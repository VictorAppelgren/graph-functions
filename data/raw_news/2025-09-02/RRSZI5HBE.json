  "description": "Mortgage rate buydowns have become a mousetrap for homebuyers.",
  "content": "Good morning. If you bought the Great Value raw frozen shrimp at Walmart, throw it away. The FDA says a possible contamination from Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, has been detected. Don't sell it, don't serve it, and definitely don't eat it \u2014 no matter how much BI's Katie Notopoulos may want to.In today's big story, homebuyers made a big bet on lower mortgage rates. They're paying a high price.What's on deck:Markets: Bank of America thinks these 10 cheap stocks are poised for big gains.Tech: This party is the surest sign yet that the tech dating scene is a mess.Business: In its latest hardcore turn, AT&T is hitting some managers with an ultimatum.But first, betting the house.If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.For homebuilders, it represented a silver bullet. For buyers, it can be a mousetrap.Rick Palacios Jr., the director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting, has been sounding the alarm since last summer about a dangerous gamble tempting Americans: \"mortgage rate buydowns.\"They seemed to offer an elegant solution. With mortgage rates sky-high, your dream home might feel out of reach. That's not good for you, nor for the homebuilders stuck with inventory.But what if a homebuilder shaved a percentage point off your monthly payments, even just for the first couple of years? Surely, rates must drop soon. When the deal runs out, you could refinance. Easy.The cost to builders is the upfront cash to lower the rate via their in-house lenders. Matt Hutton, a millennial homebuyer, told BI his builder threw in $30,000 in incentives \u2014 including the buydown \u2014 to close the deal.You buy your house. They sell theirs. Crucially, the official listing price doesn't change, so home values remain inflated.That was the wager a few years ago. Today, rates are typically still above 6.5% \u2014 right where buyers had hoped not to end up. Their gamble has failed spectacularly, BI's James Rodriguez writes.There's an even more dire scenario, Palacios warns.What if you need to sell?Life happens \u2014 a new job, a marriage, a divorce \u2014 and you may have to move. But today's sellers face a weak market. In many parts of the US, more homes are sitting unsold than at any point since the pandemic.Buyers a few years ago may have accepted inflated prices in exchange for monthly savings \u2014 but they can't usually pass those savings along to the next buyer. To close a deal, they may have to take a loss.Just ask Hutton. After five years, he and his wife sold their first home for a $150,000 profit and upgraded to a bigger, brand-new home for nearly $800,000.A few months later, they wanted out.They ended up selling it for roughly what they paid for it, after dropping their asking price by $50,000.In addition, the buyer asked them to cover a $40,000 buydown to match the builder's ongoing incentives for nearby homes. They agreed.Today, Hutton and his wife are back in an apartment, waiting for another shot at the dream.1. Wage growth isn't keeping up with prices. However, some industries have enjoyed more growth than others.

Fed up with male-dominated spaces in SF, two women who work in the tech industry threw a bash centered around \"feminine energy.\" It offered a rare chance to dress up and a strictly enforced 50/50 gender ratio \u2014 which, of course, left hundreds of men on the waitlist.2.

      "text": "- Inflation outpaced wage growth in some of the biggest white-collar industries in the last few years.\n- Bankrate compared wage growth by industry to inflation, indexed to 2021.\n- People looking for a raise could talk with their boss because switching jobs might not pay off.\nThere's more troubling news for the white-collar job market: wage growth is falling short of inflation.\nA Bankrate analysis used employment cost index and consumer price index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to look at how the gap between wage and salary growth and inflation has changed since 2021. The difference allowed Bankrate to identify the industries with better worker bargaining power.\nFinancial activities and professional and business services fell on the wrong side of that divide. Wage growth falling behind inflation in those sectors adds to the bleak picture of the white-collar labor market.\nSarah Foster, an economic analyst at Bankrate, told Business Insider the white-collar job market is frozen, affecting both newer and experienced job seekers. It's tough for new entrants to get a job, including recent tech graduates who face more competition but fewer opportunities. Experienced workers can also have a harder time finding a more advanced role or getting promoted.\n\"It results in everybody just kind of being in stasis,\" Foster said.\nHealthcare and hospitality workers have more purchasing power\nOn the other side of the coin, some sectors dominated by in-person service work that were in high demand after the pandemic recession have had more robust wage gains.\nFoster said it's no coincidence that wage growth outpaced inflation in the healthcare and social assistance industry and other areas where job seekers have been sought after. From May to July, job growth averaged about 68,000 in healthcare and social assistance, about double the average gain for nonfarm payrolls.\n\"It really depends on how much demand there is for the good or the product or the service that you're offering,\" she said about bargaining power. \"For workers, that's your labor.\"\nSimilarly, leisure and hospitality, which had the biggest positive gap between wages and inflation among the major sectors Bankrate analyzed, was a key driver of employment growth in the years after the economy reopened. Food services and accommodation, part of leisure and hospitality, had a positive gap of about 5 percentage points.\nEmployers in leisure and hospitality, desperate to restaff after the pandemic-era closures, incentivized job seekers with lavish signing bonuses and benefits.\n\"Because of how big those wage increases were as the economy reopened from the pandemic, that gave these workers a leg up to help them catch back up to prices,\" Foster said.\nDespite the strong wage growth in that sector, pay tends to be low. Foster said people in lesiure and hospitality and retail trade could still have felt inflation's effects, as they had less wiggle room in their budgets than those in higher-paying, white-collar fields.\n\"Just because your wage actually kept up with inflation doesn't always mean that you're better off,\" Foster said.\nHow to get a raise\nWith fewer opportunities in white-collar industries and the US labor market as a whole, Foster said the best way to get a raise could be staying in your position and confidently talking to your boss about how you bring value to your employer. That could be done at your annual review or earlier.\nJenny Wood, author of the career and advice newsletter Big Small Things, previously told Business Insider that instead of demanding a raise, you could ask your boss what needs to be demonstrated for stakeholders to feel comfortable bumping your pay.\nIf it's too late for 2025, you can start a conversation for 2026. Wood suggested workers ask, \"How else can I show my impact so that I am an easy candidate for a raise next year?\"\nHowever, raises for landing a new position might not be as strong as they were in the past. Median wage growth data tracked by the Atlanta Fed showed that the gap between job stayers and job switchers has narrowed.\n\"Those job gains of job switching, we can't really rely on anymore,\" Foster said.\nHow did you get a raise?

      "text": "Matt Hutton was living the millennial homeowner dream. He scrimped and saved until he was able to buy his first place in 2019, paying $324,000 for a two-bedroom townhome in a suburb west of Denver. When mortgage rates dropped to record lows during the pandemic, he refinanced to slash his interest costs. Then home values ballooned, enabling him to sell in August 2024 for a gain of roughly $150,000 in just about five years. Hutton and his wife parlayed those earnings into their own slice of the American dream: a bigger, newly built single-family house on a premium lot.\nBut Hutton's gilded path soon morphed into a cautionary tale. The house itself was nice, with fresh appliances, ample light, and clear views of a lake just beyond the property. The couple started to notice some drawbacks, though. For one, Hutton's new commute sucked. \"It took forever to get to the highway,\" the 34-year-old tells me. Simple trips demanded at least half an hour behind the wheel. The neighborhood was still a jumbled mess of construction, with hundreds of homes yet to be delivered. Even little stuff, like the sound of the wind whipping outside, got annoying. By January, only a few months after they'd closed on the house, Hutton and his wife were already starting to talk about moving.\nTheir dissatisfaction left them in a bind. Buying and selling so quickly is usually a recipe for financial loss \u2014 real estate agents pretty much always recommend staying put for at least a few years to make up for all the transaction costs. Plus, the Denver-area market softened considerably over the past two years, with more homes sitting for sale as buyers started biding their time. But there was one big issue that put Hutton in an especially bad spot. In lieu of cutting the actual list price, the builder of his current home had thrown in $30,000 worth of incentives to lure buyers like Hutton. The bulk of the deal sweetener came in the form of a \"mortgage rate buydown,\" a financing maneuver in which the builder fronts some cash to help buyers get a lower borrowing rate from the builder's in-house lender, often for just a few years. The incentive is supposed to allow buyers to stretch their budgets and soften the blow of higher mortgage rates. Some takers are betting that they'll be able to refinance for better loan terms before their mortgage snaps back to the full rate.\nHomeowners who got temporary buydowns in 2022 or 2023 have seen their gamble on rates fail spectacularly. The typical mortgage rate still hovers above 6.5% \u2014 roughly around the levels that many buyers back then were hoping to dodge. Given the slowing market, industry analysts, and even some executives, warn that these homeowners could see little in the way of equity gains before the full cost of the mortgage hits. If those buyers try to turn around and sell soon, they may end up having to slash the price just to push a deal through. Hutton's predicament is an example of the pain that could be in store for others who made a similar tradeoff, agreeing to a higher sticker price in exchange for lower interest payments.\nRick Palacios Jr., the director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting, has been sounding the alarm about the growing risks for buydown takers since last summer.\n\"People are going to start putting those homes back into the market,\" Palacios tells me, \"and I think it's going to be a bit of a shock to them, what they have to reprice at.\"\nThe steep rise in mortgage rates in 2022 caused all kinds of havoc for the housing market. Buyers retreated to the sidelines or searched for workarounds that would stave off the pain of higher monthly payments. Sellers had to get real about the fact that they might not get the flood of attention, let alone offers, that listings enjoyed in 2021. And builders found themselves in a tricky spot. After seeing all the demand in the early days of the pandemic, they'd started work on a ton of new houses. With the market grinding to a halt, they'd have to figure out some way to unload them once they were completed.\nThe answer, in many cases, was a buydown. The deals offered an elegant solution for buyers mourning the fact that they'd missed out on the rock-bottom, sub-3% mortgage rates that everyone scored earlier in the pandemic. \"Without something along those lines, the market would've been almost completely frozen in that price range,\" Lydia Creasey, Hutton's real estate agent, tells me. On their websites, builders touted borrowing rates well below the prevailing levels, keeping sales moving by enticing buyers with cheaper monthly payments. By December 2022, three-quarters of builders surveyed by John Burns Research and Consulting said they were offering buydowns. Regular sellers don't typically offer this maneuver to buyers. But for builders who could afford to eat the cost \u2014 while conveniently steering buyers to their in-house lenders \u2014 buydowns represented \"a silver bullet,\" John Burns analysts wrote in late 2023.\n\"It really saved their business,\" Palacios tells me. In a normal housing downturn, he says, builders would have started cutting prices on their homes. The rate buydowns, though, were \"like a mouse trap that allowed them to not have to adjust price.\"\nThere are a few ways a buydown can work. One option is the permanent buydown: The builder agrees to pay around 5% or 6% of the sale price to lower the mortgage rate for the entire 30-year loan, usually by one or two percentage points. Let's say someone takes out a $400,000 loan at a time when the typical rate is around 6.5% (pretty close to today's prevailing rates). If the builder buys down the rate to 5%, the buyer would be saving almost $400 every month. The initial outlay may be relatively low \u2014 in this example, about $24,000 \u2014 but over the length of the 30-year loan, the borrower's savings would come out to almost $140,000. Homebuilders and their mortgage companies are cool with this deal because they've often locked up cheap money that they can use for the loans, and because they don't want to get stuck with a bunch of homes on their books. Plus, they really don't want to cut prices, since doing so would tank the values of all the other homes nearby.\nPeople are going to start putting those homes back into the market, and I think it's going to be a bit of a shock to them.Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting\nThe other popular option is a temporary deal, which usually comes in the form of a \"2-1 buydown.\" The builder sets aside cash to lower the buyer's mortgage rate by two percentage points for the first year and one point for the second year, after which it bumps up to the prevailing rate at the time of the home purchase. Again, let's say the prevailing rate is around 6.5%. A buyer with a 2-1 rate buydown would get a rate of 4.5% in the first year, 5.5% in the second, and 6.5% from there on out. If they took out a $400,000 loan, they'd be saving more than $500 every month that first year and more than $250 a month in the second year. That's a total savings of more than $9,000. In theory, this would allow a buyer to stretch their budget a little further to get the place they want, while also giving them some flexibility to refinance down the line if rates drop.\n\"The thing with residential real estate is that it's not about the investment,\" Eric Agar, an executive at the California-based brokerage firm Pardee Properties, tells me. \"It's about your lifestyle. It's about your family. It's about you being at a home that you love. And if that allows you to do it today, instead of a year from now or two years from now, well, that's a huge pro.\"\nThe popularity of these deals soared alongside mortgage rates. In April 2021, just 17% of mortgage borrowers got a permanent buydown of one percentage point or more, data from ICE Mortgage Technology, a real estate software firm, shows. By the same point in 2023, that share had surged to nearly 45%. Temporary buydowns are more niche \u2014 they accounted for almost 5% of mortgage originations in late 2023, but have mostly hovered in the low single digits over the past few years. Still, there's no denying the prevalence of buydowns in the world of newly built homes. Last fall, Zillow published the results of a survey showing that 45% of buyers who purchased a home in the past year nabbed a mortgage rate below 5%, despite rates trending significantly higher. More than a third of those buyers said they got a lower rate because the seller or homebuilder offered them a deal on the mortgage.\nBoth permanent and temporary buydowns come with potential pitfalls, but people who agreed to time-limited incentives are starting to face a particularly harsh reality. To be clear, short-term buydowns aren't the reckless, adjustable-rate mortgages that fueled the housing bubble in the early 2000s \u2014 buyers who snag these deals have to prove they'd be able to handle the maximum amount they'll end up paying after the interest rate snaps back. But being technically able to pay that extra money and actually shelling it out each month are two different things.\nThere are still plenty of ways for buydown takers to end up in hot water. With temporary buydowns, some agents and analysts warn that fresh homeowners may be counting on rates dropping in the near future, allowing them to refinance to a new, cheaper loan before their payments bump up to the normal level. For buyers who got into the market two or three years ago, those dreams are fading fast. There's also the issue of lifestyle creep \u2014 if someone is used to saving a few hundred bucks on their loan each month, the jump to the full amount could be a bitter pill to swallow.\nLast summer, though, Palacios began warning of a more dire scenario. His concern was aimed at buyers who got a buydown \u2014 permanent or temporary \u2014 a few years ago and are now looking to sell for one reason or another, like a new job, new kid, marriage, or divorce. These homeowners face a decidedly weaker market. Many areas of the country, particularly construction hotbeds like the Sun Belt, have more homes sitting for sale than at any point since the onset of the pandemic. The typical mortgage rate has yet to slide in a meaningful way. Home prices are up less than 2% nationwide from a year ago, data from the real estate firm Redfin shows, and major metros like Houston, Austin, and Jacksonville recently posted year-over-year price declines. While buyers in 2022 or 2023 might have been willing to accept higher prices in exchange for savings on their monthly payments, they usually can't pass along those benefits to the next owner of the house. If they want to get a deal done, they might have to either cut that once-inflated price or pay tens of thousands of dollars to offer a rate buydown to the next buyer.\nAn executive at KB Home, one of the nation's largest builders, recently said in an earnings call that many customers are \"overpaying\" for homes that offer these incentives, suggesting they could have a harder time clearing a profit in the future. \"They're tied into this higher price that they're going to be stuck with forever until they sell that home.\"\nIf you so much as dipped your toe into the housing market sometime in the past few years, there's a good chance you encountered the phrase, \"Marry the house, date the rate.\" The mantra got plenty of airtime when mortgage rates spiked in 2022 \u2014 the prevailing sentiment among agents, lenders, and real estate execs was that the jump in rates would soon blow over. Don't stress too much, the logic went, because you can always refinance when rates drop back down. Better to just find a good place while you can. That mindset has so far turned out to be wishful thinking. And while there haven't yet been signs of widespread strain in the market, homeowners who got a buydown just a few years ago may be facing a significant jump in their monthly payments or the prospect of selling for far less than they'd hoped.\n\"I'm hearing more and more stories of buyer's remorse,\" says Jess Uphoff, a mortgage lender who previously worked for a homebuilder. Not long ago, a temporary buydown seemed like a win-win: Builders could keep list prices higher while still passing along savings to buyers in the form of lower monthly payments. But if one of those buyers is trying to sell now, they'll likely be competing against the same builder who sold them their home \u2014 \"only the builder has been steadily lowering prices or layering on new incentives.\" Uphoff says. \"That means homeowners often can't resell for what they originally paid.\" At the end of May, for example, the homebuilding giant Lennar said its average incentive per home had stretched to nearly $60,000, up from $44,000 a year prior.\nI'm hearing more and more stories of buyer's remorse.Jess Uphoff, mortgage lender\nRate buydowns aren't always a trap for buyers. People who got a permanent buydown a few years ago may feel pretty good about that decision, given that rates haven't yet dropped significantly. But Lauryn Dempsey, a real estate agent in the Denver area, says she counsels buyers to make sure they'll be staying in the home for at least five to seven years if they get one of these deals.\n\"Where I'm running into challenges right now is with the people who bought a couple of years ago that want to sell,\" Dempsey tells me. \"I'm bringing estimated net proceeds that have negative numbers attached to them, so the seller has to bring cash to the closing. And I know I'm not alone in that right now.\"\nHutton, the homeowner in the Denver area, fell into this camp. He and his wife paid nearly $800,000 for their new house in 2024, while the builder bought down the mortgage rate by about one percentage point. That may not sound like a lot, but that meant they were paying hundreds of dollars less in interest every month. The Huttons won't be sticking around to enjoy those benefits, though. When I talked to Hutton in mid-August, he and his wife had just closed on the sale of their home, his second in roughly a year. They managed to sell the house for $800,000 \u2014 almost exactly what they paid for it, but down from their original asking price of $850,000, which factored in some of the additional upgrades they'd made to the place. The buyer also requested that the Huttons pay $40,000 for a rate buydown to match the terms the builder was offering for other new homes nearby. They agreed to the deal. Hutton says he worried that if they wavered on a sale much longer, they'd only have more new homes in the neighborhood to compete with, each of them offering a bevy of incentives.\n\"The interest rates were killing us, because no one was buying with that,\" Hutton tells me. \"So the only way for me to get my house sold was to offer an incentive, pretty much.\"\nHutton walked away from his first sale with six figures in his pocket. Roughly a year later, after the latest transaction, all that money is gone. His agent, Lydia Creasey, even dipped into her commission to cut the buyer a check for $350 at the closing table \u2014 a rare scenario, she says, owing to the unusual circumstances of the deal. \"It was the right thing to do in this situation,\" Creasey tells me. Hutton and his wife are now living in an apartment, biding their time until they're ready to take another stab at finding their dream home.\n\"I won't jump the gun,\" Hutton says. \"I'm going to make sure to do my homework.\"\nJames Rodriguez is a senior reporter on Business Insider's Discourse team.\nBusiness Insider's Discourse stories provide perspectives on the day's most pressing issues, informed by analysis, reporting, and expertise."

      "text": "- Big banks are cracking down on entry-level workers with covert private equity jobs.\n- Citing conflicts of interest, they are asking junior bankers to disclose future-dated job.\n- Experts warn that this approach could encourage secrecy and undermine retention.\nBig banks are cracking down on junior bankers with covert private equity jobs \u2014 but experts warn that their approach may drive secrecy further underground.\nTo guard against private equity firms poaching junior talent, investment banks are requiring analysts to disclose in writing if they've accepted future-dated jobs. While each bank's policy is different, juniors who confess to having a PE job may be terminated, moved to another team or division, or taken off certain deals \u2014 consequences that could encourage ambitious young bankers to clam up and undermine banks' efforts to retain them.\n\"These are smart people. Their cognitive calculus is always working,\" said Maurice \"Mo\" Cayer, an organizational psychologist and lecturer at the University of New Haven. Young bankers facing termination for accepting PE jobs might think, \"If I get caught, I'll lose my job. Well, I'll lose my job anyway,\" Cayer added.\nThe banks declined to comment.\nRedeployment could also backfire if the moves are viewed as demotions.\n\"As long as they're still doing the job they were hired for and they're not relocating them to a different geography or a different vertical, that's okay,\" said Kate Morgan, founder and CEO of Boston Human Capital Partners, a talent acquisition and HR consulting firm. Anything short of that could result in bankers playing it safe, she said.\nEven bankers who stay on the M&A track may have reason to worry, said Anthony Keizner, cofounder of Wall Street recruiting firm Odyssey Search Partners.\n\"The bigger thing that the bankers are worried about is if you tell them you're leaving, then you're less likely to be considered for the most high-profile deals, and it could affect the way you're rated, and it could affect your bonus,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the attestations don't seem to be deterring young bankers from their buyside ambitions, according to Keizner, whose recruiting firm has surveyed about 1,100 first-year bankers in the past few weeks.\nIn describing the early findings, he said many of them are concerned about the situation and \"unsure how to proceed\" \u2014 but only \"a tiny proportion\" said they're planning to not participate in PE recruiting because of policy changes at their banks.\nQuestioning conflicts\nBanks have said the attestations are necessary to protect against conflicts of interest that can arise as a result of private equity recruiting tactics, which seek to hire junior bankers for jobs that won't start for two years, after they have been trained by the banks. That means a junior banker could be assigned to work on a deal involving a future employer.\nThe people who spoke to Business Insider, however, questioned the ambiguity of this argument.\n\"What does it mean to avoid conflicts?\" Keizner said, adding, \"Say you accept a role at PE firm X. Does it mean you can't work on something related to PE firm Y? Or can you not work on a deal for a company where PE firm X has a portfolio company that's competitive to it?\"\n\"Just because you've accepted a role at the PE firm in 18 months' time, it's not like you're privy to their deal pipeline or you've got the team on speed dial,\" he added.\nMorgan also warned that prioritizing hard-to-control compliance issues could hurt retention.\n\"They're going to always feel like the banks are now gatekeeping their ambition,\" she said of junior bankers. \"They are sort of saying, 'we don't trust you,'\" she added of the banks.\nA New York-based private equity employee who was previously an investment banker agreed that banks are sending the message that \"analysts owe the firm their underlying loyalty.\"\n\"To me personally, it wouldn't mean anything,\" she said, adding, \"People will continue to recruit regardless.\"\nFor now, banks don't have much to worry about because private equity recruiting has largely stalled.\n\"I don't think any of the participants nor firms know exactly where this is all headed,\" Keizner said, adding. \"Everyone is watching and waiting to see how the pieces will come together.\"\nWhen and if it resumes, the attestations could prevent some young bankers from participating, said Cayer.\n\"There are a lot of good Boy Scouts,\" he said, adding, \"They've studied hard. They're conscientious people.\"\n\"If the bankers won't show up because they're too scared or being seriously restricted from doing so \u2014 well that would be a big problem. That really would put a stick in the spokes of the system. But my sense is that we are not at that stage,\" Keizner said.\n\"I think the bankers will still want to interview. The PE firms still want to hire,\" he added. \"Yes, it's going a little later, but certainly based on what we've seen so far, it's going to continue happening.\""

      "text": "- Getting rejected for a job doesn't mean you should let that contact grow cold.\n- Some companies tap into a \"hidden job market\" to hire from existing candidate pools.\n- Making a good impression during the interview process could help you land a role in the future.\nSometimes, the best way to land a job at a company is to get rejected by them first.\nIn the months before graduating from Cornell University in 2023, Jahnavi Shah said she applied to over 500 jobs and secured five interviews, but none led to a full-time offer \u2014 at least not right away. Several months later, she'd be fast-tracked into a role thanks to a contact she'd made during that stretch. All it took was a good initial application, a LinkedIn connection \u2014 and a little patience.\n\"It's a great reminder that even if an opportunity doesn't work out immediately, staying on the radar can make a difference,\" said the 24-year-old, who lives in San Francisco.\nHere's what happened: Disappointed to not land a role she'd interviewed for at identity verification startup Persona, Shah connected with the recruiter on LinkedIn anyway. Months later, she'd accepted a part-time contract role but was still looking for full-time employment. When she received a congratulatory message from the Persona recruiter, Shah checked Persona's careers page, where she saw a new job posted just a few days earlier. She applied, landed an interview, and received an offer after sharing three references. Shah said she was told only one interview was required because the company was already familiar with her.\n\"I believe my previous interview experience gave the team a solid understanding of my profile and potential,\" she said.\nShah is among the workers who have battled a challenging job market in recent years. Amid economic uncertainty, ranging from tariffs to the early impacts of AI adoption, US businesses are hiring at nearly the slowest pace in more than a decade. Open roles are taking longer to fill \u2014 if they're filled at all \u2014 and some job seekers say they're sending out dozens of applications without ever hearing back from employers.\nIn this environment, it can feel like hiring happens behind closed doors \u2014 like there's a membership to an exclusive club that some job seekers simply don't have access to. In some cases, a club of this sort does exist, but getting in is more accessible than it seems. Landing an interview, even if you're rejected, can sometimes be enough to secure future opportunities.\nGetting into the 'hidden job market' can give candidates an edge\nBonnie Dilber, senior manager of talent acquisition at the automation software company Zapier, said she believes the vast majority of roles are publicly posted on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed \u2014 with some exceptions, such as senior executive positions, jobs at stealth startups, and roles at small mom-and-pop businesses.\nHowever, she said some companies do regularly hire through what she calls the \"hidden job market\" \u2014 prioritizing a select pool of candidates and, in some cases, skipping a public job posting altogether. Often, though, that pool isn't full of people with insider connections, but of prior applicants who stayed on the company's radar, she said.\nOver her career, Dilber said she's hired \"countless\" people who impressed during interviews but were initially rejected due to factors like timing or location. When circumstances changed, the company reached back out and fast-tracked them for other openings.\nAt her company, for example, she said they might post a role like technical support specialist or account executive \u2014 positions typically filled in high volumes \u2014 and hire a handful of candidates. A couple of months later, when new openings arise, they might revisit the same applicant pool rather than reposting the job. If a strong runner-up had made it to the final round, they might extend an offer without even conducting another interview.\n\"Someone could look at that and think 'no job was posted but someone got hired,' but in reality, those are applicants from existing candidate pools that a company makes many hires from,\" she said.\nOther employers are also finding ways to give rejected candidates a second shot. Sean Barry, Allstate's vice president of talent acquisition, said the company implemented a system last year that flags qualified candidates who were initially turned down and recommends them for other roles. So far, it's helped Allstate hire more than 100 people, many of them for claims positions.\n\"While they might've been a no-go for that role at that time, it certainly doesn't mean that they're not a fit for the company and potentially a fit for another need,\" Barry previously told Business Insider.\nDilber said she's benefited from processes like this herself. On two occasions, she applied for a role and was the runner-up \u2014 only to be contacted shortly after about a different opportunity, with a shorter interview process since the company was already familiar with her.\nShe said her top advice for job seekers is to focus on submitting applications for roles they're well qualified for \u2014 and to use networking and referrals to strengthen those efforts whenever possible. Even if it doesn't lead to an offer right away, a strong application \u2014 especially one that leads to an interview \u2014 can open doors down the line.\n\"Your best bet is always to apply with a strong application \u2014 and a referral if possible \u2014 rather than worrying about jobs that were never posted,\" she said.\nWhen a rejected job application turns into a dream job offer\nSometimes, getting rejected doesn't lead to a job at that employer \u2014 but it can open doors elsewhere.\nIn 2024, Alicia Strata applied for an administrative assistant job but didn't get the position. However, the third-party recruiter the company worked with suggested a part-time office support role at another company that he thought might be a good fit \u2014 so she decided to give it a shot, even though she wasn't particularly interested in the position.\nDuring the interview, Strata said she kept getting asked marketing questions that didn't align with the job description. Halfway through, she learned there had been a mix-up: the company was actually looking to hire a marketing professional. It was exactly the kind of role she'd been hoping to find since graduating with a degree in marketing communications.\nThe interviewers thought she seemed like a great fit, and she started working at the company a month later.\n\"It was amazing to walk into the interview not even wanting the role, and walk out thinking it could be my dream career,\" she said.\nLanding jobs through connections made during interviews isn't a new phenomenon. After graduating in December 2007 with a degree in communication arts, Allyson Noonan struggled to land a job, so she worked part-time at Anthropologie and babysat.\nOne day, someone who interviewed her for a job she didn't get contacted her, saying she had a friend in the industry looking for an entry-level position that she thought she'd be a fit for. This position turned out to be her first full-time job at a PR agency, which she started in June 2008.\n\"This experience taught me that it's wise to take every interview you can \u2014 even if you're not sure it's a good fit,\" she said."

That put concerns about higher potential costs from those tariffs in Apple's rearview.\nLast week, Apple scored another win when a US Customs ruling allowed the company to bring a blood-oxygen monitoring feature back to some Apple Watches.

      "text": "- AT&T is consolidating 22 internal help-desk centers into six US locations, according to sources.\n- The move comes after a memo from CEO John Stankey and an employee survey revealed falling engagement.\n- The company has taken a similar approach to consolidation previously, as AT&T looks to cut legacy costs.\nAT&T CEO John Stankey made waves this month when he told employees in a memo that the company is shifting to a \"market-based culture\" that requires employees work closer together.\nSince then, Business Insider has learned that AT&T is consolidating 22 internal help-desk centers into six locations \u2014 and affected managers get two weeks to decide whether to move or lose their jobs and get severance. Unionized workers will be allowed to remain at their current office in a different customer-service support role.\nThe consolidation of so-called centralized support desk workers, who largely assist other AT&T employees, follows a playbook the company has used repeatedly since 2023 as it upgrades its tech and cuts legacy costs. The changes also come at a time when corporate America, especially the tech sector, is embracing a hardcore culture that emphasizes performance metrics, time in the office, and a renewed sense of hustle.\nTwo managers shared details of the plan to shrink the help-desk sites to six locations with Business Insider. In a statement, a company spokesperson declined to comment on the number of centers that would remain, but confirmed that the company is reducing work locations across the business unit.\nThe spokesperson said the move is unrelated to Stankey's take-it-or-leave-it memo, which was his frank response to an internal survey that found employees reporting lower engagement at work.\nHowever, one AT&T manager told Business Insider that they understood the department's leadership was speeding up the timetable for the help-desk consolidation because of the Stankey memo, instead of taking a couple of years to carry it out.\nA choice for employees\nThe plan, the same manager said, involves moving managers to sites in Atlanta; Mesa, Arizona; Miami; Orlando; Richardson, Texas; and Tulsa, Oklahoma. The spokesperson didn't respond to a question about how many workers would be affected.\nOne of the managers, who is facing an out-of-state move hundreds of miles away, shared an email with Business Insider in which the company said they would be required to cover their own moving expenses. They feel like they don't have a choice about relocating their family.\n\"Without my income, we're not going to make it,\" the person said.\nA half-dozen employees across the company told Business Insider that department leaders were told this month to devise \"action plans\" to address concerns raised in the recent employee survey about where and how AT&T operates.\nAT&T's spokesperson said the relocations will help the company optimize its workflows. \"It reflects ongoing strategic shifts across our call center operations to colocate similar work functions and improve efficiency, consistency, and teamwork,\" the spokesperson said.\nSeveral corporate divisions have gone through similar phases of shedding satellite offices in favor of larger, centralized hubs.\nThe company made headlines in 2023 when it said some 60,000 managers would be assigned to nine metro areas, down from 300 locations across the US. Stankey told Bloomberg at the time that around 9,000 people would face relocation decisions.\nThe reduction in office footprint was followed by a mandatory five-day in-office schedule that was phased in this year.\nThese relocation orders, coupled with the RTO mandate, have resulted in some teams shrinking by half, according to internal data reviewed by Business Insider.\nStreamlining the business\nInternal figures from last year, seen by Business Insider, show the impact of relocation orders on a division under CTO Jeremy Legg called AT&T Technology Services, or ATS, which employed around 10,000 workers in the US in 2023.\nATS' consolidation meant moving from some 95 \"non-strategic\" locations \u2014 where a third of ATS employees were based \u2014 to offices in the Seattle, New York, Atlanta, and Dallas areas. Of the 318 ATS managerial workers who received notification to move during the first wave in 2023, about half declined and left the company.\nCompanywide, AT&T employed more than 160,000 workers at the start of 2023, according to its annual report. It started this year with about 141,000. Chief competitors Verizon and T-Mobile had about 99,000 and 70,000 employees, respectively, at the start of 2025.\nLegg said last week at a KeyBanc tech conference that as AT&T incorporates more software and moves away from its legacy hardware and support systems, it could cut costs.\n\"If you have 100 central o\ufb03ces, you may be able to only have the gear in 30 or 40 of them,\" he said. That means physical infrastructure and labor costs go down, Legg said.\nThe spokesperson said the latest relocations are not related to AI. They come at a time, however, where AT&T \u2014 like many firms \u2014 increasingly relies on the technology to streamline its business.\nStankey said in a January earnings call that the company expects to save $3 billion in running costs by further integrating AI.\nCTO Legg said at the KeyBanc conference that his division has begun loading trouble tickets into AT&T's generative and agentic AI frameworks for review.\n\"It now recommends what the fixes are and can write the code to do the fix,\" he said. \"Should we just go ahead and automate that? We're still human in the loop there, but these are major, major changes.\"\nThey're changes investors appear to support. AT&T shares are up around 27% in 2025.\nHave a tip?

      "text": "- Andrew Left recently revealed a short position in Palantir, citing its huge valuation.\n- Since then, his firm, Citron Research, has reiterated and fleshed out its bearish stance.\n- In a new note, it uses OpenAI's latest valuation to illustrate why it sees Palantir as too pricey.\nA week after Andrew Left criticized Palantir Technologies as highly overvalued, the short-seller is back with a more detailed analysis.\nOn August 18, Left's investment firm, Citron Research, published a note on Palantir stock, holding it up against another AI titan to illustrate why its high valuation should be alarming to investors.\nIn a Fox Business appearance last week, Left discussed his Palantir short position, stating that the stock wouldn't become cheap until it reached a price range of $40-$50 per share. However, since then, his firm has updated its view.\nCitron Research said in the note that even if Palantir fell to $40 a share\u2014which would mark a 77% decline from Tuesday's high\u2014it would still be expensive.\nThe firm highlighted OpenAI's plan to sell $6 billion worth of stock to illustrate its view on Palantir.\n\"Its new $500 billion valuation provides a true benchmark for evaluating Wall Street's favorite trading stock, Palantir, a company now detached from fundamentals and analysis, ironically the very services it claims to offer,\" Citron stated.\nThe firm provided a breakdown of why Palantir would be lucky to reach OpenAI's valuation multiple. It began by dividing Palantir's projected 2026 revenue of roughly $500 billion by OpenAI's roughly $29.6 billion, resulting in a price-to-revenue multiple of 17x.\n\"If Palantir trades at the same 17x price-to-revenue multiple on $5.6 billion in revenue (with approximately 2.37 billion shares outstanding), the implied stock price would be about $40 per share.\"\nHowever, the note went on to say that even if Palantir stock were to fall to that level, it would still be one of the most expensive software as a service (SaaS) stocks in history.\nLeft questioned whether Palantir deserves to be trading at the same multiple as OpenAI, making it clear that he does not think it belongs in the same league as the AI titan.\n\"What's remarkable about OpenAI isn't just its rapid growth, but the unprecedented scale at which it's occurring\u2014unique in tech history,\" the note said.\nAfter reporting strong second-quarter earnings and rising more than 118% year-to-date, Palantir stock has declined over the past week. Shares continued to slide on Tuesday, down about 6% to $163.92 at midday.\nPalantir did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider."

      "text": "In the heart of the tech world, where diversity and inclusion is out of fashion, a Saturday night party at Tesla's San Francisco showroom offered a tongue-in-cheek solution to one of the areas where the ongoing gender disparities are undoubtedly pronounced: dating.\nThe \"Enforced Ratio\" party, thrown this past weekend by two women in tech in response to the pervasiveness of sausage fests in San Francisco, was a night of carefully crafted contradictions. It was an event centered on \"feminine energy\" where a 50:50 gender ratio was strictly enforced. All told, about 200 women and 200 men attended. Test drives of the macho Cybertruck were paired with delicate cocktails. One of those cocktails was even named The James Damore (tequila, raspberry puree, lemon, club soda), a nod to the former Google employee who was fired over a memo he wrote asserting that efforts to equalize gender ratios are wrong because biological differences are the root cause of the industry's gender disparities. The event was a microcosm of the very tensions within tech that it seemed to be both celebrating and exposing.\nBefore the party kicked off at 7 p.m., lines formed around the block. As they waited to have their passes and IDs checked, women discussed a common sentiment: San Francisco's male-dominated parties are not a chance to dress to the nines, but places where one is expected to dress down in Patagonia fleeces and startup T-shirts. This party was different. The dress code at \"Enforced Ratio\" was \"Barbie glam,\" and multiple women remarked how they were spending less time talking about their jobs, as they frequently do at SF parties, and more time on their shimmering outfits. The men largely opted for muted suits over sparkly pink. One towering man donned a black T-shirt, black hoodie, and a black full-face mask reminiscent of Bane from \"The Dark Knight Rises\" for the duration of the event.\nThe hosts, Madison Kanna and Cat Orman, who work in AI and robotics, respectively, decided to throw the party after quipping on X about their frustrations with what's become known in the Bay Area as \"the ratio.\" Tech remains male-dominated, with women comprising 22% of the industry. No matter where they went in Silicon Valley \u2014 from \"Man Francisco\" down to \"Man Brose\" (aka San Jose) \u2014 the disparity was the same. \"I thought it would be a hilarious bit to have a party where there are more women than men, or at least have a 50/50 ratio, which is still rare,\" says Kanna, who works at the AI startup Baseten and moved to San Francisco about six months ago.\nThere has long been a feeling that nightlife in the city is sedated, but the sleepiness seemed to become especially acute after the pandemic. Record numbers of Gen Zers report not drinking, and wellness figures like Bryan Johnson \u2014 who goes to bed at 8:30 \u2014 are idolized for optimizing their health. The women I spoke to also say there may be something of a herd mentality that causes them to avoid house parties if friends aren't attending. Women generally have more options for things to do on an average weekend night, says Joyce Zhang, a former Stripe product manager turned dating coach, who was not in attendance.\nZhang says she used to attend tech parties, but gave up after a series of negative experiences. \"You go to these parties, and it's just a casual hangout. Then you have dudes who swarm around the women, like it's obvious what's going on, what they're trying to get out of it. Maybe that's why women don't show up much.\"\nTiffany Nguyen, a 28-year-old recruiter at drone maker Skydio, tells me the circles at most tech parties are tight. \"They're never drinking very heavy, just a lot of nerdy yapping,\" she says. She also avoids most tech parties because \"all people can talk about is work and tech,\" and a lack of emotional quotient is common among attendees.\n\"Everyone in SF takes themselves so seriously,\" says Kanna. \"We're trying to have fun and do something funny. 'Enforced Ratio', it's meant to make you laugh.\" She adds, \"It's post-ironic.\"\nAt one point, Kanna and Orman had accepted around 300 women for the party, even though the entire guest list would max out at 400 due to the showroom's capacity. The pair overindexed, expecting more women than men to cancel and even out the ratio. Hundreds of men were left languishing on the waitlist, some of whom signed up for the Luma invite using women's names, according to Kanna, perhaps in hopes the hosts would be duped into letting them in. The hosts say they selected men from two criteria: if they were attending with their girlfriends, and if they received positive references from multiple women. (Kanna and Orman declined to comment on how they addressed any interested attendees who might have identified as non-binary.)\nAmong the attendees was a who's who of tech influencers, including the podcaster Dwarkesh Patel (who wore a white linen button-up) and crypto personality Tiffany Fong (strapless pink dress and knee-high white leather boots). Tesla offered its space for the event but was not involved beyond offering free test rides of the Cybertruck. Women also took pictures as they stood on top of the vehicle, at least one of them pantomiming a mechanical bull ride. (\"Bitches love Cybertucks,\" Fong posted on X the next day.) Inside the truck, attendees played chess on the dashboard infotainment system.\nStanding near an Optimus robot, Rona Wang, a 26-year-old compiler engineer, tells me that many men in tech focus on their financial gains and do not spend much time learning how to speak to women. \"I've met a lot of men who think having a lot of money should make me impressed by them.\"\nOver by the (male) DJ booth, Paula Dozsa, a 30-year old engineer at AI startup Portola, says that while she does not normally dress up for tech parties, she did for this. She usually only breaks out her nicer outfits for another party series called the \"San Francisco Freedom Club,\" co-hosted by Intercom CEO Eoghan McCabe, where the theme is evangelizing American ideals. Dozsa tells me she met her boyfriend on X, vibing over commonalities, and avoids awkward conversations by mostly talking to people she already knows.\n\"As a European, I definitely wouldn't have compared it to a soir\u00e9e on the shores of Lake Como,\" says Eric-Andrei Cantacuzino Geafar, a 25-year-old graduate student at Stanford. But the party, he says, has \"one of the most original takes and locations one could think of for an event with some of the most impressive tech people I've ever met so far.\" And by his count, the final ratio may have slightly skewed in the men's favor.\nZhang, the dating coach, says there's a lot of low-hanging fruit in terms of physical glow-ups for San Francisco men. Laid-back appearances are counterintuitively venerated in San Francisco, where a hoodie and sweatpants are still seen as something of a signal of wealth and influence. \"You don't even have to do the hard work of getting a new personality,\" she says. \"You can just get new clothes, and it can make a huge difference.\" She noted, though, that the men she's coached in SF are very open to improving their overall relationship skills \u2014 after spending much of their lives focused on IQ. She speaks in typical startup lingo to help them, communicating through acronyms like OKRs (objectives and key results) for measuring and tracking progress on their dating journeys.\nMaria Valentina Escudero, 26 and working in tech, says that while San Francisco has some solid bars and clubs, \"the vibe here usually feels a lot less glamorous compared to the East Coast.\" She says Enforced Ratio stands out with its \"flirty, fun, and sexy\" atmosphere that pushed people to go all out.\nBut in typical San Francisco fashion, where nothing stays open late, the party ended abruptly at 11 p.m. as Tesla representatives called lights, put stanchions around the bar area, and sent everyone out onto the streets, where many looked for other places to keep the party going. Kanna says more Enforced Ratio parties are being planned.\nThomas Maxwell is a business and tech reporter based in San Francisco.\nBusiness Insider's Discourse stories provide perspectives on the day's most pressing issues, informed by analysis, reporting, and expertise."

      "text": "Matt Hutton was living the millennial homeowner dream. He scrimped and saved until he was able to buy his first place in 2019, paying $324,000 for a two-bedroom townhome in a suburb west of Denver. When mortgage rates dropped to record lows during the pandemic, he refinanced to slash his interest costs. Then home values ballooned, enabling him to sell in August 2024 for a gain of roughly $150,000 in just about five years. Hutton and his wife parlayed those earnings into their own slice of the American dream: a bigger, newly built single-family house on a premium lot.\nBut Hutton's gilded path soon morphed into a cautionary tale. The house itself was nice, with fresh appliances, ample light, and clear views of a lake just beyond the property. The couple started to notice some drawbacks, though. For one, Hutton's new commute sucked. \"It took forever to get to the highway,\" the 34-year-old tells me. Simple trips demanded at least half an hour behind the wheel. The neighborhood was still a jumbled mess of construction, with hundreds of homes yet to be delivered. Even little stuff, like the sound of the wind whipping outside, got annoying. By January, only a few months after they'd closed on the house, Hutton and his wife were already starting to talk about moving.\nTheir dissatisfaction left them in a bind. Buying and selling so quickly is usually a recipe for financial loss \u2014 real estate agents pretty much always recommend staying put for at least a few years to make up for all the transaction costs. Plus, the Denver-area market softened considerably over the past two years, with more homes sitting for sale as buyers started biding their time. But there was one big issue that put Hutton in an especially bad spot. In lieu of cutting the actual list price, the builder of his current home had thrown in $30,000 worth of incentives to lure buyers like Hutton. The bulk of the deal sweetener came in the form of a \"mortgage rate buydown,\" a financing maneuver in which the builder fronts some cash to help buyers get a lower borrowing rate from the builder's in-house lender, often for just a few years. The incentive is supposed to allow buyers to stretch their budgets and soften the blow of higher mortgage rates. Some takers are betting that they'll be able to refinance for better loan terms before their mortgage snaps back to the full rate.\nHomeowners who got temporary buydowns in 2022 or 2023 have seen their gamble on rates fail spectacularly. The typical mortgage rate still hovers above 6.5% \u2014 roughly around the levels that many buyers back then were hoping to dodge. Given the slowing market, industry analysts, and even some executives, warn that these homeowners could see little in the way of equity gains before the full cost of the mortgage hits. If those buyers try to turn around and sell soon, they may end up having to slash the price just to push a deal through. Hutton's predicament is an example of the pain that could be in store for others who made a similar tradeoff, agreeing to a higher sticker price in exchange for lower interest payments.\nRick Palacios Jr., the director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting, has been sounding the alarm about the growing risks for buydown takers since last summer.\n\"People are going to start putting those homes back into the market,\" Palacios tells me, \"and I think it's going to be a bit of a shock to them, what they have to reprice at.\"\nThe steep rise in mortgage rates in 2022 caused all kinds of havoc for the housing market. Buyers retreated to the sidelines or searched for workarounds that would stave off the pain of higher monthly payments. Sellers had to get real about the fact that they might not get the flood of attention, let alone offers, that listings enjoyed in 2021. And builders found themselves in a tricky spot. After seeing all the demand in the early days of the pandemic, they'd started work on a ton of new houses. With the market grinding to a halt, they'd have to figure out some way to unload them once they were completed.\nThe answer, in many cases, was a buydown. The deals offered an elegant solution for buyers mourning the fact that they'd missed out on the rock-bottom, sub-3% mortgage rates that everyone scored earlier in the pandemic. \"Without something along those lines, the market would've been almost completely frozen in that price range,\" Lydia Creasey, Hutton's real estate agent, tells me. On their websites, builders touted borrowing rates well below the prevailing levels, keeping sales moving by enticing buyers with cheaper monthly payments. By December 2022, three-quarters of builders surveyed by John Burns Research and Consulting said they were offering buydowns. Regular sellers don't typically offer this maneuver to buyers. But for builders who could afford to eat the cost \u2014 while conveniently steering buyers to their in-house lenders \u2014 buydowns represented \"a silver bullet,\" John Burns analysts wrote in late 2023.\n\"It really saved their business,\" Palacios tells me. In a normal housing downturn, he says, builders would have started cutting prices on their homes. The rate buydowns, though, were \"like a mouse trap that allowed them to not have to adjust price.\"\nThere are a few ways a buydown can work. One option is the permanent buydown: The builder agrees to pay around 5% or 6% of the sale price to lower the mortgage rate for the entire 30-year loan, usually by one or two percentage points. Let's say someone takes out a $400,000 loan at a time when the typical rate is around 6.5% (pretty close to today's prevailing rates). If the builder buys down the rate to 5%, the buyer would be saving almost $400 every month. The initial outlay may be relatively low \u2014 in this example, about $24,000 \u2014 but over the length of the 30-year loan, the borrower's savings would come out to almost $140,000. Homebuilders and their mortgage companies are cool with this deal because they've often locked up cheap money that they can use for the loans, and because they don't want to get stuck with a bunch of homes on their books. Plus, they really don't want to cut prices, since doing so would tank the values of all the other homes nearby.\nPeople are going to start putting those homes back into the market, and I think it's going to be a bit of a shock to them.Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting\nThe other popular option is a temporary deal, which usually comes in the form of a \"2-1 buydown.\" The builder sets aside cash to lower the buyer's mortgage rate by two percentage points for the first year and one point for the second year, after which it bumps up to the prevailing rate at the time of the home purchase. Again, let's say the prevailing rate is around 6.5%. A buyer with a 2-1 rate buydown would get a rate of 4.5% in the first year, 5.5% in the second, and 6.5% from there on out. If they took out a $400,000 loan, they'd be saving more than $500 every month that first year and more than $250 a month in the second year. That's a total savings of more than $9,000. In theory, this would allow a buyer to stretch their budget a little further to get the place they want, while also giving them some flexibility to refinance down the line if rates drop.\n\"The thing with residential real estate is that it's not about the investment,\" Eric Agar, an executive at the California-based brokerage firm Pardee Properties, tells me. \"It's about your lifestyle. It's about your family. It's about you being at a home that you love. And if that allows you to do it today, instead of a year from now or two years from now, well, that's a huge pro.\"\nThe popularity of these deals soared alongside mortgage rates. In April 2021, just 17% of mortgage borrowers got a permanent buydown of one percentage point or more, data from ICE Mortgage Technology, a real estate software firm, shows. By the same point in 2023, that share had surged to nearly 45%. Temporary buydowns are more niche \u2014 they accounted for almost 5% of mortgage originations in late 2023, but have mostly hovered in the low single digits over the past few years. Still, there's no denying the prevalence of buydowns in the world of newly built homes. Last fall, Zillow published the results of a survey showing that 45% of buyers who purchased a home in the past year nabbed a mortgage rate below 5%, despite rates trending significantly higher. More than a third of those buyers said they got a lower rate because the seller or homebuilder offered them a deal on the mortgage.\nBoth permanent and temporary buydowns come with potential pitfalls, but people who agreed to time-limited incentives are starting to face a particularly harsh reality. To be clear, short-term buydowns aren't the reckless, adjustable-rate mortgages that fueled the housing bubble in the early 2000s \u2014 buyers who snag these deals have to prove they'd be able to handle the maximum amount they'll end up paying after the interest rate snaps back. But being technically able to pay that extra money and actually shelling it out each month are two different things.\nThere are still plenty of ways for buydown takers to end up in hot water. With temporary buydowns, some agents and analysts warn that fresh homeowners may be counting on rates dropping in the near future, allowing them to refinance to a new, cheaper loan before their payments bump up to the normal level. For buyers who got into the market two or three years ago, those dreams are fading fast. There's also the issue of lifestyle creep \u2014 if someone is used to saving a few hundred bucks on their loan each month, the jump to the full amount could be a bitter pill to swallow.\nLast summer, though, Palacios began warning of a more dire scenario. His concern was aimed at buyers who got a buydown \u2014 permanent or temporary \u2014 a few years ago and are now looking to sell for one reason or another, like a new job, new kid, marriage, or divorce. These homeowners face a decidedly weaker market. Many areas of the country, particularly construction hotbeds like the Sun Belt, have more homes sitting for sale than at any point since the onset of the pandemic. The typical mortgage rate has yet to slide in a meaningful way. Home prices are up less than 2% nationwide from a year ago, data from the real estate firm Redfin shows, and major metros like Houston, Austin, and Jacksonville recently posted year-over-year price declines. While buyers in 2022 or 2023 might have been willing to accept higher prices in exchange for savings on their monthly payments, they usually can't pass along those benefits to the next owner of the house. If they want to get a deal done, they might have to either cut that once-inflated price or pay tens of thousands of dollars to offer a rate buydown to the next buyer.\nAn executive at KB Home, one of the nation's largest builders, recently said in an earnings call that many customers are \"overpaying\" for homes that offer these incentives, suggesting they could have a harder time clearing a profit in the future. \"They're tied into this higher price that they're going to be stuck with forever until they sell that home.\"\nIf you so much as dipped your toe into the housing market sometime in the past few years, there's a good chance you encountered the phrase, \"Marry the house, date the rate.\" The mantra got plenty of airtime when mortgage rates spiked in 2022 \u2014 the prevailing sentiment among agents, lenders, and real estate execs was that the jump in rates would soon blow over. Don't stress too much, the logic went, because you can always refinance when rates drop back down. Better to just find a good place while you can. That mindset has so far turned out to be wishful thinking. And while there haven't yet been signs of widespread strain in the market, homeowners who got a buydown just a few years ago may be facing a significant jump in their monthly payments or the prospect of selling for far less than they'd hoped.\n\"I'm hearing more and more stories of buyer's remorse,\" says Jess Uphoff, a mortgage lender who previously worked for a homebuilder. Not long ago, a temporary buydown seemed like a win-win: Builders could keep list prices higher while still passing along savings to buyers in the form of lower monthly payments. But if one of those buyers is trying to sell now, they'll likely be competing against the same builder who sold them their home \u2014 \"only the builder has been steadily lowering prices or layering on new incentives.\" Uphoff says. \"That means homeowners often can't resell for what they originally paid.\" At the end of May, for example, the homebuilding giant Lennar said its average incentive per home had stretched to nearly $60,000, up from $44,000 a year prior.\nI'm hearing more and more stories of buyer's remorse.Jess Uphoff, mortgage lender\nRate buydowns aren't always a trap for buyers. People who got a permanent buydown a few years ago may feel pretty good about that decision, given that rates haven't yet dropped significantly. But Lauryn Dempsey, a real estate agent in the Denver area, says she counsels buyers to make sure they'll be staying in the home for at least five to seven years if they get one of these deals.\n\"Where I'm running into challenges right now is with the people who bought a couple of years ago that want to sell,\" Dempsey tells me. \"I'm bringing estimated net proceeds that have negative numbers attached to them, so the seller has to bring cash to the closing. And I know I'm not alone in that right now.\"\nHutton, the homeowner in the Denver area, fell into this camp. He and his wife paid nearly $800,000 for their new house in 2024, while the builder bought down the mortgage rate by about one percentage point. That may not sound like a lot, but that meant they were paying hundreds of dollars less in interest every month. The Huttons won't be sticking around to enjoy those benefits, though. When I talked to Hutton in mid-August, he and his wife had just closed on the sale of their home, his second in roughly a year. They managed to sell the house for $800,000 \u2014 almost exactly what they paid for it, but down from their original asking price of $850,000, which factored in some of the additional upgrades they'd made to the place. The buyer also requested that the Huttons pay $40,000 for a rate buydown to match the terms the builder was offering for other new homes nearby. They agreed to the deal. Hutton says he worried that if they wavered on a sale much longer, they'd only have more new homes in the neighborhood to compete with, each of them offering a bevy of incentives.\n\"The interest rates were killing us, because no one was buying with that,\" Hutton tells me. \"So the only way for me to get my house sold was to offer an incentive, pretty much.\"\nHutton walked away from his first sale with six figures in his pocket. Roughly a year later, after the latest transaction, all that money is gone. His agent, Lydia Creasey, even dipped into her commission to cut the buyer a check for $350 at the closing table \u2014 a rare scenario, she says, owing to the unusual circumstances of the deal. \"It was the right thing to do in this situation,\" Creasey tells me. Hutton and his wife are now living in an apartment, biding their time until they're ready to take another stab at finding their dream home.\n\"I won't jump the gun,\" Hutton says. \"I'm going to make sure to do my homework.\"\nJames Rodriguez is a senior reporter on Business Insider's Discourse team.\nBusiness Insider's Discourse stories provide perspectives on the day's most pressing issues, informed by analysis, reporting, and expertise."

      "text": "- CPAs Amanda Han and Matthew MacFarland lost about $50,000 each in a failed real estate deal.\n- They invested in a real estate syndication without conducting proper due diligence.\n- It didn't deter them from these deals, which can create passive income, but they approach them differently.\nCPAs Amanda Han and Matthew MacFarland worked alongside real estate investors for years, helping them save on taxes.\nHowever, working with investors and actually investing are very different, as the accountants learned the hard way.\nThe California-based couple has built an impressive real estate portfolio that includes rentals and syndication deals outside their CPA day jobs. But, early in their real estate investment careers, a mistake cost them about $100,000 worth of retirement savings.\n\"I think each of us lost like $50,000 in our 401(k),\" MacFarland told Business Insider of the failed deal they invested in back in 2008.\n\"We were very prevalent in the industry of people talking about self-directed IRAs and using your retirement accounts, and so we happened to use our retirement accounts to invest in a syndicated real estate deal,\" he explained. \"In retrospect, the timing was horrible.\"\nIt wasn't just bad timing. Han and MacFarland forewent a critical step: due diligence.\nReal-estate syndication is a way for a group of investors to pool their capital together and purchase a single property managed by a \"syndicator.\" Once the investor contributes capital, their role in the deal becomes completely passive, as the syndicator is responsible for finding the deal, executing the transaction, and, ultimately, delivering returns to the investors.\nThe hands-off nature of these deals is great for investors with more money than time, but you're putting a lot of trust in the syndicator and depending on their competence. You're investing in both the deal and the person running it. And while a good syndicator can turn a mediocre property into a success, a bad one can ruin a great opportunity \u2014 or, drain your retirement savings, in the case of Han and MacFarland.\nThey met the syndicator through a colleague and, \"we trusted that he knew what he was doing,\" said MacFarland. Looking back, they would have spent a lot more time on the vetting process.\nAn easy first step when vetting syndicators is to type their first and last names into Google along with keywords like \"fraud,\" \"complaints,\" or \"SEC.\" You can also talk to investors who have worked with them in the past and ask about their experience.\n\"You might find a lot of things that you didn't know about someone,\" said Han.\nUsing syndication deals to build wealth passively\nHan and MacFarland are invested in multiple syndications, which allow them to own a portion of larger properties they wouldn't be able to purchase individually. Between their 16 passive syndication deals, they own condos, apartments, and mobile home parks.\nAnother perk is the distributions, which are payments that investors receive from the income generated by the property. Investors typically get paid quarterly or monthly during the life of the deal, but it all depends on how the deal is structured.\n\"It kind of runs the gamut. You see a lot of different things,\" explained MacFarland. \"But, a typical cash flow deal, you'd expect to start getting quarterly distributions probably after the first year. But some are set up in such a way that they're value-adds, and that it's going to take two to three years to stabilize the property.\"\nHaving experience with both active and passive real estate investments, \"I don't think there's one that's necessarily better than the other,\" said Han. \"It just comes down to your resources: Do you have more time, or do you have more money?\"\nIt also depends on your strengths and weaknesses.\n\"We have clients who do their own rentals, and they do super well. They generate much higher returns than any syndication could provide,\" she said.\nAt Han and MacFarland's current phase in life, passive real estate investments make more sense.\n\"When we first started out, we were cash poor and really looked for properties where we could add forced appreciation by doing things to rehab and improve them,\" said Han. \"But now, we're at a phase where we have young kids and it's just more time-consuming.\"\nIf the right deal on a rental property came around, they'd still jump on it, but \"more of our resources are now for passive investments in larger deals,\" she added. \"Because now, for us, the limitation is not as much funding. It's more so just the time.\"\nPlus, they recognize that their main strength is still tax strategy.\n\"We're really good at being tax strategists \u2014 that's our specialty \u2014 and we know there are people who do real estate investing that are a lot better at it than we are, so it makes sense to leverage their expertise,\" said MacFarland, adding: \"We do our due diligence now.\""

      "text": "- Many home sellers are loath to cut prices, opting to de-list their properties instead.\n- Conditions have been tilting in favor of buyers, but frustrated sellers could stall that momentum.\n- The housing market has been frozen over for the last few years, with prices and mortgage rates remaining elevated.\nThe US housing market has been tilting in buyers' favor recently, but a rising trend among home sellers could stall that momentum.\nA report from Realtor.com this month showed that rather than lowering the price of their homes or negotiating with buyers, many sellers are opting to simply remove their homes from the market.\nThe company's Monthly Housing Market Trends Report for June 2025 shows that sellers in the South and West have been facing downward pricing pressure, as both housing supply and median time on market have exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Throughout the East and North, however, prices have risen slightly.\nEven as national markdowns have grown, though, Realtor.com reports that \"national median list prices have held steady.\" This indicates that sellers are still driven by high expectations, even in a volatile and complicated economy.\n\"Delistings outpaced overall inventory gains\u2014jumping 35% year to date and 47% year over year in May, compared with active listing growth of 28.4% and 31.5%, respectively,\" the report stated. \"The spike signals that some sellers would rather wait than negotiate, suggesting recent buyer-friendly momentum could wane.\"\nThe message is clear for aspiring home buyers. Sellers are not interested in settling for a lower price, even if that means waiting longer to sell their home or backing out of the market entirely.\nJake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com highlighted that sellers are enjoying \"record high levels of home equity,\" which grant them significant flexibility.\n\"This allows many sellers to withdraw their homes from the market if their asking price isn't met,\" he stated.\nA lack of inventory is likely to lead to a shift in the housing market, as fewer homes for sale could push prices up again after a period that saw prices plateau or decline in key markets.\nOther data shows that the number of first-time home buyers has steadily decreased, as economic conditions compel buyers\u2014especially younger people\u2014to see renting as a better financial decision.\nIf sellers continue to remove their homes from the market rather than lower prices, this trend is likely to continue. As housing experts told Business Insider recently, this poses negative consequences for the broader economy, as the housing market is an important engine for growth."

He emphasized that he believes AI will help the industry grow, not tank.\n\"We'll see companies with a couple of employees and billions of users,\" Bosworth said.\nBut \"it's hard to say how it's going to land,\" he added.\nBosworth's boss, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has shared similar predictions on how AI will impact software engineers.\nHe said in January that he expects Meta, among other companies, to have an AI later this year that can \"be a sort of midlevel engineer that you have at your company that can write code.\"\nHe's also said he expects AI will help founders build with just \"very small, talent-dense teams.\"\n\"If you were starting whatever you're starting 20 years ago, you would have had to have built up all these different competencies inside your company, and now there are just great platforms to do it,\" he said in May.\nZuckerberg has spoken since at least 2022 about an \"efficiency\" push at Meta, which has laid off tens of thousands of workers since the pandemic.\nMeta internally announced plans earlier this year to start letting job candidates use AI in some coding interviews."

      "text": "- New home sales fell 13.7% in May, another data point that shows the housing market is stuck.\n- The South led the decline with a 21% drop, while the Northeast saw an increase.\n- Declining home sales are raising red flags for real estate experts.\nThe housing market is even more frozen over than it was last year, and more data is piling up to prove it.\nNew home sales dropped sharply in May, the US Census Bureau reported on Wednesday, showing that the US housing market is at an impasse as buyers hesitate and sellers struggle to offload their homes.\nSales of new single-family houses fell 13.7% month-over-month, from 722,000 in April to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 623,000 in May. The May number is 6.3% lower year-over-year.\nThe decline in sales was led by a sharp slowdown in the South. Sales in the region plunged 15.5% year-over-year and 21% from the previous month. The Northeast was the only region that saw an increase in new home sales.\nAmericans aren't buying homes, but it's not because supply is constrained like it was in 2024. On the contrary, housing supply has picked up.\nThe May report showed that there were roughly 507,000 new houses available for sale. At May's sale pace, it would take 9.8 months to clear the supply of housing. Anything higher than six months of supply typically indicates a buyers market \u2014 a notable shift from the sellers market that led to rapidly appreciating home prices post pandemic.\nIn the South, new home construction actually hit its higher levels since 1971 last month, with 311,000 new units on the market thanks to increased construction and decreased sales.\nData from Redfin earlier this month also points to a deep freeze in US homebuying activity.\nRedfin reported that there's a record $700 billion worth of homes for sale across the country, an all-time high by dollar amount.\nSo why aren't buyers jumping in?\nProspective homebuyers are hesitant to pull the trigger on a purchase with elevated mortgage rates and economic uncertainty. Mortgage rates still remain prohibitively high, averaging 6.82% in May, according to Freddie Mac. And home prices are still rising, making affordability a challenge; the median new home sold for $426,600 last month, up 3% from the $414,300 median a year ago.\nIt's not just new homes that aren't selling. Existing home sales dropped 0.7% this May compared to last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. May's decrease comes on the heels of the slowest April buying season in 16 years.\nThe slowdown in the housing market is raising warning signs for some experts. Meredith Whitney, the CEO of investment research firm Meredith Whitney Advisory Group and senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group, told Yahoo Finance that she believes the housing market is on track for \"its worst year in decades.\"\nThe seasonally adjusted annual rate for home sales is currently around 4 million, an alarmingly low number in Whitney's perspective."

      "text": "- Perfectly Imperfect is a culture newsletter with a social network attached.\n- Founder Tyler Bainbridge is nostalgic for an internet that brought people together.\n- The startup is betting on events and community-focused tools to grow the app and newsletter.\n\"Do you miss the old internet?\"\nThat's the question you're hit with if you find yourself on the website for Perfectly Imperfect.\nFounded in 2020 by Tyler Bainbridge, a former engineer at Meta, and Alex Cushing, Perfectly Imperfect is a culture newsletter that has interviewed downtown New York idols and celebrities from Charli XCX to Lorde. It launched a social networking app in 2024.\nBainbridge told Business Insider that his project is trying to capture what the old internet \"felt like.\"\n\"When it felt like the goal was to bring people together and the content that people were sharing was purely driven by a need to connect,\" he said.\nThe Perfectly Imperfect app, called PI.FYI, does feel like it exists in an older version of the internet. I've been using the app myself for over a year, and it's been one of the closest comparable experiences to the yee-old days of Tumblr or pre-Elon Twitter I've found in my endless pursuit of new corners of the internet.\nThe app is built around a feed filled with users' \"recs\" for music and movies, with life advice and other content sprinkled in.\nUsernames are sometimes pseudonyms and call back to the Tumblr blog names that teens would vie for. Like Tumblr or MySpace, users' profile pages are customizable.\nTumblr's influence goes deeper than usernames and vibes. One of PI's advisors is former Tumblr employee Jacob Bijani, the blogging site's fifth employee.\nBainbridge describes PI as a \"social magazine.\"\nHe's part of a cohort of founders and users seeking experiences outside platforms like Meta's Instagram and Facebook, X, or TikTok. New social networks have been cropping up in the last few years, and investors are on the hunt for the next big thing in social to emerge. While there's been some contenders since the rise of TikTok \u2014 such as Clubhouse or BeReal \u2014 many apps have had fleeting virality.\nThe business of a 'social magazine'\nBainbridge said that the newsletter has about 140,000 subscribers, of whom 74,000 have joined the app. Formerly a Substack newsletter, PI left the platform in 2024 and now runs its newsletter internally.\nPaid subscriptions are $6 a month and unlock features like the ability to further customize your profile, access the newsletter archive, and receive extra newsletter content. Bainbridge said PI has about 2,000 paying users as of late July.\nRevenue is split mostly between these subscriptions and partnerships with brands, Bainbridge said. PI recently worked with Hinge on a guide about being awkward as part of the Match Group-owned dating app's One More Hour initiative, which set aside $1 million to back projects fueling in-person connection.\nWhile the PI newsletter has ads, Bainbridge said he plans to keep the social app free of ads because they could \"diminish the user experience.\"\nBainbridge said the company has raised capital to hire more staff, expand into video, and grow the app. He declined to disclose the size of the raise. The PI team consists of three full-time staffers and five part-time contractors, Bainbridge said.\nTurning recommendations into real-life experiences\nEarlier this year, PI rolled out a feature that lets users share whether they're single and who they're interested in.\n\"I heard about a lot of people who started dating on the platform, and to me it makes perfect sense,\" he said. \"There's a nice big photo of someone, and then right below that is exactly what they're interested in as a person.\"\nPeople were also organizing meetups on the app, Bainbridge said, which fueled the app's conviction around its latest product overhaul: events.\nThe app now lets users share events happening in their area to the public feed, such as concerts or an arts and crafts night. Some are organized by PI, too, like a bowling event in Brooklyn sponsored by Hinge.\nPI's next era has shades of Facebook's events and Reddit's niche communities. Later this year, PI plans to expand its app further with tools to make private communities or groups.\n\"We want to hit a million users sometime next year,\" Bainbridge said. \"I think a lot of that's going to come from some of these product-oriented growth features.\""

      "text": "- The FDA is warning people not to eat frozen shrimp from Walmart that may be radioactive.\n- The agency is recommending a recall, though no radioactive shrimp has entered the US food supply.\n- Don't threaten ME with a good time!\nWith great power comes great responsibility. We all know that to be true thanks to a young man from Queens who happened to be bitten by a radioactive spider and went on to save the world from a careless and egomanical oligarch, a technologist gone rogue, and a guy who is sometimes made of sand.\nWe all admire the bravery and pluck of Peter Parker. So when I heard that there was a shipment of possibly radioactive shrimp at Walmart, I felt the call to serve.\nI must eat the radioactive shrimp.\nAccording to a press release from the Food and Drug Administration, a shipment of frozen shrimp from BMS Foods, an Indonesian supplier, tested positive at customs for Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. The frozen shrimp was set to be sold under the Great Value brand at Walmart.\n\"At this time, no product that has tested positive or alerted for Cesium-137 (Cs-137) has entered the US commerce,\" the FDA wrote, although they recommend a recall for three Great Value products.\nHow did the shrimp become radioactive? Are all shrimp tested for radioactivity? Is foul play suspected, or is this some natural occurrence? These are questions I do not have answers to.\nThe only question I definitively know the answer to is: Do I want to eat the shrimp?\nYes, yes, I do. I need to try it. I cannot resist knowing there's radioactive shrimp out there and that I could potentially harness its shrimpy powers. Would I get claws? A powerful tail to maneuver through water? Would I just go great with cocktail sauce?\n[Note: Business Insider does not endorse eating anything radioactive, and you should not do this, no matter how tempting it sounds. Ingesting Cesium-137 allows the radioactive material to accumulate in soft tissues, increasing cancer risk, according to the FDA.]\nSince apparently the contaminated shipment was stopped before it hit shelves, it sounds like I'll never get a chance to find out. But thanks to the power of ChatGPT, I made a picture of myself as a radioactive shrimp:"

We shouldn't have to guess about this stuff.\nDonald Trump said Larry and David Ellison are giving him millions in free ads as part of their recently finalized deal to acquire Paramount.\nIs that true?\nWe still don't know \u2014 in part because David Ellison, who is now Paramount's CEO, has refused to directly address the question.\nBut a new report in The New York Times says an Ellison lawyer has previously denied that there's a side deal.\nIn July, after Fox News reported that Skydance \u2014 the Ellison-owned studio that wanted to buy Paramount \u2014 would provide millions to Trump via \"advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions,\" an attorney for Skydance privately called the story \"unmitigated false bullshit,\" per the Times.\nThe Times also reports that a Trump rep continues to insist that \"there was an unwritten understanding between the president and the owners of Skydance.\"\nA Paramount rep declined to comment. I've also asked the White House for comment. Prior to the Ellisons' purchase of the company, Paramount executives had said they had \"no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement \" that they agreed to.\nThat's a lot of back-and-forth that ultimately doesn't clear anything up.\nWe do know that Shari Redstone, Paramount's previous owner, gave Trump $16 million to settle a suit we can kindly describe as a legal long shot, where he accused Paramount's \"60 Minutes\" of interfering in the 2024 election because of the way it edited an interview with Kamala Harris.\nWe also know that days after that payment, the Federal Communications Commission, headed by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, signed off on Skydance's acquisition of Paramount.\nBeyond that, for now, we have only Trump's claim that he \"anticipate[s] receiving $20 Million Dollars more from the new Owners, in Advertising, PSAs, or similar Programming.\"\nAs I've noted before, it's understandable that David Ellison doesn't want to address the he-said \u2014 or no-one-said \u2014 issue here: If Trump is wrong and Ellison contradicts him, he'll anger a President who routinely inserts himself into ostensibly privately run businesses. If Trump is right and Ellison says so, he'll have all kinds of other trouble.\nThis shouldn't be fuzzy. Either one of the richest families in the world promised to give the president of the United States millions of dollars in free ads, so they could get the go-ahead to buy a major American media company \u2014 or they didn't. We shouldn't be left guessing."

I was on a red carpet and a guy asked me the question, I wasn't going to lie.\"\nOn Friday, Reuters asked the Oscar-winning director about the docuseries, to which Lee responded, \"It's not coming out.

It was touted as delivering an extensive look at the former QB through never-before-seen archival footage and new interviews.\nKaepernick, 37, who played for the San Francisco 49ers from 2011 to 2016, was at the center of a media firestorm when he began kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism.\nIn 2017, he opted out of his contract with the 49ers and was never signed by another team, essentially ending his NFL career. In 2019, he privately settled his grievance against the NFL for collusion among the team owners."

      "text": "- OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor compared the AI boom to its dot-com predecessor, saying that there was lots of \"snake oil.\"\n- There's also \"very real value being created,\" Taylor told the \"ACQ2\" podcast.\n- Taylor said that \"dot-com\" often brings to mind failures like Pets.com and not the success stories, like Google.\nWithin the AI boom \u2014 or bubble, as Sam Altman called it at a recent dinner \u2014 there will be winners and losers. Some will likely soar like Amazon did out of the dot-com days; others may flounder like Pets.com.\nIn the late 1990s, the stock market reached new heights, propelled by the rise of digital-first companies. The dot-com bubble eventually burst, sending companies like Webvan and eToys.com into bankruptcy. That era also spawned some of the tech mammoths we still use today, like Amazon and eBay.\nOpenAI chairman Bret Taylor thinks that era and the AI boom have a lot in common. On the \"ACQ2\" podcast, he said that the dot-com boom is often remembered only for the companies left in the rubble after the bubble burst.\n\"If you say dot-com, people come back with failures,\" Taylor said. \"If you look at the S&P 500 now and you look at the amount of value from companies created in that, one could argue that actually almost all of the exuberance and hype was totally warranted.\"\n25 years later, some of the \"magnificent seven\" tech stocks can be traced back to that time period. Amazon went public in 1997 and weathered the dot-com bust; Google was founded during the boom, but didn't go public until after. Some mark Microsoft's 2001 antitrust ruling as the top of the bubble.\n\"It, in fact, did change commerce in fundamental ways,\" Taylor said. \"It did change the financial system in fundamental ways. It changed everything.\"\nAI has been buoying the market in a similar way. VCs are pouring billions into AI startups, and Big Tech is investing tens of billions into AI infrastructure, talent, and related capex. In July, Nvidia became the first company to hit a $4 trillion market cap on the back of AI companies' demand for its GPUs. Morgan Stanley recently predicted that AI productivity gains could lead the S&P 500 to gain up to $16 trillion.\nThe market fervor has led some skeptics to call AI a bubble \u2014 and compare it to the dot-com era before it. Tech guru Erik Gordon told BI that \"more investors will suffer than suffered in the dot-com crash, and their suffering will be more painful.\"\nAltman himself compared AI to a bubble at a recent dinner attended by reporters.\n\"When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\" Altman said, according to The Verge. \"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.\"\n\"Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money,\" Altman reportedly said in reference to AI startups comprising \"three people and an idea\" that receive massive investments. \"We don't know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money. My personal belief, although I may turn out to be wrong, is that, on the whole, this would be a huge net win for the economy.\"\nTaylor takes a similarly positive spin on the bubble question, comparing it to the dot-com boom. He referenced jokes about the word \"agentic\" being overused.\n\"You have a lot of snake oil,\" he said.\nBut there are also real, sustainable companies that Taylor predicts will stick around. Unsurprisingly, he pointed to the seismic growth of ChatGPT, which sported 100 million users just over two months after its app launch and remains dominant on the App Store.\nTaylor also pointed to AI software companies that serve the B2B market, like Lovable, a vibe coding platform for creating apps and websites.\n\"I think there's very real value being created here,\" he said."

The FDA said in a press release that radioactive testing on shrimp from the Indonesian distributor BMS Foods also came back positive.\nSo far, none of the shrimp tested as radioactive is believed to have reached grocery store shelves, but a few containers from BMS Foods did reach grocers after the CBP's initial detection.\nThe FDA is now recommending a recall of all BMS Foods shipments. The agency has also temporarily blocked imports from the company after finding that it has violated the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act by handling products under conditions that could expose them to radioactive contamination.\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, Cesium-137 is a byproduct of nuclear fission, which can cause burns, acute radiation sickness, and even death with significant exposure.\nFood recalls due to radioactive contamination are relatively rare. After the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, the FDA restricted imports of certain seafood and produce from affected regions due to Cesium-137 exposure and did not fully lift the restrictions until 2021.\nWalmart did not immediately respond to a request for comments."
