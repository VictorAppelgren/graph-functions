Megacap tech names led the rally, with Alphabet jumping 9% after an antitrust ruling and Apple up 3% following a court decision on its Google search deal, while energy stocks fell as WTI dropped over 2%.  Fed officials signaled a likely cut at the next meeting, with futures pricing a 25‑bp cut at 95% probability, reinforcing the positive sentiment for the equity market. ",
