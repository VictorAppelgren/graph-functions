  "title": "The U.S. government may take a stake in Intel",
  "description": "Bloomberg is reporting that the Trump Administration wants the U.S. government to take a direct stake in Intel as a way of bailing out the troubled chipmaker.",
  "content": "The U.S. government is discussing whether it will take a stake in beleaguered chipmaker Intel Corp. as a way to bail it out of its financial struggles, according to a report.\n\nBloomberg reported that the two sides were in discussions, but nothing has been decided: not when or even if it could happen, nor the amount of equity Intel would give up or what terms would be attached to the agreement.\n\nWhat does appear to be clear, however, is that the U.S. government is at least talking about taking a direct stake in Intel, which would be a first for the company.\n\nIn May, the Saudi national AI company Humain \u2014 a company funded by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudia Arabia \u2014 formed a joint venture with rival AMD with no direct investment. Saudi Arabia formed a Public Investment Fund (PIF) for those investments. Mubadala Investment Company, one of Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign wealth funds, made an initial investment of $622 million in AMD in 2007 but has since sold its entire stake.\n\nThe U.S. does not have a direct equivalent to the PIF, though President Trump proposed forming one in February. It\u2019s not clear whether such a fund could be authorized and put to use in this scenario.\n\nBloomberg pointed out that the U.S. Department of Defense took a $400 million preferred equity stake in MP Materials Corp., a producer of rare earths \u2014 a deal that would make the Pentagon the company\u2019s largest shareholder and set a precedent for how the government could interact with private companies.\n\nRegardless, the talks apparently are a direct consequence of a meeting between Intel chief executive Lip-Bu Tan and Trump at the White House. Trump had called for Tan to step down, citing Tan\u2019s role as a venture capitalist and his relationships with numerous Chinese companies, some with alleged links to the Chinese government. Doing business with China has always been a sensitive issue for U.S. companies, though Nvidia and AMD both agreed to hand over 15 percent of their revenues from AI chips sold to Chinese companies to allow both to do business there.\n\nA day after meeting with Tan, however, Trump praised Tan on Truth Social, calling him and his rise an \u201camazing story.\u201d\n\nIntel\u2019s struggles are well known, as the company has weathered layoffs of thousands of employees over the past nine months or so. Intel has cancelled overseas projects and delayed the development of a fab in Ohio, which was supposed to have been funded in part by the U.S. Chips and Science Act. Craig Barrett, Intel\u2019s former CEO, has also called for a bailout \u2014 though by Intel\u2019s customers, not the government.",

      "text": "Intel is a company in crisis, failing to compete with the products of its booming rivals and struggling to get back on its feet after a high-profile leadership shakeup and devastating layoffs. The last thing it needs is to be in the crosshairs of an increasingly retaliatory federal government. But that is indeed what\u2019s happening, as U.S. president Trump demands that Intel\u2019s new CEO Lip-Bu Tan resign.\n\u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,\u201d Trump posted to Truth Social, a private social network owned and controlled by the president of the United States.\nTrump offered up no specifics and no evidence to support the claim. As TechCrunch notes, the early-morning post follows less than two days after senator Tom Cotton, a Trump ally from Arkansas, wrote a letter to Intel\u2019s board questioning Tan\u2019s investments in Chinese businesses. Of particular contention is Tan\u2019s former leadership of Cadence Design Systems, which was fined $140 million for violating export restrictions to China. Reuters raised concerns over Tam\u2019s Chinese investments in April, a month after he accepted the position following Pat Gelsinger\u2019s retirement last year.\nOne of the biggest cornerstones of Trump\u2019s second term is isolationism and spurring investment in United States manufacturing, particularly in the lucrative and visible chip fabrication sector. Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act passed during former president Biden\u2019s term, and is currently constructing massive new semiconductor factories in Ohio, in addition to its primary facilities in Oregon and secondary plants in Arizona and New Mexico.\nIntel roiled markets in July by raising the possibility that it could exit chip manufacturing entirely if it could not find customers for its 14A manufacturing process, scheduled to debut two generations hence in 2028 or 2029. But Intel\u2019s inability to find big-name customers for its nascent foundry operations, period, has begun worrying former Intel board members that the entire strategy needs to be rethought. Writing in Forbes (via PCGamer), they proposed \u201cOperation Warp Speed II\u201d: a program to buy back Intel\u2019s fabs through a public-private partnership and then \u201cencourage\u201d U.S. companies to buy from it.\nTrump yesterday announced plans to raise import tariffs on semiconductors, essential components in basically all electronics, to 100 percent. He implied that he would waive the restrictions for companies that are \u201cbuilding in the United States,\u201d which would presumably include Intel. Intel\u2019s new Ohio fabrication plants are scheduled to come online in 2030 and 2031.\nThe Trump administration has established a pattern of attempting control over major American corporations. The Paramount/CBS merger with Skydance Media, a deal years in the making, was only approved by the FCC after Paramount paid a $16 million lawsuit settlement to Donald Trump following a 60 Minutes interview with his campaign opponent Kamala Harris. CBS subsequently cancelled The Late Show, the best-performing TV show in its aging niche, after host Stephen Colbert was critical of the president.\nEarlier this week, Apple CEO Tim Cook presented Trump with a golden plaque after announcing an additional $100 billion in investments in American manufacturing. Intel rival Nvidia has announced $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing on soaring profits during the AI boom. Restrictions on exports to China specifically for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips were eased following Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s attendance at a $1 million-a-seat dinner at Trump\u2019s private residence in Florida.\nIt certainly appears that there can be business rewards for indulging Trump, and steep regulatory hurdles for refusing to do so. Exactly how Intel might be rewarded or punished has yet to be seen.\nThis story was updated at 10:10 AM to add more details by Mark Hachman."

      "text": "Is there a way that Intel can be saved? Former Intel chief executive Craig Barrett thinks so, and it isn\u2019t the way the company\u2019s former board members suggest.\nIntel should have a number of its customers invest a total of $40 billion in the company to ensure a steady supply of chips, the company\u2019s former chief executive wrote over the weekend.\nBarrett\u2019s comments come as current chief executive Lip-Bu Tan is scheduled to meet with President Trump on Monday at the White House, according to a report. However, the meeting doesn\u2019t appear on Trump\u2019s public calendar.\nIntel faces numerous crises. On one hand, the company has already announced the layoffs of thousands of employees, dating back to last year. Although Intel solicited billions from the U.S. government as part of the CHIPS Act, it has warned that it might exit chip manufacturing altogether if it can\u2019t find a customer for its 14A manufacturing process. The 14A process follows the 18A process, the foundation of Panther Lake, which Tan has said remains on track. But Trump has also demanded that Tan step down, citing Tan\u2019s ties to a number of Chinese firms in his role as a venture capitalist.\nIn the interim, former Intel chief executive Craig Barrett has weighed in with a list of bombastic thoughts on the matter. Barrett, writing in Fortune, is the 86-year-old former CEO who took the reins at Intel in 1998, succeeding the iconic Andy Grove. Barrett oversaw the Pentium III and Pentium 4, as well as the early days of the Xeon processor.\nAn investment into the future\nIn Barrett\u2019s mind, customers should be investing in Intel to ensure a stable (and American) supply of semiconductors. \u201cNeither Samsung or TSMC plan to bring their state of the art manufacturing to the U.S. in the near term,\u201d he wrote. \u201cU.S. customers like Nvidia, Apple, Google, etc. needs and should understand they NEED a second source for their lead product manufacturing due to pricing, geographic stability and supply line security reasons.\u201d\nBarrett suggested that Intel\u2019s customers invest a \u201ccompetitive\u201d $40 billion into the company.\n\u201cWhere does the money come from? The customers invest for a piece of Intel and guaranteed supply,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cWhy should they invest? Domestic supply, second source, national security, leverage in negotiating with TSMC, etc. AND IF THE USG GETS ITS ACT TOGETHER, they catalyze the action with a 50% (or whatever number Trump picks) tariff on state of the art semi imports. If we can support domestic steel and aluminum, surely we can support domestic semiconductors.\u201d (Emphasis Barrett\u2019s.)\nFortune, which has apparently dug into its contact list to solicit advice on the Intel matter, previously published an opinion written by former board members arguing that Tan should be fired and the company broken up. \u201cBe serious,\u201d Barrett wrote.\n\u201cBy all means, if you want to complicate the problem, then take the time to split up Intel and make the FFWBMs [the \u201cfour former wise board members\u201d] happy but if you\u2019re in the business of saving Intel and its core manufacturing strength for the USA then solve the real problem \u2014 immediate investment in Intel, committed customers, national security, etc."

The company has suffered nightmarish processor woes, been eliminated from the dedicated graphics card market, and, to add insult to injury, laid off 15,000 employees last year. Unfortunately, those layoffs weren\u2019t the end of it and more appear to be in store for the company.\nBloomberg reports that Intel plans to lay off another 21,000 employees, or about 20 percent of its entire workforce. The company is expected to announce the layoffs later this week.\nIntel\u2019s newly appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan\u2014who came on in March 2025, replacing Pat Gelsinger after he stepped down in December 2024\u2014aims to streamline management and rebuild a work culture that\u2019s focused on technology and engineering, according to Bloomberg.\nTan said all the right things when he made his opening statements as Intel\u2019s new chief executive last month, asking for \u201cbrutal honesty\u201d while promising to \u201cturn things around\u201d and capping it all off with a bold claim: \u201cI will make it perfect.\u201d As devastating as it is for a company to slash a fifth of its workforce, we can only wait and see if this move is what Intel needs to re-establish itself and make a much-needed comeback.\nThis article originally appeared on our sister publication PC f\u00f6r Alla and was translated and localized from Swedish."
