  "description": "As the party members choose their new leader, Guardian readers quiz the three hopefuls about class, Reform UK, Corbyn and the EU",
  "content": "If the voting age drops to 16, how will you encourage young people to take part? Ellie Chowns and Adrian Ramsay: Young people face intergenerational injustice in many areas, from housing to education, and need to see they can make a difference through politics. Not least to the climate and nature crises that threaten to destroy their future \u2013 which is one reason we need to keep this primary focus. Adrian joined the Green party at 16, co-founded the Young Greens and has consistently championed youth representation. Ellie \u2013 as councillor, MEP and MP \u2013 has encouraged young people\u2019s involvement, pushing for youth inclusion on local boards, taking groups to the EU and Westminster parliaments, and setting up the West Midlands Youth Climate Assembly. Zack Polanski: Inspire them. Listen to them. Involve them. Young people face stagnant wages, high costs and the climate crisis. Why would they engage unless they can feel it makes a real difference? We need every young person to experience their power early on \u2013 through local campaigns, climate action or activism. As deputy leader, I\u2019ve consistently amplified youth voices. As leader, I\u2019ll turn the volume up. Danny Braverman: I\u2019m disappointed with both responses. Representative democracy will not motivate the very many disengaged young people. Radicalism lies in participatory democracy, such as regional youth citizens assemblies. I\u2019d like to see Zach as the new leader. He\u2019s the nearest to my own politics. I\u2019d describe myself as a watermelon: green on the outside, red on the inside, with some black anarchist pips for good measure.\n\nWhat role does class have in your understanding of the world? EC & AR: The widening inequality and deepening poverty that blight so many lives are so clearly linked to the concentration of more and more wealth into fewer and fewer hands. Those with the least are the first to be hit hard by climate breakdown, and a just transition to a zero-carbon world can\u2019t happen without much greater redistribution of wealth. At the heart of Green politics \u2013 and our personal values \u2013 is a commitment to the fundamental equality of all people, to breaking down barriers and sharing resources fairly. Politics is how we can reverse the market\u2019s tendency to concentrate wealth and power. ZP: Class is central. Without fair wages, resources and skills, other inequalities persist. We must be rooted in working-class communities. People know that the super rich and corporations are destroying our environment, communities and democracies. This isn\u2019t \u201cus v them\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s all of us, building change from the grassroots up. Simon Legg: These are decent answers to a question that could legitimately be answered in innumerable ways.\n\nIf the Greens were in a position to join a coalition government, what policies would you insist were adopted? EC & AR: With the political landscape shifting at incredible speed, we see this as an entirely possible scenario. We\u2019d focus on three things: electoral reform, fair taxation of extreme wealth to invest in public services, and strong climate and nature action. The introduction of a proportional voting system would be a complete game changer, and we\u2019d want this to be a red line in negotiations. First past the post leaves millions of people feeling unrepresented, driving cynicism and disillusionment with politics \u2013 which are deeply corrosive to democracy. It also raises the risk of an extremist government elected on a minority of votes. These are red lines about fairness, democracy and a liveable planet. Hana Prosser: 10/10 for ambition! I appreciate Zack identifying specific policy actions. But are three red lines realistic? I fear the Greens either presenting an indigestible package deal to coalition partners or, once in government, becoming Lib Dem-style hostages to fortune. Ellie and Adrian\u2019s single red line \u2013 PR \u2013 seems more credible.\n\nPolls suggest the new party being formed by Jeremy Corbyn and Zara Sultana could secure 10% of the vote. Should the Greens explore a pact with it? EC & AR: We\u2019re always ready to work constructively with other parties where we agree, and often do so in parliament \u2013 including with Jeremy and Zarah. We\u2019re open in principle to electoral alliances to stop Reform UK, but this would need to be a wider collaboration to be effective. And unless there are clear commitments to a fair voting system, and to tackling the climate and nature crises, there will be major differences between us. It\u2019s crucial for the Green party to keep its distinctive identity, offering a genuinely fresh vision of a fairer, greener country with much broader appeal than an old left party. ZP: I have huge respect for both Zarah and Jeremy and have shared many platforms with them for a whole variety of campaigns \u2013 most recently against the genocide in Gaza. But the party doesn\u2019t exist yet, so it\u2019s far too soon for electoral pacts. Right now we need coalitions of ideas, working with anyone who shares our values of environmental, social, racial and economic justice. I do already consider them allies \u2013 the actual fight must be against Reform UK and this failing Labour government. David Lowry: I think the concerns of Ellie and Adrian that the new progressive party might not support a fair voting system are misplaced. It is in their own electoral interest to do so.\n\nClimate change and biodiversity loss are likely to result in medical crises against which the UK has little defence. How do you plan to mitigate them? EC & AR: We need to treat the climate and nature emergencies as the public health threats they are \u2013 and that means action across all areas of society and the economy. We\u2019re already pressing hard for these: affordable, warm, net-zero housing for all, resilient to overheating and to flooding; good public transport, and safe walking and cycling; sustainable, healthy food systems. Tackling the climate crisis means fixing our food, housing and transport systems and more \u2013 doing this will hugely increase our resilience and health, as well as directly reducing emissions. Building resilience to climate impacts is vital to our national security. ZP: I\u2019ve chaired the environment committee in the London Assembly for the past few years and produced a report with University College London which includes recommendations for mitigation of emissions and climate adaptation. We need to make sure active travel and public transport are properly resourced, the cheapest option and accessible to all. We need to make sure that we\u2019re also building the infrastructure we need to tackle climate disasters such as wildfires and floods, including nature-friendly solutions. And we need to co-design (including using citizens assemblies) so people are involved with the decision-making process rather than have things done to them. Rajarshi Raychaudhuri: My question dealt specifically with climate change, biodiversity loss and a medical catastrophe, like the Covid-19 pandemic, which was more likely a result of biodiversity loss than US scaremongering. I note that the answer, while apparently audacious and impressive, does not deal with the question. However, having been an enthusiastic environmental activist in my youth, I continue to hope. I shall certainly follow the progress of the candidates with great interest.\n\nIf 50% of the electorate believes a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote, how would you convince people that a vote for Green wouldn\u2019t be a vote for Reform UK? EC & AR: Such arguments have been used to prop up the failed two-party system for decades. Now it\u2019s blown wide open, and there are huge opportunities for the Greens. Under Carla Denyer and Adrian\u2019s leadership, we\u2019ve shown we can win parliamentary seats everywhere, from big cities to rural constituencies. In local elections we\u2019ve gained every year for the past eight years, and Green councillors have earned strong trust. Voters can now see clearly that if you vote Green, we can win Green. That appeals not just to those disillusioned with the old politics but to all those hopeful for a greener, fairer future. ZP: We now have four MPs, three London Assembly members and more than 800 councillors. We got nearly 2 million votes and 39 second-place finishes \u2013 we\u2019re planning to turn them into MPs at the next general election. My central mission is to make Keir Starmer more worried about losing votes and ultimately losing more seats to the Green party than to Reform UK. Until he feels that electoral pressure from his left, this country will continue to veer to the right. It seems that no marginalised group is off the table for cruelty. We stop that happening right now by growing the Green party. Adam Butlin: I personally preferred Zack\u2019s response, but all the candidates have clearly addressed the central point of my question, emphasising both recent electoral successes and the potential for political leverage over the mainstream parties. I can only hope that voters also see the strategic impact of voting Green.\n\nShould the UK have a fairer immigration system? Under present rules I would not have been able to come with my husband because then he did not earn \u00a338,000 EC & AR: Generations of immigrants have made a huge contribution \u2013 culturally and economically \u2013 to our national life. We\u2019re proud to celebrate this and condemn the demonisation of migrants by the media and politicians, which is driving racist hate. We want to see a humane system of managed immigration and are opposed to rules that discriminate on the grounds of income or impose unreasonable costs on people who move here. This is not only unfair but it also ignores the fact that many currently low-paid jobs \u2013 in social care, for instance \u2013 are actually far more socially valuable than many higher-paid jobs \u2013 say in banking. ZP: We need to tell the truth. With an ageing population, we badly need migration. Of course we should also train up British workers, but it doesn\u2019t have to be an either/or. If you use the NHS, the person who cares for you is more likely to be a migrant than anyone in front of you in the queue. And the unfair rules around visas just cause unnecessary stress on families kept apart for absolutely no reason but to appease the right. The real problem in our country is not migrants but years of austerity under both Conservative and Labour governments. Patricia Jephson: I have heard no end of nonsense from the Conservative and now Labour representatives in my area regarding immigration, which is one of the reasons why I joined the Green party. I am glad that Ellie, Adrian and Zack all value immigrants and our contributions to our adopted home, the UK.",
