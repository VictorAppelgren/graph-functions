  "content": "The NFL has released a memo recommending enhanced security measures at team and league facilities following a shooting last week at a New York City office tower that houses the league\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThe memo, sent to all NFL team owners and obtained by The Athletic on Friday, outlined three recommended changes to security protocols. They include:\n\u2022 Updated threat assessments at every team and league facility to ensure risks are accurately identified and mitigated.\n\u2022 The presence of armed officers at team and league facilities whenever players or staff members are present.\n\u2022 Weapons screening for anyone seeking entry into a team or league facility, including the use of walk-through magnetometers and X-ray scanners for bags, similar to the process for obtaining entry into games.\n\n\u201cThe Committee recognizes that these changes will affect day-to-day operations and require an investment of time, coordination, and resources,\u201d the memo read. \u201cHowever, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of our players, coaches, staff, and everyone who works in and around our facilities.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations come in response to the July 28 shooting in Midtown Manhattan. In the incident, authorities say Shane Tamura double-parked his BMW outside the building at 345 Park Ave., carried an assault rifle into the building and started shooting.\n\nFour people were killed, including police officer Didarul Islam, and another was wounded before Tamura took his own life, police said. New York Mayor Eric Adams said investigators believe Tamura was trying to reach the NFL offices but took the wrong elevator.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Tamura left a three-page note in his wallet criticizing the NFL for concealing the dangers of football. Adams said the note referenced CTE, a degenerative brain disease connected to repeated blows to the head that can only be diagnosed through an autopsy.\n\n\u201cThe motive appeared to be connected to the shooter\u2019s belief that he was suffering from CTE and (a claim that) he was an ex-NFL player,\u201d Adams said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThose items just don\u2019t pan out. He never played for the NFL.\u201d\n\nTamura, who was 27 at the time of the shooting, played high school football in California but did not play in college or professionally.\n\nAccording to Friday\u2019s memo, NFL teams and stadium security have already been sent the recommended changes. The protocols will be reviewed on Aug. 26 at a special league meeting and will include a full plan for the implementation of the recommendations.\n\n\u201cIn moments like these, we are reminded that safety is not a background function. It is foundational,\u201d the memo read.",

      "text": "Chris Nowinski paused frequently.\nOn Monday, 27-year-old Shane Tamura walked into a Manhattan high-rise that houses NFL headquarters and killed four people with an assault rifle. The next day, reports surfaced that Nowinski\u2019s name was in a letter found on Tamura, who claimed he was suffering from the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\nAdvertisement\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams said authorities \u201chave reason to believe (Tamura) was focused\u201d on the NFL.\nNowinski, who retired from World Wrestling Entertainment more than 20 years ago due to brain injuries, became a neuroscientist and eventually one of the world\u2019s most renowned figures in concussion and CTE research. Not long after, Nowinski\u2019s friend and WWE peer Chris Benoit killed his wife, son and then himself. Studies done by Nowinski\u2019s foundation after Benoit\u2019s death found significant brain damage that suggested the wrestler suffered from depression and CTE.\nCTE, which is most commonly found in athletes, particularly those who participate in contact sports such as wrestling or football, can only be definitively diagnosed after a person has died. However, Nowinski and his Concussion Legacy Foundation think they are close to being able to diagnose individuals while they are still alive.\nOn Wednesday, a reflective Nowinski shared his thoughts with The Athletic about Monday\u2019s shooting, the stigmas surrounding brain injuries and what might happen with Tamura\u2019s brain.\n(Questions and answers have been edited for clarity and length.)\nWhat were your emotions upon hearing that your name was mentioned in the gunman\u2019s letter?\nUm \u2026 I\u2019m still processing.\nDid Monday\u2019s news, and the news of your name being in the letter, make you reflect on the cases of Benoit and other previous tragedies?\nYes, when I learned about the shooting and the CTE claim, I did think about Chris Benoit, Phillip Adams, Aaron Hernandez and other cases that people aren\u2019t aware of that involved homicide and often suicide.\nThis is something we\u2019ve seen before in people who have had CTE, but it\u2019s also been seen in a lot of people who don\u2019t.\nWhen it comes to violent crimes like these, how do you balance the impact of brain trauma with the impact of mental health illnesses? Where does one end and the other begin?\nNo one would argue, in general, that having traumatic brain injuries can increase the odds of developing mental health disorders or increase the odds of abnormal behaviors. The question of the role of CTE as a brain disease, within that, especially in younger people, has a lot more unknowns than knowns.\nAdvertisement\nI try to focus on what we can potentially learn from these situations so we can prevent the next tragedy.\nWhat are the dangers of CTE for younger athletes? Do concussions have a greater effect on young people?\nWhen the brain is still developing, suffering traumatic brain injuries or repetitive head impacts can change what that brain was supposed to become. There\u2019s no question around that.\nThe nature of traumatic brain injuries is that they aren\u2019t the same in everybody. They injure specific parts of the brain, so we should never be surprised that people have different symptoms after brain injuries; it all depends on how your brain is wired and where the injuries occurred.\nMost people who suffered traumatic injuries, in the big picture, are fine and recover completely or almost completely. For other people, one brain injury changes who they are for the rest of their lives.\nEverybody who has CTE has gone through the process of getting repetitive traumatic brain injuries. So, in young people, is CTE simply because those repetitive traumatic brain injuries happened? Or is CTE also causing additional degeneration that is adding on top of the damage from the repetitive traumatic brain injuries?\nDo you fear stigma becoming attached to people who have experienced traumatic brain injuries and might be, in the eyes of the public, more likely to have CTE or become violent?\nWe do have to be aware of the potential for stigma. On the other hand, we also have to be aware that the stories that we\u2019re hearing are only the tip of the iceberg.\nThe problem for someone like me is that families confide in us the truth about what their loved one went through. Many of the stories they tell us so that we can learn about them as scientists, but they are never willing to tell them publicly because a lot of those loved ones are high-profile members of the community.\nWe don\u2019t want everyone to think every ex-football player, including me, has the potential to do a terrible thing or is inevitably going to do a terrible thing. But we also have to balance that with the terrible things that are happening to these families.\nIn your past 19 years of studying concussions, how far do you feel we\u2019ve come in our understanding of CTE and how much further do you think we need to grow as a society?\nI think the most important advancement that has been made is finding that CTE is caused by repeated traumatic brain injuries, that there\u2019s not some mysterious other factor here.\nBut also, it\u2019s not just the symptomatic concussions that are causing it; the risk of CTE is most associated with the number and strength of repetitive hits taken over a lifetime, which gives us a path forward to preventing CTE.\nAdvertisement\nThe problem we have is that almost no one is trying to prevent CTE, so we\u2019re still creating the same problem. There\u2019s very little acceptance that it is preventable, and the organizations that are creating CTE don\u2019t necessarily want to balance their role in creating CTE.\nI hope that we\u2019re soon able to marshal the attention and resources this disease deserves so that we can actually diagnose and help people while they\u2019re alive, and also strengthen the case for why we should stop hitting kids in the head and we should really try to prevent this, because brain diseases are terrible.\nIf we knew how to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we would be doing everything. Yet for CTE, it has one cause, and we\u2019re almost doing nothing to prevent it.\nAre we anywhere close to getting CTE testing available for athletes while they are alive?\nWe are, we are. The studies are finally happening that will tell us how to diagnose CTE in living people. \u2026 I do think it\u2019s just around the corner now.\nWould you say it\u2019s a safe assumption to say that there is a startling number of active NFL, college or even high school football players who have early stages of CTE?\nYes. When the numbers are revealed, I think they will shock people.\nAs we look forward, can you walk us through what could happen now with Shane Tamura\u2019s brain?\nJust speculating, because I don\u2019t have any inside information, but the New York City Medical Examiner\u2019s Office is among the most sophisticated in the world, and they have affiliated experts who understand CTE.\nThe brain will be fixed in formalin solution to harden, so it can then be processed and studied, and that will happen for two or three weeks. Then it\u2019ll be photographed and observed, as it is, and then it will begin to be cut in ways to study more than 20 different regions of the brain, looking for any and all abnormalities, both visible and those that need to be studied, which don\u2019t become visible until you use use a small brush with antibodies on the tissue which make abnormalities visible and be studied under a microscope.\nAdvertisement\n(The timeline) all depends on capacity. What you learn is that for all neuropathologists, there are more brains to be studied than there is time. If this was the only job they had, it could be done in under two months, but we\u2019ll see what the capacity is.\nIn 2007, when Benoit died, your advocacy was just beginning, and now, 18 years later, your name shows up again, almost like a symbol that is attached to the topic of CTE.\nI\u2019ve always felt guilt that I didn\u2019t go far enough to help Chris Benoit. Because I remember he asked me to call him, and I did call him, and he did answer, but he sounded agitated and said he\u2019d call me back. Then he didn\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t chase him down.\nWhether it\u2019s Benoit or Andre Waters, many of those early cases shaped my view that people can really suffer with this, and it really impacts their families. So my goal has always been to let people know that this is possible and drive those who are struggling to find help.\nAt the Concussion Legacy Foundation, we now have five full-time people just taking inbound helpline requests and ensuring people are connected with the best doctor for their symptoms.\nI\u2019ve dedicated my life to trying to make sure that those people can live their best life while trying to mobilize the world to find better answers, because their answers aren\u2019t good enough right now. And that means diagnosing and potentially curing this.\nSo with that, there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. In some aspects, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. But there\u2019s still so far to go, and I\u2019ve got to figure out a way to get there faster.\n(Top photo of Nowinski, far left, testifying before Congress in 2014: Win McNamee / Getty Images)"

He never played for the NFL.\u201d\nThe shooter was identified as 27-year-old Shane Devin Tamura, according to New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch. Tamura played high school football in California, according to MaxPreps, and appeared on the roster for Granada Hills Charter in 2015, but he never played professionally.\nLet\u2019s examine what CTE is and its connection to football and the NFL.\nWhat is CTE?\nChronic traumatic encephalopathy is a degenerative brain disease most commonly found in athletes, particularly those who participate in contact sports such as football. It has also been linked to others with a history of repetitive brain trauma, such as military veterans. One of the leading experts in developing the understanding of CTE is Dr. Ann McKee, a neurologist who is the director of the Boston University Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center and Boston University CTE Center.\n\u201cThe most common neurodegeneration that we know about is Alzheimer\u2019s Disease,\u201d McKee said. \u201cBut CTE is similar. In the case of CTE, it\u2019s triggered by repetitive head trauma. We think that after sufficient amount of head trauma, this disease starts to develop in your brain and then becomes a progressive, widespread brain disease, as time goes on.\u201d\nCTE is defined neuropathologically. It\u2019s not possible to make the diagnosis while a person is still alive, meaning a definitive CTE diagnosis can only be made after a person has died and the brain is preserved.\nAccording to the New York Times, Tamura\u2019s note included a request to \u201cStudy my brain please. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nSymptoms of CTE\nWhile a definitive diagnosis can\u2019t be made while a person is still alive, there are signs that one may be suffering from CTE. Personality shifts and drastic changes in a person\u2019s behavior or mood are common symptoms.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere are things like aggression and violent behaviors,\u201d McKee said in the video. \u201cImpulsivity, a short fuse. Another common set of symptoms is memory loss and difficulty planning and organizing and difficulty with attention.\u201d\nCTE is not a stagnant disease. The mildest form of CTE starts in one area of the brain, but the condition gets progressively worse as one ages, spreading to other parts of the nervous system.\nHistory with football and the NFL\nAccording to a 2023 report by the Boston University CTE Center, 345 of 376 deceased former NFL players whose brains were studied by the program were diagnosed with CTE.\nThe first autopsy done on an NFL player that revealed CTE was in 2002, on former Pittsburgh Steelers center Mike Webster. Webster died of a heart attack on Sept. 24, 2002, at age 50, and was also diagnosed with CTE after his death.\nIn December 2009, former Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died after falling out of the back of a moving truck. An autopsy revealed that the 26-year-old had CTE, the first instance of a player who had died while still active in the NFL being diagnosed with CTE.\nOver the years, numerous players have been in the headlines for CTE diagnoses. Three years after completing his Hall of Fame career, linebacker Junior Seau died after shooting himself in the chest, and was later diagnosed with CTE. Former Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez died by suicide inside his prison cell after being found guilty of first-degree murder. Former Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher was also diagnosed with CTE after he died in a murder-suicide, first killing his girlfriend and then driving to the Chiefs\u2019 facility and shooting himself.\nThe disease isn\u2019t only connected to those who played professionally. Another Boston University study of 152 young athletes who experienced repetitive head impacts and died under the age of 30 showed that 63 (41.4 percent) had evidence of CTE. Among those 63 with CTE, 49 of them played football and most of them didn\u2019t play above the high school or college level.\nAdvertisement\nNFL\u2019s response to CTE\nBeginning in 2011, nearly 5,000 former players sued the NFL for head trauma they endured during their professional playing careers. The lawsuits alleged the NFL knew about the health risks for years, but withheld that information from its players. Eventually, a settlement was reached that promised to provide benefits to retired NFL players and their families, including baseline testing as well as an uncapped compensation fund for those suffering from conditions such as dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s or ALS.\nYet complaints have followed about how the NFL approves or denies player claims to the fund. According to a 2024 report by The Washington Post, the settlement had approved nearly 900 dementia cases since 2017 but denied nearly 1,100 others, including about 300 players who had been diagnosed by a network of doctors the league funded to evaluate players showing early signs of dementia.\n(Photo: Andy Lyons / Getty Images)"

      "text": "On Monday night at 6:28 p.m., 911 calls began pouring in from a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, where a gunman had opened fire. The high-rise houses the NFL league headquarters and offices for several other prominent companies.\nAuthorities believe the shooter was focused on the NFL when he entered the building and killed four people and injured a fifth, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Tuesday morning. The gunman then shot and killed himself. A note found in his wallet was critical of the NFL and mentioned CTE, the degenerative brain disease associated with repeated hits to the head.\nAdvertisement\nHere\u2019s what we know about the situation:\nWho was the gunman?\nShane Tamura of Las Vegas was identified as the shooter by New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.\nTamura, 27, was seen on surveillance footage exiting a black BMW shortly before 6:30 p.m. on Monday, carrying an assault rifle in his right hand. He wore sunglasses, a navy blazer and a blue dress shirt as he walked into the building at 345 Park Ave., between 51st and 52nd Streets.\nTisch said law enforcement partners in Las Vegas shared that Tamura had a documented history of mental health issues, and he appeared to have driven across the country in his BMW, which is registered to him in Nevada.\nTamura never played football in the NFL or in college, but he did play in high school in California, according to MaxPreps. He appeared on the roster for Granada Hills Charter in 2015, where his positions were listed as running back and defensive back.\nWalter Roby, Tamura\u2019s coach at Granada Hills, told Fox 11 that Tamura was a quiet, hard-working player.\n\u201cCould I have done more? Could I help the kid? Could I have reached out to him or could you reach out to me? It\u2019s just a lot of things I\u2019m trying to process right now,\u201d Roby said.\nWhat was in Tamura\u2019s note?\nAccording to The New York Times, Tamura left a three-page note in his wallet criticizing the NFL for concealing the dangers of playing football.\nAdams said Tuesday that the note referenced CTE, which can only be diagnosed through an autopsy.\n\u201cThe motive appeared to be connected to the shooter\u2019s belief that he was suffering from CTE and (a claim that) he was an ex-NFL player,\u201d Adams told CNN. \u201cThose items just don\u2019t pan out. He never played for the NFL.\u201d\nIn the excerpts of the note reported by The Times, Tamura mentions former NFL player Terry Long, who died by suicide in 2005. Long, an offensive lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1984 to 1991, was diagnosed with CTE after his death.\nAdvertisement\nTamura\u2019s note was found in his wallet after he fatally shot himself in the chest. Former NFL players Junior Seau and Dave Duerson also died after shooting themselves in the chest. Both were diagnosed with CTE after their deaths.\nDuerson\u2019s final note to his family finished with: \u201cPlease, see that my brain is given to the NFL\u2019s brain bank.\u201d\nIn Tamura\u2019s letter, he wrote: \u201cStudy my brain please. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the New York City medical examiner\u2019s office said it would perform an autopsy on Tamura, including an examination of his brain.\nWhere did the shooting happen?\nThe NFL has offices on multiple floors in the high-rise building at 345 Park Ave. Other companies with offices in the building include Deutsche Bank, the financial firm KPMG and investment management firm Blackstone.\nThe building is located blocks from Grand Central Terminal and St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in a heavily trafficked area of Midtown Manhattan.\nOnce Tamura was inside the building, he shot four people on the ground floor, killing three of them, including a uniformed New York City police officer and a security guard. He then got on an elevator, allowing a woman to exit unharmed, and went to the 33rd floor, where he killed another person before shooting himself.\nAdams said investigators believe Tamura wanted to reach the NFL offices, but he took the wrong elevator.\nWhat do we know about the victims?\nA high-ranking NFL employee told The Athletic\u2019s Dianna Russini that an employee in the league\u2019s finance department \u2014 identified in an NFL memo to team owners as Craig Clementi \u2014 was struck in the back by a bullet during the shooting.\n\u201cOne of our employees was seriously injured in this attack,\u201d Goodell said in a statement to NFL staff. \u201cHe is currently in the hospital and in stable condition. NFL staff are at the hospital and we are supporting his family.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nGoodell sent another memo to employees on Tuesday, informing them that the 345 Park Ave. office would be closed through at least Aug. 8.\nPolice officer Didarul Islam, a three-year veteran of the NYPD and an immigrant from Bangladesh, was among the deceased, Adams shared. Blackstone said an executive, Wesley LePatner, was also among the victims. Another victim, security guard Aland Etienne, was identified by the union 32BJ.\nRudin Management associate Julia Hyman was the fourth victim killed in the shooting, according to a Tuesday letter from Riverdale Country School in New York, where she attended grade school.\n(Top photo: Timothy Clary / AFP via Getty Images)"
