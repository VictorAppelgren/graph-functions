  "content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nEditor's take: Even to a non-investor, it is clear that we are in the middle of a massive AI bubble. It is not a matter of if it will burst, but when. Many of the companies driving this growth seem more interested in ginning up hype than being realistic about the value of the technology.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged what many economists have suspected for months: the artificial intelligence sector is in a bubble fueled by overexcited investors. In a dinner interview with reporters in San Francisco, the ChatGPT chief compared today's AI investment frenzy to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s \u2013 a rare moment of candor from a leader whose company sits at the center of the boom.\n\n\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman's remarks come as AI companies draw massive funding despite minimal revenue or proven business models. He said today's market mirrors past moments when genuine breakthroughs sparked rapid overvalued investment. Venture capital firms have poured record sums into AI startups, with some valuations defying traditional metrics.\n\n\"When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\" Altman explained. \"If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited.\"\n\nThe timing of Altman's comments is particularly significant given recent high-profile funding rounds in the AI sector. Multiple sources report that Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines \u2013 founded by former OpenAI executives Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati \u2013 have each secured billions in the past year.\n\nThese unicorns \u2013 startups valued over $1 billion \u2013 reflect a broader trend where investors are assessing artificial intelligence companies with limited operational history at levels typically reserved for established technology giants. Nearly 500 of these young firms hold an average valuation of around $5.4 billion each, while another 1,300 are worth over $100 million.\n\nAltman specifically criticized valuations for early-stage AI startups, calling some investments fundamentally irrational. He noted that companies with small teams and unproven concepts are receiving unprecedented funding.\n\n\"That's not rational behavior. Someone's gonna get burned there, I think,\" Altman said. \"Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money \u2013 we don't know who \u2013 and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money.\"\n\nDespite acknowledging the bubble's existence, Altman remains optimistic about artificial intelligence's long-term economic impact. He emphasized that while individual investors may face significant losses, the overall effect on the economy will likely be positive, similar to how the internet eventually fulfilled its transformative promise despite the dot-com crash.\n\nThe OpenAI chief's confidence in his company's position within this bubble appears unwavering, as evidenced by his ambitious expansion plans.\n\n\"You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,\" Altman said.\n\nHis trillion-dollar infrastructure commitment suggests that OpenAI sees the current market as an opportunity to build long-term competitive advantages, even as competitors may face funding constraints during an eventual market correction.",

      "text": "On Thursday, I had dinner with Sam Altman, a few other OpenAI executives, and a small group of reporters in San Francisco. Altman answered our questions for hours. No topic was off limits, and everything, with the exception of what was said over desert, was on the record.\nIt\u2019s uncommon to have such an extended, wide-ranging interview with a major tech CEO over a meal. But there\u2019s nothing common about the situation Altman finds himself in. ChatGPT has quickly become one of the most widely used, influential products on earth. Now, Altman is plotting an aggressive expansion into consumer hardware, brain-computer interfaces, and social media. He\u2019s interested in buying Chrome if the US government forces Google to sell it. Oh, and he wants to raise trillions of dollars to build data centers.\nBut first, he\u2019s focused on the response to last week\u2019s rollout of GPT-5. About an hour before the dinner started, OpenAI pushed an update to bring back the \u201cwarmth\u201d of 4o, its previous default model for ChatGPT. It was Altman who made the call to quickly bring back 4o as an option for paying subscribers after some protested its disappearance on Reddit and X.\n\u201cI think we totally screwed up some things on the rollout,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, our API traffic doubled in 48 hours and is growing. We\u2019re out of GPUs. ChatGPT has been hitting a new high of users every day. A lot of users really do love the model switcher. I think we\u2019ve learned a lesson about what it means to upgrade a product for hundreds of millions of people in one day.\u201d\nHe pegged the percentage of ChatGPT users who have unhealthy relationships with the product at \u201cway under 1 percent,\u201d but acknowledged that OpenAI employees are having \u201ca lot\u201d of meetings about the topic. \u201cThere are the people who actually felt like they had a relationship with ChatGPT, and those people we\u2019ve been aware of and thinking about. And then there are hundreds of millions of other people who don\u2019t have a parasocial relationship with ChatGPT, but did get very used to the fact that it responded to them in a certain way, and would validate certain things, and would be supportive in certain ways.\u201d\n\u201cYou will definitely see some companies go make Japanese anime sex bots because they think that they\u2019ve identified something here that works,\u201d he said in a not-so-subtle dig at Grok. \u201cYou will not see us do that. We will continue to work hard at making a useful app, and we will try to let users use it the way they want, but not so much that people who have really fragile mental states get exploited accidentally.\u201d\nAltman wants ChatGPT to feel as personal as possible but not necessarily play to a specific ideology or political view. \u201dI don\u2019t think our products should be woke. I don\u2019t think they should be whatever the opposite of that is, either. I think our product should have a fairly center of the road, middle stance, and then you should be able to push it pretty far. If you\u2019re like, \u2018I want you to be super woke,\u2019 it should be super woke. And if you\u2019re like, \u2018I want you to be conservative,\u2019 it should reflect you.\u201d\nChatGPT has roughly quadrupled its user base in a year and is now reaching over 700 million people each week. \u201cPretty soon, billions of people a day will be talking to ChatGPT,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe\u2019re the fifth biggest website in the world right now. I think we\u2019re on the clear path to the third.\u201d (That means beating Instagram and Facebook.) \u201cThen it gets harder. For ChatGPT to be bigger than Google, that\u2019s really hard.\u201d\nFor its operation to keep scaling, OpenAI needs a lot more GPUs. This is one of Altman\u2019s top priorities. \u201cYou should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,\u201d he confidently told the room.\n\u201cWe have to make these horrible trade-offs right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have better models, and we just can\u2019t offer them because we don\u2019t have the capacity. We have other kinds of new products and services we\u2019d love to offer.\u201d\nHe also thinks we\u2019re in an AI bubble. \u201cWhen bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future\u201d\nHe confirmed recent reports that OpenAI is planning to fund a brain-computer interface startup to rival Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink. \u201cI think neural interfaces are cool ideas to explore. I would like to be able to think something and have ChatGPT respond to it.\u201d\nDoes Fidji Simo joining OpenAI to run \u201capplications\u201d imply there will be other standalone apps besides ChatGPT? \u201cYes, you should expect that from us.\u201d He hinted at his social media ambitions: \u201cI am interested in whether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.\u201d He also said, \u201cIf Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it.\u201d\nWhile Altman has a lot of interests, it\u2019s not actually clear that running OpenAI over the long run is one of them. \u201cI\u2019m not a naturally well-suited person to be a public company CEO,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cCan you imagine me on an earnings call?\u201d\nI then asked if he would be CEO in a few years. \u201cI mean, maybe an AI is in three years. That\u2019s a long time.\u201d\nHere are some other things Altman said:\n- Making GPT-5: \u201cWe had this big GPU crunch. We could go make another giant model. We could go make that, and a lot of people would want to use it, and we would disappoint them. And so we said, let\u2019s make a really smart, really useful model, but also let\u2019s try to optimize for inference cost. And I think we did a great job with that.\u201d\n- OpenAI\u2019s AI device with Jony Ive: \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us a while, but I think you will think it is very worth the wait. I think it is incredible. You don\u2019t get a new computing paradigm very often. There have been like only two in the last 50 years. So just let yourself be happy and surprised. It really is worth the wait.\u201d\n- The future of the web and publishers: \u201cI do think people will go to fewer websites. I think people will care more about human-crafted content than ever. My directional bet would be that human-created, human-endorsed, human-curated content all goes up in value dramatically.\u201d\n- What AGI means: \u201cMaybe the milestone that\u2019s most relevant to us is when most of our research cluster is allocated to the AI researcher instead of the human researchers. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be so binary, because I think it\u2019ll feel like people get a little more help and a little more help and a little more help.\u201d\n- \u201cIf we didn\u2019t pay for training, we\u2019d be a very profitable company.\u201d\n- \u201cI don\u2019t use Google anymore. I legitimately cannot tell you the last time I did a Google search.\u201d\nPersonnel log\nInteresting career moves this week:\n- I suppose I should start asking, \u201cAre you about to quit your job?\u201d in interviews. A week after my Decoder episode with him was published, GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke announced he was leaving for startup life. The real story here is that GitHub is less independent from the rest of Microsoft, which suggests that the commercial interests of Jay Parikh\u2019s new Core AI team that absorbed it have officially overtaken GitHub\u2019s open-source, Switzerland-for-coding ethos.\n- Igor Babuschkin, the co-founder and de facto head of Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, announced that he\u2019s leaving after two years to launch an investing firm focused on AI safety. (I\u2019m sure recent Grok headlines had nothing to do with the timing of this news.)\n- Alexandr Wang added more OpenAI researchers to his new AI lab at Meta: Hyung Won Chung, Jason Wei, and Zhiqing Sun.\n- Anthropic added Dave Orr, a Google veteran who most recently ran safety for Gemini, as its head of safety. It also hired Jordan Burgess and his team at the startup Humanloop, which has been working on LLM evaluations for businesses.\n- Joelle Pineau, Meta\u2019s former head of AI research, joined Cohere as chief AI officer.\nLink list\nMore to click on:\n- My interview with Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT.\n- \u201cThe paradox of GPT-5.\u201d\n- \u201cOpenAI burns the boats.\u201d\n- \u201cThe looming social crisis of AI friends and chatbot therapists.\u201d\n- \u201cMeta\u2019s AI rules have let bots hold \u2018sensual\u2019 chats with kids, offer false medical info.\u201d\n- \u201cLarry Ellison wants to do good, do research and make a profit.\u201d\n- \u201cInside San Francisco\u2019s robot fight club.\u201d\nIf you haven\u2019t already, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to The Verge, which includes unlimited access to Command Line and all of our reporting.\nAs always, I welcome your feedback.
