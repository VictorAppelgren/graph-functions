  "title": "Scientists Taught AI to Predict Nuclear Fusion Success\u2014and It's Actually Working",
  "description": "Researchers at the National Ignition Facility achieved nuclear fusion ignition with the help of an AI program that essentially told them they were on the right track.",
  "content": "AI is giving a huge efficiency boost to one of the biggest nuclear fusion facilities in the world\u2014but perhaps not in the way you think.\n\nIn research published today in Science, scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory report how its newly developed deep learning model accurately predicted the results of a 2022 fusion experiment at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The model, which assigned 74% probability for ignition in that experiment, outperforms traditional supercomputing methods by covering more parameters with greater precision.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re excited about with this model is the ability to explicitly make choices for future experiments that maximize our probability of success each time,\u201d study co-author Kelli Humbird told Gizmodo during a video call. Even a facility as large and well-established as the NIF can only \u201cdo a couple dozen of these ignition attempts per year\u2014so really not very many at all, given how much territory we have to cover,\u201d added Humbird, who leads the Cognitive Simulation Group at NIF\u2019s Inertial Confinement Fusion Program.\n\nCurrently, nuclear power plants run on nuclear fission, which captures the energy generated by the splitting of heavy atoms, like uranium. Researchers eventually want to shift toward nuclear fusion, a process that combines lightweight hydrogen atoms to release massive amounts of energy. Fusion produces more energy and doesn\u2019t create harmful, radioactive byproducts, so having fusion as a reliable source of energy would greatly benefit our society\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. Although the field has made some promising advances, the consensus is that we\u2019re still far from implementing nuclear fusion on a commercial scale.\n\nNIF\u2019s fusion experiments are laser-driven. First, the lasers heat up a gold cylinder called the hohlraum, which then emits a flow of powerful X-rays. The extreme temperatures compress the fuel pellets containing deuterium and tritium, two hydrogen isotopes used in fusion experiments. In an ideal scenario, this triggers enough deuterium-tritium fusion reactions to produce more energy than the lasers consume.\n\nComputer simulations can\u2019t reliably predict all the physics in this process, Humbird said. That\u2019s in part because the codes are often simplified so they\u2019re \u201ccomputationally tractable,\u201d but the simulations themselves can also introduce some errors. Even if you\u2019ve taken all sorts of precautions, it still takes days for the computers to finish running through the code, she added.\n\nAchieving nuclear fusion is like scaling a tall, uncharted mountain, Humbird said. The computer simulations are like an \u201cimperfect\u201d map that\u2019s supposed to teach researchers how to reach the peak\u2014but this map could be rife with errors that may or may not be the product of their research design. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking, and researchers have to quickly decide whether they\u2019ll take the hike that day and which tools they\u2019re going to use. And of course, each \u201chike,\u201d or ignition attempt, burns a huge hole in the budget.\n\nAnd so, Humbird\u2019s team embarked on a mapmaking quest, stitching together \u201cpreviously collected NIF data, high-\u00adfidelity physics simulations, and subject matter expert knowledge\u201d to build a comprehensive dataset. Then, they uploaded the data to state-of-the-art supercomputers, which ran a statistical analysis lasting over 30 million CPU hours.\n\n\u201cWhat we basically came up with was a distribution of things that go wrong [at] NIF,\u201d Humbird explained. \u201cAll of the different ways that we have observed implosions. Sometimes the laser doesn\u2019t fire exactly how you asked it to. Sometimes your target has defects in it that can cause things to not go super well.\u201d\n\nThe model allows researchers to preemptively determine the efficacy of their experimental design, saving them considerable time and money. Humbird used the model to assess their own design from a 2022 experiment, which accurately described the results of the specific run in advance. In particular, Humbird was pleased to see that subsequent tweaks to the model\u2019s physics increased the accuracy of its predictions from 50 to 70%.\n\nFor Humbird, the strength of the new model is that it accepts and replicates the imperfections of the real world\u2014whether that\u2019s a flaw in the instrument, research design, or just some silly trick of nature. At the same time, it\u2019s a reminder that, while quick progress is exciting, things often take a lot of time and will even result in outright failure.\n\n\u201cPeople have been working on fusion for decades\u2026 We shouldn\u2019t be so bummed about the times things don\u2019t work,\u201d Humbird said. \u201cThe fact that we sometimes get 1 megajoule of yield instead of two shouldn\u2019t upset us, because not too long ago we were only getting 10 kilojoules. It\u2019s a huge step forward for research, and hopefully a huge step forward for clean energy in the future.\u201d",

      "text": "A UK-based nuclear fusion collaboration just produced a record amount of energy, a refreshing dose of good news in humankind\u2019s quest for cleaner energy sources. The Joint European Torus facility, or JET, produced just over 69 megajoules of heat.\nA brief distillation of nuclear fusion: It is a reaction by which atomic nuclei fuse, turning into a new element while at the same time producing a huge amount of energy. It is a cleaner process than nuclear fission, its evil twin, which generates energy (and a sizable amount of waste) by splitting atoms. Nuclear fusion is the same reaction that powers stars like our Sun, and for decades scientists have tried to make the reaction energy efficient on Earth.\nIf such a goal were realized, the fusion reactions would generate more energy than they take to catalyze, thereby producing\u2014at least in theory\u2014unlimited clean energy. This does not take into account the commercial viability of fusion, and to-date most of the progress towards fusion energy as a power source has been done at great expense by places like the DOE and, in JET\u2019s case, the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).\nCommercially viable nuclear fusion is always 20 years, or 30 years, or half a century away, or so aspirational minds tell us. It sometimes seems like a fata morgana, hovering on the horizon, just out of reach. But hopefully that\u2019s where the mirage analogy ends; after all, accomplishments like that recently made by JET are small-but-significant steps towards the hope of a clean energy future.\nThe 69.26 megajoules recently released at JET exceeds the facility\u2019s previous record of 59 megajoules, as noted by the DOE, and more than triples the facility\u2019s initial peak fusion power record of 22 megajoules, set in 1997. Looks like the DOE will need to update its website.\nThe recent pulse at JET also generated 20 times the record energy produced by the United States Department of Energy\u2019s National Ignition Facility last year, albeit through a different process. Tokamaks and stellarators generate magnetic fields to confine a plasma to catalyze fusion. The NIF blasted high-powered lasers at a peppercorn-sized pellet, inducing fusion in the target. Laser-powered fusion happens quickly, and at high pressures and densities, while magnetic fusion occurs at low pressures and densities over an extended period of time.\nJET began operations in 1983 and stopped its experimental operations in December 2023, so the recent result is a triumphant final act for the veteran tokamak. Over its 40 years of operations, the facility set multiple records, clearly saving the best for last.\n\u201cJET\u2019s final fusion experiment is a fitting swansong after all the ground-breaking work that has gone into the project,\u201d Andrew Bowie, the UK Minister for Nuclear and Networks, told the BBC. \u201cWe are closer to fusion energy than ever before thanks to the international team of scientists and engineers in Oxfordshire.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a beautiful thing to imagine a world where we don\u2019t need to fume over Taylor Swift\u2019s frequent flights, or those of any other billionaire. And it would be a particularly beautiful irony if the spunky project named JET helped get us there."

      "text": "The world\u2019s only fusion experiment that actually gives back more energy than it takes in is now breaking its own records. According to TechCrunch, the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory recently pushed its fusion yield\u2014first to 5.2 megajoules, and then to 8.6 megajoules\u2014more than doubling the energy released in its historic shot in 2022.\nThat original breakthrough was the first time scientists had ever achieved \u201cignition\u201d\u2014a fusion reaction that generated more energy (3.15 megajoules) than the lasers put into the fuel (2.05 megajoules).\nImportantly, that achievement does not take into account the amount of energy put into the system to power the reaction\u2014essentially, 300 megajoules of energy from the plug in the wall. Nevertheless, the accomplishment indicated the tantalizing promise of nuclear fusion as a carbon-free, essentially limitless source of energy. Jill Hruby, the under secretary for nuclear security, summed it up as \u201cthe first tentative steps towards a clean energy source that could revolutionize the world.\u201d\nFusion isn\u2019t new\u2014scientists have been chasing it for nearly a century. The problem has always been scale: It generally costs way more energy to trigger a fusion reaction than what comes out of said reaction. The NIF\u2019s achievement changed that\u2014for a moment, humanity replicated the energy source of stars and came out ahead.\nThe new surge in energy yield is a large jump for the experiment, though it\u2019s still very far off from providing a sustainable clean energy source (consider the 300 megajoules necessary to power the 2022 experiment). And that\u2019s to say nothing of building an actual fusion energy plant, and figuring out a way to produce fusion power at scale and integrate the budding technology into the world\u2019s power grid.\nThe system works via inertial confinement fusion, using 192 laser beams to compress a diamond-coated pellet the size of a peppercorn\u2014basically giving it a tiny, star-like explosion inside a golden cylinder. The laser blast occurs inside a 10-meter-wide vacuum chamber, heating the fuel to over 100 million degrees Fahrenheit and pressures hundreds of billion of times Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The team repeated the trick in 2023, and by the recent report, it seems the experiment\u2019s efficiency has only improved.\nExperts still see big roadblocks for inertial confinement as a practical energy source. That\u2019s why other teams are pursuing other means of fusion\u2014namely magnetic confinement, which uses magnetic fields to hold plasma\u2014to prove that pathway to clean energy. Other projects like ITER\u2014a massive tokamak under construction in France\u2014are attempting to generate record amounts of energy output, though they will never be part of the energy grid.\nStill, fusion\u2019s long-held reputation as a pipe dream\u2014\u201dalways 30 years away\u201d\u2014might finally be changing. The engineering problems ensnaring the field are vast, but the substantial progress of NIF is an indication of the field\u2019s momentum at a time when the world is in dire need of clean energy solutions at scale."

      "text": "CPU time\nThis article needs additional citations for verification. (July 2025) |\nCPU time (or process time) is the amount of time that a central processing unit (CPU) was used for processing instructions of a computer program or operating system. CPU time is measured in clock ticks or seconds. Sometimes it is useful to convert CPU time into a percentage of the CPU capacity, giving the CPU usage.\nMeasuring CPU time for two functionally identical programs that process identical inputs can indicate which program is faster, but it is a common misunderstanding that CPU time can be used to compare algorithms. Comparing programs by their CPU time compares specific implementations of algorithms. (It is possible to have both efficient and inefficient implementations of the same algorithm.) Algorithms are more commonly compared using measures of time complexity and space complexity.\nTypically, the CPU time used by a program is measured by the operating system, which schedules all of the work of the CPU. Modern multitasking operating systems run hundreds of processes. (A process is a running program.) Upon starting a process, the operating system records the time using an internal timer. When the process is suspended or terminated, the operating system again records the time. The total time that a process spent running is its CPU time, as shown in the figure.\nUser and System time\n[edit]The process \"accounting\" done by the Unix family of operating systems includes two components of CPU time. User time and System time reflect the fact that most programs make requests to the operating system while they execute. Input/output operations, such as reading a file or writing to the screen, are done by issuing requests to the operating system, possibly through system calls. I/O and other operations performed by the operating system on behalf of a process constitute system time.\n- User time is the amount of time the CPU is busy executing code in user space.\n- System time is the amount of time the CPU is busy executing code in kernel space. This value represents the amount of time the kernel performs work on behalf of the executing process.\nIn contrast, elapsed real time (or simply real time, or wall-clock time) is the time taken from the start of a computer program until the end as measured by an ordinary clock. Elapsed real time includes User time, System time, plus time that the process was not running for any reason, such as when its execution was preempted.\nUnix commands for CPU time\n[edit]Unix command top\n[edit]The Unix command top provides CPU time, priority, elapsed real time, and other information for all processes and updates it in real time.\nUnix command time\n[edit]The Unix command time prints CPU time and elapsed real time for the execution of a Unix command (or pipeline). Note that many command-line shells have their own implementation of this command. To run the Unix program time\n, we provide its full path, /usr/bin/time\n:\n$ gcc nextPrimeNumber.c -o nextPrimeNumber -lm\n$ /usr/bin/time ./nextPrimeNumber 300000070034\nPrime number greater than 300000070034 is 300000070043\n0.01user 0.00system 0:00.01elapsed 100%CPU\n$\nThis process took a total of 0.02 seconds of CPU time (User + System). The reported System time is 0.00 seconds, indicating that the amount of System time used was less than the printed resolution of 0.01 seconds. Elapsed real time was 0.08 seconds.\nThe following is the source code of the application nextPrimeNumber which was used in the above example.\n// nextPrimeNumber.c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <math.h>\nint isPrimeNumber(unsigned long int n) {\nunsigned long int limit = ceil(sqrt(n));\nfor (int i = 2; i <= limit ; ++i)\nif (n % i == 0) return 0;\nreturn 1;\n}\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\nunsigned long int argument = strtoul(argv[1], NULL, 10), n = argument;\nwhile (!isPrimeNumber(++n));\nprintf(\"Prime number greater than %lu is %lu\\n\", argument, n);\nreturn 0;\n}\nFunctions to get CPU time\n[edit]Modern CPUs have several clocks and counters, such as the Time Stamp Counter, the High Precision Event Timer, and the Real-time Clock, each with a specialized use. When a program wants to time its own operation, it can use a function like the POSIX clock()\nfunction, which returns the CPU time used by the program. POSIX allows this clock to start at an arbitrary value, so to measure elapsed time, a program calls clock()\n, does some work, then calls clock()\nagain.[1] The difference is the time needed to do the work.\nThe POSIX function getrusage()\nreturns more than just the CPU time consumed by a process in a POSIX environment. It returns many measurements of a process, often including approximate memory usage and Context switch (scheduling) event counts. Functionality varies across operating systems.\nTotal CPU time\n[edit]On multi-processor and multi-core machines, a program can use two or more processors simultaneously in what is called parallel processing. In such situations, a measure of total CPU time is useful, which is the sum of CPU time consumed by all of the processors utilized by the program.\nCPU time and elapsed real time\n[edit]Elapsed real time is always greater than or equal to the CPU time for computer programs which use only one CPU for processing. If no waiting occurs, such as for I/O, and the program's execution is never preempted, elapsed real time and CPU time will be virtually identical.\nCPU time and elapsed real time for parallel processing\n[edit]If a program uses parallel processing, total CPU time for that program is typically more than its elapsed real time. For a program that is able to evenly divide its work across two processors with no overhead in doing so, the value (Total CPU time)/(Number of processors) will be virtually identical to elapsed real time. Here, a processor may be a (single-core) CPU or one core in a multi-core CPU.\nExample: A software application executed on a four-core processor creates four Unix processes. If each process is able to execute on a separate processor core, computation proceeds on four processor cores simultaneously. The total CPU time would be, ideally, four times the elapsed real time.\nIn reality, parallel processing rarely achieves a linear speedup, where the amount of computation per unit time scales up with the number of processors in use. Some embarrassingly parallel problems admit such solutions, but for most, additional work is required to divide up the computation when the program starts, and to combine the results from each processor at the end. The additional work adds to the total CPU time. Frequently, a process finds itself waiting for data from another process before it can continue, which also adds to the total time.\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ See, for example, https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/CPU-Time.html\nExternal links\n[edit]- Thimmannagari, Chandra (2005-01-01).

Repeated achievement of fusion ignition at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) as part of the U.S. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship Program has also established the fundamental scientific feasibility of laser driven inertial confinement fusion as a path toward fusion energy.\nTo move from successful fusion ignition in laboratory experiments to commercial power plants, significant engineering and technical advances are needed. Stockpile stewardship experiments conducted at NIF, located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, are providing critical data that also helps to establish the technology basis for a viable development path toward laser-powered inertial fusion energy (IFE).\nLaser Fusion\nA virtually limitless energy source\nA laser fusion power plant would look different than NIF. It would use high-power lasers to create continuous fusion ignition reactions from a steady stream of targets containing hydrogen fuel pellets. These pellets, which contain the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, would be fired into the plant at a rate of about 600 per minute. The plant\u2019s lasers would precisely converge on each target, causing the fuel to ignite and give off more energy than went in. That excess energy could then be converted into a clean, abundant source of electricity when connected to the power grid. Laser fusion power plants would likely be about the size of a small football stadium, and just one could meet most of the electricity needs of a major American city."

On December 5, a team at LLNL\u2019s National Ignition Facility (NIF) conducted the first controlled fusion experiment in history to reach this milestone, also known as scientific energy breakeven, meaning it produced more energy from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it. This historic, first-of-its kind achievement will provide unprecedented capability to support NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship Program and will provide invaluable insights into the prospects of clean fusion energy, which would be a game-changer for efforts to achieve President Biden\u2019s goal of a net-zero carbon economy.\n\u201cThis is a landmark achievement for the researchers and staff at the National Ignition Facility who have dedicated their careers to seeing fusion ignition become a reality, and this milestone will undoubtedly spark even more discovery,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting our world-class scientists\u2014like the team at NIF\u2014whose work will help us solve humanity\u2019s most complex and pressing problems, like providing clean power to combat climate change and maintaining a nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.\u201d\n\u201cWe have had a theoretical understanding of fusion for over a century, but the journey from knowing to doing can be long and arduous. Today\u2019s milestone shows what we can do with perseverance,\u201d said Dr. Arati Prabhakar, the President\u2019s Chief Advisor for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\u201cMonday, December 5, 2022, was a historic day in science thanks to the incredible people at Livermore Lab and the National Ignition Facility. In making this breakthrough, they have opened a new chapter in NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship Program,\u201d said NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby. \u201cI would like to thank the members of Congress who have supported the National Ignition Facility because their belief in the promise of visionary science has been critical for our mission. Our team from around the DOE national laboratories and our international partners have shown us the power of collaboration.\u201d\n\u201cThe pursuit of fusion ignition in the laboratory is one of the most significant scientific challenges ever tackled by humanity, and achieving it is a triumph of science, engineering, and most of all, people,\u201d LLNL Director Dr. Kim Budil said. \u201cCrossing this threshold is the vision that has driven 60 years of dedicated pursuit\u2014a continual process of learning, building, expanding knowledge and capability, and then finding ways to overcome the new challenges that emerged. These are the problems that the U.S. national laboratories were created to solve.\u201d\n\u201cThis astonishing scientific advance puts us on the precipice of a future no longer reliant on fossil fuels but instead powered by new clean fusion energy,\u201d U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer said. I commend Lawrence Livermore National Labs and its partners in our nation\u2019s Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) program, including the University of Rochester\u2019s Lab for Laser Energetics in New York, for achieving this breakthrough. Making this future clean energy world a reality will require our physicists, innovative workers, and brightest minds at our DOE-funded institutions, including the Rochester Laser Lab, to double down on their cutting-edge work. That\u2019s why I\u2019m also proud to announce today that I\u2019ve helped to secure the highest ever authorization of over $624 million this year in the National Defense Authorization Act for the ICF program to build on this amazing breakthrough.\u201d\n\u201cAfter more than a decade of scientific and technical innovation, I congratulate the team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the National Ignition Facility for their historic accomplishment,\u201d said U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (CA). \u201cThis is an exciting step in fusion and everyone at Lawrence Livermore and NIF should be proud of this milestone achievement.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an historic, innovative achievement that builds on the contributions of generations of Livermore scientists. Today, our nation stands on their collective shoulders. We still have a long way to go, but this is a critical step and I commend the U.S. Department of Energy and all who contributed toward this promising breakthrough, which could help fuel a brighter clean energy future for the United States and humanity,\u201d said U.S. Senator Jack Reed (RI), the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\u201cThis monumental scientific breakthrough is a milestone for the future of clean energy,\u201d said U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (CA). \u201cWhile there is more work ahead to harness the potential of fusion energy, I am proud that California scientists continue to lead the way in developing clean energy technologies. I congratulate the scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for their dedication to a clean energy future, and I am committed to ensuring they have all of the tools and funding they need to continue this important work.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a very big deal. We can celebrate another performance record by the National Ignition Facility. This latest achievement is particularly remarkable because NIF used a less spherically symmetrical target than in the August 2021 experiment,\u201d said U.S. Representative Zoe Lofgren (CA-19). \u201cThis significant advancement showcases the future possibilities for the commercialization of fusion energy. Congress and the Administration need to fully fund and properly implement the fusion research provisions in the recent CHIPS and Science Act and likely more. During World War II, we crafted the Manhattan Project for a timely result. The challenges facing the world today are even greater than at that time. We must double down and accelerate the research to explore new pathways for the clean, limitless energy that fusion promises.\u201d\n\u201cI am thrilled that NIF\u2014the United States\u2019 most cutting-edge nuclear research facility\u2014has achieved fusion ignition, potentially providing for a new clean and sustainable energy source in the future. This breakthrough will ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile, open new frontiers in science, and enable progress toward new ways to power our homes and offices in future decades,\u201d said U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell (CA-15). \u201cI commend the scientists and researchers for their hard work and dedication that led to this monumental scientific achievement, and I will continue to push for robust funding for NIF to support advancements in fusion research.\u201d\nLLNL\u2019s experiment surpassed the fusion threshold by delivering 2.05 megajoules (MJ) of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of fusion energy output, demonstrating for the first time a most fundamental science basis for inertial fusion energy (IFE). Many advanced science and technology developments are still needed to achieve simple, affordable IFE to power homes and businesses, and DOE is currently restarting a broad-based, coordinated IFE program in the United States. Combined with private-sector investment, there is a lot of momentum to drive rapid progress toward fusion commercialization.\nFusion is the process by which two light nuclei combine to form a single heavier nucleus, releasing a large amount of energy. In the 1960s, a group of pioneering scientists at LLNL hypothesized that lasers could be used to induce fusion in a laboratory setting. Led by physicist John Nuckolls, who later served as LLNL director from 1988 to 1994, this revolutionary idea became inertial confinement fusion, kicking off more than 60 years of research and development in lasers, optics, diagnostics, target fabrication, computer modeling and simulation, and experimental design.\nTo pursue this concept, LLNL built a series of increasingly powerful laser systems, leading to the creation of NIF, the world\u2019s largest and most energetic laser system. NIF\u2014located at LLNL in Livermore, Calif.\u2014is the size of a sports stadium and uses powerful laser beams to create temperatures and pressures like those in the cores of stars and giant planets, and inside exploding nuclear weapons.\nAchieving ignition was made possible by dedication from LLNL employees as well as countless collaborators at DOE\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and Nevada National Security Site; General Atomics; academic institutions, including the University of Rochester\u2019s Laboratory for Laser Energetics, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California, Berkeley, and Princeton University; international partners, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Atomic Weapons Establishment and the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission; and stakeholders at DOE and NNSA and in Congress.\n###"

      "text": "Internship Launched a Machine-Learning Target Revolution\nKelli Humbird came to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for a summer internship in 2017 and never left.\nAt that time LLNL\u2019s Luc Peterson, taking advantage of the open science period on Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2019s Trinity Supercomputer, was creating a huge dataset and wanted to use machine learning to analyze the data (see \u201cMachine Learning Points to New Target Designs\u201d). He asked Humbird, a graduate-student summer intern with the Lab\u2019s Weapons and Complex Integration (WCI) Directorate, to see what she could learn by applying machine learning to the data.\n\u201cIt was a happy accident \u2014 I was at the right place at the right time and given the right dataset,\u201d she says. \u201cNone of us were expecting a summer project to turn into something this big.\u201d\nAccording to Peterson, the team had been trying to build a good model of the Trinity data without success for months. \u201cKelli showed up and figured it out it two weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not often that students end up being the teachers, but since the day she arrived as an intern Kelli has been instrumental in bringing these new data science techniques to not only ICF, but also the broader laboratory mission.\u201d\nHumbird trained the machine-learning model to interpolate between tens of thousands of data points generated from nine parameters like various asymmetries, drive multipliers, and gas-fill densities that affect the quality of NIF inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions.\n\u201cWe had approximately 60,000 data points, which sounds substantial, but when you consider nine-dimensional space, it\u2019s actually pretty sparsely sampled,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe wanted an algorithm that would interpolate between the points and connect the dots so we could approximate the results of simulations anywhere in the nine-dimensional space.\u201d\nTo fill in the gaps, Humbird used 80 percent of the Trinity simulations to train a machine-learning model, which was then tested on the remaining 20 percent of the data to evaluate its predictive capability. The model\u2014a random forest decision tree method\u2014accurately predicted energy yield with a less than 10 percent margin of error. With a trained machine-learning model in hand that closely mimicked the expensive physics code, Humbird began predicting implosion performance between the simulated data points to search for a robust implosion.\nA sort of topographical map of target designs began to emerge as the model filled in additional data points. The detailed topographical map indicated that areas representing egg- or football-shaped targets, known as ovoids, were plateaus of stability. Even if NIF could not create an implosion at the absolute center of the plateau, being slightly off-center would still produce a high energy yield. With a better idea of where to look, Peterson and Humbird ran a more expensive, full-scale physics simulation on the ovoid target, and their predictions were confirmed.\n\u201cThe answer was surprising,\u201d says Humbird. \u201cIt clashed with physics intuition and led us to discover a new type of physics that occurs in ICF implosions. This is a great example of what machine learning can do because it has no biases. It directed us to a design space we would not have typically considered.\u201d\nAfter puzzling over the contradictions, Peterson realized he was seeing zonal flows in the imploding egg-shaped target. Similar to a spiraling hurricane sucking up neighboring clouds, zonal flows can absorb disruptions caused by target support tents or capsule roughness and incorporate them into a larger, more stable vortex. This incorporation steadies the implosion and allows for greater energy output, the researchers concluded.\nAlong with Peterson and her thesis advisor Ryan McClarren, Humbird continued the work, which soon evolved into a Laboratory Directed Research and Development project. She became a Livermore Graduate Scholar while completing her PhD at Texas A&M and wrote her thesis on machine learning and ICF design, which LLNL design physicist Brian Spears described as \u201ca seminal work on neural networks.\u201d\n\u201cThe algorithms that Kelli developed during her thesis as a Livermore Graduate Scholar have been an enabling technology for a variety of disciplines from ICF to stockpile analysis to nuclear physics and medicine and are helping scientists around the world leverage neural networks for their research. Most recently, we have been applying these techniques to model COVID-19, helping senior decision makers plan for and respond to the pandemic,\u201d says Peterson.\nA Love of Physics and Horses\nA native of Houston, Humbird did her undergraduate and graduate studies at Texas A&M. She chose nuclear engineering as her undergraduate major, in part to support her horse hobby.\n\u201cAs a kid, I loved animals,\u201d she says. \u201cI went through a phase of being obsessed with one animal after another. Once I got to horses, I never moved on. I started riding when I was 6 and owned my first horse at the age of 16. I wanted to ensure I could always afford to have a horse in my life.\u201d\nOnce in college, she fell in love with physics after a good introductory course. This led to a double major in nuclear engineering and physics. As a graduate student, Humbird became interested in machine learning, which made her the right person for Peterson to turn to for the Trinity machine-learning project.\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t know much about inertial confinement fusion, but it\u2019s the perfect mix for me,\u201d she says.\nWhile completing her PhD, she moved to Livermore, which has proven to be the right place. The move has allowed her career to flourish at the Lab, and it\u2019s a horse-friendly town. \u201cEven though the cost of living is different, the cost to own a horse is about the same,\u201d says Humbird. \u201cIt\u2019s worked out nicely and there are so many beautiful places to ride.\u201d\nHumbird finished her PhD and became a Lab employee in 2019. She is applying machine learning tools to traditional WCI models. She\u2019s also working with the Global Security Directorate\u2019s Nuclear Forensics Group\u2019s emergency response team to build machine-learning tools for their work. And, Humbird is part of a team working on modeling for COVID-19 projects. Both projects were recently recognized with WCI Gold Awards\n\u201cThe way things have turned out for me, I feel really lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially to be a part of such cool science.\u201d\nMore Information\n\u201cMachine Learning Speeds Up and Enhances Physics Calculations,\u201d NIF & Photon Science News, October 1, 2020\n\u201cMachine Learning Points to New Target Designs,\u201d Science & Technology Review, September 2018\nOriginally published October 1, 2020\n\u2014Patricia Koning\nFollow us on Twitter: @lasers_llnl"
