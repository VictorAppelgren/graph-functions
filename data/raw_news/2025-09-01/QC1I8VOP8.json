  "title": "I'm worried the Switch 2 will be beaten by cheap PCs in less than two years",
  "description": "Nintendo's sales are safe - but how you might feel about your purchase is another matter.",
  "content": "The Switch 2 is off to a pretty glorious start. Nintendo sold over 3.5 million units in four days, and has sold over 6 million units in total since then. The console has broken multiple records, despite only having two high-profile first-party games to speak of: Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza. That means the rest of its appeal lies in playing Switch 1 games at higher framerates, and in third-party titles that were previously impossible to run, such as Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nI haven't bought a Switch 2 so far. There is a strong chance I'll get one at some point, especially with a seven-year-old in my house -- yet I'm wondering if that's going to be a smart decision, looking not just at the specs of the console, but how the PC gaming market is evolving. It's entirely possible that by 2027, the Switch 2 will be relegated to the same status its predecessor earned -- mostly good for Nintendo titles, with only a hint of the third-party games available elsewhere.\n\nFunctionally, there's nothing wrong with the Switch 2. Its 7.9-inch touchscreen is an LCD instead of an OLED panel, but it's pleasant to look at, with crisp 1080p resolution and HDR10 support. Docked, the console supports resolutions up to 4K at 60 frames per second. It also has majorly improved Joy-Cons, including mouse functions, and some welcome software changes, namely GameChat. It's finally possible to talk (and stream!) on a Nintendo console without using a phone app.\n\nMy concern is a recurring one with Nintendo: outdated performance. While the Switch 2 is massively improved over the original, its performance still sits below the Xbox Series S, released in 2020. Its CPU isn't that far ahead of 2013's PlayStation 4, let alone 2024's PlayStation 5 Pro.\n\nThe company gets away with this because most Switch games are deliberately stylized. Donkey Kong Bananza would certainly look amazing with PS5-level graphics, but because it's cartoonish, Nintendo doesn't have to bother with dense textures or polygon counts. That's just fine, in my books -- a good game is a good game, and the demand for photorealistic graphics is pushing some studios towards collapse. It takes a huge team to make a Call of Duty title look as good as it does, but most games don't pull in that kind of cash.\n\nFor now, the Switch 2 is powerful enough that it's attracting third-party games that might've otherwise been limited to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation owners. Aside from Cyberpunk, some of the ones that are out or coming soon include Elden Ring, Street Fighter 6, Borderlands 4, Civilization 7, and 007: First Light. That's not bad, considering that all of these are extremely gorgeous flagship releases.\n\nSales of third-party Switch games have proven tepid so far, though. That puts them at risk of slumping completely once the Switch 2 becomes incapable of supporting the latest and greatest. Speaking of which, we should supposedly see a new Call of Duty on Nintendo's platform at some point -- but there's no sign yet that it'll be Black Ops 7, despite that title having already been announced for other platforms. If the game comes and goes without Switch support, it may be a harbinger of dark times.\n\nAll this would be fine if the Switch 2 were arriving in similar circumstances to the Switch 1, with the portable market all to itself. But it's not, thanks to the Valve Steam Deck. The device was a surprise hit when it shipped in 2022, bringing a Switch-like convenience to PC games, including titles you'd never think would run on a handheld -- much less well. The Deck-optimized version of Cyberpunk is surprisingly fluid and sexy, even if it doesn't support effects like ray tracing.\n\nMore importantly, the Deck has spawned an entire industry of handheld PCs. Valve's biggest competition is ASUS, which already has the ROG Ally and Ally X, and is preparing Xbox versions in partnership with Microsoft. Given other companies like MSI in hot pursuit, there's a growing chance that these products are going to start pulling away Switch 2 buyers, particularly with Nintendo no longer having a giant price advantage. Yes, an $800 ROG Ally X is considerably more expensive than the Switch 2's $450, but you can get an OLED Steam Deck for $549 and save a fortune on your game library. PC titles tend to go on sale in a matter of months, whereas Nintendo rarely ever slashes prices on its first-party catalog. If you're really patient, Steam Store discounts can be steep -- sometimes as high as 80 or 90%.\n\nHandheld PC makers also seem committed to more frequent hardware refreshes than Nintendo. The Ally X shipped just a year after the original, and while there's no sign of a Steam Deck 2 yet, Valve itself has hinted that it could debut as soon as 2026. A four-year turnaround is nothing next to the eight years it took to get the Switch 2.\n\nAt a minimum, then, there will be handhelds capable of utterly annihilating the Switch 2 before any serious effort starts on its successor. PC gaming in general has also been on the upswing -- a cheap gaming laptop can be a much better buy for some households, since it'll eclipse most handhelds in performance, while doubling as tool for work and school projects. You don't need a rig with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor and an Nvidia RTX 5080 card just to play Fortnite or Grounded 2.\n\nWill handheld and laptop PCs threaten Nintendo as a company, or simply the success of the Switch 2? No, definitely not. There are already too many Switches in the wild, and you should never underestimate the value of Nintendo exclusives -- you will never see a 3D Mario or Zelda title on a third-party system. If I'm feeling a little gunshy about the Switch 2's specs, however, there are probably many other gamers in the same boat.",

      "text": "Summary\n- HDR improves color and contrast on smart TVs, making content more vibrant and detailed.\n- HDR10 provides static adjustments, while HDR10+ uses dynamic metadata to optimize the image on screen.\n- Dolby Vision is proprietary technology that rivals HDR10+, with divisions between TV manufacturers and streaming services.\nThere is no shortage of acronyms, abbreviations, and marketing terms that swirl around smart TVs, making an investment in one often a confusing and tedious process. Some terms may describe technical hardware features while other, seemingly similar terms, are actually about branding and marketing. An OLED screen is a technical consideration, but the Neo-QLED is marketing. Refresh rate is hardware, but motion rate is software.\nThe same complications arise when you look at video formatting, an important component of enjoying modern content on your smart TV. High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a crucial feature that offers more detail, color, and contrast, but the technology can get mighty confusing very quickly. Here's what you need to know.\nI'd consider these 5 specs the most before buying a smart TV\nAs a shopping savvy cinephile, here's what I look for when shopping for a new smart TV.\nWhat is HDR, or High Dynamic Range?\nThis essential technology is found on most smart TVs\nHigh Dynamic Range is a televisual technology that improves both color and contrast. When watching a TV with HDR, you'll likely notice colors are more vibrant compared to TVs that don't have HDR. Not only do colors tend to 'pop' more, but they are also more accurate and realistic.\nIn terms of contrast, HDR allows for blacks to be darker and whites to be brighter, with more noticeable detail in both extremes. Darker scenes are a bit more nuanced, with shadowing allowing you to decipher details that otherwise blur together on TVs without HDR.\nJust about every new smart TV uses HDR to improve the image, and a lot of new content is shot in HDR. Most new titles from streaming services in particular are encoded in HDR, meaning in order to enjoy the content to its fullest, you'll need an HDR-comptaible TV. HDR significantly improves upon Standard Dynamic Range (SDR), which offers limited color and brightness ranges.\n5 smart TV features that just don't matter\nNew smart TVs offer a slew of features and perks, but they are not all created equally.\nWhat is HDR10 and HDR10+?\nKey differences separate these two video formats\nHere's where things start to get confusing. HDR is a technology, and there are different types of formats of said technology. Two of the most notable HDR formats are HDR10 and HDR10+, and despite the similar names, they boast some key differences.\nHDR10 is an open standard format and free to use, so it's found on many TVs. HDR10+ is also open to use, although it requires certification from its creators, which includes Samsung and Amazon. While HDR10 makes for a good image on screen, HDR10+ is better. That's because HDR10 is static and HDR10+ is dynamic.\nJust because a TV supports HDR doesn't necessarily mean it's great at it. Screen technologies and processing power influence the extent to which HDR formats look good.\nThat means that when you're watching content with HDR10, the brightness and color set will stay the same throughout the title as the format uses static metadata. HDR10+, meanwhile, employs dynamic metadata, which means that brightness and color settings are changing throughout the title based on the needs of any given scene. Simply, HDR10+ optimizes the visual settings and adapts as needed to what's happening on TV.\nOLED, QD-OLED, LED: Modern screen technologies explained\nShopping for TVs can be confusing, so here all the technologies and marketing terms you need to know.\nWhat is Dolby Vision?\nThe top rival to HDR10+ offers some improvements\nAnother HDR format is Dolby Vision, which, like HDR10+, uses dynamic metadata to optimize the content on screen as you're watching. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ share a lot of similarities. Both offer similar peak brightness, and even though Dolby Vision can support a higher color bit depth (12-bit versus 10-bit), that slight difference doesn't really factor because most content only goes to 10-bit anyway.\nThe key difference comes down to availability. Dolby Vision is a proprietary technology made by Dolby, and requires manufacturers to pay a licensing fee to use it. Samsung, which pushed for the creation and implementation of HDR10+, does not use Dolby Vision. Competitors LG and Sony, however, do. Some models by Vizio, TCL, and Hisense will support both formats. In terms of streaming services, most popular options support both formats, though some lean in one direction more than the other. Amazon Prime Video has a lot of HDR10+ content, while Apple TV+, Paramount+ and Hulu are also boosting their HDR10+ titles. Netflix and Disney+, meanwhile, offer a lot of titles compatible with Dolby Vision.\nThe Samsung S95D is a stunning OLED model for 2024\nThe Samsung S95D is the top of the line OLED model from Samsung for 2024. It offers a dazzling image with unbeatable contrast and rich color depth.\nHow do video formats influence what TV I should buy?\nIf you watch a lot of content, the answer can get complicated\nVideo formats muddle up the process of buying a TV. The simplest approach is to make sure you buy a new smart TV that supports at least one of HDR10+ or Dolby Vision. These two formats are similar and offer the best way to watch modern content. If you're looking for a new TV to act as a main entertainment hub, and you frequently watch newer content from the top streaming services as well as major titles from big movie studios, then you'll want either of the top two formats and to avoid a TV that tops out at HDR10.\nMost new smart TVs will automatically recognize a supported video format when playing a title from physical media or a streaming service, so nothing is required from the viewer.\nDeciding between Dolby Vision and HDR10+ is more complicated. I don't know that either one should be the sole factor in determining whether you buy an LG smart TV or a Samsung one. Since most streaming services offer titles in both formats, it's also going to be hard to accurately assess which format you are likely to use more, especially if you use multiple services. It's important to know that streaming services don't necessarily want to align with one particular type of format, and many are trying to offer both as much as they can to appeal to all audiences. So, a catalog's compatibility today might change in the coming months and years.\nWhen shopping for a new smart TV, it's important to understand the differences between the main types of video formats, and the ways in which they can improve your picture. Once you know how they work, you can analyze the video formats of the content you frequently consume and find a TV that's most compatible in order to get the most out of your entertainment experience.\n7 reasons I'd buy an LG TV over a TCL TV\nBeyond impressive OLED displays, LG offers TVs to suit your lifestyle."

      "text": "Summary\n- The Nintendo Switch 2 offers a 7.9-inch 1080p display with a 120Hz refresh rate and upgraded Joy-Cons.\n- The Switch 2 can handle AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077, thanks to a more powerful chip comparable to the PS4.\n- Despite some flaws, the Switch 2 is a premium handheld option with significant improvements.\nA new Nintendo console is always exciting. From the Nintendo Entertainment System to the original Switch, each new console has brought innovative features, many of which have made Nintendo's consoles stand out from the crowd. Nintendo's latest console is something of a change from the norm, however.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is the first time that Nintendo has straight up just stuck a \"2\" on one of its consoles. A good sequel is hard to do, as anyone who has sat through Speed 2: Cruise Control will confirm, so is this another case of the sequel being worse than the original?\nThe good news, if you're a Nintendo fan, is that the company's new console is that rare case, like Terminator 2, where the sequel is even better than the original. That's not to say it's perfect, and it's certainly not Nintendo's cheapest console. I've only had my hands on it for a short time, as Nintendo didn't release any review units before launch day, but so far I've found a lot to love about the Switch 2.\n- CPU\n- Custom NVIDIA processor\n- Weight\n- 18.8oz (535.24g)\n- 4K Capability\n- Yes\n- Brand\n- Nintendo\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 features a larger 7.9-inch, 1080p LCD screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, a more powerful processor, and upgraded Joy-Cons.\n- Impressive 7.9-inch 1080p display with 120Hz refresh rate\n- Larger Joy-Cons with easy magnetic connection\n- Powerful enough to handle big AAA games\n- Battery life isn't great\n- Kickstand feels very breakable\n- Console and games are expensive\nHow we test and review products at Pocket-lint\nWe don't do arm-chair research. We buy and test our own products, and we only publish buyer's guides with products we've actually reviewed.\nPrice, availability, and specs\nThe price is high, but there's much more under the hood\nFor a long time, Nintendo has been the most affordable of the big three console manufacturers. By focusing on innovative control techniques and console formats rather than sheer power, Nintendo's consoles have usually been significantly cheaper than the standard Xbox and PlayStation models. That's all changed with the Nintendo Switch 2, which is available right now for a price of $449.99, or $499.99 for the Mario Kart World bundle, making it comparable in price to a PS5.\nYou get a lot more for your money, however. The most immediate difference is the size, with the Switch 2 featuring a 7.9-inch 1080p LCD screen, which is a significant upgrade from the 6.2-inch, 720p screen of the original Switch. The Switch 2 also has a 120Hz refresh rate, which is double the 60Hz of the first Switch. You don't just get better visuals in handheld mode, either; when docked, the Switch 2 supports 4K up to 60fps.\nThere's a lot more under the hood, too. While the original Switch is (mostly) great for first-party titles and games that aren't hugely graphically intensive, it really struggles with some games. Cyberpunk 2077, for example, was too much for the original Switch to handle, but the so-called impossible port is already available for the Switch 2. This is thanks to a custom Nvidia chip rumored to be based on the Tegra T239 processor, which would place the console on a par with the power of a PlayStation 4.\n- 4K Capability\n- Yes\n- CPU\n- Custom NVIDIA processor\n- Weight\n- 18.8oz (535.24g)\n- Brand\n- Nintendo\n- Screen\n- 7.9-inch 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution LCD, HDR, 120Hz refresh rate (4K/60fps 3840 x 2160 pixel resolution when docked)\n- Game support\n- Switch 2, Switch 2 Edition, Switch\n- Storage\n- 256GB (expandable with microSD Express cards)\n- Battery\n- 5,220mAh\n- Connectivity\n- Wi-Fi / Bluetooth\n- Ports\n- Two USB-C ports\n- Dimensions\n- 4.5 x 10.7 x 0.55-inches (272 \u00d7 116 \u00d7 13.9mm)\nWhat I liked about the Nintendo Switch 2\nSometimes bigger is better\nThe first thing that you notice about the Nintendo Switch 2 is the size. It's a lot bigger than its predecessor, with significantly more screen real estate. Playing it handheld, it feels more substantial than the original Switch, which can feel a little fragile. The Switch 2 is inevitably a little heavier, but when playing long handheld sessions, I didn't notice it feeling heavy at any point.\nBigger isn't always better, but in the case of the Switch 2, it really is. For me, this is where the Switch 2 shines. With the new dark Joy-Cons that match the console, and the more substantial size and weight, the Switch 2 feels like a premium handheld, leaving the original Switch looking and feeling more like a glorified toy.\nI've never found myself wishing that Nintendo had gone for an OLED instead.\nThe larger screen looks great despite being LCD rather than OLED, and it's a significant upgrade over the original Switch. While an LCD screen with HDR support is never going to completely match an OLED display, when I've been playing handheld, I've never found myself wishing that Nintendo had gone for an OLED instead.\nThe Joy-Cons are also a big improvement. The magnetic attachment is so much easier than the rails on the original Switch. I've lost hours of my life trying to disconnect the straps from my original Switch Joy-Cons (that I need to use, because kids), which often refuse to move despite the button being held down.\nRemoving the straps from the Switch 2 Joy-Cons was genuinely an enormous relief, as they popped off effortlessly when pressing the release button. The Joy-Cons feel sturdier than the originals, but it remains to be seen whether they will succumb to the same Joy-Con drift that plagues the originals.\nPlaying docked, you get less of a sense that you're playing on a new console. The 4K visuals are an improvement, but they're not as in-your-face as the much-improved display when playing handheld. The Switch 2 Pro Controller also doesn't feel like a huge upgrade, and I'm not sure why Nintendo opted to make parts of it light gray, but it's still my favorite way to play docked.\nExperiencing Nintendo Switch Joy-Con drift? How to fix it yourself\nThere's been a lot of talk about Nintendo Switch Joy-Con drift, but what is it? And, if you're experiencing it, what can you do about it?\nWhat I didn't like about the Nintendo Switch 2\nEvolution, not revolution\nWhile Nintendo has fallen behind its rivals in terms of the sheer power of its consoles, it's always made up for in terms of innovation. Revolutionary ideas such as the motion controls of the Wii and the console-handheld hybrid design of the original Switch are what have set Nintendo devices apart. The Switch 2 does add new mouse controls to the Joy-Cons, but otherwise, it doesn't feel like there's anything ground-breaking in the Switch 2.\nNintendo estimates the battery life to be between 2 and 6.5 hours, and in my limited experience so far, the Switch 2 has been falling closer to the lower end of those estimates.\nIt's telling that this is Nintendo's first major console sequel. The GameCube could never have been the \"N64 2\" because the two consoles were just so different. The Switch 2 is obviously an upgraded version of the original Switch, and after the major innovations of the previous few consoles, it feels like a bit of a shame that there's nothing really new about it.\nAnother disappointment is the battery life. The upgraded and larger display and the more powerful hardware will inevitably require more power. Nintendo estimates the battery life to be between 2 and 6.5 hours, and in my limited experience so far, the Switch 2 has been falling closer to the lower end of those estimates. It's not horrific, but don't expect to get the same battery life that you got out of the original Switch. That said, the addition of a USB-C port on the top of Switch 2, as well as the bottom, means that you can easily play in tabletop mode while connected to power.\nThe new kickstand is a big improvement on the old one, allowing you to adjust the angle of tilt, but it does feel a little flimsy, making me nervous every time I pop it out. According to the Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, it's made from an aluminum alloy that's used in planes and spacecraft, but I still feel like I'm going to snap it every time I pop it out, and I'm seriously worried about what my kids will do to it.\nThe Switch 2 is on track to outsell every PC gaming handheld ever made\nSorry, Steam Deck, it seems the Switch 2 is the handheld of choice.\nShould you buy the Nintendo Switch 2?\nIt's a tougher question if you already own a Switch\nIf you don't own a Switch, or a handheld PC, then the Nintendo Switch 2 is definitely worth considering. It's a joy to play handheld, looks beautiful, and can handle far more games than the original Switch could. There are plenty of games on the horizon, such as Donkey Kong Bonanza and Metroid Prime 4, that you won't be able to play on any other device, including the original Switch. So far, I've found a lot to love about the Switch 2, with only a few complaints.\nIf you already own a Switch, is there enough to the Switch 2 to make it worth upgrading? At the current price and with the current line-up of games, that's a tough call. If you play docked, you're probably not going to notice a mind-blowing difference in terms of performance when you're playing games like Mario Kart. If you play handheld a lot, then upgrading is a much easier sell.\nMario Kart World aside, there aren't currently many huge games available that you can't already play on your old Switch. However, as more titles are released, the urge to upgrade is sure to get more tempting. If you do bite the bullet, opt for the Mario Kart World bundle, as the game is an absolute blast, and you'll save yourself $30 compared to buying it separately.\nThis device was provided to Pocket-lint by Nintendo.\nYour comment has not been saved\n- 4K Capability\n- Yes\n- CPU\n- Custom NVIDIA processor\n- Weight\n- 18.8oz (535.24g)\n- Brand\n- Nintendo\nNintendo's Switch 2 features a more powerful chip, a higher resolution screen, and upgraded Joy-Cons.\n4 reasons I'm getting a Switch 2 instead of a new Steam Deck\nHandheld PCs are still best for some people, but it's hard to ignore the draw of a new Switch.\nYour comment has not been saved"

Given the Switch's runaway success, this strategy makes a lot of sense. With all of this in mind, here's a breakdown of all the key differences between the Switch and the Switch 2 that we know about so far, including details surrounding specs, pricing, availability, design, and more.\n$450 Nintendo Switch 2 drops June 5, Preorders available April 9\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, with preorders for the highly anticipated console beginning on April 9.\nThere's still a lot we don't know about the Switch 2. As information appears, this story will be updated, including the spec sheet below.\nPrice, specs, and availability\nThis is the upgrade you've been waiting for\n-\nNintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Switch 4K Capability Yes No Brand Nintendo Nintendo Screen 7.9-inch 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution LCD, HDR, 120Hz refresh rate (4K/60fps 3840 x 2160 pixel resolution when docked) 6.2-inch 1280 x 720 pixel resolution LCD (720p in handheld / 1080p when docked) Game support Switch 2, Switch 2 Edition, Switch Switch Storage 256GB (microSD Express cards) 64GB (expandable with microSD) CPU custom NVIDIA processor Nvidia Tegra X1 Battery 5,220mAh 4,310mAh Connectivity Wi-Fi / Bluetooth Wi-Fi / Bluetooth Ports Two USB-C ports USB-C (dockable to TV) Dimensions 4.5 x 10.7 x 0.55-inches (272 \u00d7 116 \u00d7 13.9mm) 4 x 9.5 x 0.55-inches Weight 18.8oz (535.24g) 14oz (398g) Audio Unknown Stereo speakers / Bluetooth / 3.5mm headphone jack RAM Unknown 4GB LPDDR4\nNintendo's Switch launched on March 3rd, 2017 for $300. The Switch 2 will release on June 5th (with pre-orders launching on April 9th) for $450. Like the original Switch, the Switch 2 comes with a dock, a set of Joy-Cons (now called the Joy-Con 2), and likely a Joy-Con Grip (this still isn't confirmed).\nWhile the Switch 2 features a 7.9-inch 1080p LCD display (we don't know the specific resolution yet), the Switch's screen comes in at a 6.2-inch 720p LCD display (1,280 x 720 pixel resolution). Unlike the Switch OLED model, Nintendo didn't opt for an OLED display with the Switch 2. That said, handheld's LCD display supports HDR and up to a 120fps refresh rate. When docked, the original Switch can push out 1080p visuals with some titles. On the other hand, the Switch 2 is able to handle 4K/60fps (it's unclear how many titles will support 4K/60fps, however).\nThere's a built-in fan in the dock to keep the Switch 2 cool, too (it costs $109 if you want an extra one). The dock includes a USB-C port for power, an HDMI port, two USB-A 2.0 ports, and an Ethernet plug.\nThe Switch 2 features 256GB of internal storage, a substantial increase from the 32GB the original Switch offered. The new handheld has two USB-C ports this time, including one on the top and one on the bottom, instead of the lone USB-C port the original Switch offered. This will make it easier to plug accessories into the Switch 2, including the new Switch 2 Camera. Unlike the original Switch, the Switch 2 is only compatible with faster microSD Express cards and not standard microSD cards, so you'll likely need to buy a new microSD card to expand the handheld's storage.\nHere's where we get into a lot of the unknowns. It's safe to assume that the Switch 2 features a far more powerful chip than the original Switch's now ancient Nvidia Tegra X1 processor, but we don't know what it is yet. The Switch featured 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, but it's currently unclear how much RAM the Switch 2 offers. We also don't know how long the Switch 2's battery will last or how big it is. The original Switch lasted between 4.5 - 9 hours and measured in at 4,310 mAh.\nDesign and build\nThe Switch 2 and Switch are the same, but different\nThe Switch 2 looks a lot like the original Switch, only slightly larger, with a size that's more in line with the Steam Deck and ROG Ally X. This also extends to its Joy-Cons, which attach magnetically instead of \"switching\" into place like with the Switch. The Switch 2's Joy-Con 2 lock to the console with powerful magnets. The inward-facing ZR and ZL buttons are used to detach the controllers from the Switch 2. Inside the magnetic slot is orange and blue plastic, giving the Switch 2's gray exterior a much-needed dash of vibrancy. These same colors also appear as a ring around both Joy-Con 2 joysticks. The familiar JoyCon Charging Grip returns as well.\nThe Joy-Con 2 can also be used like a computer mouse by placing its inner edge flat on a surface.\nThere's a new \"C Button\" on the Joy-Con 2 that allows players to access a Discord-like \"GameChat\" menu to take advantage of the Switch 2's built-in mic and camera ($49). It's unclear if a headset will also be available or if the Switch 2 will work with any microphone. Either way, it's great to see Nintendo finally embrace voice chat even through the company is roughly 20 years late. GameChat also allows you to share live game feeds with your friends, though the footage shown off during Nintendo's reveal event was very choppy. It's unclear if a headset will also be available or if the Switch 2 will work with any microphone. Finally, the Joy-Con 2 can also be used like a computer mouse by placing its inner edge flat on a surface.\nThough the Switch 2's dock looks very similar to the Switch's, it's far more rounded and features a built-in fan. The handheld's dock is more adjustable and folds out from the back of the Switch 2's as a thin bar. On the other hand, the Switch's stand couldn't move much and shifted out from the rear of the console in a more substantial way (the Switch OLED model's dock had far more range to it).\nWhile the Switch 2's cartridges are the same size as the Switch's, they're red instead of black/gray (it's unclear if they'll also taste bad). Along with the Joy-Con 2, Nintendo has confirmed it will release a new Pro Controller ($79) with additional rear buttons, a 3.5mm headphone jack with pass-through audio, and, of course, the new C Button.\n$450 Nintendo Switch 2 drops June 5, Preorders available April 9\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, with preorders for the highly anticipated console beginning on April 9.\nGet ready for Mario Kart World\nThe Switch 2 works with Switch and Switch 2 titles\nThankfully, the Switch 2 will still be able to play physical and digital original Switch games. During its recent reveal event, Nintendo confirmed that Mario Kart World, an open world, Diddy Kong Racing-like take on the long-running kart racer, will be available at launch and as a pack-in title option. Another key exclusive is the Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a game designed to show off the new console (strangely, it's set to be sold separately digitally).\nNintendo revealed Nintendo Switch 2 Edition versions of original Switch titles, including The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and more. These games will feature enhanced visuals, better frame rates, and new features (specific performance upgrades aren't known yet). Several third-party games were also revealed, including Hades II, Elden Ring, Split Fiction, and Hogwarts Legacy. Check out this story for a complete list of upcoming Switch 2 titles.\nAll 54 games that were just announced for the Nintendo Switch 2\nNintendo just streamed its big Switch 2 hybrid console showcase - here are all the games we now know to be coming to the company's next-gen device."

      "text": "Summary\n- An OLED Steam Deck offers better display technology, improved battery life, and enhanced ergonomics.\n- OLED models have longer battery life thanks to better efficiency and larger storage options.\n- The LCD Steam Deck is cheaper and provides value, but OLED is the better choice for serious gamers.\nEven Valve may be surprised by the success of the Steam Deck. The company was always hoping to make money, of course, but the Deck has become so popular that there's now a burgeoning PC handheld industry, Valve's main competition being the ASUS ROG Ally. Both Microsoft and Sony are believed to be working on inspired handhelds, although Microsoft has never produced one before, and Sony's last standalone device -- the PlayStation Vita -- was discontinued in 2019.\nIf you're interested in getting a Deck, you've got two main options: the original LCD model from 2022, or the Steam Deck OLED, launched in November 2023. Which one should you get if you're new to handheld gaming PCs?\nHow to turn a Steam Deck into a TV gaming console\nYou can play PC games on your TV without buying a desktop or laptop.\nWhat are the advantages of the Steam Deck OLED?\nBetter display technology\nThis is the obvious one. OLED delivers superior contrast, including true blacks, since the technology can shut off individual pixels. All LCDs require some sort of backlight, which remains visible even in pitch-black game scenes.\nGraphics really \"pop\" on the OLED Deck.\nOLED also improves color output and brightness, including support for HDR (high dynamic range) in compatible games. Whereas the LCD product's brightness hovers around 400 nits, the OLED model starts at 600 nits and peaks at 1,000 with HDR. Simply put, graphics really \"pop\" on the OLED Deck in a way that's difficult to convey through screenshots.\nBlack Ops 6 sets new records for GamePass, Steam, and more\nExcitement couldn't have been higher for Black Ops 6, which was released last week and immediately set new day one and opening weekend sales records on both PlayStation and Steam, which saw sales jump 60% when compared with last year's Modern Warfare III. In addition, the game's day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass led the subscription service to its biggest single day of new signups, ever. This success for Game Pass specifically comes at a critical time as subscriptions have been floundering and the longevity of the service has been called into question in recent months, especially as Sony continues to increase its lead in the console wars. You can check out Pocket-Lint's review of Black Ops 6 at the link, and then let us know what you think of this new title in the comments below! Have you been playing? If so, what console are you playing on?\nThere are some other display improvements in tow. The OLED's screen is slightly bigger, measuring 7.4 inches instead of 7, and sports a smoother 90Hz refresh rate instead of 60. These things aren't noticeable in most situations, however, so they shouldn't factor much into your shopping.\nLonger battery life\nThe OLED Deck uses a 50 watt-hour (Wh) battery, slightly larger than the 40Wh one in its predecessor. On top of that, the device is more power efficient, thanks to both OLED and a streamlined 6nm AMD processor, shrunk down from 7nm.\nThe result is between three and twelve hours of battery life, depending on how hard that AMD chip is working. It might not sound like much next to your smartphone, but the LCD Deck is capped at two to eight hours. On a long trip, you'll need to plug in an LCD Deck more frequently.\nThe simple trick I use to add PlayStation games to my ROG Ally and Steam Deck\nSony has limited remote play on handheld gaming devices, but a simple fix will let you play your Playstation favorites on the go.\nImproved ergonomics, repairs, and heat\nThe OLED model is a little lighter, and uses refined buttons, sticks, trackpads, and touch technology for the sake of responsiveness and durability. There are a number of internal design changes as well, but mostly to simplify mods and repairs -- you don't have to remove the rear cover to replace the display, for instance.\nI say \"mostly\" because the newer design also runs cooler. There's a better thermal module, which combined with reduced power consumption means there's less hot air blasting out the vent.\nProtect your Steam Deck OLED from drop damage with these cases\nProtect your Steam Deck OLED with the best cases designed to defend against drops, scratches, and general wear & tear.\nLarger storage options\nThere used to be more storage tiers for the LCD Deck, but unless you can find something used, the only one still available is 256GB. That should be plenty for most gamers, mind, since you can always expand storage with an SD card.\nOLED units are sold in 512GB or 1TB capacities. Given what I said about SD cards, the 1TB version is probably overkill, but you do get some additional perks. It's equipped with an anti-glare display, and comes bundled with a second, smaller carrying case that still fits inside the standard one.\nThat's useful if you're just taking your Deck to work or a friend's house, rather than trying to make it through airport security.\nUpdated connectivity\nOLED models feature a dedicated Bluetooth 5.3 antenna. In most situations, the upgrade from Bluetooth 5.0 won't matter, but using a separate antenna should fix reliability when connecting multiple controllers.\nWi-Fi, meanwhile, gets an update from Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) to Wi-Fi 6E. That could speed up downloads if you have a router equipped with either Wi-Fi 6 or 6E.\nBluetooth 6.0 features better tracking and precision -- but what else does it do?\nThe Bluetooth Special Interest Group has announced an update that will help bring tracking accuracy down to centimeters.\nWhy would you get an LCD Steam Deck?\nIt's all about value\nThe LCD Deck is substantially cheaper. At $399, it's $150 less than the base OLED, and a full $250 below the 1TB model. Those savings won't matter to some people, but they could be enough to buy multiple games and maybe even an accessory. There's little reason to get a Deck if you don't have the budget to buy something from the Steam Store.\nThere's nothing radically different in the OLED experience.\nIf you're willing to shop around, you can find used LCD models for amazing prices. Some people will deliberately hunt down 64GB units, hoping to swap in their own storage for an affordable upgrade. As I mentioned, that could be as simple as inserting an SD card.\nAbove all, there's nothing radically different in the OLED experience. Its AMD chip is more efficient, and paired with low-latency RAM, but you're not going to get an extra ten frames per second in Elden Ring or Indiana Jones. It's just a refinement of the Deck concept, fixing some issues while keeping the product relevant until the inevitable Steam Deck 2 a year or two from now.\nSteam Deck 2: Everything we know so far\nSure, there's Steam Deck OLED, an upgrade over the original Steam Deck. But there's also a Steam Deck 2 on the horizon. Here's everything we know.\nShould you get an LCD or OLED Steam Deck?\nThink twice before pulling the trigger on OLED\nIf you're a serious gamer, and you've got the cash for it, you should definitely pick the OLED model. It may not have any meaningful performance improvements, but once you've seen the colors and contrast its screen is capable of, it's tough to go back to LCD. For some gamers, extended battery life may be an even bigger deal -- there's no better way to pass a cross-country flight than playing something like Balatro or Vampire Survivors.\nIf you're a serious gamer, and you've got the cash for it, you should definitely pick the OLED model.\nValve's other changes have a cumulative effect. While you might not immediately notice things like grippier analog sticks, 90Hz refresh rates, or improved touch response, the OLED model simply feels like a slicker product, as if it was what the company always intended. It's an overall quality-of-life upgrade.\nThat said, the LCD Deck is still loads of fun, and delivers some fantastic value if you want something closer in price to a Nintendo Switch. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with it -- the OLED model is just better. In fact, if you're planning to leave your Deck plugged into a TV or monitor most of the time, you should probably go the LCD route and put the money you save towards Valve's official dock.\nThis insanely powerful gaming handheld is way better than a Steam Deck\nThe ROG Ally X is the best handheld gaming device on the market, but is it totally worth its high price tag."

      "text": "Summary\n- Handheld PCs offer superior physical convenience and streamlined software.\n- They also have a much lower entry price compared to gaming laptops.\n- Gaming laptops provide maximum fidelity, more connectivity options, and wider software compatibility.\nIt shows my age, but when I was growing up, there was only one option for PC gaming -- a full-sized desktop tower, sometimes costing over $2,000. Even then, console games sometimes looked and played better, though, of course, your NES or SNES couldn't switch from Mario to your homework. Going portable meant buying a GameBoy or a Game Gear, instead.\nNow, we not only have reasonably affordable gaming laptops, but also handheld PCs modeled after the Nintendo Switch. It's entirely possible to play games like No Man's Sky or Cyberpunk 2077 on your couch, not just at a desk. But which route should you take if you're new to PC gaming, and/or wanting the best experience for your money?\nWhat's inside your laptop? Why your battery type matters\nThere's only one you'll see (or want) in most laptops.\nWhat are the advantages of a handheld PC?\nSuperior physical convenience\nNaturally, the greatest advantage of a handheld PC is portability. Though products like the ASUS ROG Ally are substantially larger than a Switch, they're still a lot lighter and smaller than a laptop. You can stash one in a bag or suitcase without much trouble. When you're at home, it's easy to take your gaming from room to room, especially if you have multiple USB-C chargers with enough wattage.\nHandhelds are a lot lighter and smaller than any laptop.\nThe convenience extends beyond that, though. All handhelds have built-in gamepad controls, which means you don't have to connect to separate controllers. You can still do that, but there's freedom in not having to carry a mouse or Xbox controller with you. You can also expect handhelds to include touchscreens, and some models may have small trackpads to (kind of) replicate the precision of a mouse.\nThe simple trick I use to add PlayStation games to my ROG Ally and Steam Deck\nSony has limited remote play on handheld gaming devices, but a simple fix will let you play your Playstation favorites on the go.\nStreamlined software\nWhile quality varies, most handhelds are going to offer some sort of streamlined overlay interface that makes it simpler to launch games and tweak settings. That's often by necessity -- Windows and Linux aren't easy to use on a 7-inch screen -- but the result is convenience closer to a dedicated console. If you're new to PC games, handhelds may be a smoother on-ramp.\nIf you're new to PC games, handhelds may be a smoother on-ramp.\nIf you want the smoothest possible experience, the Valve Steam Deck may be the way to go. SteamOS is custom-tailored for gaming, so there's little chance of an error message, and no need to fiddle with settings unless you want to. You have to reboot a Deck to access its desktop interface. The biggest drawback is that, by default, you're limited to apps you download from the Steam Store -- you'll have to jump through hoops to install from sources like the Epic Games Store, or use a Deck for work tasks. Plus, games bundled with anti-cheat apps tend not to work well or at all.\nThis insanely powerful gaming handheld is way better than a Steam Deck\nThe ROG Ally X is the best handheld gaming device on the market, but is it totally worth its high price tag.\nA much lower entry price\nA 256GB LCD Steam Deck costs $400, which is ridiculously good value. Even upgraded handhelds can be affordable, though -- for $650, you can get an OLED Deck with 1TB of storage, and the more powerful ROG Ally X is still just $800.\nWith gaming laptops, $1,000 tends to be considered on the \"cheaper\" end. Sometimes, you can find decent models for less if you're willing to stick with 1080p resolution, but if you want a laptop that'll still stay relevant for a while, you may end up paying closer to $2,000 or more. Gaming laptops are inherently more expensive than equivalent desktops.\nHow I turned my Apple TV 4K into a retro gaming powerhouse\nThe Apple TV 4K is a surprisingly competent gaming machine.\nWhat are the advantages of a gaming laptop?\nMaximum fidelity and performance\nWhile the all-in-one processors on handhelds are impressive, you'll never get the best possible visual experience with them. Dedicated CPUs and graphics chips will always be faster, in some cases enabling things like ray tracing and 4K resolution. The most intense 3D games may run slowly on a handheld, if they run at all, although hits like Cyberpunk and Elden Ring do surprisingly well.\nSpeaking of resolution, it's rare to find a handheld with a screen (much) over 7 inches, whereas gaming laptops tend to start at twice that size and grow from there. That usually makes the laptop experience more immersive, although you can get around that by connecting a handheld to a TV or monitor.\nHow to turn a Steam Deck into a TV gaming console\nYou can play PC games on your TV without buying a desktop or laptop.\nMore connectivity options\nThe size of handhelds restricts their port options -- it's a miracle to find one with more than one or two USB-C ports, an SD card slot, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Better gaming laptops tend to have several additional ports, for example supporting HDMI, USB-A, Thunderbolt, and/or Ethernet. A handheld's Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radios don't fully compensate.\nA laptop is a lot easier to connect to a TV or use as a workstation. You can do both with a handheld, to be clear, but you'll need a first- or third-party docking station. As a result, a handheld workstation risks becoming a sea of cables and add-on peripherals, depending on how much you're trying to accomplish.\nThe Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro's macros make it great for work and gaming\nThe Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro is a catch-all performance keyboard that transitions perfectly from work to play.\nWider software compatibility\nArguably, this is the biggest advantage of gaming laptops. Since they offer better performance, larger screens, and built-in keyboards, they work properly with a larger number of games and productivity apps right out of the box. Personally, it would take a significant amount of time and effort to create a handheld setup I'd feel comfortable using for writing, assuming I could even get all the apps I depend on. With my laptop, I've been able to work out of hotel rooms and coffee shops with minimal effort.\nSince gaming laptops offer better performance, larger screens, and built-in keyboards, they support a larger number of games and productivity apps.\nGames often need to be specifically optimized for handhelds, including controls and performance. When they're not, the results can be choppy framerates and mislabeled interfaces, if a game functions in the first place.\nThe best mechanical keyboards for work and play\nLooking for hot-swappable switches, customizable actuation points, and other premium features? Check out our top picks.\nShould you get a handheld or a laptop for portable PC gaming?\nIt's all about intent and budget\nIf you've already got some sort of PC, or you don't need one, I'd strongly suggest trying out a handheld.\nIt's hard to ignore their convenience and price-to-performance ratio, especially if you don't have a large budget. In some situations, they can open up new possibilities -- I sometimes play Balatro or Vampire Survivors while hanging out with my wife, and I know that new parents will sometimes use handhelds in between feedings and diaper changes. I'm actually looking forward to bringing my Steam Deck on my next flight, whereas traveling with my 17-inch Razer laptop is a nightmare.\nRazer's new configuration for the BlackWidow V4 Pro is game-changing\nRazer has released the 75% configuration version of their BlackWidow V4 Pro, and it's finally wireless.\nA laptop is best if you've got a budget well over $1,000, and \"portable\" doesn't mean more than moving from one desk to another. Gaming laptops are typically thick and heavy, while also being massive power hogs. You may be lucky to get two or four hours on a laptop's battery power, which is terrible next to the three to 12 hours from a Steam Deck OLED. Assume you'll be plugging in a laptop whenever possible.\nYou should automatically prefer a laptop if you don't have a PC and need something that does it all. As I said, you can make a handheld the heart of a workstation, but it's less than ideal for that, particularly if you're unable (or unwilling) to bring a dock and peripherals with you for work on the road."
