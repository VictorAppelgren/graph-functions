      "feedback": "Actionable edit notes (core to lift to world-class quality): rebuild the piece into a single, cohesive causal chain anchored in the four source IDs, so every claim ties to a specific driver (RHXDOHQQX for the truce guardrails; OATKNJQ0E/NOTMRPS8C for regime framing; CGLLF2OES/65UUBU0OR for sector/company implications); tighten redundancy by collapsing repeated sentences into one clear arc: 90-day tariff pause lowers policy uncertainty and inflation pass-through, preserves optionality for a longer-term deal, which in turn shapes risk premia and discount rates; explicitly structure as a formal multi‑scenario framework (Base Regime A with 30% baseline tariffs and ~15% Nvidia revenue share; Regime B if export controls tighten and China leverages more; add a tail risk if escalation re-emerges) with explicit triggers; quantify implications using the sources’ numbers (Ford EV losses ~1.3B, adjusted op margin ~4.3%, ROIC ~10%, Ford dividend ~5%, forward P/E ~8–10x; Nvidia licensing ~15% revenue share); map these to macro outcomes (inflation pass-through) and to market/flows (risk assets vs headwinds from licensing/auto sensitivity); align with SECTION FOCUS by weaving macro, policy, flows/positioning, and valuation/technicals into a single framework and clearly stating how each channel transmits to assets; craft a concise 3–4 signal watch-list with triggers (e.g., extension status beyond 90 days, Nvidia licensing outcome, export-control developments, Ford Q3 results) and concrete implications; tighten citations so every factual assertion is tied to an ID and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., NOTMRPS8C’s regime default vs the base-case framing); remove all redundancies, improve prose for readability, and present the final piece within the stated length/format constraints.",
