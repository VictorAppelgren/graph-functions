      "feedback": "The draft is on‑target for the SPX but needs tighter sourcing and a few clarifications:  \n\n1. **Add inline citations** for every factual claim:  \n   - The 0.7 % slip to 6,457.34 and the 89 % September‑cut odds → (97MD1FHW8).  \n   - Core PCE 0.3 % rise and its 2.9 % threshold → (3YAQ8JUPL).  \n   - 10‑year yield at 4.23 % → (97MD1FHW8).  \n   - Tariff ruling on China, Mexico, Canada → (3952FOSRQ).  \n   - Marvell/Dell weak results → (3YAQ8JUPL).  \n   - Fed’s policy‑rate cut expectation → (97MD1FHW8).  \n   - 6,500‑level resistance and 6,400‑level support → cite either (97MD1FHW8) or (3YAQ8JUPL) if they mention those levels.  \n   - Fed’s dovish stance and yield‑impact on equity valuations → (97MD1FHW8).  \n   - Potential tariff re‑implementation and core PCE > 2.9 % invalidation → (3952FOSRQ) and (3YAQ8JUPL).  \n   - Upcoming Fed minutes, core PCE release, tariff announcements, earnings calendar → cite (97MD1FHW8) for minutes, (3YAQ8JUPL) for earnings, and (3952FOSRQ) for tariffs.  \n\n2. **Remove or re‑phrase any generic statements** that lack a source, e.g., “lifting the SPX toward its 6,500‑level benchmark that has been a key resistance” – add a citation or drop the specific level.  \n\n3. **Keep the focus tight**: every sentence should explicitly tie back to SPX, UST10Y, or DXY. Avoid mentioning unrelated policy details unless they directly influence the SPX.  \n\n4. **Formatting**: use the canonical handle names (SPX, ust10y, dxy) and keep the paragraph concise (≤ 120 words).  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the acceptance gate: ≥ 1 canonical handle with sign/magnitude, and a dated catalyst window (e.g., “Tariff ruling on 2025‑08‑29” and “Core PCE release on 2025‑08‑29”).",
