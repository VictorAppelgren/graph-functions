  "title": "Curiosity Is Valuable In The Age Of AI",
  "description": "Curiosity drives innovation and helps us harness AI thoughtfully, asking better questions to shape learning, work, and future progress.",
  "content": "We know that as artificial intelligence advances rapidly, there\u2019s a profound reshuffling of priorities, conventions in life and business, and in what we know about our world. So what is valuable right now as we witness the technology running on an exponential trajectory? How do we navigate a world that changes so fast?\n\nSome of the people at MIT have talked quite a lot about the value of creativity today. But there\u2019s another component to our human mindset that can help us make the most of what we have discovered as AI evolves. That\u2019s curiosity.\n\nIn the past, some business strategies were driven by having a \u201cgrowth mindset.\u201d And we can still talk about scaling, but before that happens, we need that spark that initiates a move forward. We need a \u201ccuriosity mindset.\u201d\n\nBy being curious, we are better able to harness AI in the right ways and confidently integrate the technology into our lives, in deliberate ways, not just passively. When we work to understand how things function, and what the likely outcomes are, we empower ourselves to succeed with the powerful new tools at our disposal.\n\nAt about the enduring value of curiosity for lifetime learners:\n\n\u201cFrom an early age, questioning emerges naturally,\u201d Geraghty writes. \u201cToddlers famously pepper their caregivers with endless \"whys?\"\u2014inquiring about everything from why the sky is blue to why bedtime comes so early. But early questioning hints at a valuable lifelong tool: curiosity, an innate desire to explore and better understand the world around them. As we get older, the questions don\u2019t stop. We explore new ideas in classrooms, our homes, and the world around us. We thrive on discovering and learning. In today\u2019s modern workplace, honing that skill is essential.\u201d\n\nGeraghty gives us four examples of questions to use, to ask those \u201cwhys\u201d about AI:\n\n\u201cHow can AI help us to understand and meet teaching and learning needs more effectively?\n\n In what ways can AI contribute to a more equitable and inclusive workplace?\n\n What role should AI play in improving engagement and outcomes?\n\n How can we best prepare students for the workforce of the future?\u201d\n\nThis type of process, she suggests, can clarify the role of AI in our world.\n\n\u201cBy asking questions, we begin a journey of learning and discovery, and ultimately personal and professional growth,\u201d Geraghty adds. \u201cUsing curiosity as a tool means not just asking questions, but asking the right questions. It means understanding the problem you are trying to solve and creating the questions to get to the core, layer by layer.\u201d\n\nDebbie Douglas is the Senior Director of Collections and the Curator of Science and Technology at the MIT Museum, a marvelous repository of physical items, materials and artifacts that tell a story of continual innovation and yes, the curiosity of humans over the last few generations. I\u2019ve produced some of her talks before, as she\u2019s active in fostering conversation about our shared world here at MIT.\n\nDouglas has been involved since 1999, and the museum has evolved quite a lot over that time. In a talk around the institution\u2019s history, Douglas stresses the role of curiosity in innovation, noting that there\u2019s been a lot of change over the years.\n\n\u201cWhen I first walked in, and took a look around, my sense was \u2013 what a diamond in the rough!\u201d she said.\n\nDouglas went over the contributions of some early figures like the founding director, Warren Seamans, and the first MIT president, William Bart Rogers, in developing these historical resources.\n\n\u201cHe felt that there needed to be a place at the institute where students could learn from objects,\u201d she said of the latter leader, \u201clearning how to experiment with instruments, to re-examine the world, and our museum, I think, most wholly embraces that vision.\u201d\n\nThere are powerful stories at the MIT museum for those who are curious enough to access them.\n\n\u201cWe can tell an unbelievable story about the history of science, technology, engineering and education in the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are thing that people made, that people used, these are things that changed people\u2019s lives, and so for us, it\u2019s just a privilege to be able to share these materials.\u201d\n\nIn pointing out how her office works with others across the MIT community, Douglas described the motivations for doing this kind of curation and archival work.\n\n\u201cWe do it because we think that the past has insight for us in the present \u2013 and \u2026 that it\u2019s a resource for us to make a better future,\u201d she said. \u201c(The museum) ought to be a place where people can come in and discover new things, learn new things, experiment, have conversations, engage with each other.\u201d\n\nAnd this ability, she added, shouldn\u2019t just be restricted to students of MIT.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re for everyone,\u201d she said of the collections. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a member of the MIT community \u2013 you just have to be insanely curious about our world, and want to know the answer to the most basic question: why?\u201d\n\nThat one word echoes what Geraghty and others have to say about lifetime learning \u2013 that we should always have this question on our minds. Yes, the \u201chow\u201d is intriguing, and the \u201cwhen\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d are practical, but the \u201cwhy\u201d of AI gets to the heart of how we view ourselves and our world as we reckon with change.",
