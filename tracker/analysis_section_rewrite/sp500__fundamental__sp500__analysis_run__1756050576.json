      "feedback": "This draft is on the right multi‑year track but needs a tighter, more defensible world‑class framework. Actionable edits: (1) embed explicit first‑principles anchors and regime map tailored to Ford’s sector: structural auto economics (high fixed costs, capital intensity, slow unit growth), EV margin burn and capex cadence, and a policy/financing regime (tariffs, rates) that acts as a transition trigger. Ground these with concrete numbers from the sources (Q2 EV loss of $1.3B; EV capex up to $50B through 2026; EV spend deferral of up to $12B; forward P/E around 10; dividend yield ~5%; ROIC ~10% and margin ~4.3% in Q2). Then spell out invariant anchors (e.g., forward ROIC vs WACC, EV vs ICE mix, and cash‑flow resilience under recession) and define regimes: (A) cyclical expansion with modest EV profitability, (B) EV profitability inflection, (C) policy/tariff shock, (D) demand downturn/stagnation. (2) Clarify the causal chain from macro conditions to market pricing: demand cycle --> volumes/mix --> margins and capex cadence --> FCF/dividend stability --> earnings revisions and multiple re‑rating. (3) Build a concrete base case, plus plausible upside/downside paths with trigger points (e.g., EV segment margin hitting break‑even or better by year X, tariff policy stabilizing, capital allocation discipline preserving dividend). (4) Specify catalysts and invalidation: EV margin turn, sustained cash flow, or a policy reversal; if not, emphasize a muted equity path. (5) Improve formatting and attribution: place the base/risks/watch list in clearly labeled lines and attach precise source IDs after each stat or claim (e.g., 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, 65UUBU0OR). (6) Reconcile conflicting tone across sources by front‑loading the risk premium and treating Ford as an income proxy with optional upside contingent on EV profitability and policy evolution.",
