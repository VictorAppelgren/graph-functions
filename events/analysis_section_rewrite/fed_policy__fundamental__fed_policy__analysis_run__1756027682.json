      "feedback": "Strengths: the draft builds a coherent multi‑year narrative around a regime shift from post‑pandemic restraint to easing, and it ties explicit catalysts (Jackson Hole, CHIPS/Intel policy, Tencent earnings, BoJ/yen dynamics) to cross‑asset moves (yields, dollar, equities, gold) with concrete anchors from the sources (notably GX057ADL7 and 37UZC9X8I). It also explicitly flags the pivotal role of policy signaling in pricing (the Jackson Hole hinge and the CHIPS‑era framework). The use of near‑term numeric anchors (e.g., the yield around 4.2–4.3% and the narrative around 50bp of cuts being discussed) is a good start.\n\nCritical gaps and concrete edits to reach world‑class, SECTION FOCUS alignment:\n- First‑principles anchors and regimes: formalize an invariant framework (real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity, BoP/net external position, policy reaction functions). State regimes (e.g., Regime A: inflation contained, policy easing; Regime B: sticky inflation, late easing; Regime C: geopolitical/shock tightening) with explicit transition conditions and trigger thresholds (e.g., CPI surprise > 0.3–0.5pp, unemployment strength/fade, or a deviation in implied policy paths). Tie each regime to a clear causal chain: policy path -> front‑end curves -> USD/FX -> risk assets -> capex/tech cycle (cite the links to Jackson Hole, Bessent, and CHIPS‑related policy). This will satisfy the horizon requirement by showing regime transitions and the invariants that price them.\n- Sharpen the transmission logic and quantify where possible: convert qualitative statements into quantitative or quasi‑quantitative channels. For example, state how the implied path of 50bp/25bp cuts (per GX057ADL7) would feed into a front‑end move, the dollar, and equity multiples, and contrast with the “don’t buy dips blindly” caution (37UZC9X8I) by showing how the same data can imply two regimes. Include explicit cross‑asset causal chains (rates → USD → equities/gold → sovereigns; yen/vs USD as BoJ expectations shift) with concrete reference points from the sources.\n- Strengthen base case, risks, and “what to watch” with calibrated scenarios: provide a base‑case path (e.g., modestly lower dollar, flatter/softening front end, gradual uplift in risk assets) and a few clear alternative scenarios (hawkish Powell, persistent inflation; China growth disappointment; a sharper US/EU tech policy shock). Ground risks in the cited sources (Jackson Hole hawkish/dovish parsing; CHIPS/Intel policy; Tencent earnings and PBOC credit tightening) and call out the potential invalidations (e.g., inflation surprises, geopolitics). The current draft ends with a qualitative statement on confidence; instead, present a concise probability‑weighted range for the next 6–12 months and a sensitivity table (even if narrative, not numeric) keyed to the triggers above.\n- Source coverage and reconciliation: tighten citations after each assertion and ensure coverage of all critical sources. Anchor 10‑year yield/yield/dollar moves to GX057ADL7; tie Jackson Hole dynamics to 37UZC9X8I; connect policy‑driven tech constraints (CHIPS) to H7Q52FKDH; mention the Tencent earnings and BoJ/yen dynamic from GX057ADL7. If you rely on the Bloomberg Horizons MEA segments for the regime calls (GX057ADL7) and the trading‑floor interpretation (37UZC9X8I), explicitly reconcile any deviations (e.g., Bessent’s aggressive easing vs the caution in the same episode) by assigning probabilities and showing how each path would update the base case.\n- Invalidation and narrative clarity: add a dedicated “invalidations” clause: what would break the base case (e.g., a sustained overshoot in inflation, a geopolitical shock, or a stubborn growth drag in China/Europe) and how markets would reprice (alternative regime activation, repricing in rates, USD, and risk assets). Ensure the prose remains tight and avoids stray non‑core sources (the Donegal Gr, personal‑loan specifics, and unrelated stock‑specific chatter can be deprioritized or referenced only to illustrate sentiment if needed).\n- Formatting and constraint alignment: turn the piece into a clean, horizon‑focused narrative with an opening invariant, a regime map (textual but precise), a base case with explicit channels and target ranges, a risk/scenario section, and a concise watchlist. Ensure every substantive claim has a source tag (e.g., GX057ADL7, 37UZC9X8I, H7Q52FKDH) and prune weak attributions (or connect them to the core sources).\n\nWith these edits, the analysis would satisfy the SECTION FOCUS by delivering invariant anchors, regime definitions, a traceable causal chain, a base case plus risks, and a tight, source‑driven framework. If you implement the above, the piece will read as a disciplined, cross‑asset, multi‑year scenario analysis rather than a qualitative digest, and it will be robust to conflicting signals across sources (GX057ADL7, 37UZC9X8I, H7Q52FKDH) while staying strictly tethered to IDs in the SOURCE MATERIAL.",
