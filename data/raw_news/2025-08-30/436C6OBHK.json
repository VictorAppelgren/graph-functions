  "title": "The overlooked qualification that could solve the UK\u2019s skills gap",
  "description": "As the new academic year begins, technical qualifications like T-levels are part of the answer to upskilling the future workforce, writes entrepreneur Sara Davies. This is the most cost-effective recruitment process going, so why are employers overlooking them?",
  "content": "It\u2019s no overstatement to say that I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today had I not worked alongside my studies. As a student starting a business, being able to be hands-on at work was transformative. It gave me real-world skills that no lecture hall could provide.\n\nThis is why I am passionate about technical education, particularly T-levels, the two-year vocational qualifications for 16 to 19-year-olds in England that are equivalent to three A-levels. And it\u2019s why I believe every employer has a responsibility to step up and do their bit for the next generation, by opening their doors to more young people.\n\nThe skills gap is real, and it\u2019s widening. But while employers across the country are consistently reporting how difficult it is to find decent candidates, young people, in turn, struggle to gain the practical experience that makes them employable. This is where technical qualifications fit in. They are revolutionising how we bridge the gap between education and employment.\n\nDesigned in partnership with employers, they provide both in-depth industry knowledge and practical skills. Unlike traditional routes that can often leave young people studying subjects they\u2019re not passionate about, T-levels can give them a chance to pursue a meaningful career in an interesting field.\n\nLast Thursday\u2019s results demonstrated the success to date, with a pass rate rising above 91 per cent and students achieving strong outcomes across diverse sectors. But they aren\u2019t just exam results; they represent young people who are work-ready and industry-focused.\n\nOver the last few months, my own business, Crafter\u2019s Companion, has been working with our local college to understand what more we can do. I am delighted that this year we will have three T-level students being mentored and supported by veteran staff members. They will be exposed to everything from product development and marketing to supply chain management and customer engagement.\n\nTo fix the skills gap, we need more employers to understand that we have a duty to lead by example. We must provide industry expertise and that invaluable hands-on experience, passing on the tricks of the trade as we were once taught. This isn\u2019t charity, it\u2019s an investment in our future workforce and the competitiveness of our industries. A third of the kids who go on into a job after their T-level are being employed by the business they did their industry placement with. That\u2019s one of the most cost-effective recruitment processes I\u2019ve heard of.\n\nOne of the most common objections I hear from businesses is that \u201cwe don\u2019t have time to manage students\u201d. But it is also one of the most easily solved. Effective placements don\u2019t require constant handholding; they require clear project briefs, regular check-ins, and willing mentors and experienced team members who remember their own early career challenges. And, to be fair to the government, they\u2019ve listened to feedback and created different models with flexibility built in to better suit employers and young people.\n\nAs the job market is reshaped and new industries emerge, employers who now engage with technical education, like offering T-level industry placements and giving their input to the curriculum, will be shaping the workforce they\u2019ll eventually hire and making sure they\u2019re getting the skills they need. Get in touch with your local college as a first step and get a sense of what they\u2019re offering. The government offers information and support online for businesses, too.\n\nThe students are ready. The colleges and schools are willing. T-levels provide the framework. The question is: are employers ready to step up and invest in the workforce they need?\n\nAs someone who built a business thanks to the combination of education and practical experience, I can tell you that the answer determines not just individual company success, but the competitiveness of entire industries.\n\nWe have a responsibility to upskill the nation. It\u2019s time to embrace it.\n\nSara Davies is a businesswoman, entrepreneur, and the founder of Crafter\u2019s Companion",

To fail to do so is to wilfully abandon the futures of a whole generation of sixth-form students.\u201d\nSeema Malhotra, Labour\u2019s shadow further education and skills minister, said: \u201cThe Conservative\u2019s shambolic roll-out of T-levels and uncertainty around BTec qualifications is putting student\u2019s future opportunities at risk.\n\u201cLabour supports the introduction of T-levels and the provision of high quality vocational pathways for young people.\n\u201cYet the Government\u2019s mismanagement threatens our future skills pipeline.\u201d\nRobert Halfon, minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear from the start that we would roll out T-levels in stages, starting with a small number of courses so we can make sure we get these important reforms right.\n\u201cThis September there are 18 high quality T-levels available offered at more than 160 providers across the country. More courses will be coming on board over the next few years, so we expect student numbers to rise as these are rolled out.\n\u201cAlternative qualifications including BTecs will continue, however, we will be removing those where there is poor uptake, inadequate outcomes, or overlap with our world-class T-levels.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe have totally overhauled Labour\u2019s legacy of failure in skills. We no longer incentivise courses like self-tanning, balloon artistry and pole fitness instructing \u2013 as the last government did.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked hand in glove with hundreds of employers to rebuild the entire skills system \u2013 with Higher Technical Qualifications, apprenticeship standards, skills bootcamps, returnerships and T-levels.\u201d"

      "text": "Students to learn how to work from home at college\nThe college said it would give a realistic experience of working life\nA further education college is including remote working in its T-Level curriculum from September.\nLincoln College\u2019s Assistant Principal for Heart, Health and Care, Steve Horsfield, said 50 per cent of the placements on certain courses, such as digital, could be done remotely, and it would give a realistic experience of working life.\nT-Levels are technical qualifications, equivalent to A-Levels, that work closely with industries. Part of the course includes a mandatory work placement.\nMr Horsfield told the BBC that the decision to offer work placements that included home working was to \u201creplicate what\u2019s going on in the industry itself\u201d, made after working closely with employers.\nHe said: \"It's why we're so focused on holding employer boards, we speak to industry partners across all of our T-levels regularly and they really support us with how we develop and work with our learners.\n\"It's not a decision we've taken lightly, it's taken with lots of research and through the industries themselves, to make it industry-specific with them.\"\nThe decision comes as working from home has grown more prevalent since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a number of employees being unable to go to the office.\nIn November, the Office for National Statistics revealed that 26 per cent of people had said they\u2019d been hybrid-working the previous seven days - meaning they spent some days in the workplace and other days at home - while 14 per cent worked from home fully. Meanwhile, 41 per cent had commuted to their workplace every day.\nThe growth of working from home culture has proven divisive, as Lord Rose, the former Asda boss, said it had created a generation of people \u201cnot doing proper work\u201d.\nMeanwhile, business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said flexible working was \u201cgood for productivity and resilience\u201d.\nLincoln College said it would only bring in remote working where it was suitable and relevant to the placement.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "More than two in three university students in paid jobs while studying \u2013 survey\nUndergraduates are spending less time on their independent study as more take on employment, a report suggests.\nMore than two in three full-time university students are now undertaking paid work during term time, a survey suggests.\nUniversity undergraduates are spending less time on independent study as more take on jobs, according to the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) think tank and Advance HE report.\nA survey of 10,232 full-time undergraduates in the UK found that 68% had paid work while they were studying, up from 56% in 2024.\nThe number of students working in term time has nearly doubled in a decade, with only 35% in paid employment in term time in 2015.\nThe Student Academic Experience Survey 2025, carried out between January and March, suggests time spent on independent study has fallen significantly, from 13.6 hours per week in 2024 to 11.6 hours this year.\nExperts have suggested that cost-of-living pressures are affecting the student experience, and they say universities should consider how they can support students who are balancing multiple commitments.\nStudents now spend an average of 39.8 hours per week in paid work and study, which is a slight fall from 41.7 hours per week in 2024, the survey found.\nBut the report said the figures imply that \u201csomething had to give\u201d and the hours spent in employment have \u201cpartly come at the expense of independent study time\u201d which has declined significantly in the past year.\nThe proportion of undergraduate students reporting that their course is good or very good value for money has dropped from 39% in 2024 to 37% this year.\nThe report said: \u201cStudents have faced some particular and ongoing challenges around the cost of living and needing to work for pay while at university, which has in turn put greater pressure on how the overall experience has been perceived in terms of value.\u201d\nThe findings come as university leaders have been warning of significant financial concerns caused by a drop in the number of international students, as well as frozen tuition fees paid by domestic students.\nA number of institutions across the UK have announced redundancies and course closures over the past year as a result of growing financial pressures.\nNick Hillman, director of Hepi, said: \u201cGiven the severe funding challenges, many students are struggling to pay their bills and institutions are often struggling to provide their students with what they expect, though both students and staff have also displayed considerable resilience in the face of adversity.\n\u201cThe fact that a large majority of students now undertake paid work during term time, and often at a high number of hours each week, suggests the student experience is completely different to the norm when today\u2019s policymakers were in higher education.\u201d\nMore than one in 10 (11%) students said they would not enter higher education if they could decide again, compared with 6% last year.\nBut the survey also found that 26% of students said they felt their experience had exceeded their expectations, which is an increase from 22% in 2024.\nAlison Johns, chief executive of Advance HE, said: \u201cWhile the higher education sector faces significant financial challenges, it\u2019s encouraging to see evidence of resilience in the student experience.\n\u201cThe quality of teaching and assessment feedback remains strong, and more students are having their expectations exceeded than ever before.\n\u201cHowever, the striking increase in students undertaking paid work alongside their studies signals a fundamental shift \u2013 and institutions will be thinking carefully about how they accommodate this change.\n\u201cWe need to consider how teaching, learning and support can evolve to better serve students who are balancing multiple commitments while maintaining academic quality.\u201d\nThe Government announced in November that undergraduate tuition fees in England, which have been frozen at \u00a39,250 since 2017, will rise to \u00a39,535 for the 2025-26 academic year.\nIt also announced that maintenance loans will increase in line with inflation in the 2025-26 academic year to help students with their living costs.\nA spokesperson for Universities UK (UUK) said: \u201cThese survey results demonstrate that universities continue to deliver high quality teaching, despite immense financial pressures.\n\u201cThere has been a significant increase in students who feel their experience has exceeded their expectations, and high levels of satisfaction with the quality of teaching and assessment feedback.\n\u201cHowever, the cost-of-living crisis is hitting students hard, with increasing numbers taking up part-time work alongside study, creating less opportunity to engage with the wider student experience.\n\u201cUniversities have stepped up their support by providing additional targeted hardship funding, digital technology so they can continue to learn flexibly, increased wellbeing and mental health support, access to discounted meals and other helpful initiatives.\n\u201cBut to ensure that all students who want to are able to access and make the most of their time at university, we need the Government to do its bit to protect the student experience by urgently addressing the insufficient maintenance package.\u201d\nA Department for Education (DfE) spokeswoman said: \u201cThe dire situation we inherited has forced us to make tough decisions to put universities on a firmer financial footing, but we also recognise the challenges facing students and have increased maintenance loans in line with inflation to support them.\n\u201cWe have also protected Strategic Priority Grant funding to boost access and participation, and are calling on universities to do more to expand opportunity and improve outcomes for disadvantaged students.\n\u201cWe aim to publish our plans for HE reform as part of the Post-16 Education and Skills Strategy white paper in the summer, as we fix the foundations of higher education through our Plan for Change.\u201d"

      "text": "Government must boost student numbers on T-levels to realise full benefits \u2013 NAO\nThe DfE should better understand the potential impacts of T-levels before making decisions on wider technical qualifications landscape, report says.\nIssues with student take-up, awareness and availability of industry placements should be addressed to cement T-levels as the main post-16 technical qualification, a Government spending watchdog has suggested.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) must make more efforts to boost the number of students on T-level courses to realise all the potential benefits of the technical qualification, the National Audit Office (NAO) said.\nThe first T-levels were introduced in September 2020 to help meet the needs of industry and prepare students for work.\nThe two-year courses, which are considered to be broadly equivalent to three A-levels, are being gradually rolled out in England.\nThe NAO report said the future economic benefits of T-levels are \u201cuncertain\u201d \u2013 as students\u2019 earnings data is not yet available and student numbers are hard to estimate \u2013 and it will \u201ctake time\u201d for them to be realised.\nConcerns have been raised about low student numbers, the value of awarding organisation contracts, challenges recruiting students, and the cost of T-levels to the government compared with other qualifications, the watchdog said.\nThe NAO has called on the DfE to better understand the potential impacts on the demand, benefits and cost of T-levels before making decisions \u201caround the development of the technical qualifications landscape\u201d.\nIt comes after the Government announced plans in December to scrap a series of vocational courses as part of a review of post-16 qualifications.\nEducation minister Janet Daby said at the time that the current post-16 education environment was \u201ctoo confusing\u201d as too many courses, including BTecs and apprenticeships, overlap with T-levels in England.\nMore than 200 qualifications that had either no enrolments, or fewer than 100 per year over the last three years, will be cancelled from August 2025.\nThe report from the watchdog said low student numbers, the announcement of the Advanced British Standard \u2013 which is no longer being introduced \u2013 and delays defunding overlapping qualifications have \u201caffected market interest\u201d from organisations contracted to award individual T-levels.\nThe DfE\u2019s ambition for T-level student numbers was \u201csignificantly overstated\u201d initially, but the DfE has since revised down its estimates, the NAO said.\nIn September 2024, 25,508 students started a T-level in England \u2013 which was 42% of the DfE\u2019s November 2022 estimate, 85% of its August 2023 estimate and 1% higher than its October 2023 estimate.\nThe report said the DfE has identified a lack of student awareness and prior attainment as \u201cbarriers\u201d to increasing numbers wanting to enrol on T-levels.\nThe DfE also considered the availability of industry placements as a \u201cpotential constraint\u201d to scaling up the programme, although it downgraded this risk earlier this month, the NAO said.\nThe watchdog has called on the DfE to continue efforts to expand industry placements and monitor the impact of student take-up on revised commercial arrangements with awarding bodies, the watchdog has said.\nGareth Davies, head of the NAO, said T-levels have \u201cthe potential to offer new opportunities for young people and address critical skills gaps\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cAlthough the DfE has made progress in delivering the wide range of courses available, efforts must be made to increase student numbers and realise all the potential benefits of T-levels.\u201d\nSir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: \u201cToday\u2019s NAO report shows that a lack of widespread awareness, declining pass rates and challenges securing industry placements risk the Department\u2019s ability to scale up T-levels.\n\u201cFor T-levels to be a success, the Department has much to do to convince students and providers of their worth as a desirable and valuable qualification.\u201d\nBill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA), said the NAO report \u201creinforces the need to retain a middle pathway of applied general qualifications for students for whom neither A-level nor T-level presents the best way forward\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cToday\u2019s report is clear that the DfE cannot yet measure whether T-levels are achieving their aims.\n\u201cUntil it can, we believe the Department should change its current policy to allow medium and large AGQs (applied general qualifications) to co-exist with T-levels.\n\u201cThis would ensure that the pipeline of skilled workers to key sectors of the economy is not disrupted and avoid the creation of a qualifications gap that tens of thousands of students could fall through.\u201d\nA DfE spokesperson said: \u201cThe \u00a328 million investment recently announced by the Prime Minister shows the Government\u2019s clear commitment to T-levels as a high-quality technical qualification which offers young people a great route into further study and a rewarding career.\n\u201cT-levels continue to grow, with nearly 60% more young people taking them last year than in the previous year.\n\u201cBased on employer-designed standards and with a substantial industry placement on every course, T-levels will be important contributors to our mission to grow the economy under the Plan for Change.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The article highlights the growing importance of T\u2011levels, England\u2019s two\u2011year technical qualifications, in bridging the skills gap and meeting employer demand for industry\u2011ready talent. It cites a 91% pass rate and strong outcomes across sectors, while noting that only a third of employers currently offer the required industry placements. MPs and the Public Accounts Committee urge the Department for Education to launch a campaign to raise awareness, increase enrolments, and ensure sufficient placement opportunities, warning that without these measures T\u2011levels risk remaining a minority pursuit. The piece also discusses the government\u2019s plan to cut low\u2011enrolment vocational courses while expanding T\u2011levels, and calls for a balanced approach that preserves alternative pathways such as BTecs to avoid leaving students without suitable options.",
