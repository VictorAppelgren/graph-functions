  "description": "A federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration is not allowed to cut funding to Los Angeles and other places with \"sanctuary\" policies that limit cooperation on immigration enforcement.",
  "content": "President Trump takes questions from reporters after signing an executive order to help coordinate logistical issues related to the 2028 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Trump administration cannot deny funding to Los Angeles and 30 other cities and counties because of \u201csanctuary\u201d policies that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies, a judge ruled late Friday.\n\nThe judge issued a preliminary injunction that expands restrictions the court handed down in April that blocked funding cuts to 16 cities and counties, including San Francisco and Santa Clara, after federal officials classified them as \u201csanctuary jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge William Orrick of the federal court in San Francisco ruled then that Trump\u2019s executive order cutting funding was probably unconstitutional and violated the separation of powers doctrine.\n\nFriday\u2019s order added more than a dozen more jurisdictions to the preliminary injunction, including Los Angeles, Alameda County, Berkeley, Baltimore, Boston and Chicago.\n\nMayor Karen Bass\u2019 office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the White House said the Trump administration expected to ultimately win in its effort on appeal.\n\n\u201cThe government \u2014 at all levels \u2014 has the duty to protect American citizens from harm,\u201d Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said in a statement. \u201cSanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement at the expense and safety and security of American citizens. We look forward to ultimate vindication on the issue.\u201d\n\nThe preliminary injunction is the latest chapter in an ongoing effort by the Trump administration to force \u201csanctuary cities\u201d to assist and commit local resources to federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Department of Justice published a list of what it determined to be sanctuary jurisdictions, or local entities that have \u201cpolicies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,\u201d Atty. Gen. Pamela Bondi said in a statement accompanying the published list.\n\nSeveral cities and counties across the country have adopted sanctuary city policies, but specifics as to what extent they\u2019re willing \u2014 or unwilling \u2014 to do for federal immigration officials have varied.\n\nThe policies typically do not impede federal officials from conducting immigration enforcement activities, but largely keep local jurisdictions from committing resources to the efforts.\n\nThe policies also don\u2019t prevent local agencies from enforcing judicial warrants, which are signed by a judge. Cooperation on \u201cdetainers\u201d or holds on jailed suspects issued by federal agencies, along with enforcement of civil immigration matters, is typically limited by sanctuary policies.\n\nFederal officials in the suit have so far referred to \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions as local governments that don\u2019t honor immigration detainer requests, don\u2019t assist with administrative warrants, don\u2019t share immigration status information, or don\u2019t allow local police to assist in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nOrrick noted that the executive orders threatened to withhold all federal funding if the cities and counties in question did not adhere to the Trump administration\u2019s requests.\n\nIn the order, the judge referred to the executive order as a \u201ccoercive threat\u201d and said it was unconstitutional.\n\nOrrick, who sits on the bench in the Northern District of California, was appointed by former President Obama.\n\nThe Trump administration has been ratcheting up efforts to force local jurisdictions to assist in immigration enforcement. The administration has filed lawsuits against cities and counties, vastly increased street operations and immigration detentions, and deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles as it increased immigration operations.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice in June sued Los Angeles, and local officials, alleging its sanctuary city law is \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nThe suit alleged that the city was looking to \u201cthwart the will of the American people regarding deportations\u201d by enacting sanctuary city policies.",

The Executive Order recognized that \u201csome State and local officials . . . continue to use their authority to violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws\u201d and \u201c[i]t is imperative that the Federal Government restore the enforcement of United States law.\u201d The Executive Order directed the Justice Department, in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security, to publish a list of such jurisdictions. Accordingly, the following states, cities, and counties have been identified as sanctuary jurisdictions:\nSTATES:\n- California\n- Colorado\n- Connecticut\n- Delaware\n- District of Columbia\n- Illinois\n- Minnesota\n- Nevada\n- New York\n- Oregon\n- Rhode Island\n- Vermont\n- Washington\nCOUNTIES:\n- Baltimore County, MD\n- Cook County, IL\n- San Diego County, CA\n- San Francisco County, CA\nCITIES:\n- Albuquerque, NM\n- Berkeley, CA\n- Boston, MA\n- Chicago, IL\n- Denver, CO\n- East Lansing, MI\n- Hoboken, NJ\n- Jersey City, NJ\n- Los Angeles, CA\n- New Orleans, LA\n- New York City, NY\n- Newark, NJ\n- Paterson, NJ\n- Philadelphia, PA\n- Portland, OR\n- Rochester, NY\n- Seattle, WA\n- San Francisco City, CA\nIn recent months, the Justice Department has filed several lawsuits against sanctuary jurisdictions seeking to compel compliance with federal law, including one against New York City on July 24th.

      "text": "Lyle Menendez denied parole, will remain in prison along with younger brother Erik\n- Share via\n- A California Parole Board denied Lyle Menendez\u2019s bid for freedom on Friday, one day after doing so for his younger brother Erik.\n- The brothers from Beverly Hills were convicted of killing their parents with shotguns in 1989.\n- Parole officials questioned both brothers about their use of contraband cellphones and other violations of prison rules.\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 A day after his younger brother was denied release, Lyle Menendez also saw California parole officials reject his bid for freedom, ruling he will remain behind bars for now for the 1989 shotgun murders of his parents.\nThe parole board grilled Menendez, 57, over his efforts to get witnesses to lie during his trials, the lavish shopping sprees he and his brother Erik, 54, took after their parents\u2019 killings, and whether he felt relief after the murders.\n\u201cI felt this shameful period of those six months of having to lie to relatives who were grieving,\u201d Menendez told the board. \u201cI felt the need to suffer. That it was no relief.\u201d\nAs the elder brother, Menendez said he at times felt like the protector of Erik, but that he soon realized the murders were not the right way out of sexual abuse they were allegedly suffering at the hands of their parents.\n\u201cI sort of started to feel like I had not rescued my brother,\u201d he said. \u201cI destroyed his life. I\u2019d rescued nobody.\u201d\nThe closely watched hearing for Lyle Menendez, one of the most well-known inmates currently in the state\u2019s prison system, was thrown into disarray Friday afternoon after audio of his brother\u2019s parole hearing on Thursday was publicly released.\nThe audio, published by ABC 7, sparked anger and frustration from the brothers\u2019 relatives and their attorney, who accused the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation of leaking the audio and tainting Lyle\u2019s hearing.\nA CDCR spokesperson confirmed the audio was \u201cerroneously\u201d issued in response to a record request, but did not elaborate or immediately respond to additional questions from The Times.\n\u201cI have protected myself, I have stayed out of this, I have not had a relationship with two human beings because I was afraid, and I came here today and I came here yesterday and I trusted that this would only be released in a transcript,\u201d said Tiffani Lucero-Pastor, a relative of the brothers. \u201cYou\u2019ve misled the family.\u201d\nHeidi Rummel, Lyle Menendez\u2019s parole attorney, also criticized CDCR, accusing the agency of turning the hearing into a \u201cspectacle.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can possibly understand the emotion of what this family is experiencing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have spent so much time trying to protect their privacy and dignity.\u201d\nAfter the audio was published, Rummel said family members who planned to testify decided not to speak after all, and said she would be looking to seal the transcripts of Friday\u2019s hearing.\nParole Commissioner Julie Garland said regulations allowed for audio to be released under the California Public Records Act. Transcripts of parole hearings typically become public within 30 days of a grant or denial, under state law.\nDuring his first-ever appeal to the state parole board, Lyle Menendez was questioned over his credibility.\nGarland referred to Menendez\u2019s appeal to get witnesses to lie, plans to escape, and lies to relatives about the killings as a \u201csophistication of the web of lies and manipulation you demonstrated.\u201d\nState parole officials had not yet publicly announced that Erik Menendez would remain behind bars, but word of the outcome was already spreading among his family members early Thursday evening.\nMenendez said he had no plan at the time, there was just \u201ca lot of flailing in what was happening.\u201d\n\u201cEven though you fooled your entire family about you being a murderer, and you recruited all these people to help you... you don\u2019t think that\u2019s being a good liar?\u201d Garland asked.\nMenendez said the remorse he felt after the crimes perhaps helped create a \u201cstrong belief\u201d he didn\u2019t have anything to do with the killings.\nLike his brother, Lyle Menendez was denied parole for three years, but could be eligible to apply for an earlier hearing.\nAfter the decision, which came at the end of a marathon 11-hour hearing, members of the parole board noted that Menendez had a strong support system of relatives for when he might be released in the future, and also commended the 57-year-old for having no incidents of violence despite being in prison for three decades.\nBut Garland said Menendez still struggled with antisocial personality traits, incidents of deception, and rule breaking.\n\u201cWe find your remorse is genuine,\u201d Garland said. \u201cIn many ways, you look like you\u2019ve been a model inmate.\u201d\nGarland also highlighted what she said was a lack of self-control, impulsiveness and poor decision-making during the crimes \u2014 including the brothers\u2019 \u201ccallous\u201d decision to shoot their mother a final time.\nRelatives of the siblings said they were disappointed in the decision, but not discouraged.\n\u201cThe process for parole is exceptionally rigorous, but we are incredibly proud of how Erik and Lyle showed up \u2014 with honesty, accountability, and integrity,\u201d relatives said in a joint statement. \u201cThis is not the end of the road. Both will go before the Board again, and their habeas petition remains under review. In the meantime, we know they will take time to reflect on the Board\u2019s recommendation and will continue to lead, mentor, and build programs that support rehabilitation and hope for others.\u201d\nDmitry Gorin, a former Los Angeles County prosecutor, said the board\u2019s decision denying parole was consistent with past decisions involving violent crimes.\n\u201cAlthough this is a high-profile case, the parole board rejecting the release demonstrates that it seeks to keep violent offenders locked up because they still pose a risk to society,\u201d Gorin said. \u201cHistorically, the parole board does not release people convicted of murder, and this case is no different.\nHe called the decision a win for Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman, who has opposed the brothers\u2019 release.\nGorin also characterized the issues with the audio release.\n\u201cThey were promised privacy, they should expect that the state would honor it,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone deserves a right to a fair hearing and a right to privacy consistent with the state rules.\u201d\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, said \u201cthere are no winners in the Menendez brothers case, when you have two dead parents and two murderers who were victims of sex abuse.\u201d\n\u201cMany legal pundits like myself thought the parole board would be a mere formality and the brothers would be released in a matter of days or weeks,\u201d Rahmani said. \u201cBut Hochman and his deputy Habib Balian saved their best argument for last and they\u2019ll keep the Menendez brothers in prison, at least for now.\u201d\nThe brothers were initially sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the killings of their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez, but after qualifying for resentencing they gained a chance at freedom.\nMany family members have supported their cause, but the gruesome crime and the brothers\u2019 conduct behind bars led to pushback against their release.\nThe killings occurred after the brothers purchased shotguns in San Diego with a false identification and shot their parents in the family living room.\nThe bloody crime scene was compared by investigators to a gangland execution, where Jose Menendez was shot five times, including once in the back of the head. Evidence showed their mother had crawled, wounded, on the floor before the brothers reloaded and fired a final, fatal blast.\nThe brothers reported the killings to 911, according to court records. Soon afterward, prosecutors during the trial noted, the two siblings began to spend large sums of money, including buying a Porsche and a restaurant, which was purchased by Lyle. Erik bought a Jeep and hired a private tennis instructor.\nProsecutors argued it was access to their multimillion-dollar inheritance that prompted the killing after Jose Menendez shared that he planned to disinherit the brothers.\nBut during the trials, the Menendez brothers and relatives testified that the two siblings had undergone years of sexual and physical abuse at the hands of their father.\nNetflix\u2019s \u2018Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\u2019 has drawn true crime fans from all over the world to see the mansion where the 1989 murders occurred.\nIn contrast to their frenzy around their trial, Thursday and Friday\u2019s parole hearings were quiet \u2014 yet occasionally contentious \u2014 affairs.\nA Times journalist was the only member of the public allowed to view the hearing on a projector screen in a room inside the agency\u2019s headquarters outside of Sacramento.\nDuring the Friday hearing, the parole board quickly dove into the allegations that the brothers were sexually assaulted by their father, which Lyle Menendez said confused and \u201ccaused a lot of shame in me.\u201d\n\u201cThat pretty much characterized my relationship with my father,\u201d he said, adding that the fear of being abused left him in a state of \u201chyper vigilance,\u201d even after the abuse stopped and his father began to abuse Erik.\n\u201cIt took me a while to realize that it stopped,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cI think I was still worried about it for a long time.\u201d\nGrowing up, he said, taking care of his younger brother gave him purpose, and helped to protect him from \u201cdrowning in the spiral of my own life.\u201d\nMenendez alleged his mother also sexually abused him, but said he did not share it during his comprehensive risk assessment because he \u201cdidn\u2019t see it as abuse really.\u201d\n\u201cToday, I see it as sexual abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was 13, I felt like I was consenting and my mother was dealing with a lot and I just felt like maybe it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nBoard members also questioned Lyle Menendez on why he didn\u2019t mention the possibility they were removed from their parent\u2019s will in their submissions to the board, but Menendez contended their inheritance was not a motive in the killings.\nInstead, he said, it became \u201ca problem afterward\u201d as they worried they would have no money after their parents\u2019 deaths.\n\u201cI believe there was a will that disinherited us somewhere,\u201d he said.\nThe result of Thursday\u2019s hearing means Erik can\u2019t seek parole again for three years, a decision that left some relatives and supporters of the younger brother stunned.\n\u201cHow is my dad a threat to society,\u201d Talia Menendez, his stepdaughter, wrote on Instagram shortly after the decision was made. \u201cThis has been torture to our family. How much longer???\u201d\nFriends, relatives and former cellmates have touted the brothers\u2019 lives behind bars, pointing to programs they\u2019ve spearheaded for inmates, including classes for anger management, meditation, and helping inmates in hospice care.\nBut members of the board questioned both siblings about their violation of rules, zeroing in at times about repeated use of contraband cellphones.\nDuring the hearing Friday, Lyle said he sometimes used cellphones to keep in touch with family outside the prison. But Deputy Parole Commissioner Patrick Reardon questioned this explanation, and asked why Menendez needed a cellphone if he could make legitimate calls from a prison-issued tablet.\nThe rule violation, board members pointed out, had resulted in Menendez being barred from family visits for three years.\nReardon pointed out that Menendez pleaded guilty to two cellphone violations in November 2024 and in March 2025. Menendez was also linked to three other violations, although another cellmate of his took responsibility for those violations.\nMenendez said the violations occurred when he lived in a dorm with five other inmates, and admitted the use of cellphones was a \u201cgang-like activity.\u201d The group, he said, probably went through at least five cellphones.\nRummel, Menendez\u2019s parole attorney, argued in her closing that despite the cell phone issues, Menendez had no violent incidents on his prison record.\n\u201cThis board is going to say you\u2019re dangerous because you used your cell phones,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is zero evidence that he used it for criminality, that he used it for violence. He didn\u2019t even lie about it.\u201d\nBut members of the board repeatedly focused on what seemed to be issues of credibility. Reardon said at times it felt like Menendez was \u201ctwo different incarcerated people.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to be different things at different times,\u201d Reardon said during the hearing. \u201cI don\u2019t think what I see is that you used a cellphone from time to time. There seems to be a mechanism in place that you always had a cellphone.\u201d\nGarland asked Menendez about whether he used his position on the Men\u2019s Advisory Council \u2014 a group meant to be a liaison on issues between inmates and prison administrators \u2014 to manipulate others and gain unfair benefits.\nMenendez said the position gave him access to wall phones, and used the position to help him barter or gain favors.\nGarland also pointed to an assessment that found Menendez exhibited antisocial traits, entitlement, deception, manipulation and a resistance to accept consequences.\nMenendez also said he didn\u2019t agree with an assessment Garland brought up that said he showed narcissistic traits.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the type of people like me self-referring to mental health,\u201d he said, adding that he felt his father displayed narcissistic tendencies and lack of self-reflection. \u201cI just felt like that wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\nMenendez pointed to his work to help inmates in prison who are bullied or mocked.\n\u201cI would never call myself a model incarcerated person,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say that I\u2019m a good person, that I spent my time helping people. That I\u2019m very open and accepting.\u201d\nThe parole board applauded Menendez\u2019s work and educational history while in prison, noting he was working on a master\u2019s degree.\nDespite the violations, Menendez argued he felt he had done good work in prison.\n\u201cMy life has been defined by extreme violence,\u201d he said, tears visible on his face. \u201cI wanted to be defined by something else.\u201d"

Rebecca Haro, 41; and Jake Haro, 32, were arrested at their home after armored vehicles rammed down their front gate.\n\u201cIt is believed Emmanuel is deceased and the search to recover his remains is ongoing,\u201d the Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a statement. \u201cWhile these arrests mark a significant development, our focus remains on finding Emmanuel.\u201d\nBy 10 a.m., a crowd was gathering near the family\u2019s home on Ramona Street where the Haro parents were arrested hours earlier. A small memorial set up for Emmanuel near the home had drawn about 50 people, some of whom came from out of state out of fascination with the case.\nAmong them was Jimmy Williams, a YouTube videographer from Chesapeake, Va., who arrived in the county three days ago to follow the case.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the community that wants answers,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole country that wants answers for this beautiful, little baby.\u201d\n- Share via\nAnother person outside the home, Kimberly Govea, was wearing a black T-shirt that said, \u201cWhere\u2019s the baby?\u201d\nShe attended a vigil Thursday evening outside the Haro home.\n\u201cThis is our passion to help people find lost kids or whatever, put pressure on the families to ... give up where the baby\u2019s at,\u201d she said.\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus thanked law enforcement and prosecutors from Riverside and San Bernardino counties for their role in the investigation and arrests. He also thanked the public and the media for their roles in assisting the investigation.\n\u201cThe circumstances surrounding this investigation are tragic and we will continue to search for Emmanuel,\u201d Dicus said in a statement. \u201cI trust our justice system will hold the parents accountable.\u201d\nEmmanuel was reported missing Aug. 14 under suspicious circumstances after his mother said she was attacked and knocked unconscious outside a Big 5 store in Yucaipa, according to a press release.\nAt the home on Friday morning, San Bernardino County sheriff\u2019s investigators in plain clothes searched the property, passing by a colorful kid\u2019s bicycle leaning against a fence and a baby swing on the the porch.\nInvestigators entered three detached buildings on the property, including a single-story home and a tin-roofed barn. Helicopters circled over the neighborhood and showed footage of investigators parsing through scattered items in the home\u2019s rear while multiple people filmed the scene with their phones from the street.\nBy 1 p.m. detectives and forensic investigators had packed up their equipment and were leaving the home.\nThey left behind some yellow police tape and a mangled wooden fence that a SWAT vehicle rammed through when the authorities made their arrests.\nWhen Rebecca Haro initially reported her baby missing, she gave statements to investigators that she later contradicted, authorities said. When she was confronted with those inconsistencies, sheriff\u2019s officials say she stopped speaking with investigators.\nOver the weekend, investigators and police dogs searched the family home in Cabazon, a community northwest of Palm Springs. The Sheriff\u2019s Department says it has served multiple search warrants at the home and is reviewing surveillance footage from areas of interest in the case.\nEarlier this week, an attorney for the boy\u2019s father, Jake Haro, insisted the family was still cooperating, and Rebecca Haro had only refused to take a polygraph when it was requested by law enforcement.\nAuthorities said she gave contradictory statements, but Vincent Hughes, who is representing Jake Haro in a separate criminal case, said she was overcome with emotion because of her missing son.\nThe couple surrendered their phones to investigators and allowed detectives to search their Cabazon home, Hughes said. Investigators also took two iPads, including one that had not been taken out of the box, and three Xbox video game consoles. Their vehicle was also taken by investigators as part of the search for their son, according to Hughes.\nHughes was escorted into the family home by investigators just before noon and stayed inside for 30 minutes before leaving.\nBystanders jeered him as he left.\n\u201cThey\u2019re innocent until proven guilty,\u201d he told news reporters as he walked back to his vehicle.\nHe declined to provide any additional comments.\nIn an interview with KTLA-TV last week, Rebecca Haro, who had a black eye, pleaded for the return of her son. She said that she had planned to go to the Big 5 Sporting Goods store the night of Aug. 14 to buy a mouth guard for her older son.\n\u201cIf you know anything, please come forward or take him to the cops,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease come and bring my son back. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d\nAccording to court records, Jake Haro was convicted in June 2023 of willful child cruelty for an incident involving another child in Hemet. He\u2019s due to appear in court on Sept. 2 for a violation of his probation, and Hughes is defending him in that case. Jake Haro said he was giving the baby girl a bath in a kitchen sink and accidentally dropped her but a doctor\u2019s report said the girl\u2019s injuries did not fit that narrative.\nThat case is separate and has no connection to the Haros\u2019 missing child, Hughes said.\n\u201cJake has a criminal past,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe\u2019re not running from that, but the facts of that case are a lot different than the facts of this case. And one crime doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve committed every other crime known to man, especially to take your own child.\u201d\n\u201cThey just want their son back, they want people to put in the same effort that they\u2019re using to question them to go out and search for Emmanuel,\u201d Hughes told The Times.\nAuthorities confirmed Wednesday that Riverside County child protective services removed a 2-year-old child from the home of the same couple who reported the infant missing last week.\nIt\u2019s unclear what prompted officials to remove the 2-year-old. A spokesperson for Riverside County declined to comment, citing state confidentiality laws."

      "text": "Unseasonable heat causing severe conditions in SoCal, new wildfires starting to burn\n- Share via\nCalifornia\u2019s weather conditions are intensifying after a week of extreme temperatures, prompting fire evacuations in Napa County and sparking a handful of blazes that began burning Saturday morning in the Angeles National Forest.\nThe Pickett fire broke out Thursday near a remote area in Napa County as weather officials warned about elevated fire threats across the region. The fire quickly spread to 2,133 acres with no containment by Friday morning, forcing hundreds of residents in the small city of Calistoga \u2014 known for its wine \u2014 to evacuate.\nFire Chief Ryan Isham said crews worked throughout Thursday night, forming a second line of defense along Rattlesnake Ridge to curb the Pickett fire from progressing into Pope Valley. As temperatures warm up, \u201cyou will expect to see increased fire activity throughout the perimeter of the fire,\u201d Isham said in a video update to Facebook.\nThe Pickett fire remained at 3,993 acres with 7% containment until Friday night. By Saturday, the fire spread to 4,690 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. About 1,200 fire personnel are currently assigned to the Picket fire, according to Cal Fire.\nNo structural damages nor injuries were reported, according to Battalion Chief Bob Todeschini. \u201cWe\u2019d like to remind everyone to be vigilant and have a plan as we continue with suppression efforts,\u201d he said Thursday in a video statement to X.\nNew fires emerged this week amid the region\u2019s intense heatwave.\nSome emergency room doctors and nurses who are versed in climate change want more recognition of the ways overheating can precipitate ER visits for heart, respiratory and kidney disease.\nThe Little fire in Kern County broke out Friday afternoon, about five miles west of Borel Road. The Little fire burned 300 acres. In Alameda County, the Parks fire burned 113 acres with 75% containment as of Saturday. Smoke plumes were seen spread across the east bay as flames scorched up dry grass.\nNo evacuation orders were issued for either incident.\nA lightning bolt struck a tree and ignited two fires southwest of the Little Rock community, according to a post by the Angeles National Forest on X. A third fire began Saturday morning near Table Mountain, west of Wrightwood. No injuries have been reported.\nThe National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning for portions of Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties for \u201can unseasonably hot and unstable air mass capable of producing extreme fire behavior from vertical plume growth [and] low relative humidity.\u201d\nThe red flag issue will continue until Sunday at 9 p.m. as temperatures are expected to range between 98 and 110 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Santa Clarita Valley, the San Gabriel Mountains and the Antelope Valley foothills will remain under critical fire warning until Saturday at 9 p.m.\nIn anticipation of potential fires, the Los Angeles Fire Department has pre-deployed resources dispatched from the state, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The dispatch includes: 10 fire engines, two water tenders, two bulldozers, one helicopter, two hand crews, three dispatchers and one Incident Management Team.\nA high alert for possible thunderstorms was issued near Pearblossom in the Antelope Valley as of Saturday morning. The storm is expected to move toward Palmdale, Lancaster and Vincent. Residents may experience \u201csudden strong winds, blowing dust and dangerous lightning.\u201d\n\u201cShowers and thunderstorms will be possible over the Los Angeles and Ventura County mountains, and portions of the Antelope Valley, during the afternoon and evening hours through Monday,\u201d the National Weather Service said.\nL.A. County is providing cooling centers at several recreation centers and libraries.\n\u201cAs the Extreme Heat Warning is extended through the weekend, City Departments remain prepared to keep Angelenos safe and respond to any emerging needs,\u201d Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement. \u201cThese temperatures can be dangerous \u2013 I urge Angelenos to limit their time outdoors if possible, check on your neighbors, and stay cool.\u201d"

      "text": "He was delivering strawberries in L.A. when Border Patrol stopped him. \u2018The wrong place at the wrong time\u2019\n- Share via\nThe strawberry delivery driver was making his last drop-off in Little Tokyo, unloading nearly a dozen boxes onto the sidewalk outside the Japanese American National Museum.\nInside the building, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his allies were holding a news conference about a Democratic Party plan to fight back against President Trump\u2019s efforts to maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives through redistricting in Texas.\nAngel Rodrigo Minguela Palacios knew nothing of the powerful men\u2019s clash as he stacked cardboard boxes filled with ripe, red fruit Thursday morning. He also didn\u2019t know that dozens of Border Patrol agents were massing nearby.\nMinguela was caught between the two spectacles. His life was about to be upended.\nIn the days that followed, Newsom accused the Trump administration of trying to intimidate the president\u2019s political opponents by sending the immigration agents. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin has said the agents were \u201cfocused on enforcing the law,\u201d not on Newsom.\nNewsom has since submitted a Freedom of Information Act request seeking records from the administration about why agents arrived at the museum as he was announcing his latest skirmish with the president.\nFor Minguela, who has been in the country for close to a decade, that day felt a lot more personal. He was arrested by Border Patrol agents and now faces deportation back to Mexico. Speaking from behind a plexiglass window at the \u201cB-18\u201d federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, Minguela stressed that he is not a criminal.\n\u201cOne comes here to work, not commit crimes,\u201d said Minguela, who wore the same red T-shirt and jeans he\u2019d been arrested in four days prior.\nWhen asked last week whether the person arrested outside the news conference had a criminal record, a Homeland Security spokesperson said the agency would share a criminal rap sheet when it was available. After four follow-up emails from a reporter, McLaughlin on Saturday said agents had arrested \u201ctwo illegal aliens\u201d in the vicinity of Newsom\u2019s news conference \u2014 including \u201can alleged Tren de Aragua gang member and narcotics trafficker.\u201d\nAsked twice to clarify whether the alleged gang member and narcotics trafficker were the same person, Homeland Security officials did not respond. But when presented with Minguela\u2019s biographical information Monday, the department said he had been arrested because he overstayed his visa \u2014 a civil, not criminal, offense.\nBorder Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino told Fox News on Friday that operations were based on intelligence about the alleged Tren de Aragua gang member. They arrested that man two blocks away from Newsom\u2019s news conference.\nTwo law enforcement sources who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak with the media told The Times that they had received word from federal authorities that Little Tokyo had been targeted because of its proximity to the Newsom event.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for Newsom told The Times that though agents \u201cintended to intimidate the Governor and community leaders, the brunt was born, as it always is, by people who believe in the American dream.\u201d\nFor those who know Minguela, it felt like mala suerte \u2014 bad luck.\nAs Martha Franco, one of Minguela\u2019s employers, put it, \u201cHe was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d\n::\nLike every other weekday, Minguela rose before the sun to start his 2 a.m. delivery route Thursday. He had around eight places to hit.\nHe\u2019d worked for the same produce company for around eight years and never missed a day.\nThat day, Minguela left his partner and their three children \u2014 ages 15, 12 and 6 \u2014 asleep in their home, hours before the kids would head off for their first day of school. His partner, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, had worked the night before as a cashier at a liquor store. She did not get off work until about 12:30 a.m. She brought him coffee as he started his day.\nShortly before 6 a.m., Minguela called his partner to wake her up so she could take the kids to school. Throughout the morning, they checked in with each other on how the day was progressing.\nShe called to warn him about immigration agents at Slauson and Miles avenues in Huntington Park. Over the last couple of months, as immigration raids became a part of daily life, the couple\u2019s world had slowly shrunk.\nMinguela had overstayed a tourist visa after fleeing the Mexican state of Coahuila in 2015 because of violence he faced there, his partner said. She said he had worked servicing ATMs there, was kidnapped twice and at one point was stabbed by people intent on stealing the money. After his employers cut staff, she said, he lost his job, helping drive his decision to leave.\nBecause he was undocumented, he rarely went out, leaving the house only for work and errands. Minguela began wondering whether it was even safe for him to pick up the kids from school, his partner said. He planned ahead, made copies of his keys and left money for his family in the event that he was grabbed by immigration agents.\nThat morning, he reassured his partner he was fine. He was heading to his last stop at a tearoom in Little Tokyo.\n\u201cTen mucho cuidado,\u201d his partner told him.\nBe very careful.\n::\nThe Border Patrol agents descended on 1st Street in Little Tokyo about 11:30 a.m., just as Newsom\u2019s news conference got underway.\nThey were decked out in camouflage and helmets, their faces obscured by black masks. One wore an American flag neck gaiter. They were armed, some with AR-15-style weapons.\nBorder Patrol agents arrested at least one person, who a coworker said was delivering strawberries, outside of Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s event in Little Tokyo.\nNearby, Minguela was busy unloading several boxes of strawberries and a box of apples. He didn\u2019t notice the agents until they were close behind him. Then, he ducked back inside the van.\nA video shared with The Times shows at least eight Border Patrol agents as they passed the van, its side door wide open. They did not stop. Then, one appeared to double back and peek inside.\nMinguela said he feels he was targeted based on his physical appearance.\nWhen the agent began asking him questions, Minguela said he pulled a red \u201cknow your rights\u201d card out of his wallet and handed it to the agent.\n\u201cThis is of no use to me,\u201d he said the agent told him. Another agent soon joined them.\nMinguela told them he didn\u2019t have to talk. But they kept asking questions, he said. What was his nationality? What was his name? Did he have papers?\n\u201cThey demanded I show them some kind of identification,\u201d he said. \u201cInsisting, insisting.\u201d\nThe agents were armed, and Minguela said he grew scared. Believing he had no choice, Minguela said, he gave one of the agents his California driver\u2019s license.\nMinguela tried to call his partner twice, but she was at a doctor\u2019s appointment and couldn\u2019t answer. At 11:22 a.m., he sent her three WhatsApp messages:\n\u201cAmor ya me agarr\u00f3 la migra..no te preocupes.\u201d\n\u201cTodo va a estar bien.\u201d\n\u201cDiosito nos va a ayudar mucho.\u201d\nImmigration had gotten him, he said, but everything would be fine. God would help them, he assured her.\nMinguela sent her a picture of an agent holding his license and seemingly plugging the information from it into a phone. Then, the agent arrested him.\nVideo captured Minguela, hands cuffed behind his back, as the agent linked an arm through his. He walked Minguela away from the van, toward Bovino.\nAfter conferring with colleagues, the agent walked Minguela back toward his delivery van. Bovino patted the agent on the back and said, \u201cWell done.\u201d\nAt about the same time, one of Minguela\u2019s employers, Isaias Franco, received a call from Little Tokyo warning him about the immigration activity. He immediately called Minguela, whose cell number is saved in his phone under \u201cpaisa,\u201d countryman. Both hail from the Mexican city of Torre\u00f3n.\nNo answer.\nIsaias Franco texted him, trying to tell him what was unfolding.\nBy that time, though, Minguela was already in handcuffs.\n::\nHours before visitation began at the detention center in downtown L.A. on Monday, families began lining up along a driveway where \u201cB-18\u201d was stamped in black on a concrete wall.\nSomeone had scrawled on the ground in chalk: \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d and \u201cViva La Raza.\u201d Another message read, \u201cCivil disobedience becomes a duty when the state becomes lawless and corrupt.\u201d\nBy 11:30 a.m., 18 people were waiting for visitation to start at 1 p.m. In less than an hour, that number had ballooned to 33.\nThey include three siblings there to visit their uncle who had been arrested at a car wash in Long Beach the day before. A woman whose uncle was taken from a Home Depot in Pasadena. Two sisters whose loved one had been arrested at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in.\nThey carried bags of medication and sweaters for detained loved ones, because they\u2019d heard it was cold inside. Each person hoped to get in before visitation ended at 4 p.m., although it seemed increasingly unlikely for those at the back of the line.\nMartha and Isaias Franco, Minguela\u2019s employers, were among the hopeful. It was their third attempt to see him. The day of Minguela\u2019s arrest, they got there too late.\nThe next day, they arrived earlier and were in luck. On the advice of others in line, they brought a jacket to keep Minguela warm.\nIn the years they\u2019ve employed Minguela, they\u2019ve only ever seen his serious, professional side. But during the five minutes they got to visit with him Friday, he spent most of it in tears, hardly able to speak.\nThe couple assured him they would help however they could.\nThey returned Monday, this time bringing a blue Ralph Lauren shirt and a pair of black New Balance socks so he could change clothing. Isaias and the couple\u2019s son, Carlos, had both come, despite starting their workday at 2 a.m.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be with him until the end,\u201d Martha Franco said. \u201cHe\u2019s part of our family. He\u2019s one of us.\u201d\nAs the hours wore on, people in line squatted or sat on the concrete to rest their aching legs. Martha Franco flitted around, advising people to bring sweaters for loved ones and letting them know the officers allowed in only one item of clothing for each detained person.\nBy the start of visitation, 44 people were in line. Martha Franco was No. 19. Families exited red-eyed, tears dripping down their cheeks after getting only a few minutes with their loved ones.\nAbout 3 p.m., after waiting three and a half hours, the Francos handed the officer their passports and identification, before finally making it inside. They had to turn off their phones. They could give Minguela only the T-shirt. The officer said no to the socks, a prohibited second item of clothing.\nMinguela beamed when he saw the Francos, who greeted him through the plexiglass window. He was trying to maintain his spirits, but said he felt \u201cimpotente.\u201d Powerless.\nThe Francos told him not to sign anything.\n\u201cVamos a estar con usted,\u201d Isaias told Minguela, letting him know they would be with him. He and Carlos fist-bumped Minguela through the Plexiglass.\n\u201c\u00c9chale ganas,\u201d Isaias added, keep going.\n::\nMinguela\u2019s children have hardly stopped crying since his arrest.\nDuring the eight years he and his partner have been together, he\u2019s helped raise her two children and their 7-year-old son, who is autistic.\nMinguela\u2019s lawyer, Alex Galvez, said the hope is that his client will be released on bond, as he initially entered the country lawfully and is the primary breadwinner for the family. The lawyer said he believes Minguela was arrested in defiance of a federal judge\u2019s order that immigration authorities cannot racially profile people or use roving patrols to target immigrants.\n\u201cIt was a political opportunity. He was one of the two guys picked up right during Newsom\u2019s press conference,\u201d Galvez said. \u201cThey had to show something for it.\u201d\nJust days before his arrest, Minguela\u2019s family had celebrated his 48th birthday. His partner made him his favorite dish, shrimp ceviche.\nHer birthday was Tuesday. The family had planned to go on a rare outing for a dinner of enchiladas de mole.\nBut they spent the day without him. There was no celebration.\nThe children asked their mother, as they have every day for nearly a week: When is pap\u00e1 coming home?\nTimes staff writer Richard Winton contributed to this report."
