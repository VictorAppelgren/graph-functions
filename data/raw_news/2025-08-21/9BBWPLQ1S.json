  "title": "Struggling fusion power company General Fusion gets $22M lifeline from investors",
  "description": "General Fusion pleaded for new funding in May after it laid off 25% of its staff. The new round buys it precious months to pursue its scientific milestones.",
  "content": "General Fusion, a Canadian nuclear fusion energy startup, announced today that it had been thrown a lifeline in the form of $22 million in fresh funding.\n\nThe company had laid off at least 25% of its employees in May in a bid to shore up its stretched finances. At the same time, CEO Greg Twinney wrote an open letter pleading for funding. The additional cash will give General Fusion some breathing room, though not much.\n\nA subset of General Fusion\u2019s existing investors ultimately ponied up for what the Globe and Mail reports was a \u201cpay to play\u201d round \u2014 a financing structure where existing investors must participate to maintain their ownership stakes \u2014 that included Chrysalix Venture Capital, Gaingels, Hatch, MILFAM, JIMCO, Penderfund, Presight Capital, Segra Capital Management, and Thistledown Capital. Penderfund and Segra gained board seats as part of the deal.\n\nThough the company described the round as \u201coversubscribed,\u201d the $22 million falls far short of the $125 million that the company was reportedly seeking. Adam Rodman, chief investment officer at Segra Capital, told the Globe and Mail that the $22 million was \u201cthe least amount of capital possible\u201d to help the company hit the next scientific milestone.\n\nGeneral Fusion was founded in 2002 and before this round had raised $440 million, according to PitchBook.\n\nJust months before making its financial woes public, General Fusion had activated its latest device, Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), a half-scale prototype of a commercial-scale reactor. The new funding will give the company more time to run LM26 as it attempts to hit key scientific milestones.\n\nGeneral Fusion is pursuing what\u2019s known as magnetized target fusion. Inside its reactor, electricity flows through deuterium-tritium fuel \u2014 heavy hydrogen isotopes \u2014 generating a magnetic field to contain the plasma. That plasma is then compressed by a liquid lithium wall that is pressed inward by steam-driven pistons. The combination should drive the temperature and pressure inside the plasma high enough to trigger a fusion reaction.\n\nIn March, when it commissioned LM26, General Fusion said it expected the device to hit scientific breakeven in 2026. Scientific breakeven is a technical term in fusion circles that means the amount of energy generated by a fusion reaction is enough to offset the amount of energy that\u2019s required to kick off the reaction. Reaching scientific breakeven is crucial in proving the viability of a reactor design, though it doesn\u2019t guarantee commercial success.\n\nToday, General Fusion said it is still pursuing scientific breakeven, though it didn\u2019t provide a timeline. The company also listed two intermediary goals: heating plasmas to 10 million degrees C and 100 million degrees C.\n\nGiven the limited size of the fresh funding, it seems likely that General Fusion will shoot for the most achievable milestones to convince investors to cut a new round of checks. The company may have bought itself a few precious months, but unless it can deliver promising results, it may find itself in back in the same tight spot it was in during May.",

      "text": "Three months after hitting a funding crunch, General Fusion Inc. has secured US$22-million to finance the pursuit of its next scientific milestone in a generation-spanning attempt to develop commercial-scale fusion reactors.\nThe Vancouver company raised the money in a rights offering known as a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d deal. About 70 per cent of its existing preferred shareholders bought their pro-rata share in the deal to maintain their stakes in the company, including Shopify Inc. chief executive officer Tobi L\u00fctke\u2019s family investment company Thistledown Capital and JIMCO, the global investment arm of Saudi Arabia\u2019s billionaire Jameel family.\nSome that didn\u2019t, including Singapore sovereign wealth funds Temasek and GIC, saw the relative size of their stakes shrink significantly. Business Development Bank of Canada, a long-standing investor, also didn\u2019t participate, but was protected against dilution because of protections it secured when it led General Fusion\u2019s last two financings.\n\u201cI feel very optimistic because we have an activated set of shareholders that proved through this difficult time that they\u2019ll step up and that they believe in the company and the opportunity,\u201d General Fusion CEO Greg Twinney said in an interview.\nGeneral Fusion at financial crossroads in quest to build \u2018break-even\u2019 reactor\nGeneral Fusion delays U.K. demonstration plant to focus on Canadian project\nGeneral Fusion previously raised US$350-million, about 75 per cent from private investors and the rest from government sources. The company was last valued at US$425-million after raising US$25-million in 2023. The new deal doesn\u2019t reset its valuation but gives participating investors the right to buy into the next financing at a discount.\nThe funding falls well short of the company\u2019s goal to raise US$125-million, which would enable General Fusion to fully develop its LM26 fusion demonstration device and reach the 100-million-degree temperatures needed to cross what it calls scientific break-even \u2013 the point beyond which the machine would produce more energy than it takes in if it were to be loaded with the appropriate fuel mix.\nGeneral Fusion would then set out to build a larger working reactor to prove the viability of the technology as a method of commercial power generation. Other companies in a global race to develop limitless and clean fusion energy, include Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy, TAE Technologies and Zap Energy.\nBut the geopolitical environment \u2013 including U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s fondness for fossil-fuel industries \u2013 and shaky markets for complex, experimental technologies, has hurt capital-raising efforts.\nMr. Twinney wrote in an open letter in May the company faced \u201cunexpected and urgent financing constraints,\u201d which forced it to lay off one-quarter of staff and reduce operations. \u201cWe needed capital, really quickly,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe were running out of time.\u201d\nAdam Rodman, chief investment officer with Segra Capital Management, a Palm Beach, Fla.-based hedge fund which first invested in 2021, said in an interview that he and other \u201cproactive interested shareholders\u201d felt the best course would be a modest, quick financing round led by existing investors to give the company \u201cthe least amount of capital possible\u201d to reach its next scientific goal.\nThat involves heating the plasma, which contains an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium, in its test device to 10 million degrees. General Fusion expects to achieve that within a year. Segra bought more than its pro-rata share, increasing its stake to 12.5 per cent from 5 per cent. Mr. Rodman is also joining the board.\nMr. Twinney said once General Fusion hits the 10-million-degree goal, \u201cit significantly changes the game because it proves out the first milestone of our science in LM26. We\u2019ve seen competitors raise capital on that. We\u2019ve also learned from many global investors that this milestone is important for them.\u201d\nDavid Barr, CEO of PenderFund Capital Management Ltd., another long-standing investor, said his firm put nearly US$5-million in the round \u2013 increasing its stake to 11 per cent from 3 per cent and gaining a board seat \u2013 because of General Fusion\u2019s narrowed focus on getting its demonstration device \u201ctoward a more commercially viable end point and doing so in a more capital-efficient way.\u201d\nGeneral Fusion was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who sought to revive an approach to nuclear fusion that was shelved in the 1970s. The method, which is different from other companies\u2019, includes using a metal sheath to momentarily contain and then rapidly compress plasma to reach the temperatures and pressures needed to initiate fusion reactions.\nAfter years of development in B.C., General Fusion agreed with the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority in 2022 to build its own demonstration reactor in Oxfordshire. It put those plans on hold a year later as the company focused on the LM26 in Canada to prove out its technology.\nThe test machine is not designed to generate electricity because it only uses deuterium, rather than the deuterium-tritium mix that can deliver a higher energy return. But it is the precursor to a full-scale fusion reactor the company ultimately hopes to develop.\nLast spring the LM26 machine successfully compressed and heated deuterium plasma that was injected into a solid lithium liner. Prior to its downsizing, General Fusion said it was on track to achieve the 100 million degrees needed to ignite fusion reactions in 2026 using the deuterium-tritium mix.\nWith files from Ivan Semeniuk"

      "text": "General Fusion laid off at least 25% of its employees last week, just days after hitting a key milestone for its latest fusion demonstration device.\nCEO Greg Twinney posted an open letter on the company\u2019s website Monday saying that while its new LM26 device had been able to compress a plasma \u2014 something necessary for fusion conditions \u2014 General Fusion was running short of money. He wrote, \u201c[T]oday\u2019s funding landscape is more challenging than ever as investors and governments navigate a rapidly shifting and uncertain political and market climate.\u201d\nThe 23-year-old company, which many still describe as a startup, is Canada\u2019s leading entrant in the race for commercial fusion power. It has raised $440 million, according to PitchBook, including a $22.66 million round that closed in July. Backers include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, and BDC Capital. But that money hasn\u2019t been enough for the company to show that its unique approach to fusion is viable.\nGeneral Fusion\u2019s plight highlights the challenges that face the fusion industry.\nTo date, only one device has been able to hit so-called scientific breakeven, a milestone that\u2019s significant historically but not commercially. To hit commercial breakeven, reactors need to produce dozens of times more energy than has been demonstrated so far.\nThe road to those milestones has proven extraordinarily costly. Though General Fusion\u2019s tally may seem impressive, it is middle of the pack. Commonwealth Fusion Systems has raised over $2 billion, Helion has pulled in over $1 billion, and upstart Pacific Fusion has been pledged $900 million in its Series A alone.\nPart of General Fusion\u2019s challenge is that it\u2019s taking a different approach than many of its competitors.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nMost fusion startups follow one of two paths: magnetic confinement or inertial confinement. The former uses magnetic fields to control plasma, squeezing it until it reaches the conditions for nuclei to fuse. The latter approach typically uses lasers to compress a fuel pellet.\nGeneral Fusion, on the other hand, has been trying to use steam-driven pistons to compress fusion fuel. The U.S. Navy tried something similar in the 1970s to no avail, but General Fusion thinks that modern computers could solve some of the timing problems that plagued earlier attempts. It has yet to show that\u2019s the case, but it has said that if completed, LM26 should be able to reach scientific breakeven.\nNow the company will have to raise more money \u2014 and quickly \u2014 if it wants to prove its approach is a viable competitor."

      "text": "Last week was a momentous one for B.C.-based General Fusion, as it conducted a successful test of the machine it hopes will lead to the development of a commercial scale fusion reactor.\nThat was Tuesday.\nBy Friday the company had laid off at least one quarter of its staff and reduced operations in response to a capital shortfall that puts its plans at risk as competitors in the United States and elsewhere push ahead with their own efforts to develop fusion power.\n\u201cThe last thing we want to do is slow things down and lose this race,\u201d said Greg Twinney, the company\u2019s chief executive officer.\nIn an open letter issued on Monday, General Fusion announced it is actively seeking new funding from private and government partners to address a situation it described as both unexpected and urgent.\nMr. Twinney told The Globe and Mail the company is seeking US$125-million in additional funding to complete development of its LM26 device and achieve the 100-million-degree temperatures needed to cross \u201cscientific break-even\u201d \u2013 a threshold that means the machine would be capable of producing more energy than it absorbs to ignite nuclear reactions.\nSuch an achievement would set the stage for building a working reactor that is double the size to prove the viability of the technology as a method of commercial power generation.\nBut with resources running out and investors limiting their risk in an uncertain financial climate, General Fusion says its path has become much more challenging.\n\u201cWe need to weather the short term to unlock the potential of the company in the longer term,\u201d Mr. Twinney said.\nThe stakes could hardly be higher. General Fusion has emerged as Canada\u2018s champion in a global effort to harness the same form of energy source that makes the sun shine. If successful, it would be a transformative technology that provides virtually limitless, carbon-free electricity.\nThe practical hurdles remain enormous but governments and private investors around the world have committed about $8-billion to more than 40 companies seeking to develop commercial fusion, according to the U.S.-based Fusion Industry Association.\nOver the past 20 years, General Fusion has raised about US$350-million in financing, with about three quarters of that coming from private investors and one quarter from public sources \u2013 primarily the federal government through Canada\u2018s Strategic Innovation Fund.\nBut the current geopolitical environment \u2013 including the Trump administration\u2019s fondness for traditional fossil fuel industries \u2013 and shaky markets for early stage technologies have eroded the company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital. Investors have been \u201cstepping back and moving a lot slower than previously,\u201d Mr. Twinney said.\nGeneral Fusion\u2018s existing investors are looking for the company to bring in new sources of capital, he said. That could include financing that cuts the valuation of the company with new investors setting conditions while earlier backers who don\u2019t participate see their stakes sharply diluted.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be flexible on valuation to raise the capital we need during this opportunistic time\u201d for investors willing to put up the needed funds, Mr. Twinney said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a burden carried by existing investors that don\u2019t participate for sure.\u201d\nHe said the company is also looking to re-engage with the federal government \u201cat the highest levels\u201d in the aftermath of last week\u2019s election.\n\u201cWe\u2019re an important technology for Canada,\u201d Mr. Twinney said.\nAxel Meisen, president of the Fusion Energy Council of Canada, which includes both industry and academic partners, said Ottawa and the government of British Columbia will need to act quickly to arrive at a decision on whether to support General Fusion materially or not.\n\u201cIt will be a test for the newly elected federal government to consider how to make such decisions,\u201d he said.\nDr. Meisen added that General Fusion\u2018s dilemma could have consequences for hundreds of specialized workers across an industry that is still in its embryonic stages in Canada and is receiving more support in other countries.\n\u201cIf General Fusion scales down significantly, it will result in a loss of expertise not only at General Fusion but also supplier industries and related research centres,\u201d he said.\nMonday\u2019s announcement is the latest twist in a winding journey for the company co-founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who sought to revive an approach to nuclear fusion that was shelved in the 1970s. Now called \u201cmagnetized target fusion,\u201d the method includes using a metal sheath to momentarily contain and then rapidly compress plasma to reach the temperatures and pressures needed to initiate fusion reactions.\nThe approach is different from those pursued by other companies, including Commonwealth Fusion Systems of Massachusetts, which had raised more than US$2-billion by last year \u2013 the largest capitalization in the industry to date \u2013 to build a small tokamak reactor that uses superconducting magnets to confine plasma.\nAfter years of development in B.C., General Fusion announced an agreement with the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority in 2022 to build its own demonstration reactor in Oxfordshire. However, those plans were put on hold a year later when the company said it was focusing on building a new machine in Canada \u2013 the LM26 \u2013 to prove out its technology.\nThe machine is not designed to generate electricity because it only uses deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, rather than the deuterium-tritium mix that can deliver a higher energy return. But it is the precursor to a full scale fusion reactor that the company envisions as its ultimate goal.\nDuring last week\u2019s test, the LM26 machine successfully compressed and heated deuterium plasma that was injected into a solid lithium liner. The next milestone, which Mr. Twinney said could be achieved in a matter of months, is achieving temperatures in the plasma of 10 million degrees. Prior to downsizing, the company said it was on track to achieve 100 million degrees, needed to ignite fusion reactions, at some point next year.\n\u201cThe quicker we can get capital in, the quicker we can get back to growth and demonstrating these milestones,\u201d Mr. Twinney said. \u201cWe need urgent capital to keep the momentum going.\nEditor\u2019s note: This article has been updated to correct the reference to magnetized target fusion."

      "text": "Deuterium\u2013tritium fusion\nDeuterium\u2013tritium fusion (D-T fusion) is a type of nuclear fusion in which one deuterium (2H) nucleus (deuteron) fuses with one tritium (3H) nucleus (triton), giving one helium-4 nucleus, one free neutron, and 17.6 MeV of total energy coming from both the neutron and helium. It is the best known fusion reaction for fusion power and thermonuclear weapons.\nTritium, one of the reactants for D-T fusion, is radioactive. In fusion reactors, a 'breeding blanket' made of lithium orthosilicate or other lithium-bearing ceramics, is placed on the walls of the reactor, as lithium, when exposed to energetic neutrons, will produce tritium.\nConcept\n[edit]In D-T fusion, one deuteron fuses with one tritium, yielding one helium nucleus, a free neutron, and 17.6 MeV, which is derived from about 0.02 AMU.[1] The amount of energy obtained is described by the mass\u2013energy equivalence: E = mc2. 80% of the energy (14.1 MeV) becomes kinetic energy of the neutron traveling at 1/6 the speed of light.\nThe mass difference between 2H+3H and neutron+4He is described by the semi-empirical mass formula that describes the relation between mass defects and binding energy in a nucleus.\nDiscovery\n[edit]Evidence of D-T fusion was first detected at the University of Michigan in 1938 by Arthur J. Ruhlig.[2][3] His experiment detected the signature of neutrons with energy greater than 15 MeV in secondary reactions of 3H created in 2H(d,p)3H reactions of a 0.5 MeV incident deuteron beam on a heavy phosphoric acid target, 2H3PO4. This discovery was largely unrecognized until recently.[4]\nReactant sourcing\n[edit]About 1 in every 6700 hydrogen atoms in seawater is deuterium, making it easy to acquire.[1][5]\nTritium, however, is a radioisotope with a short half-life and no natural sources. This can be circumvented by exposing lithium to energetic neutrons, which produces tritons.[1][5] Also, D-T fusion itself emits a free neutron, which can be used to bombard lithium.[6] A 'breeding blanket', made of lithium orthosilicate, is often placed along the walls of fusion reactors so that free neutrons created by D-T fusion react with it to produce more 3H.[7][8] This process is called tritium breeding.\nFusion reactors\n[edit]D-T fusion is planned to be used in ITER,[7] and many other proposed fusion reactors. It has many advantages over other types of fusion, as it has a relatively low minimum temperature, 108 kelvin.[9]\nSpin polarization\n[edit]Spin-polarized D-T fuel can increase tritium burn efficiency (TBE) by an order of magnitude or more without compromising output. TBE increases nonlinearly with decreasing tritium fraction, while power density increases roughly linearly with D-T cross section. In a 481 MW ARC-like tokamak with unpolarized 53:47 D-T fuel, the minimum tritium inventory was 0.69 kg. Spin-polarizing the fuel with a 63:37 D-T mix reduces the required tritium to 0.03 kg. With advancements in helium divertor pumping efficiency, TBE values of approximately 10%\u201340% could be achieved using low-tritium-fraction spin-polarized fuel with minimal power loss. This lowers tritium startup inventory requirements.[10]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ a b c \"Nuclear Fusion\". Georgia State University.

      "text": "General Fusion announced on Tuesday that it had successfully created plasma, a superheated fourth state of matter required for fusion, inside a prototype reactor. The milestone marks the beginning of a 93-week quest to prove that the outfit\u2019s steampunk approach to fusion power remains a viable contender.\nThe reactor, called Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), is General Fusion\u2019s latest iteration in a string of devices that have tested various parts of its unique approach. The company assembled LM26 in just 16 months, and it hopes to hit \u201cbreakeven\u201d sometime in 2026.\nGeneral Fusion is one of the oldest fusion companies still operating. Founded in 2002, it has raised $440 million to date, according to PitchBook. Over that time, it has seen competitors rise and fall, and, like the fusion industry writ large, it has failed to meet breakeven promises, including one made over 20 years ago.\nIn fusion power, there are two points at which a reaction is said to breakeven. The one most people think of is called commercial breakeven. That\u2019s when a fusion reaction produces more power than the entire facility consumes, allowing the power plant to put electricity on the grid. No one has reached this milestone yet.\nThe other is known as scientific breakeven. In this case, the fusion reaction needs to produce at least as much power as was delivered directly to the fuel. Scientific breakeven only looks within the boundaries of the experimental system, ignoring the rest of the facility. Still, it\u2019s an important milestone for any fusion attempt. So far, only the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Ignition Facility has reached it.\nGeneral Fusion\u2019s approach to fusion power differs significantly from other startups. Called magnetized target fusion (MTF), it\u2019s similar in some regards to inertial confinement, the technique the National Ignition Facility used in late 2022 to prove that fusion reactions could generate more power than was required to start them.\nBut where the National Ignition Facility uses lasers to compress a fuel pellet, General Fusion\u2019s MTF reactor design relies on steam-driven pistons. Inside the chamber, deuterium-tritium fuel is zapped with a bit of electricity to generate a magnetic field, which helps keep the plasma contained. The pistons then drive a liquid lithium wall inward on the plasma, compressing it.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nAs the fuel is compressed, its temperature rises until it sparks a fusion reaction. The reaction then heats the liquid lithium, which the company plans to circulate through a heat exchanger to create steam and spin a generator.\nMTF emerged in the 1970s from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, where researchers were developing concepts for compact fusion reactors. Those efforts didn\u2019t bear fruit. General Fusion says that\u2019s because the pistons compressing the liquid liner weren\u2019t controlled precisely enough, and that modern computers now provide a better chance at executing the complex choreography.\nWhatever LM26 accomplishes, General Fusion still has more work to do. The device doesn\u2019t have the liquid lithium wall, instead relying on solid lithium compressed by electromagnets. That limits the number of test runs the company can take since it takes longer to reset the device. The company has made progress on a prototype of the liquid wall, performing over 1,000 tests to see how it holds up over time, but integrating everything will still be a monumental engineering challenge.\nFlipping the switch on LM26 is nonetheless a significant step for a company that is now racing to deliver a power plant alongside a host of newcomers with their own deep pocketbooks and aggressive timelines."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.
