      "feedback": "The draft is on‑target for the 3–6 month horizon and stays within the CRWD focus, but it falls short on several Argos criteria: 1) **Canonical mapping** – explicitly link the view to the CRWD ticker (CRWD) with a sign (positive revenue growth, negative margin pressure) and a magnitude range (e.g., +5 % to +7 % YoY revenue, +1 pp to +2 pp margin). 2) **Citation density** – every quantitative claim (Q2 revenue $1.17 bn, 22.4 % YoY growth, current gross margin –4.2 %, projected 8.1 % margin in 3 yrs, Q3 revenue 5–7 % YoY, margin 1–2 pp improvement) must be anchored to the source ID (KNWKYIQ1W). 3) **Catalyst window** – specify exact dates: Falcon Next‑Gen Identity launch (27 Aug 2025) and Q3 earnings release (≈30 Aug 2025). 4) **Invalidation signals** – list concrete triggers (e.g., Q3 revenue <5 % YoY, margin <1 pp improvement, identity‑security adoption <10 % of ARR, competitor launch of a comparable platform). 5) **Scenario structure** – present a clear base case, a “slow‑margin” alternative, and a “strong‑adoption” upside, each with distinct driver paths and quantitative outcomes. 6) **Cross‑asset reach** – while the focus is CRWD, note any spill‑over to broader tech indices (e.g., NASDAQ‑100) or sector sentiment (cybersecurity). 7) **Confidence rating** – quantify (e.g., moderate‑high) and justify with evidence. 8) **Actionable language** – replace vague “margin improvement” with “gross margin rise from –4.2 % to 8.1 % by 2028” and state the implied valuation impact (e.g., PE shift from –653.4x to 264.0x). Incorporating these edits will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity rule, provide a defensible causal chain, and meet the 3–6 month scenario‑catalyst framework.",
