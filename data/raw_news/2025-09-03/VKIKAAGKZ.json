  "title": "Nudist resort up in arms as owners 'force them to wear clothes'",
  "description": "Tenants of Olive Dell Ranch in Colton, California, have expressed their fury in a new lawsuit, where they claim the management are forcing them to wear clothes.",
  "content": "A group of residents of a California nudist resort are suing the new owners, claiming they are being forced to wear clothes or face being evicted.\n\nTenants of Olive Dell Ranch in Colton claim new management that took over are actively neglecting it in order to remove residents.\n\nPast and present residents clubbed together to file a lawsuit against the owners, in which they claim problems started shortly after the property changed hands.\n\nThe first change, according to residents, was a notice left in mail boxes informing them they would need to start wearing clothes at the start of this year.\n\nIt said: 'Olive Dell RV Park and Resort is now a textile park. Starting January 6, 2025 clothing with be required at all times within the park premises.\n\n'Including all sites at Olive Dell RV Park and Resort', with the notice being signed by the new owners.\n\nSpeaking with KTLA, residents claimed the changes were aimed at driving nudists out of the resort.\n\nNancy Roeder, a resident for over ten years, told the outlet: 'We\u2019re just trying to survive. We\u2019re in survival mode at this point.\n\nAccording to Roeder and other residents, the owners also inflated utility bills and rents, threatened evictions and removed electric meters from their homes.\n\nAmenities covered by their annual memberships have also been cut out, they allege, and the property is said to have fallen into a state of disrepair.\n\nOn-site facilities like the communal swimming pool has turned green, the laundry room is now boarded up, the sauna shut off alongside hot water in community areas.\n\nRoeder added: 'I'm getting a $500 [utility bill] and I should not have a $500 bill, it should be less than $100. I have 500 square feet.'\n\nShe told the outlet that people were paying the bills due to them being threatened with being kicked out, or face having their electric meter removed.\n\nPenny Palmer, another resident, added: 'They illegally raised our rents and they attacked our lifestyle.'\n\nOne former front desk employee Sunshine Lorick told the outlet that she was fired after questioning the practices of the new management team.\n\nLorick explained: 'She wanted me to charge extra money on people's bills, and I was refusing to do it.'\n\nThe outlet spoke with a woman known only as Darlene who is the property manager, she accused residents of vandalism and failing to pay their bills on time.\n\nRoeder added: 'I\u2019m going to stay here till the very end. I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.'\n\nThe ranch, in the foothills of the San Jacinto Mountains, made headlines last year following the killing of Stephanie, 73, and Daniel Menard, 79.\n\nThe couple were found in August of 2024 underneath a concrete bunker at the home of neighbor Michael Royce Sparks.\n\nSparks is to stand trial over their deaths, with a court hearing earlier this year that the couple had taunted him about a hot dog.\n\nAt a hearing in June, a witness in the community testified that Sparks and his alleged victims often argued and had a fraught relationship before the killings.\n\nThey said they lived next door to each other, and had clashed over issues including a tree overhanging the Menards' yard and a noisy generator.\n\nBut the witness said the rift turned violent due to Sparks feeling humiliated after Menard bought him a $1 hot dog.\n\nA judge subsequently ruled that there is sufficient evidence for Sparks to stand trial for the murder of the couple, which he has pleaded not guilty to.\n\nDaily Mail have contacted legal representatives for the management of Olive Dell for comment on the suit.",

Something going on where you live. Are you in town?'\nAccording to texts shown in court on Monday, Sparks replied: 'It's me. Committing suicide today. Take care. Bye.'\n'Wait. What\u2019s going on? Where are you?' she responded.\n'Chopped up my neighbors. Didn\u2019t know I had it in me. SNAPPED,' Sparks said back.\nSparks was described as a popular figure at the Olive Dell Ranch where the slayings took place\nCops then raced to Sparks' home, where they found him in his trailer bunker holding a long rifle.\nSparks tried to shoot himself, but the rifle jammed, and when asked by cops where the Menards were, he said 'they were underneath the trailer and that they didn\u2019t need any help', Williams said in his testimony.\n'He replied back that they were in pieces.'"
