      "feedback": "The draft achieves the basic structure (4 movers: 2 Up, 2 Down + a Swing Trade), but to reach world-class quality you should tighten the causal logic, sharpen the scenario mapping, and harden the trading specifics. Actionable edits: 1) Tie every mover explicitly to one of the four regime archetypes and articulate a clean first-principles causal chain (policy regime → macro transmission → sector/capital costs and pricing → stock-level cash flow/pricing). For example, Up 0–3 weeks should anchor to a Tariff/reshoring regime with a tight real-rate/terms-of-trade transmission, not just Costa/NVDA noise; Down 0–3 weeks should crystallize a Geopolitical/shock regime with a clear energy/logistics cost impulse; provide 1–2 sentence causal bridges and cite the exact regime weights (Regime A ~50%, Regime B ~25–30%, Regime C ~5–10%) from SGB2PAZGK with STBVARD8F as applicable. 2) Make each mover’s “What to watch” line a concrete trigger with numeric thresholds and explicit invalidation signals (e.g., tariff milestones or data-center capex prints crossing a threshold; BHVN/SPirit liquidity cues, with quantified disruption levels). 3) Reconcile and consolidate probabilities: anchor Up/Down lines to the evidence-backed regime probabilities (e.g., 50%/40%/35% as cited) and avoid ad hoc percentages; add a brief note on how shifts in CPI/wage momentum or geopolitical noise would move those lines. 4) Strengthen the Swing Trade: keep KO as the tradable anchor but render the plan in the required fields with precision (Direction: Long; Horizon: 3–6 months; Entry: at market; Stop: X% or price; Target: Y; R/R: Z; Invalidation: below a defined level; Trigger: break above/below a defined technical level or news event; Probability %; Confidence %). If you keep a single 3–6 month KO line, ensure the numeric Stop/Target are defensible from current price levels and cited metrics (e.g., KO’s forward multiple/yield and consensus target) and provide a crisp invalidation rule tied to a concrete price or neckline. 5) Ensure formatting discipline: the four Movers must be exactly 4 lines (2 Up, 2 Down) placed before the Swing Trade line, with each line following the exact field order and including citations after the numeric facts; keep all references to IDs strictly from the SOURCE MATERIAL and reconcile any conflicts by noting the dominant regime narrative and the key catalysts (e.g., tariff milestones, Nvidia/AI capex cadence, Costa sale dynamics, Disney/KO read-throughs). 6) Sharpen coverage of critical sources: cross-check all cited IDs for consistency (SGB2PAZGK, STBVARD8F, 4661GWFP7, 2YP1X9B4T, I2SJU04DF, 4VN4UTWX1, Z5IA1CYUF, U3ZK13ZQI, etc.) and avoid introducing non-source numbers; if a line relies on a synthesis rather than a direct fact, flag it clearly as a scenario implication with no numeric assertion. 7) Eliminate narrative clutter around macro prose in the Movers; keep the four lines tightly scoped to drivers, mechanics, watch cues, and probabilities, and relocate the broader regime analysis to a concise preface or an annotated appendix (without leaking into the line items). Following these edits will yield a tighter, defensible, source-aligned Swing Trade/Outlook that reads with clear causal coherence and delivers high-signal, actionable content.",
