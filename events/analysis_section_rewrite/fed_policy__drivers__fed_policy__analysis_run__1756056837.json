      "feedback": "Strong scaffolding and topical coverage are evident (macro AI productivity, Ford as a margin/cash-flow proxy, oil/policy tilts, and tariff structure), but the piece would rise to world-class by tightening the causal chain, sharpening horizons, and tightening quantification and sourcing. Actionable edits: (1) Rebuild the causal map into a crisp, first-principles chain: AI-driven productivity lifts unit margins and ROIC via lower labor costs and higher capacity utilization; retraining/UBI buffers stabilize demand and curb disinflationary pressure from displaced workers; policy regime shifts (Regime 1 vs Regime 2) determine the persistence and magnitude of pricing power and capex cadence. Tie each link explicitly to observable variables and cite the exact figures you have (for example, Ford: EV losses ~$1.3B, adj. EBIT ~4.3%, ROIC ~10.0–10.1%, capex plan up to $50B through 2026 with pause risk up to $12B); JD/IEA oil signals or tariff dynamics should feed the same chain (e.g., oil supply/demand gap, 15% Regime A tariff envelope). (2) Adopt a clearly defined horizon and scenario structure (Baseline, Regime 1, Regime 2, and a Transitional path) with explicit state variables (AI-adoption rate, retraining/UBI uptake, tariff timing, oil inventory levels) and concrete, testable inflection points. (3) Build a numbers-heavy, explicitly sourced base-case: anchor Ford’s cash-flow trajectory to the midpoints/caps you’ve cited and quantify a plausible range for margin/ROIC under each regime, rather than qualitative statements; where ranges exist (e.g., 2.5% revenue CAGR noted in 22PL3Q360, oil supply +2.5 mbpd from J99EM2TPZ, IEA forecast, 15% tariff envelope RHFWI02JT), present them as probabilistic bands with upper/lower bounds. (4) Expand catalysts and invalidation triggers with precise thresholds: AI-adoption speed crossing a defined adoption-rate or productivity KPI; retraining/UBI policy milestones; Ford’s quarterly margin/ROIC inflections; EV-capex pacing changes; oil-supply/demand deltas hitting a threshold; tariff pause/renewal dates; and explicit “hard invalidation” events (e.g., regime shift confirmation via a composite indicator). (5) Reconcile conflicts and expose fragilities: e.g., oversupply in oil versus inflation/real-rate implications; tariff regime risk versus near-term pause benefits; ensure you explain how each tension would alter the macro-to-mirm-to-valuation transmission. (6) Maximize citation density and accuracy: attach each substantive assertion to a cited ID (NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, J99EM2TPZ, RHFWI02JT) and avoid mixing non-overlapping source claims; note any inconsistencies (e.g., the truncated Navarro tariff item) and verify with the full source. (7) Strengthen SECTION FOCUS alignment: explicitly synthesize cross-topic drivers (macro, policy, flows/positioning, valuation/technicals) in a single, coherent thread, then deliver a concise watch-list of decisive signals and a short list of material risk factors. (8) Replace generic language with precise, situated language tied to the data; ensure the near-term catalysts section is complete and not truncated. (9) If any source text is incomplete (e.g., “Navarro’s proposal of a 50% tari” and the oil narrative cutoffs), confirm the full item and, if missing, flag as a data gap rather than force-fitting an interpretation. (10) Deliver a revised draft that keeps the base-case, clearly delineates regime-driven outcome bands, and ends with a one-page watch-list and a 2–3 sentence synthesis of fragility and upside.",
