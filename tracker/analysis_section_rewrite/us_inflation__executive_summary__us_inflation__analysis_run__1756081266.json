      "feedback": "The draft tries a comprehensive regime-based narrative, but the presentation is too long, repetitious, and hard to extract a decisionable house view; tighten to 4–6 concise sentences (or bullets) that state a single base case (Regime A with ~50% probability, Regime B ~25–30%, Regime C ~5–10%), the causal chain (policy/inflation dynamics → discount rate → crypto valuation via ETF/institutional flows and staking yields), and a crisp actionable stance on exposure to ETH/BTC; anchor claims in first principles (DCF-like discount-rate sensitivity to regime shifts) and keep price anchors explicit (ETH around 4,955; BTC around 124,496; ETH staking ~33%, stablecoins ~40% of blockchain fees) with ranges where possible. Improve specificity by listing 3–4 catalysts and 3–4 invalidation/triggers with thresholds (e.g., inflation persistence or a Jackson Hole pivot; ETF/inflows turning negative; ETH not holding 4k or BTC not staying above 100k; regulatory progress like Project Crypto/GENIUS Act materializing) and tie each to a regime outcome; ensure each assertion cites an ID from SOURCE MATERIAL and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., probabilities or price paths cited in different sections) so they align across the 0–3 month and multi-year frames. Recast the private-market signals (Pacaso, Range, HeartSciences, Walmart private-label momentum) as marginal catalysts rather than base drivers, and deliver a clean, executive verdict on posture, exposure ranges, and risk controls with explicit watch-list items and data cadence (Jackson Hole speeches, CPI/PCE prints, wage data, debt trajectory) supported by IDs like OGK8WLL69, NL5YYTLF2, EPJYXB7DX, YQOMV2HAJ, SGB2PAZGK, T1QE6JPIX, and U6HXAJR4J.",
