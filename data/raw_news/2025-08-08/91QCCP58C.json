He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we\u2019ve had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.\n\n\u201cWe understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what\u2019s best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what\u2019s best for him.\u201d\n\nThe 2025-26 season will mark James\u2019 23rd season in the NBA, and he has a no-trade clause in his contract.",

      "text": "Luka Doncic revealed just how dramatic his physical transformation has been this offseason.\nThe Lakers star looks like a different person than the one who finished last season, losing weight and adding muscle.\nHe was recently on the cover of Men\u2019s Health, where he detailed the two-a-day workouts he\u2019s been doing in Croatia, along with a gluten-free, low-sugar diet \u2014 complete with 250 grams of protein and one almond milk\u2013fueled shake a day.\nThis week, Doncic said he\u2019s lost 31 pounds in total during an interview on Slovenian Pop TV.\nDoncic finished last season listed at 230 pounds.\nConcerns over his conditioning and eating habits reportedly caused Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison to be hesitant to give Doncic a lucrative supermax extension and subsequently trade him to the Lakers in one of the most stunning blockbusters in recent memory.\nHe and the Lakers failed to make it out of the first round of the playoffs, with the Timberwolves finishing them off in five games.\n\u201cSo every summer I try my best to work on different things,\u201d Doncic told Men\u2019s Health. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m very competitive. This summer was just a little bit different, you know. It kind of motivated me to be even better. Just visually, I would say my whole body looks better.\u201d\nLast week, Doncic signed a three-year, $165 million max extension with the Lakers.\n\u201cI just signed my extension with the Lakers. Excited to keep working to bring championships to LA and make Laker Nation proud,\u201d Doncic posted on X. \u201cGrateful to the Lakers, my teammates and all the fans who\u2019ve shown so much love since day one.

      "text": "Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James is exercising his $52.6 million player option for the 2025-26 season, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul told ESPN on Sunday.\nJames, the NBA's career scoring leader, wants to compete for a championship next season and potentially beyond and will be closely monitoring the Lakers' moves and whether the team is positioning itself this offseason to field a title-contending roster, Paul said.\n\"LeBron wants to compete for a championship,\" Paul told ESPN. \"He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we've had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.\n\"We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.\"\nJames, 40, is entering a record-setting 23rd NBA season and has said he remains uncertain about whether he has one campaign left or wants to play multiple more years.\nJames, who has a no-trade clause in his contract, is 50 games away from breaking Robert Parish's record for most career regular-season games. Next season he will break a tie with Vince Carter for the most seasons played in NBA history.\nIt remains to be seen whether James will reach season No. 24 or beyond. James went out to dinner in New York this past week with his wife, Savannah, Miami Heat big man Kevin Love and his wife, Kate, and other confidants, and one of the dinner guests posted a snippet of the night to Instagram where James can be heard saying, \"[Savannah] wants me to f---ing retire in the next year or so.\"\nAs Paul laid out, it remains to be seen how much of his playing future will remain with the Lakers -- despite what James has said in the past.\nIn February 2024, after the Warriors inquired about trading for James before the Lakers, through Paul, told Golden State they were not interested, James expressed his desire to continue playing for the purple and gold.\n\"I am a Laker, and I'm happy and been very happy being a Laker the last six years and hopefully it stays that way,\" James said.\nA few months later, Los Angeles drafted James' eldest son, Bronny James, with the No. 55 pick to set up the historic father-son tandem, then signed LeBron James to a two-year, $104 million contract extension in July 2024.\nJames is a four-time NBA champion, four-time Finals MVP and four-time league MVP, and he has made 21 All-Star teams and 21 All-NBA squads; he is also the first 40-year-old to make an All-NBA team. He joined the Lakers in 2018 and led the franchise to the 2020 NBA title and the 2023 Western Conference finals.\nHe averaged 24.4 points, 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds per game this past season, ending his record 20-year streak of averaging at least 25 points per game. He was one of three players to average 25 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists from Dec. 30 to the end of the season, along with Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic.\nJames returned to on-court basketball activity this week after suffering a sprained MCL in his left knee in Game 5 of the Lakers' first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves. James averaged 25.4 points, 9.0 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 2.0 steals and 1.8 blocks in 40.8 minutes per game against the Timberwolves.\nFollowing the loss to Minnesota, he spoke openly about the disappointment of not having a chance to compete for a fifth title.\n\"Every season that I did not make it to the Finals or did not win the championship has been a disappointment,\" James said. \"So it'd be the same for me. It'd be the same offseason of disappointment and unfulfillment, having an opportunity to play longer and give yourself an opportunity to play for the Larry O'Brien Trophy. Nothing changes for me.\"\nJames was asked about the Lakers' glaring need to add a center, after coach JJ Redick went away from starting big man Jaxson Hayes and finished the Minnesota series with a small-ball lineup, and refrained from expounding on the subject. James said he should keep his thoughts to himself, referring to the Lakers' trade of Anthony Davis to the Dallas Mavericks on Feb. 1, just nine days after Davis told ESPN, \"I think we need another big.\"\n\"No comment,\" James said. \"I never say that. 'Cause my guy AD said what he needed, and he was gone the following week. So I got no comment.\"\nThe Lakers are pursuing a center via free agency or trade, while forward Dorian Finney-Smith declined his player option Sunday, sources said.\nESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this report."

      "text": "A new video shows ex-NFL star Terrell Suggs brandishing a gun before he was arrested in April 2024 following an incident at a Starbucks in Arizona the month prior.\nThe video, published Friday by TMZ, shows the full altercation between Suggs and a man at the Starbucks drive-through, ending with Suggs dangling a gun out of his car\u2019s window before driving away.\nThe incident began when the man alleged that Suggs backed his car up and hit his vehicle in an effort to get closer to the Starbucks intercom.\n\u201cYou just backed into me, man,\u201d the man said, with Suggs responding: \u201cBack the f\u2013k up.\u201d\nAfter some more back-and-forth, the man got out of his car and walked over to Suggs\u2019 vehicle, with the former Ravens star stepping outside to confront him.\nSuggs went on to insist that he did not hit the man\u2019s car before the two men got back into their respective vehicles.\nSuggs then picked up his order from the drive-through window and flipped the bird at the man through his car window as he started driving away.\nAfter some more jawing between the two men from their respective cars, Suggs asked, \u201cDo you want to go?\u201d multiple times before adding, \u201cI\u2019ll kill your b\u2013ch ass.\u201d\nThen, as he began driving out of the drive-through line, Suggs held the gun out of his window, staring back at the man.\nAfter an investigation, Maricopa County Police arrested Suggs and the 42-year-old was charged with one count of threatening or intimidating and one count of disorderly conduct.\nSuggs pleaded guilty to the disorderly conduct charge in February and was sentenced to 18 months of supervised probation.\nA rep for Suggs issued a statement to TMZ in the wake of the footage being released.\n\u201cThere was an incident at a Starbucks drive-through in which Terrell attempted to safely back out of the lane when the individual behind him became hostile and falsely accused Terrell of making contact with his vehicle, which did not occur,\u201d Denise White told TMZ.\n\u201cThe situation escalated when the individual exited his car and approached Terrell in a confrontational manner. Notably, the individual had not placed an order in the Starbucks line, which led Terrell to believe he might continue to follow him, causing Terrell to feel threatened.\u201d\nWhite added that \u201cat no point\u201d did her client \u201cpoint a firearm at the individual, but that Suggs \u201cmade it clear that he was prepared to protect himself if necessary. Arizona is an open carry state, and Terrell is aware of the responsibilities that come with firearm ownership. He recognizes that he should not have displayed his weapon, but his actions were solely in response to feeling threatened and were not intended to escalate the situation further.\u201d\nSuggs, who was an outside linebacker, is widely considered one of the best Ravens of all time.\nHe spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons in Baltimore, earning seven Pro-Bowl selections and one All-Pro nod.\nThe Arizona State product also won the Super Bowl with Baltimore in 2012 and captured a second ring with the Chiefs in 2019."

Some have posited that the true cause of this situation was the Lakers not offering LeBron a contract beyond next season, but Rich Paul told me that they never asked for one.\u201d\nJames, who partied at a Bad Bunny concert in Puerto Rico on Friday before trekking to Las Vegas to watch his son, Bronny James, play one night later, averaged 24.4 points per game during the 2024-25 campaign \u2014 helping the Lakers clinch the Western Conference\u2019s No. 3 seed before falling in the first round of the playoffs.\nTwo months after their postseason exit, it\u2019s still unclear if that Game 5 loss to the Timberwolves will serve as his last game in Los Angeles.\nAnd James declining to talk Saturday night \u2014 when Bronny scored 14 points on 5-for-11 shooting and even received in-game coaching from his father, according to the Los Angeles Times \u2014 certainly won\u2019t help quell any speculation, either."
