      "summary": "Russia and China have signed a legally binding memorandum to advance construction of the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which will deliver an additional 50 billion cubic metres of gas per year to China via Mongolia from the Yamal Arctic fields. The deal also includes a rise in supplies through the existing Power of Siberia line from 38 bcm to 44 bcm, though pricing remains under negotiation and China seeks significant discounts. The agreement signals Russia’s pivot to China after losing much of its European gas market to U.S. sanctions, and underscores China’s continued energy trade with Russia despite Western pressure.",
