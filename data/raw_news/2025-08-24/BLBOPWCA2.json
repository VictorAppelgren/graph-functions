  "title": "Converted lighthouse with hot tub and wild geese voted best in the UK",
  "description": "Built in 1830, the converted Lincolnshire lighthouse that was once home to British conservationist and painter Sir Peter Scott, is winning over visitors too",
  "content": "With the changing colours of Autumn just around the corner, now is one of the best times of year to head outdoors. From riverside walks and woodland wanders, from pretty villages to bustling market towns, Lincolnshire is one county that has plenty to offer. Set on the banks of the River Nene just outside Sutton Bridge, the Sir Peter Scott Lighthouse is an unusual and striking base from which to enjoy the far reaching views. Overlooking the Wash National Nature Reserve, the converted lighthouse combines historic character with award-winning accommodation. The quirky stay is so special it was a winner in the Sykes Gem Awards, earning a Gold award for Best Historic Property in 2024, alongside the Bronze for Best in Central England.\n\nBuilt in 1830, the lighthouse remains operational to guide ships through tidal channels and was once the home of conservationist and painter Sir Peter Scott. Today, it has been converted into holiday accommodation situated across three floors. Scott was a British conservationist, painter and ornithologist who played a leading role in protecting wetlands and bird species. He co-founded the World Wildlife Fund, established the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and dedicated much of his life to wildlife conservation along the Wash and beyond. Accessed by country roads, the gated property sits on the River Nene leading out to The Wash, with over half an acre of grounds and parking for four cars. Inside, the ground floor includes a kitchen with garden access, a circular dining room and a sitting room with a cosy woodburning stove for snuggling up on chilly autumnal evenings. There is also a bathroom and two bedrooms, with one leading through to a games room and kitchenette.\n\nThe lower ground floor has a king-size bedroom with en-suite, while the upper floors contain a twin room, a single room once used by Sir Peter Scott. The light gallery at the very top offers panoramic views across the landscape. Guests staying at the lighthouse have access to modern amenities such as WiFi, television, electric central heating, and a washing machine. Bed linen, towels and fuel for the woodburning stove are included, and two well-behaved pets are also permitted. The property notes that certain areas, including a private wildlife conservation area with ponds, are not accessible to visitors in order to protect local species. The lighthouse sits on the Wash National Nature Reserve, the largest reserve in England, covering more than 8,800 hectares of mudflats and salt marsh. The area is internationally significant for birdlife, particularly during the winter months between November and February, when large numbers of wild geese migrate to the site.\n\nLocated 2.7 miles from Sutton Bridge, the lighthouse is close to local shops and pubs and within reach of riverside walks, including the Sir Peter Scott Walk. Visitors can also explore nearby attractions such as King\u2019s Lynn, Sandringham Estate, Houghton Hall, and beaches at Hunstanton and Gibraltar Point. For adventurers looking for other quirky places to stay in the UK, the Standby Generator Bunker in Dorset is a former RAF bunker that has been converted into a smart home by the coast. Elsewhere in Sussex, Hoots is a luxurious treehouse with all mod cons in an area of outstanding natural beauty. Over at Haverford West in Wales, St Ann's Head Lighthouse offers a selection of converted lighthouse cottages with rustic interiors, extensive sea views and coastal walks close by. Situated next to the St Ann's Head Lighthouse, the quirky cottages are nestled away at the western entrance to Milford Haven.\n\nGuests who have already stayed at the Sir Peter Scott Light House, have left glowing reviews on TripAdvisor. One said: \"What a blast,\" adding: \"We've had five nights in this beautiful, tranquil lighthouse celebrating my 40th birthday. It was more than I ever imagined with the views, wildlife, walks and shops close by. The beds were so comfortable, it was perfect.\" Another said: \"Peaceful location where you didn't feel that you had to leave the property to explore the local area. The interior was 'spot on' with plenty of room. Added bonus, of course, was the trip to the top of the lighthouse! The games room was also a great attraction for the kids.\" A third agreed, saying: \"It is truly a very special and atmospheric place. There are so many interesting things for nature lovers to be seen.\" However, one visitor did mention that they found the beds uncomfortable, adding: \"Beds are cheap and uncomfortable, especially for anyone higher than 170 cm - the duvets were also low quality and very short.\" In contrast, another five-star review said: \"Really special having the lighthouse to ourselves and being able to explore the tower. The games room was a big plus. Enjoyed watching the geese and other wildfowl, and walking locally in the area. Would highly recommend.\"",

      "text": "-\n\"The lighthouse is stunning and we loved the peaceful location.\"\nIt was great to meet Rod the goose man and to see the newly hatched Hawaiian goslings. We enjoyed the open spaces, the view from the tower and the games room.\nThere were six of us - four adults and two children. The kids loved the tower room but the second twin room is quite cramped for two adults.\nHi Emma,\nThank you for your feedback and really pleased that the lighthouse fully lived up to expectations and gave such a lovely and memorable experience for you all.\nI'm not quite sure which bedroom you are referring to, but we are sorry if you felt it was a bit on the small side.The lighthouse is the winner of Sykes Best Historic Property in the UK last year and is a grade II* listed building. Properties of this kind do come with quirks and features that make them so memorable to stay in .\nWe supply a floor plan on our sister website www.lighthouseholidays.uk as well as lots of other information which would be too much to provide in the Sykes main website\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Emma3.8\u2605Apr 2025\n-\n\"We had a fab stay at the lighthouse celebrating two milestone birthday!\"\nThe property is quirky and there was plenty of room for the 5 of us and 2 dogs! Rod the Goose Man was a welcome daily visitor\nHi Alison,\nCongratulations on the two milestone birthday and what more lovely place to celebrate it could you find than the lighthouse.\nThank you so much for your feedback. We have just had three baby Hawaiian geese hatch out and they are so cute and the rarest geese in the world, so Rod is super happy.\nWe look forward to seeing you again sometime soon.\nBest wishes\nDoug\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Alison4.7\u2605Mar 2025\n-\n\"Yes. I didn\u2019t get chance to leave you a note, the shower in the basement doesn\u2019t drain very well\"\nHi David,\nThank you very much for letting us know. i will contact Ben to take a look at it.\nBest regards Doug\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by David5.0\u2605Mar 2025\n-\n\"A wonderful place to stay, unique property which was perfect for my family and hounds.\"\nNeeds some maintenance, but this did not deter us from having a wonderful time.\nPlenty of wood was provided for log burning fire and a few binoculars to watch the birds.\nHi Ceri,\nThank you so much for your feedback and it's great that you had such a lovely time. The new paving by the gate has now been laid, so no more problems with opening it.\nLove to see you all again.\nDoug\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Ceri4.7\u2605Feb 2025\n-\n\"The lighthouse was absolutely fabulous.\"\nThe pictures on the website don\u2019t do it justice to be honest. We were completely blown away by the uniqueness of the property. The lighthouse was all decorated for Christmas inside, which really made our arrival so special. Gorgeous welcome hamper greeted us as well. There was real attention to detail throughout the property and even dog bowls for our pets use. Kitchen was perfect for Christmas Day cooking and had everything we needed to prepare and cook a superb feast. We would highly recommend this property for large families and great fun using the games room for pool and table tennis championships. We will definitely return to this fabulous place. Thanks Ben for accommodating an early check in so we didn\u2019t have to wait to get in and making sure the property was spotless on our arrival. Happy New Year!\nDear Therese,\nThank you so much for your feedback and your shared enjoyment for the lighthouse and its history as a holiday in itself. Rod-the-goose and Ben ask to be remembered to you because it makes their week as well when they get to meet lovely people that share their passion for the lighthouse and the geese.\nWe also have our companion website www.lighthouseholidays.uk that provides more history and information alongside the Sykes website.\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Therese4.7\u2605Dec 2024\n-\n\"What a blast?\"\n!!! We've had 5 nights in this beautiful tranquil lighthouse celebrating my 40th birthday. It was more than I ever imagined with the views, wildlife, walks and shops close by. The beds were so comfortable, It was perfect\nDear Gemma,\nCongratulations on your birthday and what a wonderful place to spend it. It is a very different type of area than most will ever have come across before with distant views and alongside the river. The elevated position is ideal for spotting everything including seals in the river, gulls, dicks, geese at the right time of year and all manner of other birds and wildlife.\nThe people around here are so friendly too and mostly happy to chat as they go for walks along the river.\nWe look forward to seeing you all again.\nDoug Hilton\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Gemma5.0\u2605Dec 2024\n-\n\"Dear owner, we are very happy with our stay in the Lighthouse!\"\nIt is truly a very special and atmospheric place. There are so many interesting things for nature lovers to be seen. And it is fully equipped for a perfect stay.\nWe do only have recommendation regarding the beds and bedding:\n- beds are cheap and uncomfortable, especially for anyone higher than 170 cm\n- the duvets were also low quality and very short. Again if you are higher than 165, it would not cover you properly.\nHope this could be easily improved.\nDear Hristo,\nThank you very much for your feedback. I'm really glad that you enjoyed your stay but sorry you felt the beds were uncomfortable because our aim is to please all of our guests.\nBedding and beds is a difficult area to make suitable for everyone because it largely depends on weight, height, what they are used to and any creaks and groans developed over the years. What might be too hot for some will be too cold for others and what will be too hard for some will be too soft for others. We therefore chose the best normal hotel quality beds and bedding for the lighthouse.\nI think from what you say, you probably like to be fully covered from top to bottom with a super size duvet but not everyone does and at 188cms I have never had a problem. We do however provide spare duvet liners in the drawers under some of the the beds, so people can chose their duvet heat and and could overlay them to provide additional length if needed.\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Hristo4.1\u2605Dec 2024\n-\n\"Peaceful location where you didn't feel that you had to leave the property to explore the local area.\"\nThe interior was 'spot on' with plenty of room.\nAdded bonus, of course, was the trip to the top of the lighthouse!\nThe games room was also a great attraction for the kids.\nHope you didn't mind us re- hanging the Union Jack as it was flying upside down,!\nDear Susan,\nThank you so much for your positive feedback.\nUmm...well, it sounds like we will have to educate Ben on the right way up for the Union jack. I think upside down is supposed to be the international distress signal!!!\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Susan5.0\u2605Nov 2024\n-\n\"Wonderful location and property.\"\nReally special having the lighthouse to ourselves and being able to explore the tower. Games room was a big plus. Enjoyed watching the geese and other wildfowl and walking locally in the area. Would highly recommend.\nHi Trevor,\nReally glad that the lighthouse met with all of your expectation. It is a very special place in itself and definitely not just another holiday house. This year, out of 20,000 properties managed by Sykes, the lighthouse won their Gold Award for Best Historic Property in the UK.\nThe games room was originally converted to a high standard for meetings and lectures where we used to seat 25 people and give talks about the history of the lighthouse and Sir Peter Scott and tours of the lighthouse. It was also used by wildlife groups, artists and writers etc. It was built by Peter Scott along with the whole wing and Studio. The larger side of the garage had his car and the smaller side, his boat. The lighthouse used to be the first port of call for ships coming in to what was at the time, the very busy port of Sutton Bridge. The customs officers would hail them through a megaphone as they came in past the lighthouse to find out what they were bringing in and direct them where to tie up in the port. Hence the historic 'Customs Auxiliary Station' sign on the outside of the garages. Please also see our supporting website for further information about the lighthouse and shops etc www.lighthouseholidays.uk\nBest regards and thank you for leaving feedback.\nDoug and Team\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Trevor4.7\u2605Nov 2024\n-\n\"We had a fabulous time at the lighthouse and good weather all week so we were so lucky.\"\nIt was really relaxing and we enjoyed some fabulous sunrises and sunsets. Thanks so much for allowing dogs and the garden was the best fenced property we have stayed at so it was lovely to have that peace of mind....and a lovely walk towards the sea from the doorstep was brilliant. Games room was a lovely addition and well used in the evenings. Spent a lot of time in the bay window watching the ducks and geese, sea birds and other wildlife (deer, hares & rabbits) and so excited to see the pair of Egrets regularly - we don't get to see those in Herefordshire! The surrounding areas are lovely and we enjoyed trips to Wells-Next-The -Sea (for the Basset Hound Beach Invasion), Bancaster Beach, the Lincolnshire Aviation Museum where we saw the Lancaster Bomber and Mosquito taxying and an abundance of National Trust and English Heritage properties well worth visiting. And the fish and chips from Top Shop in Sutton Bridge were excellent. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful home - we had the best time and can't wait to come back again!!\nHi June,\nWe are so glad that you enjoyed everything about the Lighthouse and were able to explore the beaches and places that are within easy reach in north Norfolk. There is of course also the Sandringham Royal Estate, Snettisham RSPB site and Welney WWT reserve. Ely by the river is also very nice and just under an hour away on the local roads.\nSutton Bridge chips have always been really excellent. Due to retirement they closed for a while but are now back in business.\nPlease also see our supporting website for further information about the lighthouse and shops etc www.lighthouseholidays.uk\nLook forward to seeing you all again\nBest regards\nDoug\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by June4.4\u2605Aug 2024\n-\n\"We were all amazed by the lighthouse.\"\nIt was everything we wanted in holiday accomodation. The kitchen was well equiped and spacious. There was enough room in the dining area for us to have family meals and play board games. The games room was well used by us all. We would have liked a larger TV in the main room. But that was only used when we were watching the England football games. The Internet was iffy and slow but probably best you can get in the atea. But it made us talk to each other more. The bedrooms were clean and tidy. A few small unwanted visitors of the many legged variety, but it is rural. The nature reserve and the provision of binoculars was brilliant. The most wanted seats in the house were in the bay window. Could have had better weather but did manage to eat outside once. The patio area was lovely overlooking the river. Also a nice idea to have an east facing patio for the morning sun. The dogs loved the secure garden to run around. Altogether a brilliant property. Will hopefully come back in the future.\nDear Anne,\nThank you so much for your feedback, we will have a chat about providing another patio to the East as you have suggested for when you come back, so thank you for that. Amazing sunrises on that side and sunsets on the other.\nSadly the only internet we can get is BT and their cable is so long that it only just about makes it and fibre hasn't made it yet.\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Anne4.4\u2605Jul 2024\n-\n\"Fantastic long weekend.\"\nThank you. The lighthouse had everything we wanted , including the sunny warm weather :-).\nEverything was perfect.\nThank you so much for your feedback and hope to see you again.\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Richard5.0\u2605May 2024\n-\n\"This is a unique and very special place to stay.\"\nThe lighthouse was comfortable and spacious, and my family loved the games room. There was lots of wildlife to spot, including rabbits and a barn owl hovering on 2 days in broad daylight, not far from the kitchen window! There were lots of paintings of birds and information about the history of the lighthouse to read in most of the rooms. The surrounding area was perfect for walking with our dog, and there are lots of interesting places to visit not too far away, such as King's Lynn and the Sandringham Estate.\nThank you for your lovely feedback. As you have found, it is surprising that this small corner of Lincolnshire is overlooked, because it is as close to many things as if one were in a Norfolk prime spot. There are so many interesting places to see nearby in Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Cambridge including lots of historic towns and villages everywhere from when this was one of the richest parts of the country.\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Jenny4.7\u2605Apr 2024\n-\n\"Would love to stay again in the summer.\"\nLoved the home and the location being away from the hustle and bustle.\nThank you for your feedback. It is such a unique experience and we love sharing it with others.\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Fay5.0\u2605Mar 2024\n-\n\"Such a special place.\"\nA fabulous mix of old and new seeped in history with magnificent views.\nWe had a wonderful couple of days. Really enjoyed watching the geese (so thoughtful to have binoculars at the property) Saw deer in the garden too. Felt quite privileged to be able to stay in such a wonderful setting. Loved the little touches, like the cupboard door handles in the kitchen and the beautiful blinds at the windows. Son claimed the room with the ladders up to the lantern and loved the little nook up there with the bean bags and books. Very clean and well maintained and the pictures and information throughout depicting the windmills history were fascinating. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to stay in such a magical place.\nThank you so much for your feedback. Feedback is so important for us and others looking to come to this special building, where the holiday is in many ways the building itself.\nGlad that your son loved the lantern room bean bags and books, that was the result of previous feedback and helps us to get it right for everybody.\nWe look forwards to seeing you again.\nDoug, Ben and Rod\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Deborah5.0\u2605Mar 2024\n-\n\"The light house was a lot of fun and very well equipped.\"\nThere was no shortage of reading material. As wildlife artists we were particularly interested in Peter Scott, to which there were plenty of references.\nHi Wendy,\nThank you so much for your feedback. Wow, lots there for wildlife artists and it was so influential for the young Peter Scott. After the war the lighthouse had been let go to ruin by the army and the new sea wall had taken away the water from his wildfowl ponds. When his mother was asked what the war had cost him, she said it had cost him his lighthouse.\nSo glad that you enjoyed it and hope it was inspirational for you.\nDoug, Ben and Rod the goose\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Wendy5.0\u2605Feb 2024\n-\n\"Useful and timely emails ahead of the holiday to help make sure the arrival was smooth and stress free.\"\nThe lighthouse is amazing\u2026..such a quirky and peaceful place to holiday in. The view from the top is amazing!\nThere are invigorating walks along the coast for the days you are feeling more energetic or simply curl up in front of the log burner on one of the leather sofas with a book or the smart tv on the days you want to chill. Perfect escape, far from the maddening crowd!\nDear Linda,\nSo glad it delivered what you wanted, the lighthouse simply wraps itself around you in a very special landscape.\nThank you for your feedback.\nDoug Hilton\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Linda5.0\u2605Jan 2024\n-\n\"We had a fabulous stay in a magical place.\"\nOur ages ranged from 3 years to 82 years and it accommodated all although not all managed to get to the lantern room, of course! The games room was a big hit with all. It was warm and welcoming and well equipped and comfortable. It was wonderful to be able to enjoy the property surrounding countryside and wildlife. No one wanted to leave and we hope to be able to return.\nDear Alison,\nVery sorry to have missed your feedback initially.\nThank you for your very lovely feedback for the lighthouse. I\u2019m glad also that the games room was working so well for your family.

Wrap up and go for walks in the day and then retreat to the games room to play pool in the evening ,fun for all the family! Any question or queries were answered and dealt with immediately .Thankyou so much for sharing this unique building with us.\nDear Shaun,\nSorry for having missed your feedback initially, it is very valuable. We are just so delighted that the lighthouse provided what you and others have been looking for.\nBest regards Doug\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Shaun4.4\u2605Nov 2023\n-\n\"I\u2019m not sure where to start\u2026the lighthouse is just magical!\"\nWe stayed as a family with ages ranging from 5 - 70 with granddad just as excited to climb up to the lamp room as the children. From the minute we arrived we were already planning on when we might return. The sense of adventure in being able to stay in such a beautiful old lighthouse didn\u2019t stop. We enjoyed lovely walks with the dogs from the doorstep, with incredible scenery and and abundance of wildlife including barn owls, rabbits, bats and water fowl.\nThe lighthouse itself is very family friendly with plenty of living space, a lovely log burner in the lounge and a hidden games room. There are stacks of books to borrow and all sorts of board games and other things that the children enjoyed as well. There is also a fabulous outside space and large seating area for Al fresco dining or sundowner G&T\u2019s! The kitchen is modern and has everything you need to cater for your stay.\nThe owner Ben was very helpful and accommodating, giving us recommendations on local pubs etc.\nIt was like stepping in to a Famous Five book, but better. A truly wonderful weekend celebrating a family birthday and we didn\u2019t want to leave. We feel very privileged to have been able to stay at the Sir Peter Scott Lighthouse so thank you again for such a wonderful stay.\nThank you so much for your feedback. It is lovely to see that what we hoped so much for our visitors to experience is working. It's so difficult to put into words what staying at the lighthouse and experiencing it's personality and history feels like to people that haven't been there we fully understand about it feeling like a Famous Five adventure.\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Samantha5.0\u2605Oct 2023\n-\n\"Lovely place we thought it could do with some sort of mosquito killer some sort ...\"\nLovely place we thought it could do with some sort of mosquito killer some sort of plug in device still an amazing place we will definitely book again many many thanks mrs edwards\nThank you so much for your feedback and very happy to know you have enjoyed your stay at the lighthouse. We were debating whether to fit one and decided not to because there's normally no problem but a plug in one that can be used anywhere if someone wants to is a great idea and thank you for the suggestion.\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Lynn5.0\u2605Sep 2023\n-\n\"Highly recommended.\"\nWhat an amazing property and location!\nOur family (3 generations represented) had a fablulous weekend of relaxation, walking along the Nene to the coast, visiting nearby beaches and Sandringham for an event. We love properties that are a little bit different, have some historic and architectural interest, so this was perfect with great views. Comfortable and clean. Plenty of space; breakfast kitchen; dining room; large lounge; games room with pool table, table tennis and table football. Great facilities, including washing machine/ utility area and related items. The grounds were secure and we felt safe.\nCommunication and access were timely and helpful.\nSykes: This property could be marketed better on here, with a few more key word categories to aid the search. This is no ordinary 'holiday cottage', it is an iconic and unique property of significant historic value and interest. This would broaden the appeal and audience. I tried looking for other quirky/ unique properties and it is difficult to find this one, or any others.\nThank you so much for your wonderful feedback. We are so pleased to have been able to share the lighthouse with you and your family, that we ourselves and everyone it touches love so much.\nAs you say, it is so much more than a normal holiday property and has a personality of it's own.\nWe have a website for the lighthouse at www.lighthouseholidays.uk but Sykes worry about putting third party links on their main website for security purposes.\nSykes have been great to work with but we take your point entirely and will have a word with them. Winter months from October to February at the lighthouse are the very best quality wildlife months with wild geese and ducks on migration.\nWe look forward to seeing you all again.\nDoug\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Louise5.0\u2605Aug 2023\n-\n\"Lovely property.\"\nBest stocked holiday home I've ever stayed in. Very quirky layout. The kids loved going into 'Narnia' (the games room). Great location for walks and bird watching. You can get to the beach in less than an hour. Castle Rising and a couple of National Trust properties are also in the area. We enjoyed our stay. Thank you.\nThank you so much for your feedback, it is much appreciated by all of the team that have worked for the last two years to open the lighthouse to visitors and by the lighthouse that just loves visitors\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Clare5.0\u2605Aug 2023\n-\n\"The Lighthouse is a real gem and we loved the quirkiness of it!\"\nIt was well furnished and the kitchen was very well equipped. The location was amazing for wildlife and birdwatching but it was great to just enjoy the property and watch the clouds go by. A very relaxing spot.\nThank you so much for your lovely detailed review. You have managed to put into words the scarce and very special lighthouse effect. 'but it was great to just enjoy the property and watch the clouds go by. A very relaxing spot'\nProperty Owner\nReviewed by Gillian5.0\u2605Jul 2023\n-\nThere are no reviews featuring this term\nShow all reviews"
