  "title": "Rediscovering Humanity: How Indigenous Wisdom Can Guide Our AI Future",
  "description": "Indigenous communities always understood that survival depended not on individual optimization but on collective resilience. Can we build AI systems learning from that?",
  "content": "As artificial intelligence reshapes our world, we find ourselves in a curious conundrum.\n\nThe same technology that promises to solve our most complex global challenges also threatens to disconnect us further from our essential human nature, and the home that we call planet earth. Being alive today is a gigantic opportunity, which comes with sharp responsibility. This era of technological acceleration presents an unexpected opportunity: to pause, recalibrate and learn from the oldest wisdom keepers on our planet.\n\nThe International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples , observed annually in August, reminds us that while we marvel at machine learning algorithms, the most sophisticated intelligence systems have been operating for millennia within indigenous communities worldwide. These communities have sustained themselves through cycles of environmental change, social upheaval and resource scarcity by cultivating values that artificial intelligence, for all its computational power, cannot replicate: deep interconnectedness, generational thinking and reciprocal relationships with the natural world.\n\nLong before Silicon Valley coined the term \"network effects,\" indigenous communities understood that survival depended not on individual optimization but on collective resilience. The of southern Africa \u2014 \"I am because we are\" \u2014 reflects a systems understanding that modern AI developers are only beginning to appreciate. These communities learned that cooperation, not competition, formed the foundation of sustainable progress.\n\nConsider the of Pacific Northwest tribes, where status derives not from accumulating wealth but from giving it away. For centuries this seemingly counterintuitive practice has created robust social networks, redistributed resources during times of scarcity and built lasting alliances across vast territories. Such practices reveal economic models that prioritize regeneration over extraction \u2014 principles that could inform how we design AI systems for collective benefit rather than individual profit maximization.\n\nThe \u2014 guardianship that extends seven generations into the future \u2014 offers another lens through which to view our technological development. While AI systems optimize for immediate outcomes, indigenous frameworks inherently consider long-term consequences. Integrating such principles into AI governance could many current ethical challenges by embedding community welfare and environmental stewardship into algorithmic decision-making.\n\nThe convergence of ancient wisdom and artificial intelligence is not merely philosophical \u2014 it's happening in real time across the globe. In the Arctic, where climate change threatens traditional ways of life, Inuit communities are collaborating with AI developers to create systems that combine satellite data with traditional ecological knowledge to predict ice conditions and ensure safe travel routes.\n\nThe , developed in partnership with Inuit communities, exemplifies this hybrid intelligence. Named after the Inuit word for sea ice, the platform integrates real-time sensor data with generations of traditional knowledge about ice behavior, creating navigation tools that are both technologically advanced and culturally grounded.\n\nIn New Zealand, is leveraging AI to revitalize the M\u0101ori language, training machine learning models on indigenous speech patterns and oral traditions. Their work demonstrates how technology can serve to preserve and strengthen cultural practices for future generations. Similarly, in Polynesia, are combining traditional marine knowledge with AI-powered monitoring systems to restore coral ecosystems. These initiatives show how artificial and indigenous intelligence can create solutions that are both scientifically rigorous and culturally appropriate.\n\nWhat makes the difference in outcomes is the motivation behind the scenes. Regenerative intent matters.\n\nDespite its remarkable capabilities, AI operates within significant constraints that indigenous wisdom systems inherently avoid. Within existing data contexts, machine learning models excel; they thrive on pattern recognition tasks but struggle with the kind of adaptive, contextual intelligence that indigenous communities have evolved over centuries.\n\nAI systems process information through narrow, predetermined frameworks, while indigenous knowledge systems embrace complexity, paradox and multiple ways of knowing simultaneously. Where algorithms seek to eliminate uncertainty, traditional knowledge systems often celebrate it as a source of resilience and adaptability.\n\nThe Navajo concept of \u2014 living in balance and harmony with all relations \u2014 represents a form of intelligence that considers relationships, context and dynamic equilibrium rather than static optimization. Researchers are now exploring how such concepts might inform future AI development, creating systems that prioritize harmony and balance over maximum efficiency.\n\nIndigenous communities have long understood that the most complex challenges require collective intelligence \u2014 the kind that emerges from diverse perspectives, intergenerational dialogue, and deep listening. The talking circles of Native American traditions, the consensus-building practices of many African communities and the collaborative decision-making processes of indigenous groups worldwide all demonstrate sophisticated forms of distributed intelligence that no single AI system can replicate.\n\nThese practices offer valuable insights for designing AI systems that amplifies our humanity and compensates for some of our quirks and caveats. They suggest that the future lies not in creating more autonomous AI but in developing technologies that facilitate better human collaboration, deeper understanding and more inclusive decision-making processes.\n\nWhen it comes to human groups sometimes the whole becomes more than the some of its parts; and once we have a holistic of the entire range of our natural and artificial assets the same complementary magic might become true for our co-habitat with AI.\n\nAs we navigate the AI r/evolution, ancestral knowledge systems offer a roadmap for developing \u2014 systems that combine the computational power of artificial intelligence with the multidimensional individual experience and the relational wisdom of human communities. This requires double literacy: a holistic understanding of ourselves, our communities, and our planet, coupled with a clear comprehension of AI's capabilities and limitations.\n\nmeans understanding that AI excels at data and patterns but cannot replicate human intuition, compassion or the kind of contextual wisdom that emerges from lived experience. It means recognizing that while AI can optimize for efficiency, indigenous wisdom systems optimize for resilience, relationship, and regeneration.\n\nMost importantly, double literacy requires us to approach AI development with the same long-term thinking that characterizes indigenous cultures. Instead of asking what AI can do for us today, we must ask what kind of world we're creating for seven generations from now.\n\nThe path forward requires intentional curation of hybrid intelligence systems that harness our computational capability with regenerative intent. It encompasses the creation of AI development processes that include community voices from the beginning, not as an afterthought. It means designing algorithms that consider relational impacts alongside efficiency metrics. And it means building technological systems that boost not bust the social fabric of our communities.\n\nAwareness of who we are, individuals and as part of a planetary citizen.\n\nAppreciation of the opportunities and obligations that come with that citizenship in a hybrid context.\n\nAcceptance of the limitations and strengths of both, our natural and artificial resources.\n\nAccountability for the consequences of our choices, online and offline.\n\nThe current moment comes with a choice. We can continue developing AI systems that optimize for narrow metrics while ignoring their broader impacts on human flourishing and planetary health. Or we can learn from the world\u2019s treasure chests of local wisdom to co-curate technologies that nurture our biggest asset \u2013 planet earth\n\nNote - As part of a moderated series with change-makers from MIT Solve a previous article looked at Technology with respect to people and planet.",

      "text": "Hunhu/Ubuntu in the Traditional Thought of Southern Africa\nThe term Ubuntu/Botho/Hunhu is a Zulu/Xhosa/Ndebele/Sesotho/Shona word referring to the moral attribute of a person, who is known in the Bantu languages as Munhu (Among the Shona of Zimbabwe), Umuntu (Among the Ndebele of Zimbabwe and the Zulu/Xhosa of South Africa) and Muthu (Among the Tswana of Botswana) and Omundu (Among the Herero of Namibia) to name just a few of the Bantu tribal groupings. Though the term has a wider linguistic rendering in almost all the Bantu languages of Southern Africa, it has gained a lot of philosophical attention in Zimbabwe and South Africa, especially in the early twenty-first century for the simple reason that both Zimbabwe and South Africa needed home-grown philosophies to move forward following political disturbances that had been caused by the liberation war and apartheid respectively. Philosophically, the term Ubuntu emphasises the importance of a group or community and it finds its clear expression in the Nguni/Ndebele phrase: umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu which when translated to Shona means munhu munhu muvanhu (a person is a person through other persons). This article critically reflects on hunhu/ubuntu as a traditional and/or indigenous philosophy by focussing particularly on its distinctive features, its components and how it is deployed in the public sphere.\nTable of Contents\n- Introduction\n- About the Sources\n- Hunhu/Ubuntu and Ethno-Philosophy\n- The Distinctive Qualities/Features of Hunhu/Ubuntu\n- The Components of Hunhu/Ubuntu\n- Conclusion\n- References and Further Reading\n1. Introduction\nThe subject of Hunhu/Ubuntu has generated considerable debate within the public and private intellectual discussions, especially in South Africa and Zimbabwe where the major focus has been on whether or not Hunhu/Ubuntu can compete with other philosophical world views as well as whether or not Hunhu/Ubuntu can solve the socio-political challenges facing the two countries. Hunhu/ubuntu is also a key theme in African philosophy as it places an imperative on the importance of group or communal existence as opposed to the West\u2019s emphasis on individualism and individual human rights. Thus, Hunhu/Ubuntu, as an aspect of African philosophy, prides in the idea that the benefits and burdens of the community must be shared in such a way that no one is prejudiced but that everything is done to put the interests of the community ahead of the interests of the individual. To this end, the traditional philosophical meaning of the term Ubuntu/Botho/Hunhu is sought and its importance in the academy is highlighted and explained. The article also looks at how the concept is deployed in the public sphere. It provides an elaborate analysis of the qualities/features of Hunhu/Ubuntu as exemplified by John S Pobee\u2019s expression Cognatus ergo sum, which means I am related by blood therefore I exist. Finally, the article outlines and thoroughly explains the components cognate to Hunhu/Ubuntu as an aspect of ethno-philosophy, namely: Hunhu/Ubuntu Metaphysics, Hunhu/Ubuntu Ethics and Hunhu/Ubuntu Epistemology.\n2. About the Sources\nMany scholars have written about Ubuntu and it is only fair to limit our discussion to those scholars who have had an interest in the philosophical meaning of the term in Southern African Thought. In this category, we have first generation scholars of Ubuntu such as Mogobe Bernard Ramose (1999; 2014), who is credited for his definition of Ubuntu as humaneness, Stanlake Samkange and Tommie Marie Samkange (1980) who link Hunhu/Ubuntu with the idea of humanism and Desmond Tutu (1999) who sees Ubuntu as a conflict resolution philosophy. These three are regarded as first-generation scholars of Ubuntu because historically, they are among the first black philosophers hailing from Africa to write about Hunhu/Ubuntu as a philosophy. They also started writing as early as the 1980s and early 1990s and they regarded Ubuntu inspired by the traditional southern African thought as a human quality or as an attribute of the soul.\nWe also have second generation scholars of Ubuntu such as Michael Onyebuchi Eze (2010), who is credited for his critical historicisation of the term Ubuntu, Michael Battle (2009) who is credited for some deep insights on the linguistic meaning of the term Ubuntu as well as his famous claim that Ubuntu is a gift to the Western world; Fainos Mangena (2012a and 2012b) who is credited for defining Hunhu/Ubuntu and extracting from it the idea of the Common Moral Position (CMP) and Thaddeus Metz (2007) whose search for a basic principle that would define African ethics has attracted a lot of academic attention; Christian BN Gade (2011; 2012 and 2013) who has taken the discourse of Hunhu/Ubuntu to another level by looking at the historical development of discourses on Ubuntu as well as the meaning of Ubuntu among South Africans of African Descent (SAADs). Finally, we have Martin H Prozesky who has outlined some of the distinctive qualities/features of Hunhu/Ubuntu philosophy that are important for this article.\n3. Hunhu/Ubuntu and Ethno-Philosophy\nIn order to define Ubuntu and show its nexus with ethno-philosophy, it is important that we first define ethno-philosophy. To this end, Zeverin Emagalit defines ethno-philosophy as a system of thought that deals with the collective worldviews of diverse African people as a unified form of knowledge based on myths, folk wisdom and the proverbs of the people. From the above definition, we can pick two important points: The first point is ethno-philosophy as a \u201csystem of thought\u201d and the second point is \u201cthe collective world views of diverse African people\u201d and that they are a unified form of knowledge. This means that the diversity that characterise African people, in terms of geographical location, history and ethnicity, does not take away the fact that Africans have \u201ca unified form of knowledge\u201d that is based on group identity or community. Now, this is what qualifies Ubuntu as an important aspect of ethno-philosophy.\nThis section defines Ubuntu as well as tracing its historical roots in Southern African cultures. To begin with, the term Ubuntu comes from a group of sub-Saharan languages known as Bantu (Battle, 2009: 2). It is a term used to describe the quality or essence of being a person amongst many sub-Saharan tribes of the Bantu language family (Onyebuchi Eze, 2008: 107). While Battle does not make reference to the Shona equivalence of Ubuntu and recognises the words Ubuntu and Bantu by the common root of \u2013ntu (human); Ramose uses the Zulu/isiNdebele word Ubuntu concurrently with its Shona equivalent \u2013 hunhu to denote the idea of existence. For Ramose, Hu\u2013 is ontological, while \u2013nhu is epistemological and so is Ubu\u2013 and \u2013ntu (Ramose 1999: 50). Having lived in Africa and Zimbabwe, Ramose is able to know with some degree of certainty the ontological and epistemological status of the words hunhu and ubuntu. It sometimes takes an insider to be able to correctly discern the meanings of such words.\nHunhu/ubuntu also says something about the character and conduct of a person (Samkange and Samkange 1980: 38). What this translates to is that hunhu/ubuntu is not only an ontological and epistemological concept; it is also an ethical concept. For Battle, Ubuntu is the interdependence of persons for the exercise, development and fulfilment of their potential to be both individuals and community. Desmond Tutu captures this aptly when he uses the Xhosa proverb, ungamntu ngabanye abantu whose Shona equivalence is munhu unoitwa munhu nevamwe vanhu (a person is made a person by other persons). Generally, this proverb, for Battle, means that each individual\u2019s humanity is ideally expressed in relationship with others. This view was earlier expressed by Onyebuchi Eze (2008: 107) who put it thus:\nMore critical\u2026is the understanding of a person as located in a community where being a person is to be in a dialogical relationship in this community. A person\u2019s humanity is dependent on the appreciation, preservation and affirmation of other person\u2019s humanity. To be a person is to recognize therefore that my subjectivity is in part constituted by other persons with whom I share the social world.\nIn regard to the proverbial character of Ubuntu, Ramose also remarks that, \u201cUbuntu is also consistent with the practices of African peoples as expressed in the proverbs and aphorisms of certain Nguni languages, specifically Zulu and Sotho\u201d (Ramose quoted in van Niekerk 2013).\nIn his definition of ubuntu, Metz (2007: 323) follows Tutu and Ramose when he equates Ubuntu to the idea of humanness and to the maxim a person is a person through other persons. This maxim, for Metz, \u201chas descriptive senses to the effect that one\u2019s identity as a human being causally and even metaphysically depends on a community.\u201d With this submission, Metz, agrees with Ramose, Samkange and Samkange and Gade that ubuntu is about the group/community more than it is about the self.\nIt may be important, at this juncture, to briefly consider the historical roots of the term Ubuntu in order to buttress the foregoing. To begin with, in his attempt to trace the history of the idea of Ubuntu, Michael Onyebuchi Eze (2010: 90) remarks thus when it comes to the idea of Ubuntu, \u201chistory adopts a new posture\u2026where it is no longer a narrative of the past only but of the moment, the present and the future.\u201d Other than asking a series of questions relating to \u201chistory as a narrative of the moment, present and future,\u201d he does not adequately explain why this is so. Instead, he goes further to explain the view of \u201chistory as a narrative of the past.\u201d As a narrative of the past, Onyebuchi Eze observes thus:\nUbuntu is projected to us in a rather hegemonic format; by way of an appeal to a unanimous past through which we may begin to understand the socio-cultural imaginary of the \u201cAfrican\u201d people before the violence of colonialism; an imagination that must be rehabilitated in that percussive sense for its actual appeal for the contemporary African society (2010:93).\nOnyebuchi Eze seems to be suggesting that there is too much romanticisation of the past when it comes to the conceptualisation and use of the term Ubuntu. He seems to question the idea of the unanimous character of Ubuntu before \u201cthe violence of colonialism\u201d reducing this idea to some kind of imagination that should have no place in contemporary African society. We are compelled to agree with him to that extent. Thus, unlike many scholars of Ubuntu who have tended to gloss over the limitations of Ubuntu, Onyebuchi Eze is no doubt looking at the history of this concept with a critical eye. One of the key arguments he presents which is worthy of our attention in this article is that of the status of the individual and that of the community in the definition and conceptualisation of Ubuntu.\nWhile many Ubuntu writers have tended to glorify community over and above the individual, Onyebuchi Eze (2008: 106) is of the view that, \u201cthe individual and the community are not radically opposed in the sense of priority but engaged in contemporaneous formation.\u201d Thus, while we agree with Onyebuchi Eze that both the individual and the community put together define Ubuntu, we maintain that their relationship is not that of equals but that the individual is submerged within the community and the interests and aspirations of the community matter more than those of the individual. This, however, should not be interpreted to mean that the individual plays an ancillary role in the definition of Ubuntu. Below, we outline and explain the qualities/features of hunhu/ubuntu as an aspect of ethno-philosophy.\n4. The Deployment of Hunhu/Ubuntu in the Public Sphere\nHunhu/Ubuntu has dominated the public discourse especially in Zimbabwe and South Africa where it has been used to deal with both political and social differences. In Zimbabwe, for instance, hunhu/ubuntu has been used to bring together the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU PF) and Patriotic Front Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union (PF ZAPU) after political tensions that led to the Midlands and Matabeleland disturbances of the early 1980s which saw about 20000 people killed by the North Korea trained Fifth Brigade. The 1987 Unity accord was done in the spirit of Ubuntu where people had to put aside their political differences and advance the cause of the nation.\nThe Global Political Agreement of 2008 which led to the signing of the Government of National Unity (GNU) also saw hunhu/ubuntu being deployed to deal with the political differences between ZANU PF and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) formations as a result of the violent elections of June 2008. This violence had sown the seeds of fear to the generality of the Zimbabwean population and so it took hunhu/ubuntu to remove the fear and demonstrate the spirit of \u201cI am because we are, since we are therefore I am.\u201d The point is that the two political parties needed each other in the interest of the development of the nation of Zimbabwe.\nIn South Africa, Desmond Tutu, who was the Chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) which was formed to investigate and deal with the apartheid atrocities in the 1990s demonstrated in his final report that it took Ubuntu for people to confess, forgive and forget. In his book: No Future without Forgiveness, published in 1999, Tutu writes, \u201cthe single main ingredient that made the achievements of the TRC possible was a uniquely African ingredient \u2013 Ubuntu.\u201d Tutu maintains that, what constrained so many to choose to forgive rather than to demand retribution, to be magnanimous and ready to forgive rather than to wreak revenge was Ubuntu (Tutu quoted in Richardson, 2008: 67). As Onyebuchi Eze (2011: 12) would put it, \u201cthe TRC used Ubuntu as an ideology to achieve political ends.\u201d As an ideology Ubuntu has been used as a panacea to the socio-political problems affecting the continent of Africa, especially the Southern part of the continent. This means that Ubuntu as a traditional thought has not been restricted to the academy alone but has also found its place in the public sphere where it has been utilised to solve political conflicts and thereby bring about socio-political harmony. To underscore the importance of Ubuntu not only as an intellectual and public good, Gabriel Setiloane (quoted in Vicencio, 2009: 115) remarks thus, \u201cUbuntu is a piece of home grown African wisdom that the world would do well to make its own.\u201d This suggests the southern African roots of ubuntu as a traditional thought.\n5. The Distinctive Qualities/Features of Hunhu/Ubuntu\nWhile Martin H Prozesky (2003: 5-6) has identified the ten qualities that are characteristic of hunhu/ubuntu, it is important to note that, although this article will only utilise Prozesky\u2019s ten qualities, the philosophy of hunhu/ubuntu has more than ten qualities or characteristics. Our justification of using Prozesky\u2019s ten qualities is that they aptly capture the essence of Ubuntu as an aspect of ethno-philosophy. This article begins by outlining Prozesky\u2019s ten qualities before attempting to explain only four of them, namely humaneness, gentleness, hospitality and generosity. Prozesky\u2019s ten qualities are as follows:\n-\n- Humaneness\n- Gentleness\n- Hospitality\n- Empathy or taking trouble for others\n- Deep Kindness\n- Friendliness\n- Generosity\n- Vulnerability\n- Toughness\n- Compassion\nHunhu/ubuntu as an important aspect of ethno-philosophy is an embodiment of these qualities. While Ramose uses humaneness to define hunhu/ubuntu, Samkange and Samkange use humanism to define and characterise the same. The impression one gets is that the former is similar to the latter. But this is further from the truth. Thus, with regard to the dissimilarity between humaneness and humanism, Gade (2011: 308) observes:\nI have located three texts from the 1970s in which Ubuntu is identified as \u2018African humanism.\u2019 The texts do not explain what African humanism is, so it is possible that their authors understood African humanism as something different from a human quality.\nGranted that this is may be the case, the question then is: What is the difference between humaneness and humanism, and African humaneness and African humanism as aspects of hunhu/ubuntu philosophy? While humaneness may refer to the essence of being human including the character traits that define it (Dolamo, 2013: 2); humanism, on the other hand, is an ideology, an outlook or a thought system in which human interests and needs are given more value than the interests and needs of other beings (cf. Flexner, 1988: 645).Taken together, humaneness and humanism become definitive aspects of hunhu/ubuntu only if the pre-fix \u2018African\u2019 is added to them to have African humaneness and African humanism respectively. African humaneness would, then, entail that the qualities of selflessness and commitment to one\u2019s group or community are more important than the selfish celebration of individual achievements and dispositions.\nAfrican humanism, on the other hand; would, then, refer to an ideology or outlook or thought system that values peaceful co-existence and the valorisation of community. In other words, it is a philosophy that sees human needs, interests and dignity as of fundamental importance and concern (Gyekye 1997: 158). Gyekye maintains that African humanism \u201cis quite different from the Western classical notion of humanism which places a premium on acquired individual skills and favours a social and political system that encourages individual freedom and civil rights\u201d (1997: 158).\nThus, among the Shona people of Zimbabwe, the expression munhu munhu muvanhu, which in isiNdebele and Zulu language translates to umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu, both of which have the English translation of \u201ca person is a person through other persons,\u201d best explain the idea of African humanism (cf. Mangena 2012a; Mangena 2012b; Shutte 2008; Tutu 1999).\nIn regard to the definition and characterisation of African humanism, Onyebuchi Eze (2011:12) adds his voice to the definition of African humanism when he observes that:\nAs a public discourse, Ubuntu/botho has gained recognition as a peculiar form of African humanism, encapsulated in the following Bantu aphorisms, like Motho ke motho ka batho babang; Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu (a person is a person through other people). In other words, a human being achieves humanity through his or her relations with other human beings.\nWhether one prefers humaneness or humanism, the bottom line is that the two are definitive aspects of the philosophy of hunhu/ubuntu which places the communal interests ahead of the individual interests. Of course, this is a position which Onyebuchi Eze would not buy given that in his view, the community cannot be prioritised over the individual as:\nThe relation with \u2018other\u2019 is one of subjective equality, where the mutual recognition of our different but equal humanity opens the door to unconditional tolerance and a deep appreciation of the \u2018other\u2019 as an embedded gift that enriches one\u2019s humanity (2011: 12).\nSome believe that what distinguishes an African of black extraction from a Westerner is the view that the former is a communal being while the latter prides in the idea of selfhood or individualism. To these people the moment we take the individual and the community as subjective equals [as Onyebuchi Eze does] we end up failing to draw the line between what is African from what is fundamentally Western. Having defined humaneness, this article will now define and characterise the quality of gentleness as understood through hunhu/ubuntu. Gentleness encompasses softness of heart and being able to sacrifice one\u2019s time for others. Thus, being gentle means being tender-hearted and having the ability to spend time attending to other people\u2019s problems. Gentleness is a quality of the tradition thought of hunhu/ubuntu in that it resonates with John S Mbiti\u2019s dictum: \u201cI am because we are, since we are therefore I am\u201d (1969: 215). The point is that with gentleness, one\u2019s humanity is inseparably bound to that of others. Eric K Yamamoto (1997: 52) puts it differently in reference to the altruistic character of Ubuntu philosophy when he remarks thus:\nUbuntu is the idea that no one can be healthy when the community is sick. Ubuntu says I am human only because you are human. If I undermine your humanity, I dehumanise myself.\nBoth the definition of gentleness provided above and Mbiti\u2019s dictum are equivalent to Yamamoto\u2019s understanding of gentleness in that they both emphasise on otherness rather than the self. The attribute of hospitality also defines hunhu/ubuntu philosophy. Hospitality generally means being able to take care of your visitors in such a way that they feel comfortable to have you as their host and the relationship is not commercial. However, the Western definition of hospitality is such that the host goes out of his or her way to provide for the needs of his guests in return for some payment. This, however, should not be interpreted to mean that the Westerner is not hospitable outside of commerce. No doubt, they can also be hospitable but it is the magnitude of hospitality that differs.\nIn the case of the Shona/Ndebele communities in Africa where hospitality is given for free as when one provides accommodation and food to a stranger at his or her home, the magnitude is high. Coming to the idea of hospitality in Africa, it is important to note that in traditional Shona/Ndebele society when a person had travelled a long journey looking for some relative, they would get tired before reaching their relative\u2019s home and along the way; it was common for them to be accommodated for a day or two before they get to their relative\u2019s home. During their short stay, they would be provided with food, accommodation and warm clothes (if they happened to travel during the winter season).\nAmong the Korekore-Nyombwe people of Northern Zimbabwe, strangers would be given water to drink before asking for directions or before they ask for accommodation in transit. The thinking was that the stranger would have travelled a very long distance and was probably tired and thirsty and so there was need to give them water to quench their thirst. Besides, water (in Africa) symbolises life and welfare and so by giving strangers water they were saying that life needed to be sustained and that as Africans, we are \u201cour brothers\u2019 keepers.\u201d Thus, hunhu/ubuntu hospitality derives its impetus from this understanding that the life and welfare of strangers is as important as our own lives and welfare.\nNow, this is different from the idea of home and hospitality in Western Cosmopolitans where a home is a place of privacy. Most homes in the West have durawalls or high fences to maximise the privacy of the owner and so a stranger cannot just walk in and be accommodated. This is quite understandable because in Western societies, the individual is conceived of as the centre of human existence and so there is need to respect his or her rights to privacy. In the West, the idea of a stranger walking into a private space is called trespassing and one can be prosecuted for this act. And yet in African traditional thought, in general, and in the Shona/Ndebele society, in particular, the idea of trespassing does not exist in that way.\nIn fact, in pre-colonial Shona/Ndebele society, however, the community was at the centre of human existence and that is why the pre-colonial Shona/Ndebele people would easily accommodate strangers or visitors without asking many questions. However, due to the colonisation of Africa, some Africans have adopted the Western style of individual privacy, but this is contrary to hunhu/ubuntu hospitality which is still being practiced in most Shona/Ndebele rural communities today. The point is that philosophies of hospitality, identity and belonging are more clearly played out on the home front than in the public sphere.\nThe last attribute to be discussed in this section, is generosity. Generally, generosity refers to freedom or liberality in giving (Flexner 1988: 550). The attribute of generosity in Southern African thought is best expressed proverbially. In Shona culture, for instance, there are proverbs that explain the generosity of the Shona people or vanhu. Some of these include: Muenzi haapedzi dura (A visitor does not finish food), Chipavhurire uchakodzwa(The one who gives too much will also receive too much), Chawawana idya nehama mutogwa unokangamwa (Share whatever you get with your relatives because strangers are very forgetful) and Ukama igasva hunazadziswa nekudya (Relations cannot be complete without sharing food).\nThese proverbs not only demonstrate that Bantu people are generous people, but the proverbs also say something about the hunhu/ubuntu strand that runs through the traditional thought of almost all the Bantu cultures of Southern Africa whereby everything is done to promote the interests of the group or community. The proverbs show that the Bantu people are selfless people as summarised by the Nguni proverb which we referred to earlier, which says: Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu (a person is a person through other persons) or as they put it in Shona: Munhu munhu muvanhu. Without the attribute of generosity, it may be difficult to express one\u2019s selflessness.\n6. The Components of Hunhu/Ubuntu\nThis section outlines the components of hunhu/ubuntu traditional philosophy showing how these are different from the branches of Western philosophy. These components will be outlined as hunhu/ubuntu metaphysics, hunhu/ubuntu ethics as well as hunhu/ubuntu epistemology. The objective is to show that while Western philosophy is persona-centric and is summarised by Descartes\u2019 famous phrase, Cogito ergo sum which when translated to English means \u201cI think therefore I am\u201d; hunhu/ubuntu traditional philosophy, on the other hand, is communo-centric and is summarised by Pobee\u2019s famous dictum, Cognatus ergo sum which when translated to English means, \u201cI am related by blood, therefore, I exist.\u201d In much simpler terms, while Western philosophy emphasises the self and selfhood through the promotion of individual rights and freedoms, hunhu/ubuntu traditional thought emphasises on the importance of the group or community through the promotion of group or communal interests.\na. Hunhu/Ubuntu Metaphysics\nBefore defining and characterising hunhu/ubuntu metaphysics, it is important to begin by defining the term Metaphysics itself. For lack of a better word in African cultures, the article will define metaphysics from the standpoint of Western philosophy. The article will then show that this definition, though, it will give us a head-start; can only partially be applied to non- Western cultures. To begin with, in the history of Western philosophy, Metaphysics is by far regarded as the most ancient branch of philosophy and it was originally called first philosophy (Steward and Blocker 1987: 95). The term Metaphysics is only but an accident of history as it is thought to have resulted from an editor\u2019s mistake as \u201che was sorting out Aristotle\u2019s works in order to give them titles, several decades after Aristotle had died. It is thought that the editor came across a batch of Aristotle\u2019s writings that followed The Physics and he called them Metaphysics, meaning After Physics\u201d (1987: 96).\nMetaphysics then is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of reality. It asks questions such as: What is reality? Is reality material, physical or an idea? As one tries to answer these questions, a world is opened to him or her that enables him or her to identify, name and describe the kinds of beings that exist in the universe. Thus, two words define being, namely: ontology and predication. While pre-Socratics such as Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus and Parmenides and others defined being in terms of appearance and reality as well as change and permanence; Classical philosophers such as Socrates/Plato and Aristotle defined change in terms of form and matter.\nWhile form was more real Socrates/Plato and existed in a different realm than that of matter, Aristotle argued that both form and matter together formed substance which was reality. Although the idea of being has always been defined in individual terms in the history of Western philosophy; it was given its definitive character by French Philosopher, Rene Descartes, who defined it in terms of what he called Cogito ergo sum which when translated to English means, \u201cI think therefore I am.\u201d Thus, the individual character of Western philosophy was firmly established with the popularisation of Descartes\u2019 Cogito. A question can be asked: Does this understanding of metaphysics also apply to non-Western cultures? The answer is yes and no. Yes in the sense that in non-Western cultures being is also explained in terms of appearance and reality as well as change and permanence and no in the sense that non-Western philosophies, especially the hunhu/ubuntu traditional philosophy of Southern Africa has a communal character, not an individual character. Having said this, so what is hunhu/ubuntu metaphysics?\nHunhu/ubuntu metaphysics is a component of hunhu/ubuntu traditional philosophy that deals with the nature of being as understood by people from Southern Africa. As we have already intimated, in Southern African traditional thought, being is understood in the communal, physical and spiritual sense. Thus, a human being is always in communion with other human beings as well as with the spiritual world. Sekou Toure (1959) calls this \u201cthe communion of persons\u201d whereby being is a function of the \u201cus\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d as opposed to the \u201cI\u201d as found in \u201cthe autonomy of the individuals\u201d that is celebrated in the West and is especially more revealing in Descartes\u2019 Cogito. Pobee (1979) defines the African being in terms of what he calls Cognatus ergo sum which means \u201cI am related by blood, therefore, I exist.\u201d What this suggests is that in Southern Africa, just like in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa, the idea of being is relational.\nComing to the communion of human beings with the spiritual world, it is important to remark that the idea of being has its full expression through participation. Just as, Socrates/Plato\u2019s matter partakes in the immutable forms, being in the Shona/Ndebele society depends solely on its relationship with the spiritual world which is populated by ancestral spirits, avenging spirits, alien spirits and the greatest spiritual being called Musikavanhu/Nyadenga/unkulunkulu (The God of Creation). The greatest being works with his lieutenants, ancestors and other spirits to protect the interests of the lesser beings, vanhu/abantu. In return, vanhu/abantu enact rituals of appeasement so that it does not become a one-way kind of interaction. It is, however, important to note that while Socratic/Platonic Metaphysics is dualistic in character; hunhu/ubuntu Metaphysics is onto-triadic or tripartite in character. It involves the Supreme Being (God), other lesser spirits (ancestral/alien and avenging) and human beings.\nb. Hunhu/Ubuntu Ethics\nHunhu/ubuntu ethics refer to the idea of hunhu/ubuntu moral terms and phrases such as tsika dzakanaka kana kuti dzakaipa (good or bad behaviour), kuzvibata kana kuti kusazvibata (self-control or reckless behaviour), kukudza vakuru (respecting or disrespecting elders) and kuteerera vabereki (being obedient or disobedient to one\u2019s immediate parents and the other elders of the community) among others. In Shona society they say: Mwana anorerwa nemusha kana kuti nedunhu (It takes a clan, village or community to raise a child). Having defined hunhu/ubuntu ethics, it is important to distinguish them from hunhu/ubuntu morality which relates to the principles or rules that guide and regulate the behaviour of vanhu or abantu (human beings in the Shona/Ndebele sense of the word) within Bantu societies.\nWhat distinguishes hunhu/ubuntu ethics from Western ethics is that the former are both upward-looking/transcendental and lateral, while the latter are only lateral. This section will briefly distinguish between an upward-looking/transcendental kind of hunhu/ubuntu ethic from a lateral kind of hunhu/ubuntu ethic. By upward-looking/transcendental is meant that hunhu/ubuntu ethics are not only confined to the interaction between humans, they also involve spiritual beings such as Mwari/Musikavanhu/Unkulunkulu (Creator God), Midzimu (ancestors) and Mashavi (Alien spirits). Thus, hunhu/ubuntu ethics are spiritual, dialogical and consensual (cf. Nafukho 2006). By dialogical and consensual is meant that the principles that guide and regulate the behaviour of vanhu/abantu are products of the dialogue between spiritual beings and human beings and the consensus that they reach. By lateral is meant that these principles or rules are crafted solely to guide human interactions.\nAs Mangena (2012: 11) would put it, hunhu/ubuntu ethics proceed through what is called the Common Moral Position (CMP). The CMP is not a position established by one person as is the case with Plato\u2019s justice theory, Aristotle\u2019s eudaimonism, Kant\u2019s deontology or Bentham\u2019s hedonism (2012: 11). With the CMP, the community is the source, author and custodian of moral standards and personhood is defined in terms of conformity to these established moral standards whose objective is to have a person who is communo-centric than one who is individualistic. In Shona/Ndebele society, for instance, respect for elders is one of the ways in which personhood can be expressed with the goal being to uphold communal values. It is within this context that respect for elders is a non-negotiable matter since these are the custodians of these values and fountains of moral wisdom.\nThus, one is born and bred in a society that values respect for the elderly and he or she has to conform. One important point to note is that the process of attaining the CMP is dialogical and spiritual in the sense that elders set moral standards in consultation with the spirit world which, as intimated earlier is made up of Mwari/Musikavanhu/Unkulunkulu (Creator God) and Midzimu (ancestors), and these moral standards are upheld by society (2012: 12). These moral standards, which make up the CMP, are not forced on society as the elders (who represent society), Midzimu (who convey the message to Mwari) and Mwari (who gives a nod of approval) ensure that the standards are there to protect the interest of the community at large.\nCommunities are allowed to exercise their free will but remain responsible for the choices they make as well as their actions. For instance, if a community chooses to ignore the warnings of the spirit world regarding an impending danger such as a calamity resulting from failure by that community to enact an important ritual that will protect members of that community from say, flooding or famine; then the community will face the consequences.\nc. Hunhu/Ubuntu Epistemology\nWhat is epistemology? In the Western sense of the word, epistemology deals with the meaning, source and nature of knowledge. Western philosophers differ when it comes to the sources of knowledge with some arguing that reason is the source of knowledge while others view experience or the use of the senses as the gateway to knowledge. This article will not delve much into these arguments since they have found an audience, instead it focuses on hunhu/ubuntu epistemology. However, one cannot define and characterise hunhu/ubuntu traditional epistemology without first defining and demarcating the province of African epistemology as opposed to Western epistemology.\nAccording to Michael Battle (2009: 135), \u201cAfrican epistemology begins with community and moves to individuality.\u201d Thus, the idea of knowledge in Africa resides in the community and not in the individuals that make up the community. Inherent in the powerful wisdom of Africa is the ontological need of the individual to know self and community (2009: 135) and discourses on hunhu/ubuntu traditional epistemology stems from this wisdom. As Mogobe Ramose (1999) puts it, \u201cthe African tree of knowledge stems from ubuntu philosophy. Thus, ubuntu is a well spring that flows within African notions of existence and epistemology in which the two constitute a wholeness and oneness.\u201d Just like, hunhu/ubuntu ontology, hunhu/ubuntu epistemology is experiential.\nIn Shona society, for instance, the idea of knowledge is expressed through listening to elders telling stories of their experiences as youths and how such experiences can be relevant to the lives of the youths of today. Sometimes, they use proverbs to express their epistemology. The proverb: Rega zvipore akabva mukutsva(Experience is the best teacher) is a case in point. One comes to know that promiscuity is bad when he or she was once involved in it and got a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) and other bad consequences. No doubt, this person will be able to tell others that promiscuity is bad because of his or her experiences. The point is that hunhu/ubuntu epistemology is a function of experience. In Shona, they also say: Takabva noko kumhunga hakuna ipwa (We passed through the millet field and we know that there are no sweet reeds there). The point is that one gets to know that there are no sweet reeds in a millet field because he or she passed through the millet field. One has to use the senses to discern knowledge.\n7. Conclusion\nIn this article, the traditional philosophy of hunhu/ubuntu was defined and characterised with a view to show that Africa has a traditional philosophy and ethic which are distinctively communal and spiritual. This philosophy was also discussed with reference to how it has been deployed in the public sphere in both Zimbabwe and South Africa. The key distinctive qualities/features of this traditional philosophy were clearly spelt out as humaneness, gentleness, hospitality and generosity. This philosophy was also discussed within the context of its three main components, namely; hunhu/ubuntu metaphysics, hunhu/ubuntu ethics and hunhu/ubuntu epistemology. In the final analysis, it was explained that hunhu/ubuntu metaphysics, hunhu/ubuntu ethics and hunhu/ubuntu epistemology formed the aspects of what is known today as traditional southern African thought.\n8.

      "text": "Artificial Intelligence is everywhere\u2014from search engines and supply chains to climate forecasts and school curriculums. But amid the buzz about what AI can do for us, an equally important question often gets overlooked: what is it doing to us, particularly those usually left out from mainstream design and decision-making processes, such as Indigenous communities?\nThe answer is complex. AI carries tremendous potential to support Indigenous self-determination, language preservation, and climate stewardship. But it also risks deepening long-standing patterns of erasure, exploitation, and exclusion \u2014 unless it is carefully aligned with the values, rights, and realities of Indigenous peoples.\nOne framework that helps unpack these dynamics is the ABCD of silent AI issues: agency decay, bond erosion, climate conundrum, and divided society. These issues aren't always visible in headlines or policy briefs \u2014 but they shape how AI shows up in everyday life. And for communities historically sidelined in technological revolutions, these risks can carry outsized consequences.\nA \u2014 Agency Decay\nWho controls the narrative when technology speaks for us?\nAs AI systems become more embedded in daily decision-making, there\u2019s a growing concern that personal and collective autonomy may erode \u2014 especially for groups with little say in how those systems are trained or deployed. When AI is built on biased or incomplete data, it often defaults to dominant worldviews, misrepresenting or ignoring others altogether.\nThis isn\u2019t just a design flaw. It\u2019s a continuation of colonial patterns in a new digital form.\nYet some efforts flip the script. The w\u00e2sikan kisew\u00e2tisiwin platform, for example, is being designed to recognize harmful or biased language about Indigenous peoples, flag it, and offer respectful alternatives. The tool serves as a digital ally to reduce emotional labor and as a mechanism to ensure Indigenous knowledge and experiences are not overwritten by default AI norms.\nB \u2014 Bond Erosion\nCan AI protect culture, or will it strip it of meaning?\nCultural appropriation has found new fuel in generative AI. Without guardrails, these systems scrape, remix, and reproduce sacred imagery, ceremonial language, and ancestral designs \u2014 usually without consent or context. This commodification not only disrespects Indigenous cultures but also risks severing the very bonds that sustain them.\nSome organizations are working to turn that around. Natives Rising supports digital upskilling and AI literacy so that Indigenous communities can use the tools and shape them. This includes exploring AI\u2019s role in emotional wellness and creating community-aligned content that strengthens identity and intergenerational connection rather than diluting it.\nC \u2014 Climate Conundrum\nHow can AI serve the planet without sacrificing the communities that protect it?\nThe environmental cost of AI is staggering. Data centers require immense electricity and water \u2014 resources often sourced from or near Indigenous lands. Ironically, the very populations stewarding biodiversity hotspots are those most at risk from the tech industry\u2019s growing footprint.\nA better path is possible. The First Languages AI Reality Initiative uses AI to revitalize endangered Indigenous languages while advocating for carbon-neutral infrastructure. By powering language preservation tools with renewable energy, the initiative models how AI can be deployed in ways that honor both people and planet.\nThis kind of alignment isn\u2019t just ethical \u2014 it\u2019s strategic. Indigenous communities have centuries of ecological knowledge and a track record of protecting 80% of the world\u2019s remaining biodiversity. A climate-smart AI future must include \u2014 not displace \u2014 these contributions.\nD \u2014 Divided Society\nWill AI bridge or widen the digital divide?\nAccess to AI isn\u2019t just about software but also power, infrastructure, and inclusion. Many Indigenous communities still lack stable internet or electricity, let alone the training and legal tools to engage with AI on equal footing. Meanwhile, large AI developers race ahead, sometimes using data sourced from these communities without consent.\nThe result? A lopsided tech economy where some benefit from AI and others are mined for it.\nThat\u2019s why platforms like Corral matter. It consolidates tribal consultation opportunities from U.S. federal agencies, allowing Indigenous leaders to engage with policy more efficiently. By automating time-consuming administrative work, Corral frees up capacity for governance, cultural preservation, and community programming \u2014 areas that too often get sidelined due to bandwidth constraints.\nWhat A Prosocial AI Future Looks Like\nThe promise of AI lies not in its novelty but in how it\u2019s directed. Prosocial AI \u2014 AI systems that are tailored, trained, tested, and targeted to bring out the best in and for people and the planet \u2014 is possible. It requires intent and inclusivity from design to deployment. Here\u2019s how:\nDesign with, not for\nAI systems must be co-developed with Indigenous communities, drawing on their knowledge systems and lived realities. This ensures technologies are accurate and aligned with cultural values and legal rights.\nInvest in ethical infrastructure\nRenewable-powered data centers, governed by local communities, can mitigate environmental harm while creating jobs and digital sovereignty.\nStrengthen data sovereignty\nCommunity-owned data cooperatives and legal protections must be established to prevent extractive practices. Consent isn\u2019t just polite\u2014it\u2019s essential.\nBridge the skills-to-systems gap\nCoding camps, fellowships, and open-access AI education should be scaled to ensure Indigenous youth and leaders are not only users but creators of AI.\nAI doesn\u2019t have to repeat the extractive logic of past innovations. It can help restore language, uplift knowledge, and accelerate justice \u2014 but only if we approach it as a tool in service of community-defined goals.\nThe choice is ours. Let\u2019s not just ask what AI can do. To reconfigure it with a holistic mindset, let\u2019s ask who it serves, why, and at what cost. What is outlined here, with a focus on Indigenous communities, applies to other minorities as well. AI can be a force of social good that serves everyone. But to unlock that potential, we must design our expanding artificial treasure chest with awareness of the differences that distinguish us and attention to the needs that we have in common. We are all different, but we all share the aspiration for happiness and the desire to be heard and respected. Prosocial AI can serve that purpose.\nThis article is part of a broader series exploring AI\u2019s impact on equity, sustainability, and society, including changemakers from MIT Solve."

      "text": "In recent weeks, the AI landscape reached a new milestone with the release of several reasoning models, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT o3-mini, Deep Seek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Building on the foundations laid by models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, these latest systems demonstrate notable gains in logical consistency and context awareness. Their rapid evolution does not unfold in isolation but coincide with technological strides on multiple fronts.\nA pragmatic response to these converging trends would be an investment in double literacy, an approach that curates and aligns both natural and artificial intelligence as a way of curating hybrid intelligence. Why?\nAn Acceleration Of Our Artificial Arsenal\nAs AI systems grow more capable, jailbreaking \u2014 manipulating AI to bypass its built-in constraints \u2014 has become an increasingly pressing concern. More powerful models often prove more vulnerable to exploitation, challenging developers and policymakers to keep safeguards ahead of potential misuse.\nAt the same time, agentic AI and robotics are making striking advances. Robots researched by NASA robotics and pioneered by Boston Dynamics, among others, illustrate how physical machines equipped with sophisticated sensors and actuators can now navigate, manipulate objects, and execute tasks with unprecedented agility. Meanwhile, purely software-based AI agents \u2014 think advanced virtual assistants or complex problem-solving programs \u2014 leverage machine learning, natural language processing, and large-scale data analysis to make autonomous decisions. They already tackle intricate tasks such as medical diagnostics or financial modeling without needing a physical form.\nIncreasingly, these two fields converge: software agents orchestrate fleets of robots, while robots generate invaluable real-world data to feed AI\u2019s learning processes. Yet, with the rise of powerful AI comes a heightened risk of jailbreaking and related vulnerabilities. The smarter these systems become, the harder they can be to control, underscoring the need for a balanced, human-guided approach that ensures such technologies serve constructive ends.\nGiven these rapid developments, double literacy, mastery of artificial and natural intelligence in complementarity is no longer optional. As (agentic and eventually embodied) AI becomes more deeply intertwined with daily life, individuals, communities, and entire societies must learn to engage with machine intelligence from a position of awareness and agency. But what is natural intelligence?\nNatural Intelligence: A Composition Of 2 x 4 Dimensions\nTo fully grasp the importance of double literacy, we must first define what natural intelligence entails. NI is not simply about cognition; it is a composite of twice four dimensions:\nAspiration, Emotion, Thought, and Sensation are the four core components of individual intelligence. Aspiration shapes long-term goals, emotion influences decision-making, thought structures logic and learning, and sensation grounds perception and experience.\nPerson, Community, Country, and Planet are the four collective dimensions of intelligence. Individuals are not isolated; they are embedded within communities, shaped by national policies, and influenced by global systems. Micro, meso, macro and meta arenas mutually influence each other, and the whole that they are part of. Everything is connected in a continuum of constant change,\nA holistic comprehension of NI means understanding that intelligence is neither purely individual nor solely cognitive. It is an interconnected web of experience shaped by our internal aspirations and emotions and the broader social and planetary context in which we operate. Unlike AI, which excels at processing vast datasets, NI integrates meaning, ethics, and adaptability into decision-making.\nThe Beauty Of Double Literacy\nNI literacy entails appreciating the multidimensional nature of human intelligence \u2014 encompassing aspiration, emotion, thought, and sensation\u2014and recognizing how these individual facets operate within broader social contexts, from person and community to country and planet.\nAI literacy involves understanding how AI models work, including their limitations and inherent biases, as well as the ethical considerations accompanying their use \u2014 such as the potential spread of misinformation and other unintended consequences. It also requires recognizing when to trust AI systems versus relying on human judgment and staying informed about ongoing developments in AI capabilities and regulations.\nA 360-degree understanding of brain and body, self and society, combined with a granular comprehension of technology, improves our critical thinking and moral reasoning ability. It also equips us to take personal responsibility for decisions and outcomes in increasingly hybrid society, in which billions are still left out from the enjoyment of even the most fundamental of their human rights such as education.\nCurating Hybrid Intelligence\nHybrid intelligence merges the best of AI and NI. Machines enhance human capabilities, while humans inject ethical judgment, empathy, and broader contextual understanding into automated processes. This synergy is transforming multiple domains:\nResearch: AI uncovers unconventional connections, but human researchers ensure meaningful interpretation and real-world application.\nMedicine: AI can identify early disease patterns in massive data pools, but doctors integrate empathy, patient histories, and ethical considerations.\nEducation: AI tailors learning paths to individual students while educators inspire creativity, critical thinking, and values-based reasoning.\nBusiness: AI streamlines operations and analyzes market trends, yet leaders provide strategic direction, relationship-building, and ethical guardrails.\nBy blending AI\u2019s precision with NI\u2019s depth, hybrid intelligence positions us to address complex societal challenges responsibly.\nTakeaway: 4 Questions For Daily Double Literacy\nTo strengthen double literacy, individuals and organizations can begin by asking four core questions whenever they interface with AI:\nWhy are you using AI?\nClarify your motivations and ambitions.\nWhat is the AI optimizing for?\nUnderstand the system\u2019s design, objectives, and incentives.\nDoes this align with my values?\nPinpoint where AI complements\u2014or conflicts with\u2014your human priorities.\nWhich decisions will I never delegate to AI?\nMaintain personal agency and moral responsibility in all human-AI collaborations.\nAs AI continues to evolve, merely adapting to new tools is not enough; we must systematically cultivate our own natural intelligence. Because only a deliberate balance of all our assets will ensure we remain informed curators of an ever-expanding universe of machine intelligence, not passive consumers. Agency amid AI is not a luxury but our best bet to flourish.\nSo far, understanding the organically evolving kaleidoscope that each of us represents is not part of traditional school curricula. It is time to change that to future-proof society.\nIn the meantime, each of us, particularly parents, teachers and caregivers, is well advised to start curating hybrid intelligence at home. Without hybrid intelligence, a deliberate balance of AI and NI, we risk designing systems that outpace our ability to guide them."

      "text": "Indigenous-led tech solutions for a better planet\nIndigenous people account for just over 6 per cent of the world\u2019s population today.\nYet they are vital protectors of an estimated 80 per cent of the world\u2019s remaining biodiversity. Indigenous communities have therefore become key partners to international climate, environment and development missions seeking global sustainability.\nSafeguarding and improving the quality of lives for present and future generations will depend partly on indigenous-led solutions, as the human communities closest to the land and the environment merge their deep knowledge with scientific inquiry and new technologies.\nToday, August 9, the International Day of Indigenous Peoples, the United Nations is calling for the inclusion, participation and approval of indigenous peoples in creating a system that benefits everyone.\nProtecting nature\nIndigenous knowledge and partnerships have helped to produce several notable technologies, with use cases ranging from medical to forensic to environmental. At the same time, many communities have turned to the latest tech to help secure their heritage and navigate the challenges of climate change.\nThe Awaj\u00fan people of Peru and the Achuar Nation of Ecuador, for instance, have started using geospatial tools to stop land encroachment and illegal logging. They have received training and now provide crucial support through Earth Observations for Indigenous-led Land Management (EO4IM), a joint project by the non-governmental organization Conservation International and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\nIn Brazil\u2019s Amazon rainforests, similarly, the Awapy Uru Eu Wau Wau indigenous people have used drones to monitor and report deforestation.\nIndigenous tech adoption can help to address ecological challenges worldwide.\nOn Australia\u2019s Cape York, a group of indigenous landowners and scientists have combined artificial intelligence (AI) and traditional knowledge to protect endangered baby turtles Real-time information and location tracking help indigenous rangers to intervene and stop predators from attacking turtle nests.\nThe GEO Indigenous Alliance, in parallel, is exploring ways to use Earth observation data to conserve indigenous cultural heritage.\nTraditional knowledge goes digital\nAlready, a rapidly changing global climate poses an existential threat to the lives of indigenous people.\nIn the Arctic, which has warmed three times more quickly than the planet as a whole, new technologies and generations-old wisdom are keeping Inuit communities safe when travelling and hunting on thinning ice.\nStationary sensors inserted into the ice and mobile sensors towed behind snowmobiles track ice and snow thickness in real time.\nThe data feeds into an app called SIKU, which means \u201csea ice\u201d in traditional Inuit languages. The app blends the sensor data with satellite imagery and up-to-date community knowledge to guide Inuit people on their trails.\nImage credit: Arctic Eider Society/SIKU\nThe Canadian government says it is working closely with indigenous communities to tackle climate change. In the Kivalliq region, science and qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit traditional knowledge, are being harnessed to study the links between climate, vegetation and caribou herd movements and address community concerns about food security.\nThe Earth Defenders Toolkit, co-created by the organization Digital Democracy, offers valuable tech for indigenous people and their allies. Their Mapeo app helps communities gather photographic evidence on environmental issues and record locations. Terrastories, which works offline as well, is a platform to record oral history storytelling of indigenous people.\nThe toolkit aims to support local autonomy and data sovereignty, which is based on the premise that all data generated belongs to the community.\nDriving digital inclusion\nAs people everywhere turn to information and communication technologies (ICTs) in their everyday lives, indigenous communities also need innovative solutions. Protecting traditional skills and values should not mean being left behind in the face of a widening digital divide.\nIn the San Diego area of the southwestern United States, the Tribal Digital Village project set out to connect underserved tribal and rural communities through wireless broadband. The network now serves over 500 kilometres of \u201cpoint-to-point\u201d and \u201cpoint-to-multi-point\u201d links supporting 86 offices and schools.\nWhile everyone needs adequate infrastructure, indigenous people also need to be able to use digital tools on their own terms.\nMikaela Jade, a Cabrogal woman of Australia\u2019s Dharug-speaking nation, advocates for a co-designed approach in bridging the digital divide. Her company, Indigital, provides training to indigenous Australian communities in augmented and mixed realities, AI, machine learning, the Internet of Things and geospatial technologies.\nTraining sessions draw on cultural knowledge and traditional language to engage with indigenous schools and communities.\nHeader image: Elder Jimmy Iqaluit and Hunter Johnny Kurluarok review posts on the SIKU online platform as a part of developing the platform.

      "text": "Indigenous Peoples and AI: Defending Rights, Shaping Futures\nWhile AI can support cultural revitalization, youth empowerment, and even adaptation to climate chance, it often reinforces bias, exclusion, and misrepresentation towards Indigenous Peoples.\nMost AI systems are built without Indigenous input, risking the misuse of their data, knowledge, and identities.\nBesides, massive data centers can also impact Indigenous lands, resources, and ecosystems. This is a new issue added to the barriers to accessing new technologies, especially in rural areas, excluding Indigenous from full participation in AI-related processes.\nTo unlock AI\u2019s full potential, Indigenous Peoples must be respected as rights-holders, co-creators, and decision-makers. Meaningful inclusion, data sovereignty, and culturally grounded innovation are key to ensuring AI empowers their communities.\nThe upcoming International Day of the World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples will put a spotlight on this through its theme, Indigenous Peoples and AI: Defending Rights, Shaping Futures.\nSpread the word! Let\u2019s leave no one behind. #IndigenousPeoples\nCommemoration event\nAugust 8, 2025\n9:00 - 10:30 a.m. EDT, New York time\nRegister for this online UN event where speakers will discuss how Indigenous Peoples rights can be ensured in the age of AI, and the associated challenges and opportunities Indigenous Peoples face.\nWe need indigenous communities for a better world\nThere are an estimated 476 million Indigenous Peoples in the world living across 90 countries. They make up less than 6 per cent of the world's population, but account for at least 15 per cent of the poorest. They speak an overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s estimated 7,000 languages and represent 5,000 different cultures.\nIndigenous Peoples are inheritors and practitioners of unique cultures and ways of relating to people and the environment. They have retained social, cultural, economic and political characteristics that are distinct from those of the dominant societies in which they live. Despite their cultural differences, Indigenous Peoples from around the world share common problems related to the protection of their rights as distinct peoples.\nIndigenous Peoples have sought recognition of their identities, their way of life and their right to traditional lands, territories and natural resources for years. Yet, throughout history, their rights have been violated. Indigenous Peoples today, are arguably among the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of people in the world. The international community now recognizes that special measures are required to protect their rights and maintain their distinct cultures and way of life.\nIn order to raise awareness of the needs of these population groups, every 9 August commemorates the International Day of the World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples, chosen in recognition of the first meeting of the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations held in Geneva in 1982.\nDid you know?\n- In Polynesia, Indigenous-led reef conservation projects are using AI to monitor coral health.\n- In Inuit territories, AI models are being co-developed with Indigenous wisdom to help communities adapt to climate change.\n- In New Zealand, they are using an AI natural language processing tool to help revitalize the M\u0101ori language.\nDo you know the Equator Initiative?\nIt is a global network promoted by UNDP in recognition of the wisdom of Indigenous peoples and local communities around the world. Through this movement, learn about surprising stories of Indigenous knowledge."

These include efforts to translate and incorporate isolated parts of their language and traditional practises into the prevailing culture. Major problems with this process are the incommensurability of such attempts whereby the real meaning of a custom or word is frequently debased and divorced from its traditional cultural setting, so that its proper functioning is impaired. Added to this is the ignorance on the part of many concerning the conceptual world view, traditional beliefs and practices of the Maori ? or, if knowing these things, a lack of respect for their validity. On the other hand there are some, especially among the modern conservation movement, who have a more empathetic attitude towards indigenous ecological knowledge, but who thereby assume that their environmental ethics and those of indigenous peoples are motivated by similar philosophies and share similar aims. Not only is this assumption often wrong, it may also contribute to the inability of the western conservation movement to properly serve the needs of, and to fully empower, indigenous conservation aspirations as guaranteed to Maori under the Treaty of Waitangi. This paper addresses some of these issues by providing Maori perspectives on an increasingly important environmental concept: that of kaitiaki, and kaitiakitanga.https://doi.org/10.1071/PC950007\n\u00a9 CSIRO 1995"

      "text": "The air in boardrooms is thick with the buzz of Artificial Intelligence. Just recently, major players like OpenAI and Google have signaled a massive push toward AI literacy in schools and on university campuses, recognizing that the workforce needs to understand these powerful tools early on. This singular focus on AI literacy misses a deeper truth: the real competitive edge in our algorithmic future won't come from understanding AI alone. It will emerge from cultivating double literacy, a fundamental fluency in both the artificial and critically, the human.\nOur collective fascination with technology has begun to further sideline the very human capacities that define our ingenuity, our ethics and our ability to truly innovate. The current drive for AI literacy is a useful step, but it must be paired with an equally deliberate cultivation of human literacy. Without dual mastery, people and businesses risk not just inefficiency, but medium term mediocrity due to the erosion of nuanced judgment, compassion and creative sparks that only human beings can provide (so far at least).\nBeyond Prompts: What Is Double Literacy?\nDouble Literacy is not another buzzword; it's a strategic multigenerational investment for the modern enterprise. It encompasses two interconnected pillars:\nAlgorithmic Literacy: This is the essential understanding of how AI actually functions. It moves beyond simply knowing how to use an AI tool to grasp its underlying logic, its inherent biases, its limitations, and its optimal applications. It means recognizing when an AI is confident but wrong, when its data is skewed, or when a task truly requires human intuition over algorithmic calculation. This level of understanding is critical for effective interaction and responsible deployment.\nHuman Literacy: This involves a commitment to a continuous development and safeguarding of our uniquely human capacities. It's about sharpening critical thinking, fostering empathy, strengthening ethical reasoning, nurturing creativity and honing the ability to ask candid, open-ended questions that a large language model, by its very nature, cannot generate. It's the holistic understanding of self, others, and the intricate tapestry of society.\nWhy are both indispensable? Because the most powerful breakthroughs, the most resilient strategies, and the most impactful innovations arise from the seamless, conscious collaboration between these two distinct forms of intelligence.\nUnseen Frictions: Why We Need Double Literacy, Now\nThe best time to invest in Double Literacy was yesterday, the next best time is now.. This is driven by several converging forces:\n- The Paradox of Unconscious Collaboration: Recent Gallup research paints a telling picture: while algorithmic tool adoption has surged (a 12-point increase in white-collar roles since 2024), employee preparedness to work with AI has declined from 2024 to 2025. This growing disconnect signals an \"unconscious collaboration\" where AI integration outpaces our human and cultural adaptation. We are using AI, but not always with full awareness or optimal engagement.\n- The Cognitive Offloading Dilemma: Our natural tendency to delegate mental tasks to external systems, known as cognitive offloading, is accelerating. While AI can significantly boost productivity and quality, as highlighted by recent Harvard Business School research, it can also subtly erode our critical thinking skills if we bypass essential mental effort. The challenge lies in achieving \"appropriate reliance\"\u2014a finely tuned trust that allows humans and machines to collaborate effectively without sacrificing human cognitive autonomy.\n- The Mandate for Transparency: The European Union's AI Act, effective August 1, 2024, underscores the global shift towards transparency in AI. Its emphasis on users' understanding when they interact with AI systems reflects a cultural commitment to conscious engagement, demanding that businesses cultivate both algorithmic understanding and human oversight.\n- Misleading Trust: Data reveals a frightening pattern: studies suggest AI use may reduce critical thinking skills, particularly among younger, more frequent users. This highlights the urgent need to nurture conscious engagement, not just passive adoption. This dynamic plays out to another phenomenon whereby the more humans trust the AI the less they verify its outputs \u2013 and the more they trust the artificial intelligence the less they rely on their own judgement and thinking.\nA Promise: Hybrid Intelligence To Amplify Potential\nThe true promise of AI lies not in replacing natural intelligence, but in amplifying and diversifying it. This is the core of hybrid intelligence, where human-in-the-loop collaboration and cognitive computing merge. When humans possess strong algorithmic literacy, they can effectively leverage AI's analytical power, speed, and pattern recognition. When they also possess strong human literacy, they can provide the essential context, ethical discernment, empathy, and creative vision that AI lacks.\nThis symbiosis leads to a new chapter of potential. Imagine medical researchers using AI for rapid diagnostic imaging, while human experts provide the context relevant judgment for life-critical decisions. Or jazz musicians collaborating with generative AI to explore harmonic possibilities, with human artistry guiding the algorithm toward emotionally resonant compositions. As research on human-machine collaboration indicates, insights from cognitive psychology can help educators and trainers utilize AI tools to facilitate learning, enhancing human cognitive processes rather than replacing them. The outcome is not just efficiency, but breakthroughs that neither human nor machine could achieve alone.\nPractical Takeaways: RISE By With Double Literacy\nFor business leaders ready to proactively cultivate Double Literacy within their organizations, the RISE framework offers a tangible starting point:\n- Reframe: Shift the organizational mindset from viewing AI as merely a tool for automation to recognizing it as a genuine cognitive partner. This reframing is essential for fostering a culture of conscious collaboration. Encourage teams to explore how AI can augment their unique human skills, rather than fearing displacement.\n- Invest: Prioritize investment in both algorithmic and human literacy. This means providing training not only on AI tools and their technical aspects but also on critical thinking, ethical reasoning, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving. Consider cross-disciplinary workshops where technologists and humanists learn from each other.\n- Scrutinize: Implement processes that encourage intelligent skepticism. Teach employees to critically evaluate AI outputs, question assumptions, and understand the provenance of data. Foster a culture where challenging algorithmic recommendations is seen as a strength, leading to more robust and ethical outcomes. This includes transparent internal guidelines for AI use.\n- Empower: Design workflows and organizational structures that empower humans to retain agency and ethical oversight in AI-driven processes. Ensure that AI serves human flourishing, not the other way around. Empower teams to experiment responsibly with AI, learn from failures, and adapt their approaches based on real-world feedback and human values.\nThe future of innovation belongs to those who master the delicate, powerful dance between human and artificial intelligence. By deliberately cultivating Double Literacy, businesses can not only navigate the algorithmic age but lead it, ensuring that technology amplifies our humanity, rather than diminishing it."

      "text": "potlatch\npotlatch, ceremonial distribution of property and gifts to affirm or reaffirm social status, as uniquely institutionalized by the Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Pacific coast. The potlatch reached its most elaborate development among the southern Kwakiutl from 1849 to 1925. Although each group had its characteristic version, the potlatch had certain general features. Ceremonial formalities were observed in inviting guests, in speechmaking, and in the distribution of goods by the donor according to the social rank of the recipients. The size of the gatherings reflected the rank of the donor. Great feasts and generous hospitality accompanied the potlatch, and the efforts of the kin group of the host were exerted to maximize the generosity. The proceedings gave wide publicity to the social status of donor and recipients because there were many witnesses.\nA potlatch was given by an heir or successor to assert and validate his newly assumed social position. Important events such as marriages, births, deaths, and initiations into secret societies were also occasions for potlatches; but trivial events were used just as often, because the main purpose of a potlatch was not the occasion itself but the validation of claims to social rank. The potlatch was also used as a face-saving device by individuals who had suffered public embarrassment and as a means of competition between rivals in social rank."

Some 3,000 \u2014 three-quarters of the total \u2014 could disappear before the end of the century, or one every two weeks, according to UNESCO.\nAs part of a movement to protect such languages, New Zealand\u2019s Te Hiku Media, a broadcaster focused on the M\u0101ori people\u2019s indigenous language known as te reo, is using trustworthy AI to help preserve and revitalize the tongue.\nUsing ethical, transparent methods of speech data collection and analysis to maintain data sovereignty for the M\u0101ori people, Te Hiku Media is developing automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for te reo, which is a Polynesian language.\nBuilt using the open-source NVIDIA NeMo toolkit for ASR and NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, the speech-to-text models transcribe te reo with 92% accuracy. It can also transcribe bilingual speech using English and te reo with 82% accuracy. They\u2019re pivotal tools, made by and for the M\u0101ori people, that are helping preserve and amplify their stories.\n\u201cThere\u2019s immense value in using NVIDIA\u2019s open-source technologies to build the tools we need to ultimately achieve our mission, which is the preservation, promotion and revitalization of te reo M\u0101ori,\u201d said Keoni Mahelona, chief technology officer at Te Hiku Media, who leads a team of data scientists and developers, as well as M\u0101ori language experts and data curators, working on the project.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also helping guide the industry on ethical ways of using data and technologies to ensure they\u2019re used for the empowerment of marginalized communities,\u201d added Mahelona, a Native Hawaiian now living in New Zealand.\nBuilding a \u2018House of Speech\u2019\nTe Hiku Media began more than three decades ago as a radio station aiming to ensure te reo had space on the airwaves. Over the years, the organization incorporated television broadcasting and, with the rise of the internet, it convened a meeting in 2013 with the community\u2019s elders to form a strategy for sharing content in the digital era.\n\u201cThe elders agreed that we should make the stories accessible online for our community members \u2014 rather than just keeping our archives on cassettes in boxes \u2014 but once we had that objective, the challenge was how to do this correctly, in alignment with our strong roots in valuing sovereignty,\u201d Mahelona said.\nInstead of uploading its video and audio sources to popular, global platforms \u2014 which, in their terms and conditions of use, require signing over certain rights related to the content \u2014 Te Hiku Media decided to build its own content distribution platform.\nCalled Whare K\u014drero \u2014 meaning \u201chouse of speech\u201d \u2014 the platform now holds more than 30 years\u2019 worth of digitized, archival material featuring about 1,000 hours of te reo native speakers, some of whom were born in the late 19th century, as well as more recent content from second-language learners and bilingual M\u0101ori people.\nNow, around 20 M\u0101ori radio stations use and upload their content to Whare K\u014drero.

So began the organization\u2019s trustworthy AI efforts, in 2016, to accelerate its work using ASR.\n\u201cNo one would have a clue that there are eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs in our derelict, rundown, musky-smelling building in the far north of New Zealand \u2014 training and building M\u0101ori language models,\u201d Mahelona said. \u201cBut the work has been game-changing for us.\u201d\nTo collect speech data in a transparent, ethically compliant, community-oriented way, Te Hiku Media began by explaining its cause to elders, garnering their support and asking them to come to the station to read phrases aloud.\n\u201cIt was really important that we had the support of the elders and that we recorded their voices, because that\u2019s the sort of content we want to transcribe,\u201d Mahelona said. \u201cBut eventually these efforts didn\u2019t scale \u2014 we needed second-language learners, kids, middle-aged people and a lot more speech data in general.\u201d\nSo, the organization ran a crowdsourcing campaign, K\u014drero M\u0101ori, to collect highly labeled speech samples according to the Kaitiakitanga license, which ensures Te Hiku Media uses the data only for the benefit of the M\u0101ori people.\nIn just 10 days, more than 2,500 signed up to read 200,000+ phrases, providing over 300 hours of labeled speech data, which was used to build and train the te reo M\u0101ori ASR models.\nIn addition to other open-source trustworthy AI tools, Te Hiku Media now uses the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit\u2019s ASR module for speech AI throughout its entire pipeline. The NeMo toolkit comprises building blocks called neural modules and includes pretrained models for language model development.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely amazing \u2014 NVIDIA\u2019s open-source NeMo enabled our ASR models to be bilingual and added automatic punctuation to our transcriptions,\u201d Mahelona said.\nTe Hiku Media\u2019s ASR models are the engines running behind Kaituhi, a te reo M\u0101ori transcription service now available online.\nThe efforts have spurred similar ASR projects now underway by Native Hawaiians and the Mohawk people in southeastern Canada.\n\u201cIt\u2019s indigenous-led work in trustworthy AI that\u2019s inspiring other indigenous groups to think: \u2018If they can do it, we can do it, too,\u2019\u201d Mahelona said.\nLearn more about NVIDIA-powered trustworthy AI, the NVIDIA NeMo toolkit and how it enabled a Telugu language speech AI breakthrough."

Indigenous communities worldwide are co\u2011creating hybrid systems\u2014combining AI with traditional ecological wisdom\u2014to protect language, monitor climate, and safeguard cultural rights. The article argues for \"double literacy,\" a dual fluency in both AI and human (natural) intelligence, to ensure technology amplifies rather than undermines collective resilience. It highlights Ubuntu and other Indigenous philosophies as models for ethical, relational AI governance that prioritizes regeneration, intergenerational responsibility, and shared prosperity.",
