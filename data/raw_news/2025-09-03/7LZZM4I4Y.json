  "title": "How To Invest In Your Business When An Exit Is On The Horizon",
  "description": "Learn how to shift from revenue growth, to building business value. Invest smartly in your small business exit strategy before you think about selling your business.",
  "content": "You\u2019re bringing in great revenue, your team is growing, and you\u2019ve got exciting offers in the pipeline. But then someone asks, \"Is your business sellable?\" And suddenly, you pause. Because deep down, you know growth and value aren\u2019t the same thing. You might be building something big, but not necessarily something sellable.\n\nThat\u2019s the quiet danger for a lot of small business owners: investing in their business without being clear on the finish line. Growing your business and selling your business both require investment, but they don\u2019t follow the same route. If you wait too long to pivot, you might scale a business your future self wouldn\u2019t want to buy.\n\nMost small business owners know how to invest for growth. You hire. You launch new services. You move into bigger markets. You pour resources into top-line, revenue expansion because that\u2019s what gets you the dopamine hit: bigger months, bigger milestones, bigger momentum.\n\nBut growth, unchecked, can become a trap. Growth doesn\u2019t guarantee profit. Growth doesn\u2019t mean the business can run without you. Growth doesn\u2019t mean a business buyer will want it. Because buyers aren\u2019t impressed by chaos, even if it\u2019s profitable chaos. And they definitely won\u2019t pay top dollar for a business that requires the owner to stay involved.\n\nAs I said recently on my Master Your Exit show:\n\nThat mental shift changes everything: from how you lead your team to how you invest in your business.\n\nWhat Business Buyers Really Want\n\nA business that looks good on the surface isn\u2019t the same as one that holds up under scrutiny. Business buyers aren\u2019t just buying your revenue. They\u2019re buying your systems, your sustainability, your team. Here\u2019s what they actually want:\n\u2022 A business that doesn\u2019t revolve around you\n\nAs I say often:\n\nAnd \"easy to run\" starts long before you think about selling your business.\n\nHow to Invest When An Exit Is 1 to 3 Years Away\n\nIf you know selling your business is on the horizon, it\u2019s time to invest in your business differently. You still want growth, but now it\u2019s intentional. Strategic. Sellable.\n\n1. Focus on profitability over top-line revenue. \n\n A higher top line might feel impressive, but business buyers care about what\u2019s left after expenses. Improve your margins and manage your costs.\n\n2. Remove yourself from day-to-day operations. \n\n You can still lead, but you can\u2019t be the driving force. Start with removing yourself from client delivery, then marketing, then leadership. Create a business that runs without you.\n\n3. Prioritize financial clarity. \n\n Stop running your business by looking at its bank balance. Build a monthly review rhythm. Know your numbers. Invest in a fractional CFO if needed.\n\n4. Invest in systems, not just people. \n\n Great people need great infrastructure. Document your processes. Systematize delivery. Make training and handover easy.\n\n5. De-risk your business. \n\n Don\u2019t rely on one big client. Avoid single points of failure. Build a resilient business that can take a hit and keep going.\n\nThese shifts don\u2019t just make your business sellable, they make it more enjoyable too. Because creating freedom and having an exit-ready business are the same thing.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: you don\u2019t have to sell your business. But you should build it like you will sell it. Why? Because an exit-ready business gives you options: You can scale. You can step back. You can cash out or reinvest. You can fall back in love with your company or confidently pass it on.\n\nToo many founders wait to prepare for an exit until they want to sell their business. But the best time to build a sellable business is while you still enjoy running it.\n\nAs I often say:\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the sale. It\u2019s about the space and freedom you create for yourself by removing friction and dependence. You get your time back. You get your creativity back. You get your power back. That\u2019s what strategic investment really buys you.\n\nIf you\u2019re scaling now and thinking about exiting later, don\u2019t wait to adjust your strategy. The investments you make today determine whether your business is desirable tomorrow.",

      "text": "Every business owner wants to build a valuable business. But when you\u2019re thinking about value and only considering revenue or profit, you\u2019re missing the real metric business buyers care about: buyer\u2019s risk.\nMost owners looking to sell their business obsess over valuations. \"Can I get four times profit? Maybe six times if I wait a year?\" But valuations and these so called \u2018multiples\u2019 are just a reflection of how safe your business looks to someone who\u2019s considering buying your business. Multiples aren\u2019t magical. They\u2019re mathematical and rooted in a buyer\u2019s gut feeling about how risky it is to own what you\u2019ve built.\nBuyers aren\u2019t just purchasing your brand, your clients, or your revenue. They\u2019re buying a future stream of income. And their most important question is: how stable is that stream?\nIf you want to sell your business for life-changing money, you need to see your company through a buyer\u2019s eyes. That means understanding what risk looks like to them and how it silently subtracts from your valuation.\nWhat \"Risk\" Really Means To A Buyer\nImagine someone is about to spend one million dollars on your business. That money isn\u2019t just a payment, it\u2019s an investment to them. And just like any investor, they\u2019re running a mental checklist: Can this business run without the current owner? Are these profits predictable? What are the chances something blows up in year one?\nThe higher the perceived risk, the faster they want to earn their money back. And the faster they want their return, the lower they\u2019ll offer. That\u2019s how risk works: it drives down your business valuation, even when your profits look solid.\nIn other words, two businesses with the same revenue and margin can sell for wildly different prices\u2014purely based on how risky they appear to buyers.\n3 Risk Factors That Shrink Your Valuation\nMost business buyers use a mix of instinct and data to judge risk. But over the years, a few patterns have emerged. Here are three of the biggest red flags that drag your valuation down:\n- Owner Dependency: If you are the business\u2014the rainmaker, the operator, the face\u2014you\u2019re also the risk. Buyers worry that when you leave, the business might collapse. That fear directly lowers your business value.\n- Client Concentration: If more than a half of your revenue comes from one client, buyers ask the obvious question: what happens if that client leaves? They see fragility, not stability.\n- Inconsistent Revenue: Spiky cash flow, one-off projects, and seasonal ups and downs create unpredictability. Buyers prefer boring, stable, and dependable. Peaks and valleys make them nervous.\nHow Risk Changes The Value Of Your Business\nLet\u2019s say your business earns $300,000 in annual profit. A buyer is interested in a 25% return would pay around four times your profit\u2014a $1.2 million valuation. But if they see risk and demand a 33% return, that multiple drops to three times profit, bringing your valuation down to $900,000.\nSame business. Different perception. $300,000 difference.\nThis isn\u2019t just theoretical. It\u2019s how deals happen every day. Financial buyers have target returns, and they back into valuations based on how confident they feel in achieving them. Your job is to make them feel more confident. Lower the perceived risk, and you increase the price.\nReal-World Example: Risk Vs. Readiness\nTake a creative agency doing $1.2 million in annual revenue with a 35% profit margin. On paper, that\u2019s a $420,000 profit. But how that profit is earned makes all the difference.\nIn scenario A, the founder manages every client, two clients drive 60% of revenue, and there are no documented systems. A buyer might value that at 2.5 times profit, around $1.05 million.\nNow, imagine the same agency twelve months later. An account manager handles relationships, no single client drives more than 20% of revenue, and systems are documented. The buyer\u2019s perceived risk drops, and the multiple climbs to four times profit, around $1.68 million.\nSame revenue. Same profit. $630,000 increase in valuation\u2014just by reducing risk.\nHow To Make Your Business Less Risky\nYou don\u2019t need to be perfect to sell your business. You just need to be significantly less risky than the average seller in your category. Here are key areas where buyers look for stability:\n- Independence: Build a team that runs day-to-day operations. The less you\u2019re needed, the more valuable your business becomes. Document roles. Train people. Step back.\n- Recurring Revenue: Predictable income is the holy grail. Subscriptions, retainers, and licensing deals make buyers feel secure. Project-based work? That feels like a gamble.\n- Diversified Revenue: Spread your income across more customers, more offers, or more markets. If one thing falls apart, the business still stands. That\u2019s how you show resilience.\n- Operational Systems: SOPs, automations, dashboards\u2014these aren\u2019t just internal tools. They signal to buyers that your business can scale and survive without you.\n- Clean Financials: Buyers don\u2019t trust messy books. They want clarity. That means proper accounting, clean P&Ls, and a firm grip on metrics like customer acquisition cost and lifetime value.\n- Transferable Brand: If the founder\u2019s personal brand is front and center, buyers wonder if customers will stick around post-exit. Build a brand that lives beyond you.\n- Transition Plan: Buyers pay more when they feel supported. Offer a clear handover, introduce them to key relationships, and have a plan for continuity. It lowers friction and boosts confidence.\nRisk Isn\u2019t Just Evaluated, It\u2019s Engineered\nMost business owners underestimate how much they can influence perceived risk. But once you understand how buyers think, the game changes. You can proactively shape the story they see.\nYou can reassign responsibilities to your team. You can document your sales funnel. You can renegotiate contracts to add stability. These aren\u2019t massive overhauls. They\u2019re small shifts that build trust. And trust is what drives up your business value.\nValue Is Psychology\nBuyers use numbers, but they decide based on emotion. Logic tells them your EBITDA is solid. But emotion says, \u201cCan I sleep at night owning this?\u201d\nWhen your business feels stable, structured, and scalable, buyers relax. They pay more. They bid faster. And you walk away with a better deal.\nSo the next time you think about valuation, don\u2019t start with the multiple. Start with the buyer\u2019s risk. Then reduce it. That\u2019s how you raise your price and exit on your terms."

      "text": "What if the perfect buyer for your business is already in your inbox? Or sitting across from you in your Monday team meeting? Most small business owners don\u2019t need to post their business on a marketplace or hire a high-fee broker to sell their business. They just need a better system for identifying the right buyer, at the right time, with the right motivation to say yes.\nIn this article, you\u2019ll learn a 6-step framework, with a practical, proven path for finding the buyer who sees value in what you\u2019ve built and is ready to take it to the next level.\nStep 1: Understand the Different Types of Business Buyers\nBefore you go looking for a business buyer, get clear on who you\u2019re actually looking for. There isn\u2019t just one type of buyer, there are three main ones, and each brings different expectations and priorities to the table.\nStrategic buyers are often companies already in your industry or a related field. They pay a premium because acquiring your business gives them a strategic advantage, like new customers, products, or market access. They\u2019re harder to find, but they often pay the most.\nFinancial buyers look at your business purely as an investment. They\u2019re focused on financial performance, return potential, and future cash flow. They don\u2019t care as much about industry fit, they care about profitability and scalability.\nLifestyle buyers are common in smaller deals. Think solo entrepreneurs or operators who want to step into a stable business they can run themselves. These buyers want cash flow, simplicity, and a business that doesn\u2019t require a huge team or complex systems.\nKnowing which buyer type fits your business helps you tailor your pitch, prepare your materials, and choose the right outreach strategies.\nStep 2: Start With Your Inner Circle\nMost successful small business exits happen behind the scenes, long before anyone lists their business publicly. The reason? Trust. Your buyer is likely someone who already knows you, respects your work, and understands your business.\nStart by making a list of potential buyers in your existing network. Think about:\n- Employees who have expressed long-term interest or loyalty\n- Co-founders or business partners\n- Family members already involved in operations\n- Long-time suppliers or vendors who know how your business runs\n- Loyal clients or customers who might want to expand\n- Industry peers or even indirect competitors who understand your space\nDon\u2019t overthink it. Just brainstorm 10 to 20 names or companies and rank them by two things: trust and alignment.\nStep 3: Expand One Degree Out\nOnce you\u2019ve mapped your immediate circle, look one level beyond. These aren\u2019t strangers, but they\u2019re not in your day-to-day orbit either. This step helps you explore warm leads without making your sale public.\nPotential candidates in this tier include:\n- Former employees who understand your systems and culture\n- Industry associations, events, or online communities with potential buyers\n- Founders in adjacent niches\n- Accountants, attorneys, or consultants who know entrepreneurs looking to buy\nOne founder we worked with ended up selling their agency to a long-time supplier who casually mentioned wanting to expand into service delivery. An example of intentional networking, which lead to an exit.\nStep 4: Proceed Carefully With Competitors\nCompetitors can absolutely become the buyer of your business. But you need to protect yourself. Not every inquiry is in good faith. Sometimes, a competitor will act interested just to get a look under the hood.\nHere\u2019s how to stay safe while exploring competitor interest:\n- Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) early in the conversation\n- Share high-level financials first, not client lists or internal processes\n- Wait until after a signed Letter of Intent (LOI) before revealing sensitive data\n- Vet their intent through your advisor, especially if you\u2019re unsure of their motivation\nTrust, but verify. And always keep control of what gets shared and when.\nStep 5: Use External Buyer Tools If Needed\nIf your network doesn\u2019t yield serious leads, there are reputable platforms and professionals who can help connect you with qualified buyers. But not every tool is the right fit for every business.\nOnline buyer platforms like Acquire.com, Flippa, Baton and BizBuySell work well for digital businesses, productized services, or brands with clear systems and recurring revenue.\nBusiness brokers can help for more traditional businesses. The right broker will have a vetted buyer list and guide you through negotiations and valuation. Just be mindful of fees and vet their track record.\nM&A advisors are best for higher-value exits (typically $1M+ in profit) or when intellectual property, licensing, or growth potential is part of the deal. These professionals offer a tailored approach, including confidential outreach and detailed due diligence support.\nStep 6: Don\u2019t Just Sell But Select the Right Buyer\nJust because someone wants to buy your business doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the right fit. Remember, you\u2019re not just selling assets. You\u2019re passing on something you built. It deserves a buyer who aligns with your vision and values.\nHere\u2019s what to look for:\n- Do they have proof of funds or financing lined up?\n- What\u2019s their motivation for buying?\n- Have they acquired a business before, or will this be their first?\n- How do they plan to transition or grow the company?\n- Are they someone your team, clients, or vendors will respect?\nTalk to other founders they\u2019ve bought from (if applicable). Ask about the handover, post-sale experience, and any surprises. You want to know what it\u2019s really like doing a deal with them.\nFinal Thoughts: Your Business Buyer Is In Your Network\nFinding a buyer for your business doesn\u2019t require luck. It requires clarity, preparation, and the willingness to start with who you already know. I\u2019ve seen time and again that the best deals are born from relationships, not form cold listings.\nSo start now. List out your potential buyers. Map your network. Ask your advisors and entrepreneurial friends who they know. The right buyer might be closer than you think. Don\u2019t just hope for a big exit. Build one. On purpose."

      "text": "Is your small business doing well, but you want it to grow even more? Maybe you're thinking about selling it someday. Many small business owners dream of this, but they don't know how to do it. Don't worry! I'll show you ten simple steps to grow your business and make it appealing to buyers. These aren't just ideas - they're proven methods that have worked for many business owners like you.\nHow to Grow Your Small Business in 10 Steps\nFollow these steps to turn your small business into something bigger that people might want to buy:\n- Improve Your Business Plan\n- Create Better Work Systems\n- Make Your Finances Clear\n- Find Different Ways to Make Money\n- Build a Strong Brand\n- Get More Customers\n- Use Technology to Help You\n- Build a Great Team\n- Plan How You'll Sell Your Business\n- Create a Good Marketing Plan\nLet's look at each step in more detail.\n1. Improve Your Business Plan\nYour business plan is very important. It's like a map for your business. To grow, you need to understand what's working well and what isn't in your current plan.\nTip: Look at how you make money now. Which products or services make the most money with the least work? Focus on these. Think about stopping or automating the parts that don't make much money.\nExample: Sarah was a graphic designer who made custom designs for clients. She realized this took a lot of time and limited how much she could grow. So, she started selling ready-made design templates online instead. This way, she could make more money without working more hours.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n2. Create Better Work Systems\nTo grow your business, you need to work efficiently. This means having good systems in place. Without clear ways of doing things, your business might become messy and stressful as it grows.\nTip: Write down how you do everything in your business. This includes how you talk to clients, how you manage projects, and how you handle daily tasks. Use tools like Asana or Trello to create step-by-step guides that anyone on your team can follow.\nPersonal Story: When I started my first business, I kept everything in my head. This worked when it was just me, but it became a problem when I started hiring people. Things only started running smoothly when I wrote down all our processes.\n3. Make Your Finances Clear\nIf you want to sell your business someday, buyers will want to see clear financial records. If your finances are messy or unclear, it will be hard to find someone who wants to buy your business.\nExpert Advice: Work with an accountant to organize your finances. Make sure all your financial statements are accurate and up-to-date. Buyers will look closely at these, so they need to be clear and honest.\nTip: Use accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero. These tools can automatically track your money and create reports. This keeps your finances organized and makes it easier to show buyers how your business is doing.\n4. Find Different Ways to Make Money\nRelying on just one way to make money can be risky. Having multiple revenue sources makes your business more stable and more attractive to buyers who want a safe investment.\nTip: Look at your current customers. Can you offer them new products or services that go well with what they already buy? Also, think about selling to new types of customers or entering new markets.\nExample: Mike owned a small digital marketing agency that mostly did SEO work. He noticed that many companies were offering SEO, which was driving prices down. So, he started offering content marketing too. This made his agency more valuable, and larger companies became interested in buying it.\nExtra Resource: 6 Passive Revenue Ideas For Small Business Owners\n5. Build a Strong Brand\nYour brand is more than just your logo or slogan. It's how people think and feel about your business. A strong, consistent brand can make your business much more valuable.\nTip: Review your brand. Does your message, look, and customer experience all match? If not, make changes. Make sure your brand shows what makes your business special and appeals to your target customers.\nPersonal Story: When I started my second business, I focused on branding from the beginning. I hired professionals to help create a strong brand, and I made sure everything about my business - from the website to how we talked to customers - matched this brand.\nExtra resources: 3 Steps to Turn A Personal Brand into a Business Asset\n6. Get More Loyal Customers\nBuyers want businesses with many loyal customers. If most of your money comes from just a few clients, buyers might see your business as risky.\nTip: Focus on keeping your current customers happy and finding new ones. Start loyalty programs, talk to your customers often, and always look for new clients. This makes your income more stable and your business more attractive to buyers.\nExample: Jane ran a small personal investing company. At first, 80% of her money came from just two clients. She knew this was risky, so she worked hard to get new clients and offer more services. Over time, she built a diverse group of clients, which made her business worth much more when she decided to sell it.\n7. Use Technology to Help You\nThe right technology can help small businesses grow faster and work more efficiently. It can automate repetitive tasks, improve customer experiences, and boost your marketing efforts.\nTip: Use customer relationship management (CRM) systems like HubSpot or Salesforce to manage client relationships and track potential sales. Use tools like Zapier to automate tasks, and try AI-powered analytics tools to understand your business performance better.\nExpert Advice: Keep up with new technology in your industry. Using the latest software or exploring new tech can help you stay ahead of competitors and make your business more appealing to tech-savvy buyers.\n8. Build a Great Team\nYour business is only as good as the people who work in it. Buyers aren't just investing in your products or services; they're investing in your team too.\nTip: Hire good people and keep them happy. Create a positive work environment, pay fair salaries, and give opportunities for learning and growth. A strong, motivated team will help your business grow and make it more attractive to buyers.\nExample: John, who owned a successful online store, knew his small but mighty team was crucial.

      "text": "For small businesses with less than $2 million in annual sales\u2014often called Main Street Businesses\u2014the unfortunate truth is that the market of buyers can be illiquid. Unlike large corporations or high-growth startups, small businesses often lack a broad pool of eager buyers. So the question arises: Who would buy my business? The good news is, there are specific types of buyers that might be interested in your business, each with its own advantages and challenges.\nSo, who would buy your small business? The most likely candidates are:\n- Another company: This could include competitors, suppliers, or even customers who see strategic value in your business.\n- A private equity firm: These firms are increasingly interested in smaller, niche companies, especially in tech, SaaS, and consulting.\n- An employee: Selling to someone who already knows the ropes can create a seamless transition.\n- A family member: Keeping the business in the family can preserve your legacy.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each of these potential buyers, their motivations, and the factors you need to consider when deciding if they\u2019re the right fit for your business.\n1. Selling Your Business to Another Company, Including Private Equity Firms\nSelling to another company is often the most financially lucrative option. These buyers see your business as a strategic asset that can enhance their own operations. Whether it\u2019s a competitor looking to expand market share, a supplier aiming to vertically integrate, or a private equity firm with a roll-up strategy, these buyers often value your business for more than just its financials.\nAdvantages Of Selling Your Business To Another Company\n- Higher potential profit: Strategic buyers may be willing to pay a premium if your business offers unique advantages, such as access to new markets, proprietary technology, or cost-saving synergies.\n- Possible bidding war: If your business attracts multiple interested parties, you could see a bidding war drive up the price.\n- Synergies: Buyers often look for businesses that complement their own, whether through product offerings, customer base, or operational efficiencies. This can increase the value of your business in their eyes.\nDisadvantages Of Selling Your Business To Another Company\n- Cultural clashes: If the buyer\u2019s company culture differs significantly from yours, it could lead to integration challenges. This might affect your employees, customers, and even your brand\u2019s reputation.\n- Loss of reputation: Once the business changes hands, you\u2019ll no longer have control over its operations or brand. Poor decisions by the new owners could reflect poorly on you.\n- Loss of control: After the sale, you may have little to no say in how the business is run. This can be difficult for founders who have poured their heart and soul into building their company.\nDeciding Factor To Sell Your Business To Another Company\nAsk yourself: Are you ready to fully let go? Selling to another company can be the most financially rewarding decision, but it requires emotional readiness to walk away and trust that the buyer will take your business in the right direction.\nExtra Resource: 10 Ways To Grow Your Small Business And Make It Attractive To Buyers\n2. Selling Your Business To An Employee\nIf you have a trusted employee who knows the business inside and out, selling to them can be a logical choice. Employees often have a vested interest in the success of the company and may be motivated to build on your legacy.\nAdvantages Of Selling Your Business To An Employee\n- Continuity: Employees already know the business, its customers, and its operations, making the transition smoother for all stakeholders.\n- Simplicity: The due diligence process is often simpler and less stressful, as employees are already familiar with the company\u2019s financials and day-to-day operations.\n- Flexible terms: You can structure the sale in a way that works for both parties, such as through installment payments or gradual ownership transfer.\nDisadvantages Of Selling Your Business To An Employee\n- Lack of experience: Employees are not professional buyers. They may struggle with understanding valuations, deal structures, or financing options, which can complicate the sale.\n- Financial risks for employees: Ownership ties the employee\u2019s financial future even more closely to the company, which could be risky if the business faces challenges.\nDeciding Factor To Sell Your Business To An Employee\nConsider whether the employee has the skills, drive, and resources to successfully run the business. This option works best when you have long-term employees who are deeply invested in the company\u2019s success.\n3. Selling Your Business To A Family Member\nFor many business owners, keeping the business in the family is an appealing option. It allows you to maintain a sense of legacy and ensures that the business continues to operate in a way that aligns with your values.\nAdvantages Of Selling Your Business To A Family Member\n- Familiarity and trust: Selling to family can provide peace of mind, as you\u2019re passing the business to someone you know and trust.\n- Continuity: A family member who shares your vision and values can ensure a smooth transition and continued success.\n- Flexible terms: Sales to family members often involve creative financing options, such as installment payments or gifting shares over time.\nDisadvantages Of Selling Your Business To A Family Member\n- Family conflicts: Mixing family and business can be risky. Rivalries, jealousy, or differing visions for the company\u2019s future can create tension.\n- Interest and qualifications: Not every family member will have the skills or passion needed to run the business. An unqualified successor could jeopardize the company\u2019s future.\nDeciding Factor To Sell Your Business To A Family Member\nAsk yourself if you have family members who are both willing and capable of taking on the responsibility. Be honest about their abilities and ensure that all parties are aligned to avoid future conflicts.\nExtra Resource: 9 Books For Business Owners Planning To Sell\n4.

Here\u2019s how to make your business more appealing:\nClean Up Financials: Transparent, well-organized financial records build trust and make your business easier to evaluate.\nReduce Owner Dependence: Create systems and processes that allow the business to run smoothly without you.\nHighlight Unique Value: Showcase what sets your business apart, whether it\u2019s a niche market, proprietary technology, or a loyal customer base.\nWork with Professionals: A business broker or advisor can help you identify and approach the right buyers, negotiate terms, and ensure a smooth process.\nExtra Resources:\n8 Essential Steps To Maximize Your Business's Value\n4 Ways To Make Your Small Business More Valuable\nFinal Thoughts: Who Will Buy Your Business?\nDeciding who should buy your business is as much about your goals as it is about theirs.
