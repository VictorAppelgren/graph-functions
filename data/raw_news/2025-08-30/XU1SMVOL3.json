  "content": "With the median house price inching towards $600,000 in New York, many Empire State residents are relocating to other parts of the country to enter an increasingly competitive real estate market.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t made the move, they may be enticed by the places appearing on a new list published by GOBankingRates.\n\nUsing data from Zillow\u2019s Home Value Index and the US Census data from 2021 and 2023, the company has compiled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Fastest-Growing Suburbs With Home Values Under $500K in 2025.\u201d\n\nStockbridge, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia, was named the country\u2019s fastest-growing suburb, with an increase of 6,908 residents in just two years. That figure represents a sizable 24.18% increase.\n\nNo doubt, new residents are taking advantage of the relatively affordable real estate, with the average home value in the area $303,705.\n\nThe booming suburb, located just 35 minutes from Atlanta\u2019s downtown area, boasts access to outdoor recreation, including the nearby Panola Mountain State Park.\n\nStockbridge was the only suburb in Georgia to make GOBankingRate\u2019s top 50 list.\n\nUnsurprisingly, however, other Southern and Southwestern states featured heavily, with residents from both the Northeast and West Coast migrating there in an attempt to make their money stretch further.\n\nA considerable 13 Texas locales made the list, including Tascocita, a suburb of Houston, which came in second spot.\n\nKyle, a suburb of Austin, Texas, rounded out the top three, with an increase of 16.15% in just two years.\n\nWhile Austin\u2019s real estate market has soared over the past decade, in Kyle, the average home value is $323,917, making it one of the most affordable nabes in the city.\n\nFlorida, Arizona, North Carolina, and Tennessee also have suburbs featured on the list, as does Indiana.\n\nWestfield, a suburb of Indianapolis, has seen a surge in residents, enticed by an average home value of $482,509.",

I\u2019m afraid to spend on things.\u201d\nReyjka was 18 when she began sleeping on friends\u2019 couches as she couldn\u2019t afford an apartment of her own, even living in her car for a short period.\nAfter getting a job at Target at age 23, she began renting a room in a house with friends in Florida, Georgia.\nShe said: \u201cI was working, but with my co-workers, when there was a pizza party, I would have to eat the leftovers because I didn\u2019t have food at home.\n\u201cMy electricity was turned off all the time, so I would have to use candles.\n\u201cI would buy clothes and keep the tags on them and wear them, and return them because I couldn\u2019t afford to keep them.\n\u201cThis was like from age 18 to 26 \u2014 that entire time period where I was doing these crazy things to save money and get things for free.\u201d\nAt 26, Reyjka got a higher-paying job as a therapist assistant, hitting it off with the hiring manager who gave her \u201ca chance.\u201d\nShe met her husband in 2019 and was able to get more schooling with his support, graduating with a degree in psychology from an online university in 2021.\nReyjka said, \u201cWe moved to Norway two years ago.\n\u201cWe have a child, age three now.\n\u201cIt was the best decision.\u201d\nReyjka still budgets and is careful with her money.\nShe said, \u201cI have guilt when I buy things.\n\u201cI don\u2019t do anything in terms of cosmetic application like hair, nails, or make-up.\n\u201cTo me, I think it looks beautiful, but to me, it feels like wasted money.\n\u201cGoing out to eat is not a thing more than once or twice a year, max.\n\u201cI always think \u2018I can cook it at home\u2019.\n\u201cI still use coupons even if I have enough money in my account; I use coupons to get the best price.\u201d\nReyjka makes a detailed spreadsheet every payday of her income and expenses.\nShe said: \u201cOur monthly income on average is $7,000 to $7,500 before taxes.\n\u201cWe pay our bills first and allow ourselves to have $400 to $500 of \u2018fun\u2019 money \u2014 like eating out or taking a trip.\n\u201cThe rest immediately goes into savings.\n\u201cBefore, my monthly income was less than $1,000 per month.\n\u201cI just wanted people to know that if you\u2019re born into a hard situation like me, and it can take years to get out of, but you can resolve this.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel less than because you\u2019re struggling with money.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no shame in it.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "GOBankingRates\u2019 July 2025 study ranks Stockbridge, Georgia as the fastest\u2011growing suburb with home values under $500\u202fk, followed by a cluster of Texas and Florida suburbs that have seen 10\u201325\u202f% population growth between 2021 and 2023. The report highlights that the median home price in New\u202fYork is approaching $600\u202fk, prompting many residents to relocate to more affordable markets. In a separate analysis, the firm estimates that families in the country\u2019s top school districts\u2014such as Palo\u202fAlto, California and Old\u202fWestbury, New\u202fYork\u2014must earn over $500\u202fk pre\u2011tax to comfortably cover housing, taxes and living expenses. Together, the pieces illustrate a widening affordability gap and a shift of middle\u2011class households toward lower\u2011priced suburban markets.",
