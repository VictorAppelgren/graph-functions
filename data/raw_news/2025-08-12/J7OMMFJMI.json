  "title": "Rachel Reeves' 'Racing Tax' could decimate UK countryside costing 2,750 jobs",
  "description": "UK horseracing's been left in uproar at plans to slap it with higher taxes and lump the 'Sport of Kings' into the same category as online casinos.",
  "content": "One of the world's top trainers has told the Sunday Express how Rachel Reeves' proposed horseracing tax hike could devastate the sport and \"bring it to its knees.\" And a new report predicts the Treasury's plans for a feared, ultra-high tax on the industry could spark a catastrophic \u00a3330 million revenue hit in the first five years, and put 2,752 jobs at risk. Currently there are separate taxes for online bookies depending if punters are having a flutter on the real-life sport of horseracing (15 percent) or playing virtual 'chance' casino games like roulette or poker (21 percent). But now the Treasury's consulting on a new 'one size fits all' tax that merges horseracing and virtual online casino gaming together - and at a higher tax rate - with tax hikes needed to fill the public finances black hole.\n\nNow legendary trainer John Gosden, 74, has told us Rachel Reeves' plan to lump the art of horseracing into the world of online poker, roulette and slot machines is a disgrace. John - boasting over 3,000 winners worldwide including victories in the Breeders' Cup Classic, the Derby, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the King George - fumed: \"There's no doubt that if you do this, it's going to bring us to our knees. \"To say that we belong in the same bracket as online casinos is a great worry. It's flawed thinking. I just don't want to see them making what would be a real car crash mistake.\" He stressed horseracing is \"a fantastic industry to be in\" but fears its \"very delicate ecosystem\" could be broken by this proposed higher new tax. John went on: \"Horseracing is the second biggest spectator sport in the country. \"We indirectly employ 85,000 people. A lot of the racing itself is in urban areas - Chester, York, Sandown, Ainslie, Cheltenham - but the training and breeding is in rural areas. \"Betting and horseracing has been a symbiotic relationship worldwide for centuries. But when you bet on a horse race there's a lot of factors to think about. \"The ground, the track, the distance, the form of the horses, the jockey, the trainer, everything to look at. It's not just a blind game of chance. \"Now, to say that that is the same as betting in online casinos, where you're piling on to red, and putting us in that bracket is completely showing a lack of understanding.\"\n\nAside from paying taxes, 10 percent of all bookmakers' gross profits from UK horseracing bets are collected by the Horserace Betting Levy Board (HBLB) - to funnel back into the industry. The levy was introduced in the 1960s amid concerns the legalisation of betting shops could negatively impact racecourse attendance. David Menuisier, Racehorse Trainer at Coombelands Racing Stables, in West Sussex, said: \"Racing is much more than just a sport in this country. It brings fun and excitement to millions and is a major local employer. \"The Government needs to acknowledge the unique and significant social and economic contributions the horseracing industry makes to the country and stop risking the ecosystem that keeps this sport alive.\" While Sarah Guest, Yard Manager for John O\u2019Shea Racing, Gloucestershire, said: \"A tax rise on betting is only going to stifle the sport. I love what I do, but if the industry starts shrinking, it will be stable staff like me who will feel it first.\" Modelling has shown that every 20 horses in training provide a \u00a31m benefit to the rural economy. But new research claims the Treasury\u2019s proposed tax rises on horserace betting could spark a \u00a3330 million revenue hit to the industry in the first five years, and 2,752 jobs at risk in the first year alone. In a wake-up call for the Government, the latest research commissioned by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) reveals an even more devastating economic outlook than initial reports suggested. Yorkshire alone, home to nine racecourses including Doncaster and York, is predicted to suffer a \u00a337 million economic hit in the first five years, with 342 jobs immediately at risk in the first year - from trainers and stable staff to local pub owners and hospitality workers. It is in response to this risk that the BHA has launched its #AxeTheRacingTax campaign. The BHA warns that a tax rise to the online casino rate of 21 per cent could cost the industry \u00a366 million a year.\n\nBrant Dunshea, CEO at BHA, stated: \"This latest tax bombshell from the Government, if followed through, poses one of the gravest risks to horseracing the sport has ever seen. \"The horseracing industry is already in a precarious financial position, and the latest research provides a much more catastrophic forecast than we first thought. \"We\u2019re talking about thousands of jobs at risk across the supply chain, severely impacted towns and communities, and the irreversible decline of the country\u2019s second most popular sport. \"Together as an entire industry, we\u2019re asking the British public for support in calling on the Government to rethink this policy and stop undermining a much-loved part of British heritage and culture. It\u2019s time to axe the racing tax and back British horseracing.\" The Jockey Club operates 15 racecourses - like Aintree and Cheltenham - The National Stud in Newmarket and training centres in Newmarket, Epsom and Lambourn; on top of their 'Racing Welfare' charity helping those working in the sport. Their Group Chief Executive Officer Jim Mullen told the Sunday Express he fears Reeves's tax grab could devastate rural Britain. Mullen explained: \"Britain can be justifiably proud of its racing industry, which is rich in history and heritage, world-leading in its standards of equine welfare and Thoroughbred breeding and a vital contributor to towns, villages and communities up and down the UK through jobs and tourism. \"What we need the Government to understand is that rather than simply generating more money from bookmakers, these proposals would have far more wide-reaching and potentially devastating consequences for people\u2019s livelihoods and a much-loved and valuable British institution.\" An HM Treasury spokesperson told us: \"We are consulting on bringing the treatment of online betting in line with other forms of online gambling to cut down bureaucracy. \"It is not about increasing or decreasing rates, and we welcome views from all stakeholders including businesses, trade bodies, the third sector and individuals.\" * To help stop the racing tax and back British horseracing, the BHA is urging supporters to sign the #AxeTheRacingTax petition.",

John has over 30 years of valuable experience and expertise which he applies on a daily basis to the benefit of his horses in training and their owners.\nElton racing stables is a friendly 25-box yard currently with a 25/75% split of jumpers to flat racers \u2013 which is just how we like it.\nWhy put your horse with us?\nOur experience and expertise\nIn an industry that is which is always struggling to retain experienced staff we are an exception. We have maintained a full team due to a really low turnover of staff. We genuinely value our staff, their experience, knowledge and their dedication to the horses. When people are properly appreciated, they perform better and deliver beyond expectations. We work hard to create a caring, close family feeling amongst our staff, and this happy, stable working environment translates itself to the horses too.\nA superb location for training\nElton racing stables is located at Bell House near Westbury on Severn in the Forest of Dean. It\u2019s a superb location for training. It provides a truly peaceful environment for training race horses. We have no traffic noise and we genuinely believe this has a beneficial impact on the health and wellbeing of our horses.\nThe size of our yard\nOur 25-box yard means that we are big enough to be competitive \u2013 we are currently (2022) the leading yard at our local course \u2013 Chepstow \u2013 but we are also still small enough to give detailed care and attention to each individual horse.\nThis level of care and focus is not always available at larger yards, for many reasons. This is a shame, because by really getting to know the horses as individual characters means we can much better care for them and get the best of them. We can also quickly pick up on any potential health or wellbeing issues because we spot small changes in behaviour, often a pre-cursor to a developing problem.\nOur detailed understanding of the horses needs, its likes and dislikes, means we can tailor training programs and arrange schedules that will allow us to get the best performances possible. With more horses in a bigger yard, and with a regular turnover of staff, this constant attention to the smaller details is just not possible and this is what gives us an edge.\nAll this plus trainer John O\u2019Shea\u2019s vast and valuable experience, gained across all key aspects of race horse training, care and management, means that Elton racing stables offers outstanding value for money to any owners looking to place their horses with us."
