      "feedback": "The draft fails the acceptance gate because ETH is not a canonical handle (no mapping to a listed asset such as ust10y, dxy, etc.), so add a proxy handle (e.g., crypto or cdx_hy) that follows the naming policy and link it to the real‑rate differential and term‑premium drivers; specify a concrete catalyst window (e.g., Fed meeting on 16‑17 Sep, SEC review on 30 Sep, institutional ETF inflows by 15 Oct) and give a magnitude range for the price move (e.g., +5 % to 10 % for the 0‑3 month up case, –3 % to –6 % for the 0‑3 month down case, and ±2 % for the 12‑18 month range) with a clear causal chain (fed_policy → real‑rate diff → ETH price); replace the generic “70 %” probabilities with evidence‑based ranges (e.g., 65 %–75 % for the up case, 20 %–35 % for the down case) citing the specific IDs (OGK8WLL69, B1KYJ1GPU); differentiate the drivers for up vs. down (e.g., up: regulatory tailwinds + Fed cut; down: Fed hike + regulatory clampdown) and ensure each line contains a single sentence, no filler, and follows the strict format “Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %”.",
