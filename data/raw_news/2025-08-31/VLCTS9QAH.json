  "content": "It will be the moment when millions of mobile phones will vibrate and ring at the very same time.\n\nAt about 3pm next Sunday, an official 'Emergency Alert' will be sent to all 4G and 5G-enabled phones and tablets.\n\nThe phones will vibrate and emit a siren-like tone for ten seconds.\n\nBut happily, there will also be a message making clear that it is only a drill albeit one of the largest public safety exercises of its kind ever staged in the UK.\n\nThe Sunday afternoon timing has chosen by government emergency planners to minimise disruption to work and school routines.\n\nSince the Emergency Alerts system was launched in April 2023, it has been used five times to warn of life-threatening danger, including during Storm \u00c9owyn in January 2025 when 4.5million people across Scotland and Northern Ireland received an urgent warning of extreme conditions.\n\nCabinet Office officials also said that the system has also proved invaluable in local emergencies \u2013 for example, in Plymouth, where more than 10,000 residents were evacuated in hours after an unexploded Second World War bomb was discovered.\n\nAnd last night, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Pat McFadden said: 'Next Sunday will be one of the UK's largest public safety exercises in history, as we ensure the Emergency Alerts system is ready to help keep the country safe.\n\n'The test alert will be issued by COBR, the government's emergency planning team whose work usually takes place behind the scenes.\n\n'Emergency Alerts have the power to save lives.\n\n'In real life emergencies, it's vital to rapidly share warnings and advice, which is why we keep the system on standby 24/7.'\n\nCOBR brings together ministers, senior officials and expert planners to coordinate the national response during major incidents.\n\nIts role is usually behind closed doors, but the test offers a rare glimpse into how this function ensures a swift, joined-up response to emergencies.\n\nNext week's test follows the publication of the government's Resilience Action Plan, which sets out unprecedented investment in national preparedness.\n\nMeasures include \u00a31billion for a new network of National Biosecurity Centres and \u00a34.2billion to strengthen flood defences protecting communities across England.",

  "summary": "A public safety exercise, organised by the UK government, will send an emergency alert to millions of mobile phones at around 3pm on Sunday, causing them to vibrate and ring simultaneously. The alert will be sent to all 4G and 5G-enabled phones and tablets. However, it is only a drill, one of the largest public safety exercises ever staged in the UK. The timing of the event was chosen to minimise disruption to work and school routines. Since the Emergency Alerts system was launched in April 2023, it has been used five times to warn of life-threatening danger, including during Storm \u00c9owyn in 2025 when 4.5 million people across Scotland and Northern Ireland received an urgent warning of extreme conditions. The test follows the government's Resilience Action Plan, which includes \u00a31bn for a new network of National Biosecurity Centres and \u00a34.2bn for flood defences.",
  "shortSummary": "The UK will test the Emergency Alerts system next Sunday, involving millions of mobile phones, to ensure national safety and enhance national preparedness in the event.",
