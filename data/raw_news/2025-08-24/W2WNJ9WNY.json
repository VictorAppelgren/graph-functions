  "description": "Like many Labubu fans, 28-year-old Joselyn Chamorro is over the craze.",
  "content": "Like many Labubu fans, 28-year-old Joselyn Chamorro is over the craze.\n\nWaiting in overnight lines to buy the $30 mischievous dolls, or shelling out $100 to resellers, has lost its appeal. So when she saw a gas station in Lakeland, Florida, was selling fake Labubus \u2014 known as Lafufus \u2014 for $20, she didn\u2019t hesitate to buy one.\n\nTrying to get a real Labubu, \u201cit\u2019s almost like \u2018The Hunger Games,\u2019\u201d Chamorro said.\n\nJust like an authentic Labubu, it even came in a blind box, meaning the buyer doesn\u2019t know the specific doll they\u2019re getting.\n\nLabubu\u2019s maker, Pop Mart, seems unstoppable. The Beijing-based toy company expects its 2025 revenue to exceed 30 billion yuan, or $4.2 billion. Just in the Americas, revenue soared by over 1,000% year-on-year, according to Pop Mart\u2019s semi-annual report released in August. Globally, revenue for Labubus alone skyrocketed 668% in the first half of the year.\n\nBut as rapidly as Labubus have risen in popularity, they could fall just as fast. Shortages of the creepy-cute dolls, on top of the $20 to $40 price tag, have driven shoppers to look for alternatives.\n\nPop Mart\u2019s strength lies in its creations that draw a cult following \u2013 Labubus, Cry Babies and Molly figurines \u2013 but the company still needs to grow past virality, Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang said.\n\n\u201cCompared with global leaders such as Disney and Sanrio, Pop Mart has yet to demonstrate a sufficiently long track record of generating excess return on invested capital from self-owned IPs,\u201d Zhang wrote last week.\n\nAnd in a twist, Lafufu owners aren\u2019t afraid to share they have a knock-off.\n\nChamorro\u2019s fake is smaller than the real Labubus, and its hands and face may be two different shades. But the palm-sized toy bears holds the same mischievous grin and soft fur that made the original go mind-bogglingly viral.\n\n\u201cMy little monster, even though he\u2019s not authentic, he\u2019s still really cute in his own little way,\u201d Chamorro said.\n\nPop Mart has trademarked \u201cLabubu\u201d since 2019 in the United States and at least 2016 internationally, according to the company\u2019s legal filings. And China is cracking down on Lafufus, with its customs agents seizing droves of fakes.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain irony in China\u2019s possessiveness over its Labubu IP. The country is known for pushing out fakes of practically every well-known brand, accounting for 45% of all reported seizures of counterfeit goods in 2021, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It also doesn\u2019t rank too highly in the US Chamber IP index, which measures the strength of intellectual property among different nations.\n\nPop Mart Americas recently sued a group of 7-Eleven stores in California for selling counterfeit Labubus. Zhang said more companies may face lawsuits from Pop Mart over Lafufus, but counterfeits might also decrease as Pop Mart ramps up its production\n\nA consumer standards body in the United Kingdom warned fake Labubu dolls could pose a choking hazard for young children. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission, which issued a similar warning, noted a real Labubu will feature a holographic Pop Mart sticker, a scannable QR code linking to the official Pop Mart site and exactly nine teeth; newer Labubus will also have \u201ca subtle UV stamp on one foot.\u201d\n\nThese days, you may see more Lafufus on the streets than Labubus, especially as social media has destigmatized the shame of owning knock-off toys.\n\nLafufus are \u201ca lot more unique looking, you know, the little mess ups and the little quirks \u2026 people like that,\u201d Cassandra Harrison, a 32-year-old from New Jersey, told CNN.\n\nMany of her friends are starting Lafufu collections, and she recently found a wall of Lafufus at a phone repair store inside her local Super Walmart. But at the end of the day, Harrison still ended up purchasing a real Labubu.\n\nTurning Labubu, originally a storybook character, into a beloved plush wasn\u2019t exactly dumb luck, said Mark Tanner, managing director of consumer insights newsletter China Skinny. More and more Chinese companies are outpacing their Western competitors with rapid-fire product development, he told CNN.\n\nPop Mart did a lot of work behind the scenes to make the \u201cblind box\u201d approach work. Like most consumer trends today, the blind boxes appeal to shoppers who are scrolling through hyper-specific TikTok algorithms.\n\n\u201c(Pop Mart\u2019s strategy) just aligns really well with the way people are consuming information right now, where the algorithm does all the work for them. When you buy a Labubu, you\u2019re not having to make any choices,\u201d Tanner said.\n\nPop Mart also doesn\u2019t have the decades-long history as some of its Western competitors. So the company isn\u2019t as concerned about retaining loyal customers \u2014 it\u2019s still busy building its base.\n\nPop Mart has opened at least 50 stores in 2025 around the world, Morningstar said. Morningstar analysts estimate that business outside China will account for 70% of Pop Mart\u2019s revenue in 2034, compared to 39% in 2024.\n\nAnd regarding fake Labubus, Pop Mart still has a few tricks up its sleeves to keep the spotlight on the real thing.\n\nLast week, Pop Mart CEO Wang Ning announced an even tinier version of the character, similar to the popular Sonny Angel figurines that hang off many-a-Gen Z\u2019ers devices. Wang said mini Labubus could be launched as soon as this week, a rapid turnaround time, reports say.\n\nUpon the news of the very tiny toy, Pop Mart\u2019s stock climbed 14%, hitting levels as high as December 2020, when the company first went public.\n\nFor some, Labubus are so overdone\n\nMadonna recently unveiled a slightly terrifying \u201cMadudu\u201d birthday cake to ring in her 67th birthday. Labubu costumes have been spotted on event dance floors. And why does a 24 karat gold Labubu seem to exist?\n\nBut what\u2019s novel is the sheer ridiculousness of the Lafufus. Some have faces that are plastered on sideways. Others have foreheads that are definitely not proportional to its tiny body. All these imperfections play to the delight of social media users.\n\nChamorro, the woman in Florida, also owns a Labubu. But she said her funky Lafufu has grown on her. The fact that she was able to purchase it from a local gas station makes it all the better.\n\nSo, at least for now, Chamorro is not bothering with the official Pop Mart drops.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if in a year from now, they\u2019re still going to be as big,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like this is more of a trend and lowkey, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to get another. They\u2019re just so hard to get.\u201d",

      "text": "Fake Labubu dolls that could pose a choking hazard for young children have flooded the UK market, a consumer standards body has warned.\nLegitimate Labubu toys, created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung and sold by Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, have become a viral and profitable sensation around the world. The palm-sized plushie, which has a bunny body, elf-like face and sharp teeth, is so popular that genuine versions are becoming increasingly difficult to come by.\nIn May, Pop Mart announced that it was temporarily suspending all in-store sales of the collectible across the UK following chaotic scenes of crowd surges and reported fights. Last week, thieves in the Los Angeles area broke into a store and made off with thousands of dollars worth of stock.\nThe toy\u2019s massive popularity has led to a wave of fakes, and many have been deemed unsafe, according to Britain\u2019s Chartered Trading Standards Institute.\nIn a warning it described as \u201curgent\u201d on its website, the CTSI reported that thousands of dangerous counterfeits have been seized by their teams across the country, often as a result of complaints from parents.\n\u201cCounterfeit Labubu dolls are poorly made and unsafe,\u201d the news release warned. \u201cMany contain small, detachable parts such as eyes, hands, and feet, which present a serious choking hazard to young children. Loose stitching and exposed stuffing further increase the risk of suffocation.\u201d It added: \u201cWithout proper safety checks, they may also contain toxic substances such as lead, harmful dyes, or banned plasticisers.\u201d\nLast month, CNN reported on the massive production of fake Labubus in China, with the cheap copycats dubbed \u201cLafufus.\u201d Chinese customs officials are said to have seized many thousands of these that were intended for export since June alone.\nConsumers can tell if a doll is genuine by certain markers, including a holographic Pop Mart sticker, a scannable QR code linking to the company\u2019s website and a UV stamp on one of the feet. These are \u201ccommonly missing or poorly replicated\u201d on fakes, the CTSI said.\nAnother tell-tale sign can be the number of teeth. Genuine dolls have nine, while fakes may vary. Overly vibrant colors and poor stitching can also indicate the doll is not the real deal.\nKerry Nicol, external affairs manager at CTSI, said in the release that the demand has been \u201camplified\u201d by social media. \u201cSupply and demand means that legitimate Labubu dolls are almost impossible to find,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThese fake products bypass the rigorous safety checks and compliance requirements the law demands, meaning they could contain choking hazards, toxic materials, or faulty components that put children at serious risk. Everyone involved in the supply chain \u2013 from manufacturers and fulfilment houses to sellers and marketplaces should have a role to play in ensuring unsafe toys never reach the hands of children.\u201d\nPop Mart have been contacted for comment.\nOlivia Kemp contributed to this report."

      "text": "Unveiling their latest seizure in front of news cameras last month, two Chinese customs agents revealed not drugs or weapons \u2013 but suitcases full of plush toys.\nThe stash on display included dozens of Pop Mart Labubus - the toothy, fluffy figurines that have sparked buying frenzies around the world, and in some cases, brawls among fans outside shops selling them.\nEven in China, where Pop Mart is based and most of its toys are made, people are struggling to get their hands on Labubus. When CNN recently visited a Pop Mart store at a bustling shopping mall in downtown Beijing, Labubu dolls were nowhere to be found on shelves, with only display samples remaining in glass cabinets.\nLabubus are typically \u201csold out in seconds\u201d when released, longtime Pop Mart fan Evelyn Lin told CNN.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to get a Labubu via the official channels,\u201d she said.\nFans are instead turning to unusual sources - including buying from smugglers.\nA total of 462 Pop Mart toys have been confiscated by customs authorities across China since April, according to a CNN compilation of multiple official posts.\nDetails and footage of one seizure were posted by China\u2019s Customs Administration on social media, which stated that that the toys were intended \u201cfor profit by resale\u201d and seized in accordance with law.\nThe post did not say whether any of the Labubu smugglers faced other legal consequences.\nLabubu is the brainchild of Hong Kong-born illustrator Kasing Lung, and it has quietly built a loyal following since its 2015 debut.\nBut in recent months, the bunny-bodied, elf-faced creature \u2014 equal parts grotesque and adorable \u2014 has soared in popularity. Stars including Rihanna, Dua Lipa, and Lisa from K-pop group Blackpink have worn Labubus like lucky charms, and the toys were even spotted at Paris Fashion Week this year.\nAccording to Chinese state-owned media outlet Cover News, a blind box from the latest Labubu 3.0 series, originally priced at 584 yuan ($81), has been selling for between 1,000 ($139) and 2,000 yuan ($278) on the second-hand market.\nPop Mart\u2019s annual results show that the company\u2019s global gross profit surged by over 125% last year, while its revenue in mainland China reached more than $1.09 billion, 34% higher than 2023.\nBut buying from resellers carries risks. Kate Yang, a Beijing resident and Labubu enthusiast, told CNN that her two last purchases from resellers both turned out to be fakes.\n\u201cBecause they are not available on official platforms, if you\u2019re in a rush to get a gift for a friend, you just can\u2019t manage to get the popular ones in time,\u201d said Yang.\n\u201cYou can only pay extra to buy from resale platforms.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Marc Stewart and Martha Zhou contributed reporting"

      "text": "Labubus \u2014 the fluffy, sharp-toothed figurines adorning belt loops and bags across the globe \u2014 aren\u2019t just toys. They\u2019ve become a cultural and commercial phenomenon.\nThe creepy-cute collectibles, typically sold in \u201cblind boxes\u201d that conceal the design inside, have gone from niche toy to global craze, propelling a revenue explosion at Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the product. And for collectors chasing the rarest versions \u2014 like the elusive \u201csecret\u201d Labubu \u2014 the price of obsession can add up fast.\nIn 2024, the company reported revenue of more than $1.8 billion, including $420 million outside China, in part because of Labubu sales. CNN unpacks how this tiny plushie helped fuel a billion-dollar business.\nThe furious interest in the brand has fueled many new offerings from Pop Mart for US customers in recent years, according to an analysis of the company\u2019s products, which lists release dates in their descriptions online.\nThe cumulative number of dolls, figurines and related \u201cThe Monsters\u201d products, which includes Labubu, has more than doubled in recent years, according to a CNN analysis.\nPart of the demand is perhaps driven by a clever sales tactic. Popular Labubu blind boxes offer six possible designs \u2014 and a chance at a \u201csecret\u201d variant. Pop Mart advertises that buyers have a 1-in-72 chance of unboxing these coveted versions.\nFor collectors chasing those dolls, the price of obsession can theoretically add up fast. A CNN simulation found that scoring one could cost the average buyer around $2,000.\nTo help illustrate how rare and potentially expensive these items can be, CNN used a computer script to simulate 10,000 buyers and how much they would need to spend before unboxing one.\nSome people in this mock sale got lucky early. Others had to keep buying \u2014 dozens, sometimes hundreds of times \u2014 to succeed.\nDespite the boom in demand and new products, availability at Pop Mart\u2019s online and retail stores hasn\u2019t kept pace. The company lists nearly 100 products in its \u201cThe Monsters\u201d series on its website for US customers.\nYet only a handful of the toys were in stock this week, when a flash sale of two of the company\u2019s most popular Labubus sold out rapidly.\nThough the scarcity of furry figurines is a central part of the Labubu ecoystem, reseller communities online and in local collector shops keep buyers hooked.\nThe online seller eBay, for example, has more than 19,000 Labubu products \u2014 many of them listed at higher prices than on Pop Mart. And online search interest in Labubu has also skyrocketed in the last year, especially in California, Nevada, Texas and Hawaii, according to Google Trends.\nCNN\u2019s Olivia Kemp contributed reporting to this story."

      "text": "About the Report\nThe U.S. Chamber\u2019s International IP Index (IP Index) creates a roadmap for economies seeking to strengthen the ecosystem for innovation and creativity through more effective intellectual property (IP) standards.\nThe 12th IP Index evaluates intellectual property systems across the world's top 55 economies using 50 unique criteria. The data shows economies how to improve IP-driven innovation and creativity and reveals trends in global IP protection.\nThe IP Index also serves as a guide to world leaders on proven methods to champion innovation and creativity at home. With this data, they can see what's working, what's not, and what changes are needed to ensure a brighter future.\nSupplemental reports\nTop Scores and Rankings\n| Rank | Country | Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | United States | (95.48%) |\n| 2 | United Kingdom | (94.12%) |\n| 3 | France | (93.12%) |\n| 4 | Germany | (92.46%) |\n| 5 | Sweden | (92.12%) |\n| 6 | Japan | (91.26%) |\n| 7 | Netherlands | (91.24%) |\n| 8 | Ireland | (89.38%) |\n| 9 | Spain | (86.44%) |\n| 10 | Switzerland | (85.98%) |\n2024 IP Index Findings\nGlobal Rankings of the top 55 economies\nSelect a country below to see specific strengths and weaknesses\nTop 4 Findings for 2024\n1. Twenty economies improved their overall scores, signaling optimism for global IP policy's future, but work remains.\n- Top gains: Saudi Arabia (+6.04%), Brazil (+4.50%), and Nigeria (+3.00%) showcase policy-driven innovation investments.\n- Static scores: 27 economies remain unchanged; 8 declined, with Ecuador dropping over 1% due to inadequate border control against IP infringement.\n- Leadership Challenge: No significant progress in top-ranked economies calls for the U.S. and EU to reassert IP policy leadership.\n2. Multilateral organizations can reaffirm global IP commitment instead of tolerating counterproductive measures like IP waivers.\n- Post-pandemic response: Despite the pandemic's end in May 2023, debates on IP waivers for COVID-19 treatments and diagnostics continue, risking future IP Index scores.\n- WHO proposals: The draft Pandemic Accord and International Health Regulations suggest time-bound IP waivers and forced technology transfers.\n- Broader impact: The push against IP protections now includes demands for green technology and climate solutions waivers.\n3. High-income economies risk losing IP leadership with new policy and regulatory proposals.\n- U.S. concerns: Proposals to expand march-in rights based on pricing and patentability uncertainties undermine the life sciences sector.\n- EU proposals: Legislative changes in Europe may weaken regulatory data protection, undermine patent protection, and jeopardize trade secrets.\n4. Economies continue to take steps to combat online piracy.\n- Online piracy progress: Notable efforts to combat online copyright infringement through dynamic injunctions.\n- Legislative changes: Economies introduced legislative changes to increase criminal sanctions in India, implement EU law, and better protect copyrighted content in Nigeria.\nPrevious editions\nDive into previous editions\nIP Category Highlights\n- Patents: 23 economies score above 70%, with India and Pakistan making notable legislative changes.\n- Copyrights: Marginal improvement in protection with proactive enforcement in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.\n- Trademarks: Average scores rise with significant enforcement actions and judicial rulings in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia.\n- Design rights: EU proposals aim to modernize design rights, with Indonesia increasing protection terms.\n- Trade secrets: EU's EHDS proposals may affect the handling of confidential health data and undermine trade secrets protection.\n- IP commercialization: Morocco takes steps to facilitate IP asset licensing and commercialization.\n- Enforcement: Strong actions in the Netherlands and the Dominican Republic highlight the focus on enforcement.\n- Systemic efficiency: Saudi Arabia, Kenya, and Costa Rica engage in IP policy improvements, awareness raising, and training.\n- International treaties: Brazil joins the Hague Agreement, but new free trade agreements show varied commitment to comprehensive IP protection.\nFor a full analysis and detailed scores, download the full report below."

      "text": "These days, Labubus are in vogue \u2014 so you best believe the Queen of Pop is getting in on the trend. To celebrate her birthday this year, Madonna embarked on a luxurious trip to Italy for an outing she\u2019d always dreamed of and topped it off with an enormous cake, modeled after the latest collectible plushie craze.\nIn a video posted to her social media accounts Monday (Aug. 18), the pop superstar shared clips of herself and boyfriend Akeem Morris traveling through Siena, Italy, where they beheld the annual Palio di Siena bareback urban horse race with thousands of other spectators as well as Madonna\u2019s daughters Lourdes and Mercy. \u201cMy Dream for many years has been to watch the Palio horse race in [Siena] that takes place on my birthday, August 16, since 1482!!\u201d the icon wrote in her caption.\n\u201cThere are no words to describe The excitement , the suspense and the Pageantry!! A truly sacred ritual to witness thousands of people hushed to a silence before the race begins!\u201d she continued. \u201cThe race itself is impossible to describe. Dreams do come true! Happy Birthday to me!!!\u201d\nTrending on Billboard\nAfter taking in the race followed by an extravagant firework show, Madge was treated to an enormous pink cake topped with sparklers and a giant edible sculpture of a Labubu doll. \u201cHappy birthday Madudu,\u201d read lettering at the base of the confection.\nMadonna \u2014 who just turned 67 \u2014 is just the latest musical star who\u2019s been loving Labubus, the creepy-cute goblin keychains that have popped up on bags and purses everywhere in recent months. Lady Gaga recently declared that she was the human embodiment of a Labubu in a silly video filmed before a Mayhem Ball Tour show, while BLACKPINK\u2019s LISA previously gifted White Lotus costar Tayme Thapthimthong\u2019s daughter one of the dolls.\nOne performer who definitely isn\u2019t loving the trend, however, is Rene\u00e9 Rapp. When asked to sign a Billboard staffer\u2019s Labubu at a recent pop-up, the Mean Girls star made her feelings quite clear, saying in a viral video, \u201cThese are so f\u2013king ugly.\u201d\nSee Madonna\u2019s Labubu-themed birthday video here."

  "argos_summary": "The Labubu plush, created by Pop Mart, has become a global craze, driving the company\u2019s revenue past $4\u202fbillion and sparking fierce demand that often forces buyers to turn to resellers or counterfeit copies known as Lafufus.  Shortages and high prices have fueled a wave of knock\u2011offs, some of which pose choking hazards and contain toxic materials, prompting warnings from UK and US safety regulators and lawsuits against retailers selling fakes.  Pop Mart\u2019s blind\u2011box strategy, combined with aggressive IP enforcement and plans for new mini\u2011versions, keeps the brand in the spotlight while the company expands its international footprint.  The trend has even reached pop\u2011culture icons, with celebrities sporting Labubus and the dolls appearing in fashion shows, media, and celebrity celebrations.",
