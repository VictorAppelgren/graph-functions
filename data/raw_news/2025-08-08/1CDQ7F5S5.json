  "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Stocks rose in morning trading on Wall Street Friday, keeping the market on track for its third weekly gain in the last four.\n\nThe S&P 500 was up 0.7% and sitting just below its record. The benchmark index is on track to wipe out its losses from a slide last week.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 212 points, or 0.5%, as of 10:44 a.m. Eastern. The Nasdaq added 0.8% to the all-time high it set a day earlier.\n\nTechnology companies, with their hefty stock values, were doing much of the heavy lifting for the market. Nvidia rose 0.9% and Microsoft rose 0.2%.\n\nGilead Sciences jumped 8.8% for one of the biggest gains. It reported financial results that easily beat analysts\u2019 forecasts, while also raising its earnings forecast for the year. Expedia Group also notched one of the biggest gains, advancing 4.4% after also reporting encouraging financial results.\n\nThey are among the final big batch of companies within the S&P 500 to report mostly strong financial results for the second quarter. Still, many have warned that current tariffs could cut into their profits and operations.\n\nThe main focus throughout the week has been on President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and its potential impact on the U.S. economy, as well as the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy.\n\nTrump began imposing higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday. The unknown path of the economy amid an unpredictable tariff policy has been the key reason for the Fed to hold its benchmark interest steady.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, though, has been under increasing pressure from Trump to cut interest rates. Policy decisions aren\u2019t made solely by the Fed chair. All 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee vote on interest rate changes.\n\nTrump has an opportunity to exert more control over the Fed following his nomination of Stephen Miran to a vacancy on the Fed\u2019s board of governors. Miran is a top economic adviser to Trump and is a near-certain vote in support of lower interest rates.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s last decision to hold interest rates steady included two votes to lower interest rates. Its next meeting is in September and Wall Street is overwhelmingly betting that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nTreasury yields edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28% from 4.25% late Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury which more closely tracks expectations for Fed actions, rose to 3.76% from 3.73% late Thursday.\n\nThe expectation for an interest rate cut follows a series of signals last week that the economy could be weakening. That included reports showing that inflation edged higher in June and employers in the U.S. hit the brakes on hiring in July.\n\nBoth are key concerns for the Fed, which has been trying to cool inflation down to its target rate of 2% while also fulfilling its \u201cfull employment\u201d mandate.\n\nLower interest rates can give the economy and investment prices a boost, though the downside is that they can also push inflation higher. Concerns about inflation reheating could be overshadowed by worries about a weakening employment market.\n\nWall Street and the Fed will get more insight next week on inflation\u2019s temperature and the economy. The government will release updates on inflation at both the consumer and wholesale levels, along with a report on retail sales.\n\n\u201cWe believe stocks will stay supported amid solid fundamentals, but fresh headlines in the coming week may challenge investor sentiment that remains vulnerable to tariff, economic, and geopolitical risks,\u201d said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for the Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nAsian markets closed mostly lower except in Tokyo, where the Nikkei rose 1.9% after Japan\u2019s main trade envoy said the U.S. had agreed to correct a problem over tariffs that will apply to exports to the U.S.",
