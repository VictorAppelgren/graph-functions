  "description": "Beginning in October, the budget airline will end service in 11 U.S. cities, including Portland and Salt Lake City",
  "content": "Beginning in October, the budget airline will end service in 11 U.S. cities, including Portland and Salt Lake City, according to The Points Guy.\n\nThey're Spirit\u2019s first cuts as the airline re-enters the chapter 11 bankruptcy process, its second filing in a year. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in November, making it the first major U.S. carrier to file for Chapter 11 since 2011. The company emerged from bankruptcy in March after a court approved restructuring backed by creditors.\n\nThen in August, Spirit raised major concerns about its ability to stay in business. In its second-quarter earnings, the company pointed to adverse market conditions, elevated domestic capacity, and continued weak demand for domestic leisure travel as major obstacles moving forward. The company reported a $245.8 million net loss on $1.02 billion operating revenue for the quarter that ended June 30.\n\nThe airline, known for its yellow planes and heavily discounted fairs, told investors that it continues to experience challenges and uncertainties in its business operations and expects these trends to continue for at least the rest of 2025.\n\nTo address these concerns, the company has made network and product enhancements, including its premium economy travel option. It attempted to reduce costs using sale-leasebacks of spare engines. In July, the company announced it would furlough 270 pilots and demote 140 more this fall, Reuters reported.\n\nBut Spirit\u2019s management believed it was still likely the company would fail to meet its cash flow requirements and default on its loans, which could halt operations within the next year.\n\nSpirit filed for its second bankruptcy last week and received court approval on Wednesday, according to a press release.\n\nHere is the list of airports Spirit will no longer serve, as reported by the Points Guy:\n\nMeanwhile, Frontier Airlines is going after Spirit\u2019s customers. Last week, the budget airline rival announced 20 new routes beginning in late fall, many of which overlap with Spirit Airlines\u2019 major markets. The new routes will include departures from Fort Lauderdale, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston, Charlotte, and Dallas and fares will start at $29.",

      "text": "Spirit Airlines axes 11 cities from route map as bankruptcy cuts begin\nSpirit Airlines will end service to 11 cities in October as it begins the hard work of overhauling its route map in bankruptcy.\nThe Dania Beach, Fla.-based airline will end service to the following cities during the week of Oct. 2, 2025, a spokesperson confirmed:\n- Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ) in New Mexico\n- Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport (BHM) in Alabama\n- Boise Airport (BOI)\n- Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport (CHA) in Tennessee\n- Columbia Metropolitan Airport (CAE) in South Carolina\n- Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport (OAK)\n- Portland International Airport (PDX) in Oregon\n- Sacramento International Airport (SMF)\n- Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC)\n- San Diego International Airport (SAN)\n- San Jose Mineta International Airport (SJC) in California\nSpirit also suspended plans to add Middle Georgia Regional Airport (MCN) in Macon, Georgia, to its map on Oct. 16.\nThe cuts come days after Spirit filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring in less than a year. The airline plans to shed planes, shrink its network and cut costs in the hopes of returning to profitability.\n\"Spirit is redesigning its network to focus its flying on key markets to provide more destinations, frequencies and enhanced connectivity in certain of its focus cities, while simultaneously reducing its presence in certain other cities,\" Fred Cromer, chief financial officer of Spirit, said in a statement filed with the court on Sunday.\nRobert Milton, chairman of Spirit's board of directors, told The Wall Street Journal that the carrier plans to refocus its map on key airports, including Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL), Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) and Orlando International Airport (MCO).\nThe 12 airports cut from Spirit's map in October represent 3.9% of the airline's total seats that month, schedule data from aviation analytics firm Cirium shows.\nLas Vegas' Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) will lose the most routes with the cuts, saying goodbye to eight nonstops, schedules show. FLL will lose four routes.\nMany industry analysts expect further cuts at Spirit as it \"significantly,\" as Cromer put it, shrinks its fleet.\nThe airline operated 214 Airbus A320-family aircraft when it filed for bankruptcy on Aug. 28. However, only around 157 planes are in service, Cromer said.\nPassengers booked on a canceled flight would be entitled to a refund under U.S. Department of Transportation policy.\nRelated reading:\n- When is the best time to book flights for the cheapest airfare?\n- The best airline credit cards\n- What exactly are airline miles, anyway?\n- 6 real-life strategies you can use when your flight is canceled or delayed\n- Maximize your airfare: The best credit cards for booking flights\n- The best credit cards to reach elite status\n- What are points and miles worth?
