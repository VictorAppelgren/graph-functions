      "summary": "Florida officials have announced plans to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates, becoming the first in the U.S. to do so, raising the risk of deadly disease outbreaks. The state has long required students to receive vaccinations for childhood illnesses like polio and measles. However, this change is expected to be the most sweeping change to vaccine regulations. Public health experts argue that high rates of vaccination are necessary to prevent outbreaks of disease and achieve herd immunity, which helps protect vulnerable members of the population who are too young or immunocompromised. The CDC recommends a herd immunity threshold of 95% for a disease like measles. School vaccination rules vary by state, with most students receiving vaccinations for polio, chicken pox, diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).",
