On August 18, the company confirmed the repricing of 2028 Term Loan B totaling $730 million.

      "text": "In this article, we will take a look at Ken Fisher\u2019s top 10 stock picks.\nKen Fisher is a force to reckon with on Wall Street, as his opinions consistently shape investors\u2019 insights and influence market trends. That was evident as in April, he predicted Trump\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d tariffs would fail and the market would rebound. The proclamation has come to fruition as the US markets have rebounded and rallied to a record high.\nThe founder of investment advisory firm Fisher Asset Management made the remarks as the US equity market came under pressure, with investors scrambling for safety away from equities.\n\u201cYet, as near as I can tell it will fade and fail and the fear is bigger than the problem, which from here is bullish,\u201d Fisher said.\nFast forward, Fisher is taking issue with a new trend he dubbed \u201cBreakevenitis,\u201d whereby investors react emotionally to sell stocks during downturns due to the fear of losses. According to Fisher, historical data clearly show that markets recover and continue to rise after downturns. Therefore, the focus should always be on long-term returns rather than short-term swings.\nWith markets at all-time highs, fear is already brewing of a potential correction or deep pullback. On its part, Fisher Asset Management remains bullish about the market\u2019s long-term outlook.\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet, and here\u2019s why: Yes, sentiment may be warming in certain regards. For example, we\u2019ve seen the return of some speculative behavior in areas like meme stocks and special purpose acquisition companies, and enthusiasm around growth sectors, like technology, that remains elevated in the US,\u201d Fisher Investment, in an expert commentary to investors.\nFisher Asset Management, which achieved an incredible return of 32.18% in 2024, boasts a highly diversified investment portfolio positioned to generate long-term value. With that in mind, let\u2019s look at Ken Fisher\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Buy.\nOur Methodology\nTo analyze Ken Fisher\u2019s Stock Portfolio: Stocks to Buy, we began by reviewing Fisher Asset Management\u2019s second quarter 2025 portfolio. We focused on stocks in which the firm owns significant stakes. We also focused on stocks popular among elite hedge funds based on data taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q1 2025 database. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the value of Fisher Asset Management\u2019s equity stakes.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nKen Fisher Stock Portfolio: Stocks to Buy\n10. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)\nFisher Asset Management Equity Stake: $3,878,386,220\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 94\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. On August 18, Guggenheim reiterated a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on the stock and raised its price target to $115 from $112. The price target hike comes as the company demonstrates solid fundamentals, with revenues skyrocketing to $685 billion in the last 12 months.\nIn addition, Guggenheim remains confident about Walmart\u2019s prospects, even as Amazon expands into its domain around same-day fresh food delivery. According to the research firm, Walmart boasts an unmatched scale and productive store and supply chain assets, which should give it a competitive edge in the space.\nConsequently, Guggenheim expects Walmart\u2019s second-quarter total sales to increase by 4.4%, resulting in EBIT growth of 8.7%. It also expects the retail giant to revise its EBIT growth guidance upwards from the current range of between 3.5% to 5.5%.\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a global retailer that runs a vast network of retail and wholesale stores, membership clubs, ecommerce platforms, and mobile apps across multiple countries.\n9. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)\nFisher Asset Management Equity Stake: $4,305,241,598\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. On August 19, the company confirmed the adoption of its SAP Business Suite at Tata Projects Limited. The adoption is a significant milestone, given that Tata is India\u2019s leading engineering, procurement, and construction Company.\nThe adoption of SAP Business Suite enables Tata Projects Limited to become a cloud-first, intelligent enterprise. The company will be able to unify key business functions from project planning and procurement to finance, human resources, and analytics. Consequently, the company will enjoy enhanced data visibility, which is expected to drive business agility and operational efficiency.\n\u201cTata Projects\u2019 successful digital transformation exemplifies the construction industry\u2019s accelerating shift to cloud-based solutions. We are proud to support their journey with SAP\u2019s unified ERP platform, which is enhancing operational efficiency, enabling data-driven decision-making, and fostering innovation across the enterprise,\u201d said Manish Prasad, President and Managing Director, SAP Indian Subcontinent.\nSAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a software application company that develops and sells enterprise software solutions that help businesses manage their operations and customer relations. Companies utilize their solutions to enhance efficiency, productivity, and informed decision-making."

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.

      "text": "In this article, we will look at the 12 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire George Soros.\nGeorge Soros is a name that reverberates far and wide as one of the iconic investors of the last century. The legendary investor has made a name for himself on Wall Street by building Soros Fund Management, a highly adaptive and opportunistic hedge fund.\nSoros is best remembered for generating a $1 billion profit in a single day by shorting the British pound in 1992. The billionaire investor also formerly managed the Quantum Fund that ended up generating an average annual return of 30% over 30 years.\nThe fund concentrates on specific investment areas whenever conviction is high. Therefore, Soros\u2019 investments in the market often reflect a mix of long-term megatrends and near-term opportunities created by changes in economic and political cycles. With $28 billion in assets under management, Soros Fund Management offers significant exposure to technology stocks, services, and utilities investment plays.\nUS Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in his annual address at the Jackson Hole symposium, has given Wall Street hopes of easier days. Powell reiterating that conditions \u201cmay warrant adjusting our policy stance\u201d already signals potential interest rate cuts expected to bolster bullish momentum in the equity markets.\n\u201cAlthough we are aware of the extreme political pressures on the Fed to ease, and we acknowledge cracks emerging in some labor market data, from our perch \u2026 the case for cuts looks modest,\u201d Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley.\nWhile the broad picture suggests an incrementally weak macroeconomic environment fueled by the tariff war, Morgan Stanley equity strategist Arianna Salvatore expects equities to continue outperforming. Some of the sectors that the strategist expects to remain resilient include industrials, driven by artificial intelligence and semiconductors, most of which Soros Fund Management is highly invested in.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with our list of the best stocks to invest in according to billionaire George Soros, we scanned Soros Fund Management\u2019s Q2 2025 portfolio. We focused on the hedge fund\u2019s biggest holdings by equity stake. We shared an analysis of their popularity among top-tier hedge funds during Q2 2025. We also provided insights on why they stand out as a buy. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on Soros Fund Management\u2019s equity stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is straightforward: our research has demonstrated that we can outperform the market by replicating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire George Soros\n12. Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW)\nSoros Fund Management Equity Stake: $61.16 Million\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 100\nSnowflake Inc.
