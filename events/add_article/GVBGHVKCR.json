      "summary": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers have reached a deal with Uber and Lyft to let drivers unionize and collectively bargain while remaining independent contractors. The package also cuts insurance costs for underinsured drivers, aiming to lower fares for riders. The legislation, backed by SEIU and Uber/Lyft, could become law after Senate and Assembly approval. It follows a 2020 ballot measure that reversed a 2019 law mandating benefits for gig workers.",
