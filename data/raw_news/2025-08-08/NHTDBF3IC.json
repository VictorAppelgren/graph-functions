  "title": "Peloton Outperforms, Plans More Micro-Stores And Pedals Back On Costs",
  "description": "After some torrid years post pandemic, fitness brand Peloton is showing signs of getting its model back on track amid cost reductions and new growth strategies.",
  "content": "Fitness brand Peloton surprised the market this week when it posted a profit for its fiscal fourth quarter and it laid out a strategy to build on cost reductions and return to growth.\n\nUnder CEO Peter Stern, the company recorded a net income of $21.6 million, compared with a loss of $30.5 million in the year prior, largely thanks to better-than-expected sales but also lower operating expenses, which Stern warned in a communication to shareholders remained too high in his opinion.\n\nThe company\u2019s recorded net income of $21.6 million for the three-month period to June 30, equivalent to 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of $30.5 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales fell 6% year-on-year to $607 million.\n\nPeloton is also planning to grow its micro-stores, having reduced its larger stores portfolio from 37 to 13 by the end of the fourth quarter. Peloton is looking to expand its micro-stores from one to 10, plus expand its preowned secondary marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe plan to support our members\u2019 wellness journey by expanding our offerings and strength where we are already a category leader, mental wellbeing, sleep, recovery, and over time, nutrition and hydration,\u201d Stern said on an earnings call Thursday. \u201cWe will employ advanced technologies like AI to enhance our ability to serve as personalized coaches.\u201d\n\nFor fiscal 2026 starting July, the company said that it plans to reduce run-rate expenses by another $100 million, over and above the $200 million it had already cut in fiscal 2025. Half of those reductions will come from indirect costs, like renegotiating contracts, but the other half will come from reducing staff levels by 6% the company said, just over a year after it confirmed plans to cut 15% of its staff head count.\n\n\u201cOur operating expenses remain too high, which hinders our ability to invest in our future. We are launching a cost restructuring plan intended to achieve at least $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of FY26 by reducing the size of our global team, paring back indirect spend, and relocating some of our work,\u201d Stern said.\n\nInvestors responded well to the announcement and the latest figures, eight months into Stern\u2019s tenure, as his strategy starts to show signs of working. While the share value is 20% off from the start of the year, the value has at least stabilized and enjoyed a short-lived spike on yesterday\u2019s announcements.\n\nPeloton restructured its debt last year and in fiscal 2025 its net debt declined by $343 million, a 43% drop compared with the year-earlier period, bringing net debt to $459 million allowing for cash and cash equivalents.\n\nFor Peloton\u2019s current quarter, it forecast sales between $525 million and $545 million, below the $560 million analysts anticipated, but for the full year its projection of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion tallies with expectations.\n\nPeloton also outperformed on bike and treadmill sales, posting connected fitness revenue for Q4 of $198.6 million, well above projections of $170.3 million. Peloton\u2019s gross margin for hardware was 17.3%, up 9% on the year prior.\n\nHowever, the new 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on aluminium, plus other duties, mean Peloton is expecting tariffs to hit free cash flow by $65 million and in Stern\u2019s letter to shareholders, he said the company will have to rework promotions and adjust prices to reflect these higher costs.\n\n\u201cInternationally, we plan to deliver local, in-language experiences using a mix of native instruction, AI dubbing, and more flexible approaches to music for thousands of classes,\u201d Stern said.\n\n\u201cThrough partnerships, we aim to introduce the Peloton brand and experiences to millions of people around the world. Together, we believe these actions lay the groundwork for future, cost-effective launches of the full Peloton offering in new geographies.\u201d",

      "text": "There were some good times. At any given point between the end of 2020 and late 2021 to hold the holy trinity of stock in Deliveroo, Peloton and Netflix\nForget Warren Buffet, you were living the life.\nBut not any longer. Take-out food delivery, expensive (and proliferating) streaming services and home workouts just don\u2019t hold the same allure once potential customers can get outdoors.\nAnd especially not when wallets are being squeezed harder than calf muscles on the ascent of Alpe D'Huez.\nWho knew? Well not Peloton by the looks of things and the latest results from its U.K. arm suggest that its long-suffering stock holders might be in for a long ride yet.\nThe U.S. parent company floated back in 2019 and its share price peaked at $162 in late December 2020 but has been freewheeling downwards ever since, trading below $8 today.\nDespite a major repositioning, of which more in a moment, manufacturing changes and substantial job cuts, Peloton\u2019s stock price has actually ticked down since the start of the year and sales at its U.K. arm decreased 13% over its last financial year as Peloton's biggest overseas market reported widening losses.\nIn accounts filed at Companies House, Peloton Interactive U.K. reported turnover of $162.5 million in the year to June 30 2022, down from just shy of $187 million in the 12 months prior.\nThe firm\u2019s directors put the fall down to \u201cslowing sales, reflecting the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our hardware sales\u201d.\nThat echoes the U.S. parent company, which has stemmed the blood loss at least, recently confirming stronger cash flow after cost cutting through circa 3,000 redundancies plus store closures.\nU.K. Bike Sales Fall\nU.K. sales of bikes, treadmills and online fitness classes nearly trebled during the first year of the pandemic but losses in the year to June 30 2022 more than doubled year-on-year from $103 million to $267 million.\nExpansion costs saw expenditure up 47%, including the opening a three-gym fitness studio in Covent Garden, London, only the second such location worldwide after the New York debut.\nIt also recorded nearly $47 million in restructuring costs as the group decided to stop manufacturing its own bikes to reduce costs, while the U.K. business said it was \u201clooking critically\u201d at its cost base, including the \u201crationalisation of our retail footprint\" plus outsourcing an increasing proportion of delivery.\nPeloton has eight retail locations in the U.K., including six concessions in John Lewis department stores.\nHowever, on a more positive note Peloton said that subscription revenues had risen an impressive 89% on the year prior thanks to extra members and a low churn rate. That was reflected in the shift in revenues from hardware to subscriptions. Peloton\u2019s fitness units accounted for $99 million of sales, while subscriptions hit nearly $61 million.\nPeloton Rides Out\nThe U.K. sales update comes at a pivotal time for the business. On May 23, Peloton announced it was to reposition \"from the perception of an in-home bike company to reflect everything Peloton has to offer to everyone, at any level, wherever they are\u201d.\nIt has introduced five membership tiers, with a new work out App with or without equipment \u2013 at home, outdoors or at the gym \u2013 independently, or with instruction. Peloton Row content is also available on the App and subscriptions range from the free entry level to $25 per month.\nIt also launched Peloton Gym, available across all membership tiers. It is the brand's first offering in which workouts are written-out, demoed with a supporting video, and designed to be done at the user's own pace.\nHowever, despite a short stock price jump since the announcement a major product recall of its PL01 bike model \u2013 which follows the 2021 recall of its treadmills \u2013 means that in the year to date shares have rolled back around 4%.\nClearly, a company that raced to the top during the pandemic still has a lot of hard work to do to persuade investors that it is on the way back to the summit, not on the road to nowhere."

      "text": "Peloton has launched an equipment and accessories resale marketplace called Peloton Repowered, as the company boss also slapped a \u2018not for sale\u2019 sign over the business.\nSpeaking at a Bloomberg event today, CEO Peter Stern insisted that he had not been brought in to find a buyer for the company but instead is looking to capitalize on new and existing customers with a range of initiatives, including the growing trend towards pre-used merchandise.\nInitially eligible for sellers located in the Boston, New York City and Washington, D.C. metro areas, the marketplace will then expand nationally in the coming months and has been created to connect buyers and sellers in the same metro area, Peloton said.\nIn its testing phase it will launch in beta and until there is enough inventory will only allow users to list items, with the facility to buy and sell to be introduced in the next few weeks.\nThe platform will enable members to post their used Peloton equipment and gear and set a price with help from a generative AI tool, the company said, although sellers will have the final say on how much to list the item for.\nPeloton Repowered sellers will receive 70% of the sale price and a discount on new Peloton workout equipment, adding to the discounted products it sells, which already include refurbished equipment, offering a peer-to-peer pre-owned option.\nThe sellers\u2019 discount on new Peloton equipment will range from around $200 to $600, depending on what type of new equipment is purchased, while Peloton Repowered buyers will receive a reduced used activation fee for the equipment they purchase at $45, which compares with its typical used equipment activation fee of $95.\nBuyers will be able to see the equipment\u2019s history on the listing and have the option to get the item delivered for an extra fee, Peloton said.\nPeloton Repowered Marketplace Rival\nThe Peloton Repowered platform works through the Archive platform, which has worked with fashion brands including The North Face, Dr. Martens and New Balance and Peloton said previously it had started to see a \u201cmeaningful increase\u201d in the number of new members who bought used Bikes or Treads from peer-to-peer markets such as Facebook Marketplace.\nThe launch of Peloton\u2019s new resale platform follows third-quarter earnings released last month that showed a 13% year-on-year fall in revenue to $624 million and a wider-than-expected net loss of nearly $48 million.\nPeloton ended the third quarter with 2.9 million paid fitness subscribers, down 6% from a year prior.\nPeloton\u2019s stock value is a fraction of the peak in 2021, when enforced pandemic lockdowns led to a surge in home exercise and rocketing equipment and subscription sales. CEO Peter Stern \u2013 who was co-founder of Apple Fitness+ \u2013 took the helm in January and been trying to revamp the company, although he has so far been unable to reverse value declines which have seen the stock price fall by over a fifth since the start of the year.\nSpeaking at a Bloomberg event yesterday, Stern stressed that he had no intention of selling the company as he reaffirmed his commitment to reviving the bike and running workouts firm and keeping it \"a standalone company.\"\n\"I was not hired to sell this company,\u201d he said. \"I was hired to bring this company back to growth, reinvigorate it, and that is happening.\"\nPeloton Repowered Focus Shift\nHe said that Peloton must evolve into a more personalized coach powered by AI, while expanding its reach through retail, international markets, and travel, including a stronger presence in hotel gyms. The company has implemented several initiatives to steady the business, including 15% job cuts announced last year and shifting its focus to subscription sales over hardware.\nThe company last month also initiated a pricing strategy to offer discounted equipment rates for eligible educators, healthcare workers, first responders and military personnel in the U.S.\nPeloton Repowered also seems to play to Stern\u2019s assertion that the company must balance between hardware and software: \"Our future is not to try to scale the app at the expense of that equipment business,\" he said"
