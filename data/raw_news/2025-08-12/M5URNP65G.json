  "content": "With a significant presence in Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio and strong hedge fund interest, Moody\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) secures a spot on our list of the 14 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Invest in.\n\nAn iconic financial building in the background, with silhouettes of busy bankers walking past in the foreground.\n\nOn July 23, 2025, Moody\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) announced its results for Q2 2025. The company recorded adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.56, exceeding estimates of $3.39 per share. Meanwhile, resilient Ratings performance, strong growth in Moody\u2019s Analytics (up 11%), and increasing demand for private credit ratings (up 75% from a low base) helped the company achieve a 4% YoY revenue increase, taking it to $1.9 billion. While softness remained in April for the issuance market, May and June brought strong momentum, resulting in the second consecutive quarter of over $1 billion in Ratings revenue.\n\nFurthermore, Moody\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)\u2019s Private Credit segment accounted for nearly 25% of first-time mandates, remaining a standout. Meanwhile, key strategic partnerships, including MSCI and Microsoft, enhanced the company\u2019s positioning within data, AI, and workflow solutions. Moreover, AI-enabled offerings and insurance solutions experienced strong growth, further expanding the company\u2019s recurring revenue to 96% of the total. Looking ahead, the company raised its MIS revenue growth guidance to the low-to-mid single digits for 2025.

The Fed meets, the jobs report is out, as is a key inflation report, and four more Mag7 companies report earnings. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq all gained about 1%. So far this year, the Dow is up 5%, the S&P 500 has climbed 8%, and the Nasdaq leads with a gain of 9%. Earnings season is at peak volume, with more than 900 public companies reporting this week. The list includes Visa, Procter & Gamble, Merck, Booking Holdings, Boeing, Spotify, Starbucks, and UPS on Tuesday; Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday; Apple, Amazon, MasterCard, and Anheuser-Busch on Thursday; and Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Colgate-Palmolive on Friday. At this point, 30% of S&P 500 companies have reported, with 8% growth in corporate earnings compared to the year-ago quarter. This is a solid but slower pace than in the past few quarters. The first quarter logged earnings growth of 14%, following 17% growth in 4Q24, and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For the current quarter, Communication Services is leading, up 37%, while Energy, down 23%, is at the bottom. This week's economic calendar is also jammed. The FOMC will announce its next interest-rate decision on Wednesday afternoon. No change is expected. Wall Street, as usual, will focus on the comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Other releases include consumer confidence and job openings on Tuesday; GDP on Wednesday; the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index on Thursday; and the important July jobs report on Friday. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure currently forecasts 2.4% for 2Q, following a decline of 0.5% for 1Q. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.7% rate for CPI in July, even with the June pace. Mortgage rates stayed flat last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.74%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices dropped a penny to an average of $3.12 per gallon for regular gas. After this week's Federal Reserve rate decision, the next meeting is on September 17, with odds at 64% for a cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the central bank meets on October 29 and odds jump to 80% for a cut. Most economists still expect two rate cuts in 2025. Taking a deeper dive into performance, U.S. stocks are lagging global stocks. A leading industrialized global stock market index, the EFA ETF, has surged 19% year to date, while the leading emerging market ETF EEM has gained 18%. U.S. growth stocks, with a year-to-date gain of 9% (ETF ticker IWF), have taken the lead over value stocks, which show an advance of 7% based on the value ETF (IWD). In other asset classes for the year to date, AGG bonds are up 1.3%, gold is up 28%, crude oil is down 7%, and Bitcoin is up 24%. The U.S. dollar is down 10%, tracking DXY. The VIX Volatility Index is at 15, below its historical average of 20 and consistent with a bull market. Sector performance reveals a mixed picture halfway through 2025. The Industrial sector leads with a 17% gain, followed by Information Technology, Communication Services, and Utilities (all up about 12%). Financials (+10%) also is outperforming the broader market. Turning to defensive sectors, Consumer Staples is up 4% and Materials 10%. Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare are around flat-line for the year, while Real Estate (+6%) has turned a bit higher, but continues to struggle amid elevated interest rates.\nRaising target price\nBaker Hughes was formed from the merger of Baker Hughes Inc. and GE's oil and gas business in July 2017. BKR is the world's third-largest oil services company, with annual revenues of $25.5 billion in 2023, and approximately 55,000 employees. Over the long term, it expects to generate approximately 30% of revenue from the U.S. and 70% from international markets. Baker Hughes is a component of the S&P 500 index and employs approximately 58,000 people.\nRatingPrice TargetMoody's Wide Moat and Profits Revolve Around Its Ratings Business\nMoody\u2019s, along with S&P Ratings, is a leading provider of credit ratings on fixed-income securities.

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up.

      "text": "In this article, we discussed the 14 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Invest in.\nHaving built a fortune of $142.7 billion with a disciplined focus on identifying undervalued companies with solid fundamentals, Warren Buffett is considered one of the greatest investors of all time. Starting his journey toward wealth creation at an early age, he eventually acquired Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, which was a struggling textile business at the time, transforming it into a diversified $1 trillion conglomerate. Today, the company\u2019s portfolio includes iconic brands such as Dairy Queen and GEICO, alongside several publicly traded stocks. His success is marked by strong principles like \u201cnever lose money\u201d and \u201cbuy businesses, not stocks.\u201d Furthermore, his investment philosophy has consistently revolved around early investments, reinvesting profits, and maintaining a long-term perspective.\nMeanwhile, companies with stable revenue, solid profitability, and reliable dividend payouts have always drawn the investor\u2019s attention. Buffett preferred such stocks due to their ability to drive compounding cash flow and sustained growth. This strategy\u2019s success is evident in his company\u2019s performance, where a $500 investment in 1965 has grown into a multi-million-dollar holding.\nWith this backdrop in mind, let\u2019s move on to our list of the 14 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Invest in.\nOur Methodology\nTo curate our list of the 14 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Invest in, we scanned Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment portfolio to extract stocks, ranking these stocks in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in the respective stocks, as of Q1 2025. For this purpose, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund database, which tracks over 1,000 hedge funds. For stocks tied based on hedge fund interest, we used Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake value in them as of the end of Q1 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.
