      "summary": "India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi used the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit to strengthen ties with Russia and China amid escalating U.S. tariffs aimed at curbing India’s Russian oil imports. The U.S. has doubled tariffs to 50% on Indian goods, but a loophole allows India to sell refined Russian oil to the U.S. at market prices, limiting U.S. leverage. Modi’s engagement with Xi and Putin signals a pivot toward the BRICS bloc, potentially countering Western pressure and reshaping India’s trade and geopolitical alignment.",
