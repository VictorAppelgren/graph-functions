      "feedback": "Adjust the probabilities to reflect the source’s signal strength: set 80 % for the verdict‑upheld case and 20 % for reversal; for the Fed, use 30 % for a September cut and 70 % for a hike or higher inflation. Tighten each line by making the driver/mechanism a single phrase and the watch a single key level: e.g., “Verdict reversal (LJZYDXVL3)” → “TSLA price above $360 resistance (LJZYDXVL3)”; “Fed rate cut (B1KYJ1GPU)” → “TSLA borrowing costs lower (B1KYJ1GPU)”; “Fed rate hike (B1KYJ1GPU)” → “TSLA cost structure worsens (B1KYJ1GPU)”. Remove the 30‑day MA references from the driver clauses (they belong in the watch clause if kept). Ensure each line remains a single sentence and that the probability is a numeric percent. This will sharpen the causal chain, align with the 2‑3‑week horizon, and keep the format strictly compliant.",
