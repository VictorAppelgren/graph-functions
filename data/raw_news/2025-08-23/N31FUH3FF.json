      "text": "In July, some of the brightest minds in American technology descended on Washington to celebrate a major milestone: the launch of President Donald Trump's bold initiative to ensure the United States remains the world's unrivaled leader in artificial intelligence (AI).\nLet me be blunt: the AI arms race is no longer theoretical. It's here. And we cannot afford to come in second place.\nIn business, if you don't constantly adapt and innovate, you lose. Nations are no different. If we fail to lead in AI, we risk surrendering our economic and national security edge to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) \u2014 a regime that seeks to challenge American technological supremacy and reshape the global order in its authoritarian image.\nAMERICA MUST WIN THE AI RACE \u2014 AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST\nTrump understands this. That's why his vision for American renewal is laser-focused on innovation, particularly in AI and emerging technologies that will shape our economy and define the nature of future conflict.\nWe have to stop being complacent with a slow, outdated and reactive government. The future demands urgency, ambition and a commitment to putting America first at every turn. This is about building a trusted AI ecosystem that is private-sector led, American-built, and decisive in its capacity to defend freedom.\nThere's a quote from Christian Brose's book, \"The Kill Chain,\" that has stayed with me: \"Over the past decade, in U.S. war games against China, the United States has a nearly perfect record: We have lost almost every single time.\"\nDETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH\nThat's a wake-up call for every American.\nThe CCP is not just trying to compete. They're trying to dominate. From economic espionage and cyber infiltration to exploiting our supply chains and siphoning off our data, the CCP is engaged in full-spectrum technological warfare. The next conflict will not look like the last. It will be a battle of data, autonomy, and algorithmic superiority \u2014 and the side that controls the best AI will win. \\\nThis isn't just a defense imperative; it's an economic one. The AI infrastructure boom will generate thousands of high-paying jobs across the country. From building advanced data centers to manufacturing chips, American workers are at the center of this effort. And making sure every family in this country has the opportunity to get a good job is how we win. That's why Trump's action plan doesn't just emphasize innovation; it prioritizes workforce development, energy modernization and secure supply chains.\nWyoming's vast energy resources will be absolutely critical to winning this race. AI data centers require massive amounts of reliable, baseload power \u2014 the kind that Wyoming's abundant coal and natural gas can deliver, 24/7, 365 days a year. While other states struggle with expensive, intermittent energy sources, Wyoming offers both the dependable power and affordable rates that give American companies a decisive advantage. Our state stands ready to power America's AI revolution with the energy infrastructure that will keep our systems running affordably when national and economic security is on the line.\nAI ARMS RACE: US AND CHINA WEAPONIZE DRONES, CODE AND BIOTECH FOR THE NEXT GREAT WAR\nAmerican manufacturing is at the heart of this effort, and that includes making sure our critical data stays right here at home.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nLet's ask a simple question: do you want your personal data stored on American soil, protected by American workers and American laws \u2014 or housed in China, where it's subject to Communist surveillance and exploitation?\nThis isn't a hypothetical. It's already happening. And that's exactly why American companies are investing billions to build state-of-the-art facilities here at home. These aren't just buildings filled with servers. Data centers are the digital backbone of everything from telehealth and e-commerce to our intelligence agencies and defense systems. They are a critical piece of the AI puzzle and a national security asset we can't afford to outsource. But they're also massive energy consumers \u2014 which makes Wyoming's affordable, dependable energy production essential to keeping these facilities running 24/7.\nTrump's plan rightly focuses on removing barriers and burdensome regulations to allow for the rapid buildout of data centers. His America First AI agenda is the roadmap. But it's up to all of us, from the private sector to Congress, to take the action necessary to propel us forward. We cannot afford to be na\u00efve about the economic and national security risks of falling behind.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWe must ensure that the future of AI is developed in the U.S.A., powered by American energy, and guided by our enduring values of freedom, innovation and hard work.\nThe AI arms race is on \u2014 and America doesn't lose races. Let's win this one, together."

      "text": "Cybercriminals continually seek new ways to expose you to phishing and scam sites designed to steal your credentials or install malware that can compromise your personal data and system. Although browsers and search engines like Chrome and Google Search actively scan and take action against spam and malicious sites, they rely on automated tools to manage the huge volume of threats.\nRecently, hackers have developed AI-powered cloaking software that enables them to bypass these scanners by showing benign pages to security systems while revealing harmful content only to real users. This advanced cloaking technique significantly increases the effectiveness and durability of phishing and malware sites, making it harder for traditional detection methods to protect you.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\nGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER\nHOW AI CHATBOTS ARE HELPING HACKERS TARGET YOUR BANKING ACCOUNTS\nAI-powered web cloaking is here to trick you\nAs discovered by researchers at Slashnext, cybercriminals are adopting a new tactic that makes scam websites nearly invisible to the security systems meant to stop them. Known as web cloaking, the technique uses artificial intelligence to hide phishing pages, fake storefronts, and malware delivery sites from automated scanners while showing them only to human victims.\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\nPlatforms like Hoax Tech and JS Click Cloaker are emerging as key players in this trend. While both market themselves as traffic filtering tools for digital marketers, they are also being used to protect criminal infrastructure. These services use advanced fingerprinting, machine learning, and real-time decision-making to control what each visitor sees.\nHow cloaking tools outsmart detection systems\nHoax Tech analyzes hundreds of data points to build a digital fingerprint of every visitor, from their browser configuration and plugins to their geographic location and IP history. The company\u2019s AI engine, called Matchex, compares this data to a massive database of known crawlers and security scanners. If the system detects a suspicious visitor, it redirects them to a clean, harmless site. If it identifies the visitor as legitimate, it displays the actual scam content.\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\nJS Click Cloaker takes a similar approach but claims to evaluate over 900 parameters per visit. The system scans for behavioral anomalies and uses historical click data to decide whether to allow access to the real page. It also includes features like traffic splitting and A/B testing, giving its users a suite of tools more commonly seen in professional marketing software.\nAt the core of both platforms is the \"white page\" and \"black page\" system. The system shows security scanners the white page, which looks benign and passes review. It serves human victims the black page, which contains the scam or malicious payload. This selective targeting allows phishing campaigns and fraudulent sites to stay live longer and avoid detection.\n6 ways you can stay safe from cloaked scam sites\nCybercriminals are increasingly adopting advanced cloaking tools to evade detection, which is making it harder for people to spot malicious websites. Still, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk:\n1. Stick to trusted sources: Avoid clicking on links from unknown senders or sketchy websites, even if they appear in ads or social media posts. Type URLs directly when possible.\n2. Use strong antivirus software: A strong antivirus software can help analyze suspicious links and sites before you open them.\nGet my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech\n3. Use security-focused browsers: Built-in protections in browsers like Firefox and Brave can help block suspicious scripts and trackers.\n4. Keep your software updated: Regular updates to your browser, operating system, and antivirus software ensure you have the latest security patches.\n5. Be cautious with login pages: If a site asks for your credentials unexpectedly, verify the URL and domain name carefully. Cloaked phishing pages can look nearly identical to the real thing.\n6. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Even if your credentials are stolen, 2FA can act as a final line of defense against account takeover by requiring a pin which is generated through an authenticator app or is sent to your phone or email.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nKurt\u2019s key takeaway\nAI-powered cloaking is making it increasingly difficult to track and take down malicious sites. The result is a fast-growing market for what is essentially cloaking-as-a-service. These tools are inexpensive, easy to use, and designed to work at scale. For cybercriminals, cloaking is no longer a fringe tactic but a core part of their toolkit. While you may still be unaware of these tools, they are already reshaping how digital fraud operates behind the scenes.\nDo you think browsers and search engines are doing enough to protect you from advanced scams like these?

      "text": "Zuckerberg wants to give everyone their own personal superintelligence through Meta's new vision\nMeta CEO says vision differs from industry focus on automating work\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday announced the tech giant will focus on developing a personal superintelligence for everyone, which will further enable creative and leisurely pursuits.\nZuckerberg discussed the path forward for Meta's artificial intelligence (AI) push in a video published on Facebook and Instagram, two of the main social media platforms that are part of Meta.\n\"AI keeps accelerating, and over the past few months we've begun to see glimpses of AI systems improving themselves, so developing superintelligence is now in sight. But there's this big open question about what we should direct superintelligence towards,\" he said.\n\"A lot has been written about the scientific and economic advances that AI can bring, and I'm really optimistic about this,\" Zuckerberg explained. \"But I think an even more meaningful impact in our lives is going to come from everyone having a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world, be a better friend, and grow to become the person that you aspire to be.\"\n\"This vision is different from others in the industry who want to direct AI at automating all of the valuable work. At Meta, we believe in putting the power of superintelligence in people's hands to direct it towards what they value in their own lives.\"\n\"Some of this will be about improving productivity, but a lot of it may be more personal in nature. This is going to be a new era in some ways, but in others it's going to be a continuation of historical trends.\"\nOPENAI CEO ACCUSES META OF OFFERING $100 MILLION BONUSES TO POACH EMPLOYEES\n| Ticker | Security | Last | Change | Change % |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| META | META PLATFORMS INC. | 754.79 | +15.69 | +2.12% |\nZuckerberg said 200 years ago, about 90% of people were focused on farming for survival, while today fewer than 2% of the population produce the food that feeds the world.\n\"Advances in technology have freed much of humanity to focus less on subsistence, and more on the pursuits that we choose. That at each step along the way, most people have decided to use their newfound productivity to spend more time on creativity, culture, and just enjoying life \u2013 and I expect superintelligence to accelerate this trend even more.\"\nMETA PARTNERS WITH OAKLEY TO LAUNCH AI-POWERED PERFORMANCE GLASSES\nHe went on to say that if past trends continue, there will be less time spent on productivity software and more time on creating and connecting, adding that he believes personal devices such as AI-enabled smart glasses, will become the \"main computing devices.\"\n\"I believe deeply in building personal superintelligence for everyone, and at Meta, we have the resources to build the resources to build the massive infrastructure required, and the ability to deliver new technology to billions of people. I am excited to build this future, and we've got a lot more to come soon,\" Zuckerberg concluded."

      "text": "Trump administration strikes deal with Google to use AI platform across federal agencies\nDeal runs through 2026 and follows similar agreements with OpenAI and Anthropic under OneGov initiative\nThe General Services Administration (GSA) on Thursday announced a new agreement with Google to deploy its suite of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services across the federal government.\nThe deal comes as part of the Trump administration's \"America AI Action Plan\" and will see federal agencies pay $0.47 per agency to use Google's AI tools, including a new Gemini for Government offering. The deal is valid through 2026 and builds on the prior agreement under which Google Workspace was provided to all federal agencies at a 71% price cut.\nGSA's deal with Google comes as part of the OneGov initiative for procurement across federal agencies, which has also featured deals for AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT for $1 and those offered by Anthropic for $1.\nOVERNMENT AGENCY SLASHES MORE CONSULTANT CONTRACTS IT SAYS WILL SAVE TAXPAYERS BILLIONS\n\"This is a natural progression in the strategy that we have rolled out over the last couple of months in what we're calling OneGov,\" Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum said in an interview with FOX Business Network's Grady Trimble. \"It's trying to use the federal wallet as one negotiating leverage point and one-stop shop for industry to deal with the federal government as it relates to common goods procurement.\"\n\"I think what differentiates Google inside of the strategy that the GSA has been deploying over the past several months\u2026 is they are answering the bell in terms of many different policies and pulling together many different initiatives that we are trying to execute on under the direction of this president and his commonsense business approach to the way the federal government operates on a day-to-day,\" Gruenbaum said.\nKaren Dahut, CEO of Google Public Sector, told Trimble in an interview that the company is \"super excited about our partnership with GSA,\" saying that \"what we came to understand is that we have a shared sense of urgency around the need to really provide AI tools and products to the federal workers.\"\nGOOGLE COMMITS $1B TO TRAIN US COLLEGE STUDENTS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OVER THREE YEARS\n\"What really separates this offer from anything else that anybody else has done is we are offering a fully integrated AI-ready platform for federal workers to use today. It's hyper-secure at the FedRAMP high standard, and it includes Gemini and all of the assistive capabilities of Gemini,\" she said.\nDahut explained that the offer is \"aimed at helping the government really transform operations\" and \"reduces the toil of the federal workforce\" by allowing workers to spend more time on higher-value activities.\n| Ticker | Security | Last | Change | Change % |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| GOOGL | ALPHABET INC. | 206.09 | +6.34 | +3.17% |\nThe GSA's rollout of AI tools like Google's Gemini for Government offering, as well as the previously announced tools from Anthropic and ChatGPT, gives federal agencies the ability to begin experimenting with how the tools can improve operations and begin incorporating them into more workflows over time.\nNVIDIA AND AMD STRIKE MAJOR REVENUE-SHARING DEAL WITH US GOVERNMENT OVER CHINA CHIP SALES\n\"Agencies are adopting this technology in the crawl, walk, run paradigm in a different cadence. There are some agencies that are quite ahead of the curve,\" Gruenbaum said, noting GSA has been using AI in procurement for nearly two years.\n\"Other agencies will learn from GSA. We are building a full playbook that they will be able to leverage and try to go and deploy within their own agencies,\" he said.\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\"My expectation is certain agencies will deploy the tools for some of the more obvious use cases, like help desks or call centers, and then as they get to that run phase of where they could really make their processes and systems very, very tech forward, very agentic, that's going to evolve over time as we start educating the workforce,\" Gruenbaum said."
