      "summary": "Copeland’s refrigeration controllers, used by major grocery chains, have been hit by a series of critical security flaws (Frostbyte10) that could allow remote code execution and full system takeover. The vulnerabilities, including predictable admin passwords and root‑level access, affect both E2 and E3 models, with E2 already end‑of‑life but still in use. Copeland has released firmware updates (E3 2.31F01) and urges immediate patching, while authorities warn that the widespread deployment makes these devices prime targets for state‑sponsored or ransomware actors.",
