  "content": "Warren Buffett\u2019s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, recently filed its quarterly Form 13F equity investment portfolio, providing investors with an update regarding the company\u2019s holdings. The filing indicated five newer holdings that Buffett and Berkshire have acquired, including one rather surprising investment in a very controversial and embattled company.\n\nAlso Learn: 10 Genius Things Warren Buffett Says To Do With Your Money\n\nBuffett has long been known as the \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d thanks to incredible investment acumen, financial success and longevity in the market \u2014 all of which makes these most recent investments worth considering. The Oracle has bet on these companies \u2014 should you?\n\nAlso see why Buffett is so good at weathering market unrest.\n\nCertainly the most surprising investment reveal in Berkshire\u2019s filing is that the holding company now has 5 million shares (valued at around $1.55 million) of the embattled UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Berkshire has been amassing shares of UNH in secret since the final quarter of 2024 so as to avoid a spike in share prices. UNH is currently under a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice due to a potential Medicare fraud, which caused its income to plummet throughout 2025.\n\nSo why did Buffett\u2019s company invest, and should you?\n\n\u201cUnitedHealth Group is strongly recommended as a company selling at a 50% discount to its peak price of $615 just nine months ago,\u201d said David Kass, clinical professor of finance at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business.\n\nKass commended Berkshire\u2019s investment, adding that UNH\u2019s controversies will likely lead to some \u201cmajor fines and some executives may be forced to leave the company. But [UNH] will survive and likely regain its prominence in the industry. Its finances are solid. It has above-average profitability and a below-average price-to-earnings ratio.\u201d\n\nVince Stanizone, CEO and founder of First Information, said, \u201cWhat we see with Berkshire\u2019s latest buys is that they have gone for out-of-favor stocks such as UnitedHealth, where they see value after the near 50% drop. As the old Buffett saying goes, \u2018Be greedy when others are fearful.'\u201d\n\nSee More: If Warren Buffett\u2019s Wealth Was Evenly Distributed Across America, How Much Money Would Every Person Get?\n\nAllegion, a security products firm, is \u201cattractive as a result of its high profitability, with a gross margin of 45% and a return on equity of 39%, along with a solid growth outlook,\u201d Kass said. Berkshire scooped 780,000 shares of the security company for an estimated $107 million.",

      "text": "Warren Buffett: 10 Things Poor People Waste Money On\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in the world, has a reputation for his simple financial wisdom. His advice is certainly worth listening to, especially if it helps you avoid making money mistakes.\nAccording to Buffett, here are 10 things poor people waste money on and what he does instead.\nLow-Value Investments\n\u201cThe most important investment you can make is in yourself,\u201d Buffett has said, according to Inc. \u201cThat\u2019s how knowledge builds up. Like compound interest.\u201d\nOne of Buffett\u2019s most famous tips, known as the Buffett formula, is to go to bed smarter each day.\nAccording to Inc., Buffett recommends reading. He spends about 80% of his day reading, and he suggests that anyone hoping to achieve success should read 500 pages per day.\nIf you\u2019re investing in something other than yourself right now, it might be time to rethink your strategy.\nCredit Card Debt\nBuffett is also very against credit card debt. He prefers to rely on cash instead of using a credit card. \u201cI\u2019ve got an American Express card, which I got in 1964,\u201d Buffett told Yahoo Finance. But I pay cash 98% of the time.\u201d\nQuantity Over Quality\n\u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,\u201d Buffett wrote in his 1989 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.\nBuffett won\u2019t invest in something just because it\u2019s cheap. Although he\u2019s talking about investing in businesses, this can be applied to everyday life. When you prioritize quantity over quality, the short-term gains may not mean much (and it could cost you more) in the long run.\nUnnecessary Spending\nBuffett doesn\u2019t care about having the latest technology or designer labels. According to AP Moneywise, he used a $20 flip phone for several years before upgrading to an iPhone in 2020.\nHis advice? \u201cDo not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving,\u201d according to Moneywise.\nNew Cars\nCars are depreciating assets. According to Kelley Blue Book, most new vehicles have a 20% drop in value in the first year.\nSo instead of buying a new car, Buffett prefers to buy used vehicles at reduced prices.\n\u201cThe truth is, I only drive about 3,500 miles a year, so I will buy a new car very infrequently,\u201d he said, according to Forbes.\nFull-Price Purchases\nEven Warren Buffett looks for good deals. Years ago, Buffett once treated Bill Gates to a meal at a fast food restaurant and used coupons to help pay for the meal.\n\u201cRemember the laugh we had when we traveled together to Hong Kong and decided to get lunch at McDonald\u2019s? You offered to pay, dug into your pocket, and pulled out \u2026 coupons!\u201d Gates wrote in his and now-ex-wife Melinda\u2019s 2017 annual letter.\n\u201cMelinda just found this photo of me and \u2018the big spender.\u2019 It reminded us how much you value a good deal,\u201d Gates wrote, using the anecdote to segue to a discussion about the value of philanthropy.\nRegular Nights Out\nBuffett has a very simple diet and doesn\u2019t like to go out much. In Buffett\u2019s biography, \u201cThe Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,\u201d author Alice Schroeder quoted him as saying, \u201cI like eating the same thing over and over and over again. I could eat a ham sandwich every day for fifty days in a row for breakfast,\u201d Mashed reported.\nWasted Opportunities\nIn his early years, Buffett picked up side hustles and made money by delivering newspapers, selling used golf balls and buffing cars, as previously reported by GOBankingRates. He also looked for new opportunities, and when he couldn\u2019t find any, he\u2019d create them.\nGambling\nAt a 2007 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, Buffett called gambling \u201csocially revolting,\u201d according to The Motley Fool.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a prude about it, but to quite an extent, gambling is a tax on ignorance,\u201d he reportedly said, referring to the tax revenue generated by gambling.\n\u201cA government shouldn\u2019t make it easy for people to take their Social Security checks and [waste them pulling] a handle.\u201d\nIf you have extra money, don\u2019t waste it on gambling.\nLiving Beyond Their Means\nWhen you\u2019re shopping and see something you like, ask yourself whether you really need it or just want it.\nDuring a 2009 meeting at Emory University, Buffett said something to the effect that his goal is \u201cnot to make people envious.\u201d He also said you can\u2019t buy health or love and warned the audience not to confuse the cost of living with the standard of living, according to meeting notes from a student who attended, which appeared on the student\u2019s Underground Value blog."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nEntrepreneur/Tesla CEO Elon Musk and investor/Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett are two of the wealthiest human beings on Earth. Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth of more than $400 billion, and Buffett is currently ranked in the top 10 with a net worth hovering around $150 million, according to Forbes. Both men have weathered economic tumult and bad investments, and have still managed to amass more wealth than the rest of the planet.\nWhile Buffett and Musk have both achieved monumental success, they have done so with radically different styles, attitudes and personalities. Musk has a tendency toward risk and bluster; Buffet has a more measured persona and bases his decisions upon care and research. In an era of such economic uncertainty as this one, why is Buffett better suited to weather the market upheavals of the day?\nResilience Over Risk\nBuffett\u2019s personality and investment strategies are defined by patience, with an eye toward long-term growth via investing rather than short-term success. As an investor, Buffett favors industries and businesses that are resilient and promise long-term growth. Such companies \u2014 like Apple and Coca-Cola \u2014 are resilient enough to last through eras of financial chaos.\nMusk, on the other hand, takes a high-risk approach to business strategies. For example, he insisted upon buying the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in 2022 for a staggering $44 billion in a loud and splashy deal\u2026only for X\u2019s net value to drop to less than $10 billion.\nMusk himself tends to be a walking, talking risk-generator himself \u2014 his alignment with President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial administration in 2025 caused Tesla\u2019s stocks to steeply drop even before tariff-related chaos shook the markets. While Musk lives his business life as an innovator, game-changer and risk-taker, part of that inclination toward risk prevents keeps him from achieving Buffett\u2019s resilience in troubled times.\nDiversity Over Limited Scope\nBuffett\u2019s investment strategy prefers a diversified portfolio, made up of such varied industries as consumer commodities, energy, insurance and tech products. In doing so, Buffett has curated a wide array of investments to blunt the impact of market upheavals \u2014 if one industry collapses or crashes, the others maintain the stability of Buffett\u2019s wealth.\nMusk\u2019s high-risk style includes a far narrower investment focus: himself. Musk often doubles down and invests big in his own ventures, such SpaceX, Tesla and X. Investing in himself as a brand can be advantageous during successful periods, but when Musk is embroiled in controversy \u2014 such as in 2025 \u2014 it can lead to incredible losses.\nOverall, while Musk is the wealthier of the two men, Buffett\u2019s wealth is far less volatile than that of the world\u2019s richest man. While so many others have lost billions throughout 2025, Buffet\u2019s wealth continues to grow thanks to his measured and careful value investments.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWarren Buffett has made his billions largely through investing. His uncanny ability to predict the behaviors of the market have served him \u2014 and the many investors who mirror his moves \u2014 remarkably well. Buffett, dubbed \u201cthe Oracle of Omaha\u201d for his extraordinary prescience, has been consistently generous in sharing his investing strategies. But he also adamantly refuses to play the role of fortune teller \u2014 no matter how badly we want him to.\nInstead of worrying about predictions, he has advice on what to focus on.\nBuffett Is Not Predicting a Crash\nRight now, as the stock market endures turbulence, sparking fears of a recession across Wall Street, investors are all but begging Buffett for insight. Will there be a crash?\nBuffett will not directly answer the question \u2014 and not because he\u2019s gatekeeping, but because he recognizes the impossibility of the ask. We may harken back to something he said in a 2008 New York Times op-ed, \u201cI can\u2019t predict the short-term movements of the stock market. I haven\u2019t the faintest idea as to whether stocks will be higher or lower a month or a year from now.\u201d\nStop Expecting Buffett To Be a Fortune Teller \u2014 And Do This Instead\nRather than hounding Buffett for crystal ball visions that not even he can conjure, we should follow his evergreen advice on how to handle these topsy-turvy times when the market is volatile and we feel the ground shaking under our precious investments.\nIn a 2017 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett advised investors to do the following when \u201cmajor declines occur.\u201d Read the poem \u201cIf\u2013\u201d by Rudyard Kiping, written circa 1895. Buffett highlighted these lines from the poem.\n\u201cIf you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . .\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . .\nIf you can think \u2013 and not make thoughts your aim . . .\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you\u2026\nYours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it.\u201d\nWhat Does the Poem Mean?\nLike any worthwhile poem, \u201cIf\u2013\u201d wasn\u2019t published with an explanation by the author of what it means. But scholarly interpretations abound. Generally, this poem is received as an expression of Victorian-era stoicism. It\u2019s a rallying call for self-discipline, restraint and acceptance.\nWe may hear Kipling giving us some very basic advice along the lines of, \u201cIf you can control your reactivity and just let things be as they are, you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\nSo, when the stock market tailspins, recognize that this has happened before and it will happen again, and be at peace knowing that your long-term investment strategy is still working in your favor. Stay calm and focused and don\u2019t let the storm displace your sense of security and strength.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nWarren Buffett, the legendary \u201cOracle of Omaha,\u201d has built one of the most impressive fortunes in modern history through decades of savvy investing and his leadership of Berkshire Hathaway. But what if the 94-year-old billionaire\u2019s massive wealth was distributed equally among every American citizen? The answer might surprise you.\nAs of 2025, Warren Buffett\u2019s estimated net worth stands at approximately $160-161 billion, making him one of the five wealthiest individuals in the world. If that money was split evenly amongst millions of Americans, how much would you get?\nHow Much You Would Hypothetically Get From Buffett\u2019s Fortune\nWith the United States population estimated at around 347 million people as of January 2025, a simple division reveals that each American would receive approximately $462 if Buffett\u2019s entire fortune was distributed evenly.\nWhile $462 might not seem life-changing for most Americans, it represents the purchasing power equivalent to:\n- A month\u2019s worth of groceries for an average household.\n- Several months of streaming service subscriptions.\n- A decent emergency fund starter for those living paycheck to paycheck.\n- A small investment that could grow over time.\nHow Buffett Built His Fortune\nBuffett has a history of beating the S&P 500 performance each year with his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, and 2025 has been particularly kind to the investing icon, with his estimated personal wealth growing while most other billionaires have lost money this year. In just the first four months of 2025, Buffett amassed an additional $24 billion as Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stock price increased.\nThe vast majority of Buffett\u2019s wealth comes from his ownership stake in Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he has led since 1970. His investment philosophy of buying quality companies at reasonable prices and holding them for the long term has created extraordinary returns for shareholders over more than five decades.\nPutting $462 in Perspective\nTo understand the significance of this amount, consider that $462 represents:\n- More than many Americans have in their emergency savings accounts.\n- About 10% of the median monthly household income in the United States.\n- Enough to cover unexpected expenses like car repairs or medical bills for many families.\n- A meaningful contribution to retirement savings when invested properly.\nFor context, this amount is considerably less than what each American would receive from other tech billionaires\u2019 fortunes. For example, if Elon Musk\u2019s wealth was distributed equally, each person would receive significantly more due to his higher net worth.\nThe Reality of Wealth Distribution\nOf course, this thought experiment is purely hypothetical. Buffett has already committed to giving away 99% of his wealth through the Giving Pledge, a commitment he made alongside Bill and Melinda Gates to donate the majority of their fortunes to charitable causes during their lifetimes or after their deaths.\nSince 2006, Buffett has donated more than $50 billion to various charitable organizations, primarily through annual gifts of Berkshire Hathaway stock to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and family foundations run by his children. His approach to philanthropy emphasizes that those who have been fortunate in capitalism should give back to society.\nWhile receiving $462 from Warren Buffett\u2019s hypothetical wealth distribution might provide temporary relief or a small financial boost, the real value lies in understanding how he built that wealth in the first place. His disciplined approach to investing, focus on long-term value creation and commitment to continuous learning offer more valuable lessons than any one-time windfall could provide."

Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1.\u201d If you\u2019re working from a loss, it\u2019s that much harder to get back to where you started, let alone to earn gains.\nGet High Value at a Low Price\nAnother key principle Buffett has shared is, \u201cPrice is what you pay; value is what you get.\u201d Losing money can happen when you pay a price that doesn\u2019t match the value you get \u2014 such as when you pay high interest on credit card debt or spend on items you\u2019ll rarely use.\nInstead, live modestly, or in the case of stocks Buffett recommends when approaching your investment strategy, start by looking for opportunities to get more value at a lower price. \u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down,\u201d he wrote.\nFind Out: How To Become Rich: 9 Fastest Ways, According To Experts\nForm Healthy Money Habits\nIn an address at the University of Florida, Buffett said, \u201cMost behavior is habitual, and they say that the chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken.\u201d Work on building positive money habits \u2014 and breaking those that hurt your wallet.\nAvoid Debt, Especially Credit Card Debt\nBuffett built his wealth by getting interest to work for him \u2014 instead of working to pay interest, as many Americans do. \u201cI\u2019ve seen more people fail because of liquor and leverage \u2014 leverage being borrowed money,\u201d Buffett said in a 1991 speech at the University of Notre Dame. \u201cYou really don\u2019t need leverage in this world much. If you\u2019re smart, you\u2019re going to make a lot of money without borrowing.\u201d\nBuffett is especially wary of credit cards. His advice is to avoid them altogether. \u201cInterest rates are very high on credit cards,\u201d Buffett once said. \u201cSometimes they are 18%. Sometimes they are 20%. If I borrowed money at 18% or 20%, I\u2019d be broke.\u201d\nKeep Cash on Hand\nAnother key to ensuring security is to always keep cash reserves on hand. \u201cWe always maintain at least $20 billion \u2014 and usually far more \u2014 in cash equivalents,\u201d was a piece of advice in a letter Buffett wrote to shareholders as part of a Berkshire Hathaway annual report.\nBusinesses and individuals alike might get an itch to put liquid cash to work through investments. \u201cCash, though, is to a business as oxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cWhen bills come due, only cash is legal tender. Don\u2019t leave home without it.\u201d\nInvest in Yourself\nBuffett once said, \u201cInvest in as much of yourself as you can. You are your own biggest asset by far.\u201d He echoed those sentiments in a CNBC interview when he said, \u201cAnything you do to improve your own talents and make yourself more valuable will get paid off in terms of appropriate real purchasing power.\u201d\nThose returns are big, too. \u201cAnything you invest in yourself, you get back tenfold,\u201d Buffett said. And unlike other assets and investments, \u201cnobody can tax it away; they can\u2019t steal it from you.\u201d\nLearn About Money\nPart of investing in yourself should be learning more about managing money. As an investor, much of Buffett\u2019s job consists of limiting exposure and minimizing risk. And \u201crisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Buffett once said, according to Forbes. The more you know about personal finance, the more security you\u2019ll have as you minimize risks.\nThe lesson from this Buffett quote is to actively educate yourself about personal finance. As Charlie Munger \u2014 Buffett\u2019s late partner \u2014 put it, \u201cGo to bed smarter than when you woke up.\u201d\nTrust a Low-Cost Index Fund for Your Portfolio\nWhile much of Buffett\u2019s wisdom and advice borders on the philosophical, he has also provided some actionable tips that nearly anyone can apply. For instance, Buffett urges the average investor to purchase index funds.\n\u201cPut 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund,\u201d he wrote in one of his letters to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.\nBuffett has given this advice for years. \u201cIf you invested in a very low-cost index fund \u2014 where you don\u2019t put the money in at one time, but average in over 10 years \u2014 you\u2019ll do better than 90% of people who start investing at the same time,\u201d Buffett said at the 2004 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.\nGive Back\nAccording to Forbes, Buffett once said, \u201cIf you\u2019re in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%.\u201d And as a top member of that 1% himself, Buffett makes it a point to put his money where his mouth is.\nAlong with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Buffett is a founder of The Giving Pledge, which is a promise made by more than 100 billionaires to give their fortunes away. While you might not be a billionaire, you can still enrich your life by giving back.\nView Money as a Long-Term Game\nBuffett also said, \u201cSomeone\u2019s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.\u201d And it\u2019s true. Planting and nurturing the seeds of financial success now will lead to shade to enjoy later in life. That shade might include freedom from debts, a secure retirement or the ability to cover the cost of college for your children.\nSuch a long-term view of money is central to Buffett\u2019s investing decisions. He claims people should \u201cinvest with a multi-decade horizon \u2026 their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasing power over their investing lifetime.\u201d He urged investors not to focus on moments of stock market volatility or economic crisis.\nBuilding true wealth and financial security takes time, and you\u2019ll likely encounter financial challenges along the way. But viewing your finances as a lifelong endeavor can help you stay on course despite hardships. That gives you a financial foundation that will last.\nCaitlyn Moorhead contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates"
