      "text": "Why is Trump sending US National Guard to Washington, DC?\nThe president is deploying the National Guard in response to what he calls a crime emergency, with 800 troops slated to be sent to the capital.\nUnited States President Donald Trump has announced that he is temporarily taking control of the Washington, DC, police department, while deploying 800 National Guard troops to the city.\nTrump said his actions are needed to \u201crescue\u201d the US capital from a surge in crime.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 2 itemsTrump says he will deploy US National Guard in Washington, DC\nWhile violent crime spiked in Washington, DC, in 2023, data shows it has been falling quickly since then.\nHere is what we know:\nWhat has Trump announced?\nDuring a 78-minute news conference, Trump announced that the federal government would take control of the District of Columbia (DC) Metropolitan Police Department to address surging crime.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\u201d Trump said during the conference in which he was joined by US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will oversee the city\u2019s police force while it is under federal control.\n\u201cThis is Liberation Day in DC, and we\u2019re going to take our capital back. We\u2019re taking it back,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cUnder the authorities vested in me as the President of the United States, I\u2019m officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act\u2026 and placing the DC Metropolitan and Police Department under direct federal control,\u201d he said.\nHe also announced the deployment of the National Guard.\n\u201cI\u2019m deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC, and they\u2019re going to be allowed to do their job properly,\u201d he said.\nTrump also said that he intends to remove the capital\u2019s homeless population, but did not provide details on how the plan would be carried out.\nWhat is the Home Rule Act of 1973?\nThe Home Rule Act of 1973 is a US federal law that gave Washington, DC, a significant degree of self-government for the first time.\nWashington, DC, is the seat of the federal government and the only US city that is not part of the 50 states. As a result, it has no voting representation in Congress.\nFor about a century, up until 1973, the city was run by three presidentially appointed commissioners. That was until then-President Richard Nixon signed the Home Rule Act, enabling district residents to elect a mayor and city council.\nBut the Home Rule Act also says the president can take control of the city\u2019s police force if \u201cspecial conditions of an emergency nature exist\u201d.\nThis is something Trump threatened to do in 2020, amid nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd. The city\u2019s police can be used for \u201cfederal purposes\u201d.\nThe president can use the DC police force for 48 hours, or up to 30 days if he notifies Congress.\nTrump said he plans to keep the federal takeover of the force going past the first 48 hours, and will officially inform the appropriate parties.\nThe mayor of Washington, DC, Muriel Bowser, is adamant that the city still has control: \u201cLet me be clear. Chief Pamela Smith is the chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, and its 3,100 members work under her direction.\u201d\n\u201cNothing about our organisational chart has changed,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cAnd nothing in the executive order would indicate otherwise.\u201d\nAccording to a report by the news outlet Politico, federal law enforcement officers will be tasked with protecting federal buildings and national monuments.\nWhat do we know about the National Guard deployment?\nAccording to a statement from the US Army, \u201cbetween 100-200 soldiers will be supporting law enforcement at any given time\u201d.\n\u201cTheir duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,\u201d the army said.\nThe National Guard will operate under Title 32 status, meaning they remain under local control but are funded by the federal government. In this status, they are not bound by the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars US service members from engaging in law enforcement activities.\nUS Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that the Guard would begin flowing into DC this week.\nAccording to a report by CNN, deployed troops are not expected to openly carry rifles as they patrol the streets. Instead, they will probably keep their weapons nearby, for example, in their trucks, so they can access them if necessary for self-defence, the official said.\nHegseth said the Pentagon was \u201cprepared to bring in other National Guard units \u2013 other specialised units\u201d, but did not offer any further details.\nWhen asked whether the military would assist with clearing homeless people from the city, Hegseth said that the soldiers would assist local law enforcement.\n\u201cOur job is to stand alongside law enforcement,\u201d he said.\nWhy is Trump taking these measures?\nIn the executive order, Trump states that rising violence in the capital has become an emergency.\nThe \u201crising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government\u201d, the order states.\n\u201cThe magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States.\u201d\nIt also says that the attorney general shall regularly update the president \u201con the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia\u201d.\nMAKE D.C. SAFE AGAIN \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/xJRIcgy4ld\n\u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 11, 2025\nAccording to reports, the move seems to have been triggered by an assault involving Edward Coristine, a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer and protege of Elon Musk, who previously led DOGE. Police say 10 teenagers attacked the 19-year-old and his partner early on August 3. Two 15-year-olds were later arrested and charged.\n\u201cIf DC doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, days after the attack, with an image showing a shirtless Coristine with what appeared to be blood spattered on his face, body and trousers.\n\u201cPerhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime,\u201d Trump added.\nIs DC truly facing a crime emergency?\nThe mayor of Washington, DC, Bowser, questioned the effectiveness of deploying the National Guard to enforce local laws, saying that more funding for prosecutors would make a more meaningful difference.\nAt a news conference on Monday, the mayor said that Trump\u2019s perception of the city was \u201cshaped by his COVID-view experience during his first term\u201d.\n\u201cIt is true that those were more challenging times related to some issues. It is also true that we experienced a crime spike post-COVID, but we worked quickly to put laws in place and tactics that got violent offenders off our streets, and gave our police officers more tools,\u201d she said.\nAccording to Bowser, violent crime is now at a 30-year low in Washington, DC.\nWashington, DC\u2019s crime numbers have been questioned after authorities began investigating claims that some figures were changed to make the situation look better.\nBut Bowser has stood by the data and said that Trump\u2019s picture of DC as lawless is wrong.\nIn January, the Department of Justice reported that violent crime in the nation\u2019s capital fell 35 percent from 2023 to 2024.\nOfficial crime statistics from the DC Metropolitan Police Department show that violent offences declined between 2023 and 2024, and preliminary 2025 data indicate the trend is continuing.\nThe data for this year shows that homicides have fallen by 12 percent, and assaults with dangerous weapons by 20 percent.\nThe FBI, however, reported that nationwide violent crime also fell, by an estimated 4.5 percent in 2024, compared with 2023."

      "text": "Two dead, 10 injured in explosion at US steel plant in Pennsylvania\nFlames and heavy smoke billow out of the plant owned by US Steel as firefighters struggle to extinguish the fire.\nMultiple explosions at a US Steel plant near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania have killed two people and injured 10, according to the company and local authorities.\nThe blasts at the Clairton Coke Works \u2013 part of a sprawling industrial complex along the Monongahela River \u2013 took place just before 11am Eastern Time (15:00 GMT) on Monday.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 itemsTrump mass layoffs cause uncertainty among federal firefighting workforce\nWhy fire hydrants and water supply failed during Los Angeles wildfires\nCalifornia water wars: A century of wrangling over Los Angeles\u2019s water\nFirefighters battled flames and heavy smoke that billowed out of the plant, which is owned by US Steel, a subsidiary of Nippon Steel.\nInitially, two people were reported missing. One person was found and transported to a local hospital, said Allegheny County Police Assistant Superintendent Victor Joseph at an afternoon briefing.\nThere was no word yet on the possible cause of the explosion.\nThe investigation into the explosion would be \u201ca time-consuming technical investigation\u201d, Joseph said.\nDavid Burritt, president and chief executive officer of US Steel, said in a statement that the company was working with local authorities to discover the cause.\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro posted on X that there were multiple explosions at the plant and that his administration was in touch with local officials.\n\u201cThe scene is still active, and folks nearby should follow the direction of local authorities,\u201d he wrote at the time the employee was missing.\nThe severity of the injuries was not known, but news accounts said several people were taken to hospital burn units.\nSteel sector in decline\nClairton Mayor Rich Lattanzi said it was a horrible day for the city, about 32km (20 miles) south of Pittsburgh, long known as the US Steel City.\nUS Steel has produced steel in the area since the late 19th century, but in recent decades, the industry has been in decline, leading to plant closures and restructurings.\nIn June, Nippon Steel, Japan\u2019s biggest steelmaker, closed its $14.9bn acquisition of US Steel after an 18-month struggle to obtain United States government approval for the deal, which faced scrutiny due to national security concerns.\nWhile air quality monitors did not detect a dangerous rise in sulphur dioxide after Monday\u2019s explosions, residents within 1.6km (1 mile) of the plant were advised to remain indoors, close windows and doors, set HVAC systems to recirculate, and avoid activities that draw in outside air, said Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato at the briefing.\nThe Clairton Coke Works is the largest coke manufacturing facility in the US, employing about 1,300 workers. It operates 10 coke oven batteries, which produce about 4.3 million tonnes of coke a year.\nCoke is produced by heating coal at high temperatures. It is used in blast furnaces as part of the process of making steel."

      "text": "US to extend China tariff pause another 90 days\nUS President Donald Trump signed an extension just before midnight in Beijing, when a pause on tariffs was set to expire.\nUnited States President Donald Trump has signed an executive order extending the China tariff deadline for another 90 days.\nThe extension came only hours before midnight in Beijing, when the 90 day pause was set to expire, CNBC reported on Monday, citing a White House official.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 itemsNvidia, AMD to pay 15% of China chip sales to US government\nNorway wealth fund divests from several Israeli companies due to Gaza war\nTrump meets with Intel CEO after calling for his ouster\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment.\nEarlier on Monday, Trump said he has been \u201cdealing very nicely with China\u201d as Beijing said it was seeking positive outcomes.\nIf the deadline had passed, duties on Chinese goods would have returned to where they were in April at 145 percent, further fuelling tensions between the world\u2019s two largest trading partners.\nWhile the US and China slapped escalating tariffs on each other\u2019s products this year, reaching prohibitive triple-digit levels and snarling global trade, both countries in May agreed to temporarily lower tariffs at a meeting between negotiators in Geneva, Switzerland.\nBut the pause comes as negotiations still loom. Asked about the deadline on Monday, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. They\u2019ve been dealing quite nicely. The relationship is very good with [China\u2019s] President Xi [Jinping] and myself.\u201d\n\u201cWe hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state,\u201d said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian in a statement.\nHe added that Beijing also hopes Washington will \u201cstrive for positive outcomes on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit\u201d.\nIn June, key economic officials convened in London as disagreements emerged and US officials accused their counterparts of violating the pact. Policymakers again met in Stockholm last month.\nEven as both countries appeared to be seeking to push back the reinstatement of duties, US trade envoy Jamieson Greer said last month that Trump will have the \u201cfinal call\u201d on any such extension.\nOngoing negotiations\nKelly Ann Shaw, a senior White House trade official during Trump\u2019s first term and now with Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, said she expected Trump to extend the 90-day \u201ctariff detente\u201d for another 90 days later on Monday.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a Trump-style negotiation if it didn\u2019t go right down to the wire,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe whole reason for the 90-day pause in the first place was to lay the groundwork for broader negotiations, and there\u2019s been a lot of noise about everything from soybeans to export controls to excess capacity over the weekend,\u201d she said.\nRyan Majerus, a former US trade official now with the King & Spalding law firm, welcomed the news.\n\u201cThis will undoubtedly lower anxiety on both sides as talks continue, and as the US and China work toward a framework deal in the fall. I\u2019m certain investment commitments will factor into any potential deal, and the extension gives them more time to try and work through some of the longstanding trade concerns,\u201d he said.\nFor now, fresh US tariffs on Chinese goods this year stand at 30 percent, while Beijing\u2019s corresponding levy on US products is at 10 percent.\nSince returning to the presidency in January, Trump has slapped a 10-percent \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff on almost all trading partners, aimed at addressing trade practices Washington deemed unfair.\nMarkets are relatively flat on the news of extension. The Nasdaq is down by 0.07 percent, the S&P 500 is down 0.08 percent. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by about 0.4 percent at 3:30pm in New York (19:30 GMT)."

The species, which prefers still water with high levels of animal plankton, such as that in ports and canals, has caused similar problems before in ports and at nuclear plants in China, Japan, and India.\nEDF said it did not know the species of jellyfish involved in the shutdown, but this is not the first time jellyfish have shut down a nuclear facility, though such incidents were \u201cquite rare\u201d \u2013 the last effect on EDF operations was in the 1990s.\nThere have been cases of plants in other countries shutting down due to jellyfish invasions, notably a three-day closure in Sweden in 2013 and a 1999 incident in Japan that caused a major drop in power output.\nExperts say overfishing, plastic pollution and climate change have created conditions for jellyfish to thrive and reproduce.\nEDF said there was no risk of a power shortage due to the shutdown, saying other energy sources, including solar power, were operational."

      "text": "Australia PM says Israel\u2019s Netanyahu \u2018in denial\u2019 over suffering in Gaza\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese reveals details of phone conversation with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said that Israel\u2019s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, is \u201cin denial\u201d about the suffering inflicted on Gaza, and the international community is now saying, \u201cEnough is enough\u201d.\nA day after announcing that Australia will recognise Palestinian statehood at the United Nations next month, Albanese said that frustration with the Israeli government amid the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza had contributed to Australia\u2019s decision to recognise a Palestinian state.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 4 itemsMajority seek end to Israel weapons sales: Survey spanning three continents\nMicrosoft cloud used in Israeli mass surveillance of Palestinians: Report\nNorway wealth fund divests from several Israeli companies due to Gaza war\n\u201c[Netanyahu] again reiterated to me what he has said publicly as well, which is to be in denial about the consequences that are occurring for innocent people,\u201d Albanese said in an interview with state broadcaster ABC on Tuesday.\nAlbanese said he spoke with Netanyahu last week to inform him of Australia\u2019s decision to join France, Canada and the United Kingdom in recognising a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly meeting in September.\nNetanyahu, he said, continued to make the same arguments he made last year regarding the conduct of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, which has now killed more than 61,500 Palestinians since October 2023.\n\u201cThat if we just have more military action in Gaza, somehow that will produce a different outcome,\u201d Albanese said, recounting his call with the Israeli leader, according to ABC News.\nAnnouncing Australia\u2019s decision to recognise Palestinian statehood on Monday, Albanese said that \u201cthe risk of trying is nothing compared to the danger of letting this moment pass us by\u201d.\n\u201cThe toll of the status quo is growing by the day, and it could be measured in innocent lives,\u201d Albanese said, adding the decision was made as part of a \u201ccoordinated global effort\u201d on the two-state solution, which he had discussed with the leaders of the UK, France, New Zealand and Japan.\n\u2014 Anthony Albanese (@AlboMP) August 11, 2025\n\u201cA two-state solution is humanity\u2019s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt seems to me very clearly\u2026 we need a political solution, not a military one,\u201d he said.\nAlbanese had said just last month that he would not be drawn on a timeline for recognition of a Palestinian state, and has previously been wary of a public opinion backlash in Australia, which has significant Jewish and Muslim minorities.\nBut the public mood has shifted sharply in Australia against Israel\u2019s war on Gaza.\nTens of thousands of demonstrators marched across Sydney\u2019s Harbour Bridge this month, calling for aid deliveries to be allowed to enter Gaza as the humanitarian crisis worsens and Israel\u2019s military continues to block relief efforts.\nIsrael also plans to take military control of Gaza City, risking the lives of more than a million Palestinians and instigating what a senior UN official said would be \u201canother calamity\u201d, as deaths from starvation and malnutrition continue to grow across the enclave.\n\u201cThis decision is driven by popular sentiment in Australia, which has shifted in recent months, with a majority of Australians wanting to see an imminent end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza,\u201d Jessica Genauer, a senior lecturer in international relations at Flinders University, told the Reuters news agency."
