  "content": "\u2022 The S&P 500 edged higher by less than 0.1% on Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025, notching its third straight record close.\n\u2022 Intel stock pushed higher, extending this week's string of gains following reports that the U.S. government could take a stake in the chipmaker.\n\nMajor U.S. equities indexes were little changed Thursday after a report showed the latest Producer Price Index, a key measure of wholesale inflation, rose more than economists expected in July.\n\nThe report raised concerns consumers could soon face steeper price increases as businesses deal with tariff-related cost pressures, and cast some doubts about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting in September.\n\nThe S&P 500 eked out a gain of less than 0.1%, securing an all-time closing high for the third straight session. The Nasdaq and the Dow finished fractionally lower.\n\nIntel (INTC) shares gained the most of any S&P 500 stock on Thursday, surging more than 7% to extend the string of gains this week following Monday's meeting between CEO Lip-Bu Tan and President Donald Trump. The stock got another boost Thursday from a report the Trump administration is in talks with Intel about potentially taking a stake in the struggling chipmaker.\n\nShares of Texas Pacific Land (TPL) climbed 3.4% after the real estate operator announced a dual listing of its stock on NYSE Texas, the recently launched, fully electronic equities exchange based in the Lone Star State. An owner of significant acreage in the oil-rich Permian Basin, Texas Pacific Land has been exploring opportunities to diversify its revenue stream beyond oil and gas royalties through projects including cryptocurrency mining and data centers.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) said it would raise prices in Europe. Separately, the drugmaker said it will partner with Superluminal Medicines on the discovery of new weight-loss treatments using Superluminal's artificial intelligence platform. Shares of the pharmaceutical giant ended 3.6% higher on Thursday.\n\nShares of Tapestry (TPR), parent company of the Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman brands, plunged over 15%, retreating from Wednesday's record-high close to log the S&P 500's weakest performance on Thursday. Although the maker of luxury handbags and other fashion accessories beat fiscal fourth-quarter sales and profit estimates, boosted by demand for Coach bags, Tapestry slashed its fiscal 2026 profit outlook, citing an anticipated $160 million negative impact from tariffs.",

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- A higher-than-expected July Producer Price Index report has economists asking whether consumers will soon see price increases as businesses struggle with higher costs.\n- Tariffs likely contributed to price increases on goods that are subject to tariffs.\n- After the wholesale inflation report was released, investors dialed back expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September.\nData on wholesale inflation is reigniting worries that price pressures from tariffs are imminent\u2014 and investors took notice.\nThe Producer Price Index rose 0.9% in July, well above the 0.2% increase economists expected on average. Core PPI, which excludes foods, energy, and trade services, rose by 0.6% over the month, the largest monthly increase in the metric since March 2022.\nAccording to last week's report on consumer prices, businesses have broadly held off on passing increased tariff costs onto consumers. But Thursday's data on wholesale inflation may indicate a change is coming.\n\u201cTariff-exposed goods are rising at a rapid clip, indicating that the willingness and ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be beginning to wane,\u201d said Matthew Martin, senior economist at Oxford Economics.\nWhat Does the PPI Report Mean for the Fed?\nThe PPI data could affect the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans for cutting interest rates.\nBefore the inflation print was released Thursday morning, traders were pricing in a 100% chance that the Fed would cut rates at its next meeting in September, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool. CME forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data.\nAfter the report was released, they pulled back from that certainty. As of noon ET on Thursday, traders thought there was more than a 9% chance that the Fed officials would hold their rates steady, as they have all year.\nFed officials are less sure that a rate cut is the right move, and this data could give them leeway to continue their \"wait-and-see\" approach.\n\u201cThis emboldens those who are less dovish on the Fed that a September cut is not a done deal,\u201d wrote BMO senior economist Jennifer Lee."

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- Fashion handbag maker Tapestry slashed its full-year forecast because of the costs on new U.S. tariffs.\n- The company lowered its fiscal 2026 earnings per share estimate as it anticipates a $160 million hit from tariffs.\n- The news offset better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, driven by demand for Coach bags.\nTapestry (TPR) shares slumped 15% Thursday after owner of fashion brands gave a weaker-than-expected outlook as it warned it would take a significant hit from new tariffs.\nThe parent of the Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman brands expects fiscal 2026 earnings per share (EPS) of $5.30 to $5.45, which includes the \"negative impact of incremental tariffs and duties of over $0.60.\" The midpoint of the range was below the $5.42 consensus projection of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha.\nThe company added that gains in operating margin would be \"offset by a negative tariff and duty impact of approximately 230 basis points,\" or $160 million.\nThe news came as Tapestry reported it set a fourth-quarter revenue record of $1.72 billion, and posted adjusted EPS of $1.04. Both exceeded estimates.\nThe gains were driven by sales of Coach, which jumped 14% year-over-year to $1.43 billion. Kate Spade sales dropped 13% to $252.6 million, and sales at Stuart Weitzman fell 10% to $45.5 million.\nShares of Tapestry closed at an all-time high yesterday, and even with today's selloff they're up nearly 50% year-to-date."

      "text": "Shares of Intel rose Monday as CEO Lip-Bu Tan visited the White House, drawing praise from President Donald Trump just days after calls for his resignation.\n\"The meeting was a very interesting one. His success and rise is an amazing story,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform. The president added that his cabinet and Tan would spend more time together and \"bring suggestions\" to him during the next week.\nIntel (INTC) in a statement said Tan and Trump had \"a candid and constructive discussion on Intel\u2019s commitment to strengthening U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership. We appreciate the President\u2019s strong leadership to advance these critical priorities and look forward to working closely with him and his Administration as we restore this great American company.\"\nIntel shares rose nearly 4% during Monday's regular session amid optimism about Tan's improving relations with Trump, the stock finishing back in the black for the year so far. The shares added nearly 3% in extended trading.\nTrump Had Said Tan 'Must Resign'\nTan, who took the helm of Intel in March, said in a letter to employees last week that \u201cthere has been a lot of misinformation circulating,\u201d adding that he looked forward to engaging with the Trump administration, after the president called for him to step down.\n\"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social last Thursday.\nThe post came after Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote a letter to Intel\u2019s board chair asking about Tan\u2019s work history and stakes in companies with reported connections to China\u2019s military. Tan was previously CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), which said it recently settled legal proceedings related to \"operations and business dealings in China.\"\nThis article has been updated since it was first published to include additional information and reflect more recent share price values."

      "text": "Inflation, or the rate of change in prices for a basket of goods and services, is one of the most anticipated indicators to gauge the overall health of an economy.\nFor investors, inflation is an extremely useful measure, since it can be used as a leading indicator to speculate on the future direction of interest rates. Typically, interest rates have a negative correlation with market returns. Learn how to predict rising or falling inflation using the producer price index (PPI), which tracks the prices that producers pay.\nKey Takeaways\n- The producer price index (PPI) measures inflation from the perspective of costs to industry or producers of products.\n- Because it measures price changes before they reach consumers, some people see it as an earlier predictor of inflation than the CPI.\n- PPI data is segmented into three main areas of classification, with the core PPI the most-watched.\nWhy Inflation Matters\nA low and stable rate of inflation is most often found in healthy growing economies with effective monetary policies.\nOn the other hand, runaway inflationary environments significantly reduce the purchasing power of individuals' savings, while deflation is indicative of an economic slowdown. Economists and policymakers work closely with central banks to coordinate optimal open market operations and monetary policy adjustments that promote a stable long-term rate of inflation.\nWhen inflation is high, central banks increase interest rates in order to restrict economic growth and the continuous demand for funds. Likewise, deflation, or periods of decreasing prices, will often force an increase in the money supply as a government attempts to stimulate the economy.\nWhat Is the Producer Price Index (PPI)?\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is often the most frequently cited measure of inflation. This metric measures the price change of a basket of goods and services from the perspective of the consumer.\nHowever, the producer price index (PPI), often overlooked, can also be utilized to assess the rate of change in prices. The PPI is a wholesale measure of inflation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the government body that collects PPI data and releases it on a monthly basis, the PPI \"measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output.\"\nThe PPI is somewhat similar to the CPI with the exception that it looks at rising prices from the perspective of the producer rather than the consumer. While the CPI looks at final prices realized by consumers, the PPI takes one step back and determines the change in output prices faced by producers. The discrepancies between the two prices are based on factors such as sales taxes and markups as products move through the various stages of the supply chain.\nFast Fact\nDespite the two measures being constructed differently, historically there has been a close correlation between changes in CPI and PPI.\nHow PPI Is Measured\nThere are three basic measures of PPI that are based on the various stages of processing, providing an index on crude, intermediate, and finished goods.\nCrude goods, measured by the PPI Commodity Index, reflect the changing costs of input materials such as iron ore, aluminum base scrap, soybeans, and wheat. The PPI stage of processing tracks the price changes of goods in the intermediary stages of production. Included in this index are products such as refined sugars, leather, paper, and basic chemicals.\nCore PPI refers to the index of finished goods and is generally what economists refer to when the producer price index is referenced. Footwear, soap, tires, and furniture are among the items included in core PPI.\nPPI can also be broken down into general categories of input and output measures that reflect the rate of change in prices for which consumers buy and sell their products, respectively.\nWhen core PPI is calculated, volatile items such as energy and food prices are excluded from the core calculation. Although these omissions reduce the overall accuracy of the index, their prices are heavily influenced by temporary supply and demand imbalances that would make the index difficult to compare on a long-term basis. Luckily, the BLS tracks the price changes for many of these missing components, so interested analysts can recalculate the index values to include food and energy inputs.\nOnce the price changes have been compared to those faced in 1982, which serves as the base year for the index (value = 100), the overall value of the PPI is calculated using a weighted average. The weights are determined by the relative importance of the components in terms of their share of total national output. For example, plastic bottles and residential lubricants have a much greater associated weight than candles or umbrellas. The cumulative weight of the thousands of items included in the \"basket\" sums up to 100%.\nIn January 2011, the BLS began experimenting with improvements to the stage-of-processing index. After initially focusing only on the price changes of intermediate processed and unprocessed goods, the analysis began to track the escalating costs of services and construction activities as well.\nWhy PPI Is Important\nInflation is probably the second-most-watched indicator after unemployment data, as it helps investors deduce the future direction of monetary policy. The core PPI can serve multiple roles in improving investment-making decisions because it can serve as a leading indicator for CPI. When producers are faced with input inflation, those rising costs are passed along to the retailers and eventually to the consumer.\nFurthermore, PPI presents the inflation picture from a different perspective than CPI. Although changes in consumer prices are important for consumers, tracking PPI allows one to determine the cause of the changes in CPI. If, for example, CPI increases at a much faster rate than PPI, such a situation could indicate that factors other than inflation may be causing retailers to increase their prices. However, if CPI and PPI increase in tandem, retailers may be simply attempting to maintain their operating margins.\nEconomists can also forecast the future movement of the finished goods index by monitoring the intermediate index, and the direction of the intermediate index can be determined by analyzing the crude index.\nImportant\nEssentially, the data obtained from monitoring the downhill indicators, those focused on raw materials, can be used to forecast the uphill core indicators.\nThe PPI of finished goods provides a sense of the expected CPI movement.\nWhen companies experience higher input costs, those costs are ultimately passed on to the subsequent buyers in the distribution network. These firms will then charge higher prices for final products that are delivered to retail locations. Although firms throughout the supply chain will typically hedge their input costs, higher prices will eventually be realized once the fixed price contracts expire.\nIs PPI a Good Indicator of Inflation?\nPPI can be a good pre-indicator of inflation, because it measures the costs to produce consumer goods. When costs rise for manufacturers and producers, retail prices tend to go up as well.\nWhat Is the Difference Between CPI and PPI?\nCPI, or consumer price index, measures the prices that consumers pay and therefore also accounts for taxes and other additional costs. PPI, on the other hand, only measures the cost to the producer, and does not include taxes or imports.\nIs PPI Usually Higher than CPI?\nYes, PPI is often higher than CPI. This is partially because the PPI measures a different \"basket\" of costs than the CPI. It's also partly due to the fact that when business's costs rise, they don't always immediately pass on that cost to the consumer. Plus, PPI mostly measures goods, while CPI measures both goods and services.\nThe Bottom Line\nBy following PPI trends, consumers and investors can avoid unexpected changes to inflation. Inflation is less dramatic than a crash, but it can be more devastating to your portfolio."
