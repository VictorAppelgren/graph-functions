Generate Key Takeaways\n\nKelly Clarkson is proving that family comes first, no matter what has happened in the past.\n\nThe 43-year-old singer revealed on an Aug. 6 Instagram post that she needed to postpone her Las Vegas residency for a very serious reason.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows, and I so appreciate your grace, kindness, and understanding.\u201d\n\nThe pop star confirmed the rumors about Blackstock\u2019s health that first surfaced in April in a report by NewsNation. She had been sporadically absent from The Kelly Clarkson Show, and the media outlet shared unconfirmed news (at the time) about her ex-husband\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cHer ex-husband is sick, and she took the kids to see him,\u201d NewsNation said on April 18.\n\nClarkson and Blackstock share two children: a daughter, River, 11, and a son, Remington, 9.\n\nBlackstock\u2019s situation is likely behind the rumors that Clarkson is looking to exit her daytime television contract after the 2025-26 season. She\u2019s thinking that she might need a shift next year when her contract is up,\u201d a source told People on July 10. \u201cShe still has time to figure out what\u2019s best for her career and family. She was never one to rush into things.\u201d\n\nThere also seems to be a desire to return to music full-time, but her commitment to The Kelly Clarkson Show doesn\u2019t allow for that. While performing at a May 9 concert in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Clarkson hinted at the conflict.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done a show in a while, y\u2019all, \u2019because I have a talk show,\u201d she told the New Jersey audience, via Page Six. \u201cIt\u2019s like a whole other job. We are bummed because we love doing shows, and it\u2019s hard to fit it in, so it\u2019s cool when it does work out with the schedule, and it\u2019s cool to get to see your faces and feed off y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nClarkson and Blackstock\u2019s divorce was contentious after they split in 2020, battling over spousal support and her Montana ranch. Still, there was a desire for the TV personality to make the co-parenting relationship work for their kids.\n\n\u201cI know with me and Brandon, it\u2019s just a difficult thing because we\u2019re in different places, and it\u2019s like, we both agree on the main things, but it\u2019s a hard thing when you\u2019re not together all the time, for me personally,\u201d she told KOST 103.5 in November 2024. \u201cAs long as you make sure it\u2019s about the children and their best interests, then we\u2019re both on board.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Clarkson is doing with her ex-husband\u2019s health battle, putting their kids\u2019 needs first.\n\nBefore you go, click here to see 19 facts about Kelly Clarkson you didn\u2019t already know.\n\u2022 None A Look Back at Martha Stewart's Incredible Life, From Her Early Modeling Career to Her Media Empire at 84\n\u2022 None Join These 10 Celebrity Book Clubs & Read Along with Your Favorite Stars\n\nSign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.

      "text": "When Kelly Clarkson fell in love with Brandon Blackstock, it was easy to be happy for her because she was a bundle of sunshine and rainbows in every interview she gave. You just wanted to bottle her sappy lovestruck moment and hope that she stayed in a bubble of joy forever.\n\u201cWe are totally going to get married,\u201d she gushed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2012. \u201cWe love each other. We are totally going to get married one day. No, he has two children and I\u2019m new\u2026 You know you want to like\u2026 I mean he\u2019s got to put it a ring at some point.\u201d Blackstock certainly did put a ring on it just weeks later and the two forged ahead with their relationship at lightning speed \u2014 marriage, baby, another baby, huge careers.\nIt\u2019s hard to say where the marriage took a wrong turn exactly, but the talk show host gave us a little insight into why the marriage went south. \u201cMy mom has been telling me since I was a kid: You are who you surround yourself with,\u201d she said on The Kelly Clarkson Show in late 2020. \u201cYou want to make sure you\u2019re surrounded by people that also want to be the best versions of themselves and also want a good common goal for everyone, not just themselves, right?\u201d\nOf course, that was all before things got really difficult with the legal aspects of their divorce with Blackstock challenging their ironclad prenuptial agreement. But if there\u2019s one thing we know, the pop star is \u201cstronger\u201d for falling in love and creating a beautiful family \u2014 and there\u2019s very little that\u2019s going to stop her even when she\u2019s down. Learn more about her relationship timeline with her ex \u2014 and the exciting things ahead for her in the future (like that stunning new estate).\n-\nThe Single Life (Pre-2012)\nBefore Kelly Clarkson met Brandon Blackstock, she kept her dating life casual. It was a series of short-lived romances that mostly stayed out of the press \u2014 from her American Idol co-star, Justin Guarini, to singers Ryan Key and Graham Colton. She did address her situation with Guarini years later on Watch What Happens Live, and it just feels like it was nothing more than a cute fling in her young adult life.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t date during Idol which, everybody thought, but we did date during\u2026 I feel like we weren\u2019t dating during [From Justin to Kelly] but I feel like maybe we did,\u201d she coyly revealed. \u201cWe did date a little bit. I think any two people who are thrown together that much would [date]. Guy, girl, just saying \u2014 \u201cTimeless,\u201d put that song on From Justin to Kelly \u2014 you can\u2019t fight it!\u201d\n-\nDating (2011 or 2012)\nKelly Clarkson didn\u2019t begin dating Brandon Blackstock for years after their first meeting in 2006 because he was married. But they stayed in each other\u2019s orbit because the American Idol star\u2019s career was managed by his father, Narvel Blackstock. Now, depending on who you talk to, they either began dating in late 2011 or early 2012 \u2014 the timeline seems to have changed over the years to coincide with Brandon\u2019s official divorce date from first wife Melissa Ashworth in 2012. The on-the-record story has them becoming reacquainted at the 2012 Super Bowl, where she sang the National Anthem, and both of them were single.\nIt was love at first sight for the duo and they became inseparable right away. Clarkson could help gushing to the world that she was in love, but the angsty songwriting went completely out the window.\n\u201cIt is killing me. I\u2019m trying to write a tough song and it is coming out like butterflies and rainbows,\u201d she told People. \u201cIt is ruining my creativity. I\u2019m writing all this happy [stuff]. People are going to be, like, \u2018What the hell happened to you?\u2019 It has been really difficult. I love it. It\u2019s an awesome problem to have.\u201d\n-\nEngagement (December 2012)\nTheir relationship was on fast forward in 2012 and Brandon Blackstock wasted no time in asking the \u201cStronger\u201d singer to be his wife. Kelly Clarkson tweeted out the cutest announcement to share the news with all of her followers.\n\u201cI\u2019M ENGAGED!!!!! I wanted y\u2019all to know!! Happiest night of my life last night! I am so lucky and am with the greatest man ever :),\u201d she wrote. She also shared a photo of her gorgeous engagement ring on WhoSay (remember that app?), \u201cIt\u2019s a yellow canary diamond with diamonds around.\u201d\n-\nWedding (2013)\nThe Clarkson-Blackstock wedding started out as a huge event with country music pal Blake Shelton officiating the wedding, but the couple put the brakes on the over-the-top affair. \u201cWe just got overwhelmed by it \u2014 all the decisions,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe sent out a save-the-date to everyone, and then it got crazy and all the details were leaking.\u201d\nTheir Plan B wedding went off without a hitch as it was just the two of them, an officiant and Blackstock\u2019s two kids from his first marriage, daughter Savannah, and son Seth. \u201cI\u2019m officially Mrs. Blackstock,\u201d she announced via Twitter. \u201cWe got married yesterday at Blackberry Farms in TN, the most beautiful place ever!\u201d She shared a video (see it here) of their beautiful fall ceremony and they looked so happy and in love.\n-\nFirst Pregnancy (November 2013)\nJust one month after their wedding, Kelly Clarkson shared the exciting news that she was expecting her first child with her new hubby. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant!!! Brandon and I are so excited! Best early Christmas present ever,\u201d she tweeted, via Celebitchy. The news came as no surprise to anyone because she had been shouting from the rooftops her wish to get pregnant before the holiday season \u2014 and having great stepkids had a lot to do with those baby urges.\n\u201cI want a little baby with little feet and I just want to bite them,\u201d she told Jay Leno on The Tonight Show, via Celebitchy. \u201cThey\u2019re so great. I never wanted kids before, but now I want, like, five.\u201d\n-\nCheating Claims (December 2013)\nBy early December, just two months after they married, the couple was plagued with cheating rumors after a tabloid website posted claims about Blackstock stepping out on his new wife. \u201c\u2018We haven\u2019t slept together, but we\u2019ve been intimate in other ways,\u201d an anonymous source told The Dirty, via the Daily Mail.\nClarkson even defended her new husband on Twitter, writing, \u201cKeep hearing random rumors of me & Brandon splitting or that\u2019s he\u2019s cheating on me. Stop with all the lying please #aintnobodygottimeforthat.\u201d Nothing concrete ever came from those rumors, so the couple continued on in their marital bliss.\n-\nGrowing Family (2014, 2016)\nClarkson\u2019s first child, daughter River Rose, was born in 2014, and son Remington Alexander followed in 2016. \u201cI sound like such a tool, but becoming a mother has made me next-level confident,\u201d The Voice star told Good Housekeeping. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt more empowered. I feel like my 20s were spent walking on eggshells making sure everyone felt loved and not really expressing my opinion.\u201d\nEven though motherhood was a dream for her, she was ready to be done with having children, so she asked (OK, demanded) Blackstock to get a vasectomy. \u201cI was literally pregnant with Remi, and I was like, \u2018You are getting fixed. This will never happen to me again,\u2019\u201d Clarkson revealed on The Jenny McCarthy Show, via People. \u201cIf something happens, it\u2019s a miracle of God. I literally told my OBGYN on the table while open, \u2018If I get pregnant again, I will find you!\u2019\u201d\n-\nSuperstardom (2018)\nKelly Clarkson has been famous since she won the inaugural season of American Idol, but her fame still hovered on the B-list in Hollywood. The game-changer for her was joining The Voice as a coach in 2018. She sat alongside Adam Levine and Alicia Keys, but it was her witty banter with Blake Shelton that had everyone in stitches. American fell in love with her all over again.\nOne year later, she launched her own daytime talk show, The Kelly Clarkson Show, which put her sparkling personality on full display (and got her a Daytime Emmy) \u2014 and suddenly she was everywhere as she shot to A-list TV stardom. But it was her time at home with her husband and kids that mattered the most to her despite her next-level fame. \u201cWe both love what we do, but we\u2019re really good about checking out whenever we make it home from work,\u201d she explained to Parade. They spend time together every night after putting their kids to bed. \u201cSometimes we\u2019ll go out or we\u2019ll just listen to music.\u201d\n-\nDivorce (June 2020)\nAfter quarantining together in Clarkson\u2019s Montana ranch (yes, she holds the deed to the property), the couple shockingly announced their divorce in June 2020 citing \u201cirreconcilable differences.\u201d But where do we begin in this messy split? Blackstock challenged their prenuptial agreement, which was held up by a judge in court, so the \u201cMiss Independent\u201d singer gets to keep the Montana ranch he had been fighting to keep. There\u2019s still the thorny legal issue involving her father-in-law, who used to manage her along with her ex, regarding entertainment commissions \u2014 and she countersued for alleged violations of California labor codes. Phew!\nYet there are still tender hearts to deal with, which Clarkson revealed on her daytime show in her interview with First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, who gave her wise advice. \u201cMy mother always said to me, \u2018Things are going to look better tomorrow,\u2019\u201d the first lady told the daytime talk show host. \u201c\u2018And if you can take one day at a time, and things will get better.\u2019\u201d\nClarkson isn\u2019t dating just yet, but we can\u2019t wait to see who might open her mind (and heart) to a relationship again.\n-\nThe Future (2021)\nAside from the final financial details to be worked out by the court, Clarkson has already been declared legally single. And she\u2019s already moving ahead with her new single, complete with shady lyrics, \u201cChristmas Isn\u2019t Canceled (Just You).\u201d She also sold their marital home in Encino and is getting a fresh start in her new Toluca Lake, California estate with their two kids. And the best part is she is leading the way with an optimistic outlook, according to a Hollywood Life source, \u201cShe has so much going on in her life that she doesn\u2019t have time to stop and dwell on things; she\u2019s always focused on the positive.\u201d\n-\nLearning to \u201cUn-Love\u201d (2022)\nIn a candid conversation with guest Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Clarkson said she was curious how the reality star learned to \u201cun-love\u201d Tristan Thompson after his multiple betrayals. Clarkson laughed, \u201cHow\u2019d you do that? Asking for a friend.\u201d\nClarkson then shared how she\u2019s felt in her post-split life. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. I think it\u2019s the most ridiculous thing sometimes when something doesn\u2019t work out and you\u2019re in a relationship and you\u2019re so deeply in love \u2014 and people are like \u2018Oh yeah, why can\u2019t you [move on],'\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cI\u2019m like, I think I might always love that person, I don\u2019t know if it goes away.\u201d\n-\nTackling Co-Parenting (2023)\nClarkson got candid about the impact that the divorce has had on their two children. \u201cI literally ask my kids every night when we\u2019re snuggling, \u2018Are you happy? And if you\u2019re not, what could make you happier?'\u201d the talk show host recounted during an episode of The Angie Martinez IRL podcast, per E! Online. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll say, especially the past two years, and it kills me and I want them to be honest, so I don\u2019t ever say, \u2018Oh god, don\u2019t tell me that,\u2019 but a lot of times it would be like, \u2018You know, I\u2019m just really sad. I wish mommy and daddy were in the same house.'\u201d\nClarkson went on to explain exactly how she handles that difficult conversation. \u201cI just sit there and I\u2019m like, \u2018I get it. I\u2019m from a divorced family as well. I get it. That sucks. But we\u2019re going to work it out. And you are so loved by both of us,'\u201d Clarkson explained. \u201cI think communicating with them and not treating them\u2014not treating them like an adult, because they\u2019re not\u2014but not treating them like a child. They\u2019re not small feelings. Those are huge feelings, and those are huge emotions.\u201d\n-\nA Telling Verse Change (2023)\nDuring her rendition of the song \u201cABCDEFU\u201d by GAYLE during her show\u2019s iconic Kellyoke segment on March 30, Clarkson gave a telling spin on the original lyrics that clearly pointed to Blackstock. \u201cF you and your dad and the fact that you got half / and my broken heart / turn that s*** into art,\u201d she sang, referencing her contentious divorce settlement.\n-\nReleasing Her Album\u2019s First Singles (2023)\nOn April 14, Clarkson released the first two singles, \u201cmine\u201d and \u201cme,\u201d from her upcoming emotional album Chemistry.\nIn \u201cmine,\u201d the lyrics suggest Clarkson sings about being heartbroken and not realizing the problems in the relationship before it was too late. \u201cYou know I question every motive, everything you say / Thought with you maybe my heart wasn\u2019t meant to break / Can\u2019t believe I let you in, I can\u2019t believe I stayed / As long as I stayed,\u201d Clarkson sings.\nIn the chorus, Clarkson wishes for some karmic retribution so that her ex one day feels the same way she does. She sings, \u201cI hope one day someone will take your heart and hold it tight / Make you feel like you\u2019re invincible deep inside / And right when you think that you\u2019ll try again, they cross a line / And steal your shine like you did mine.\u201d\nIn her second single, \u201cme,\u201d Clarkson is feeling strong and powerful while she looks back at the relationship that once was. \u201cI don\u2019t need somebody to hold me / Don\u2019t need somebody to love me / Don\u2019t need somebody to pick these pieces up / I put together my broken / Let go of the pain I\u2019v\u0435 been holdin\u2019 / Don\u2019t need to need somebody / When I got me.\u201d Talk about telling lyrics"
