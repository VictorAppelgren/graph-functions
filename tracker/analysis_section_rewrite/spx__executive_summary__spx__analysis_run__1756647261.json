      "feedback": "The draft is already concise and mostly on‑target, but it can be sharpened to meet the 4–6‑sentence, decision‑useful standard and to satisfy the citation‑and‑handle requirements. 1) Add the explicit 10–15 bp rise in ust10y (OGK8WLL69) to the second sentence so the yield‑impact link is quantified. 2) In the third sentence, state that a 4–6 % spx decline would give RSP an 10–12 % outperformance (12)(56DSYR7J6)(9CYUOM9JM) and that a 10–15 % pullback has a 10–15 % probability within 0–3 weeks (12). 3) Explicitly flag the early Fed‑cut risk (3YAQ8JUPL) and the VIX spike risk (9CYUOM9JM) as counter‑scenarios. 4) Tighten the watch list sentence to a bullet‑style list of the dated catalysts: September 2025 Fed minutes, Tesla lawsuit outcome (2025‑08‑29), tariff announcement (2025‑08‑13), Marvell earnings (2025‑08‑29), Shiller CAPE trend, and VIX levels (all with citations). 5) End each sentence with a single citation block and remove the phrase “split‑second pivot” for clarity. 6) Confirm that every sentence references at least one canonical handle (spx, ust10y, rps) with a clear sign/magnitude. This will produce a 5‑sentence, high‑signal brief that satisfies all acceptance gates.",
