  "content": "Having chosen to bat first, Superchargers found themselves pegged back by a wicket every time they seemed to be building momentum.\n\nAnnabel Sutherland looked in good touch but the Australia international - one of three in the home team - holed out off Matthews for 28 and at 89-4 from 65 balls, the innings could have gone either way.\n\nArmitage and Wareham ensured things went in the Superchargers' favour as they stayed together for the remainder of the innings.\n\nThe pair found the boundary regularly enough to keep the score moving and Wareham ended the innings with a bang, smashing a Jess Jonassen full toss into the stands.\n\nFire's chase got off to the worst possible start with Dunkley run out after setting off for a single that was never on and, when Linsey Smith bowled the dangerous Matthews, the pressure was on.\n\nBeaumont countered well, her experience shining through as she hit three sixes in an innings of controlled aggression, but a stand of 42 with Georgia Elwiss was ended by another run out.\n\nWareham removed Jonassen before Grace Ballinger struck the telling blow, having Beaumont caught at cover by Armitage to leave Fire 58-5 at the halfway stage.\n\nThere was no way back for Fire, with Superchargers bowlers targeting the stumps to great effect, taking five wickets from 19 balls that would have hit the timbers - including three bowled dismissals.\n\nDespite some late resistance from Shabnim Ismail and Katie Levick, Superchargers wrapped things up with two balls left in the match and go top of the table on net run-rate.",

In response, the Fire struggled with early run outs and lost key wickets, including a crucial dismissal of Beaumont, leading to a collapse.
