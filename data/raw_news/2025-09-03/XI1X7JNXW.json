  "content": "is apparently going to be a rather gruesome FPS compared to some of the previous Battlefield installments, as it's set to be the third game in the series to be rated for \"gore\" by the ESRB.\n\nAt the time of writing, Battlefield 6's full ESRB age rating isn't available to read, but fans have spotted that on the likes of the PlayStation and , the upcoming shooter has been given a Mature 17+ ESRB rating, specifically mentioning \"Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, [and] Strong Language.\"\n\nWhile not totally unprecedented, as pointed out by fan account , this makes Battlefield 6 only the third game in the series \u2013 after 4 and Hardline \u2013 to mention gore in its rating. It's also only the fourth game following 3, 4, and Hardline to mention \"intense violence.\"\n\nAs others have , this is \"likely for the campaign\" mode rather than EA suddenly deciding to add a whole lot more blood and grisly stuff into the multiplayer that everyone has already tried in the open beta. So, make of that what you will \u2013 the single-player mode might have a rather intense story.\n\nThere's now just over a month to wait until Battlefield 6's release, but if you were expecting it to have ray tracing at launch after it was missing from the beta, you might be disappointed. Technical director Christian Buhl has confirmed that there are \"no plans\" for ray tracing in \"the near future,\" as the devs \"wanted to focus on performance\" and \"making the game as [optimized] as possible for the default settings and the default users.\"\n\nEA and DICE tried to stop them, but Battlefield 6 players keep leaking maps and content from closed tests and Labs experiments \u2013 but at least the leaked news is good news.",

We've already seen clips of Mirak Valley, the largest at-launch map in the game, and another huge one, apparently called either Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm.\nAs reported by our friends over at PC Gamer, Mirak Valley is bringing the Battlefield 3 and 4 vibes. With its vehicles, large amounts of open space, and scattered compounds, it's got a little something for everyone.\nBlackwell is another huge map, and this apparent leak comes from an account that's already given us a glimpse at an alleged battle royale map and new gadgets and customization options coming to Battlefield 6.\nThe Blackwell map is huge, and, as reported by Insider Gaming, it is supposedly coming in Battlefield 6's Season One. The leaker claims it's set in Kern County, California.\nThe video has already been removed due to a \"copyright request,\" but it showed oil rigs, an airstrip, and a large amount of open, rocky terrain, making it perfect for snipers and aircraft. Tanks and other ground vehicles will struggle to navigate some of these areas.\nThere are even lush hills and a small village, so you'll get a mix of wide, open battles and close-quarters combat as you fight between buildings. This is great news for Battlefield fans who were unhappy with the beta's small maps.\nOne player on Reddit writes, \"Seems pretty damn big with some enclosed objective areas (like the small town and base). Should be fun for some combined warfare goodness.\"\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nBattlefield 6 is only a month away, launching October 10, so we won't have to wait for much longer.

A press release is more revealing of what's already confirmed to be in the actual Battlefield 6 game: \"Battlefield 6 will launch with a robust package of multiplayer modes and maps, taking the fight around the world from Egypt, to Gibraltar and the streets of New York,\" it explains. \"Fan favorite multiplayer modes return in Battlefield 6, with classic staples making an appearance, including Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush.\n\"Players will also experience a host of fast-paced and intense first-person shooter staples, including Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, Domination and King of the Hill. While a brand new mode called Escalation sees two teams fight to capture strategic control points.\"\nThe press release doesn't mention \"battle royale\" by name, and it doesn't reference the battle royale mode in 2018's Battlefield 5, Firestorm, either.

      "text": "Battlefield 6 campaign trailer goes all-in on the destruction the series was once known for: \"Blow through walls and bring down buildings for a tactical advantage\"\nIs Levolution finally back?\nThe first major stop on the Battlefield 6 promotional tour has arrived, and with it, our first look at the FPS title's campaign. Sure, there are plot teasers in here, but the exciting bit is just how many crumbling buildings and exploding environments we see falling apart over the course of the two minutes of footage.\nThe trailer, which you can see below, makes a real point of lingering on scenes of environmental destruction. We see a helicopter crash into an apartment, a collapsing bridge, and even an entire city street falling apart. Another sequence shows a tank blowing apart a building where some soldiers are taking cover. Yet another shows a damn coming down. Yet another sees an entire building get blasted apart.\nThere are too many instances of environmental chaos to count, and while these might all be scripted campaign sequences, it's clear that EA is making a point of putting that destruction front and center. As the publisher promises in a press release, you'll be able to \"blow through walls and bring down buildings for a tactical advantage.\"\nDestructible environments were once a hallmark of the Battlefield series, but that feature has been severely deemphasized in recent entries. Showing this much of it here certainly seems to be a bit of a mission statement, and a message to lapsed fans that this sequel aims to get back to what made the series so beloved in the first place.\nBut we'll see what this all means for the game itself on July 31. That's when the devs are hosting a big multiplayer reveal event, showing the first public look at gameplay. While we don't have official launch or pre-order details, the Battlefield 6 release date seemingly leaked yesterday, and it appears we're looking at an October 10 launch.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

While the wildly popular beta was ongoing, the option was not present, and not only will that still be the case at launch, but it sounds like ray tracing might not ever come to the FPS.\nSpeaking to ComicBook, Christian Buhl, technical director at Ripple Effect (one of the teams that makes up Battlefield Studios) confirms that ray tracing won't be one of the touted 600-plus options available to players on PC (it won't be on consoles either, but you don't get that many options). \"No, we are not going to have ray tracing when the game launches and we don't have any plans in the near future for it either\" Buhl explains.\n\"We wanted to focus on performance.\" Buhl adds, saying this was done \"to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as [optimized] as possible for the default settings and the default users. So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we just weren't going to do ray tracing and again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance [sic] for everyone else\"\nPersonally, I love ray tracing when done right, but there's a ton of games where I don't even notice that it's there. And for a fast-paced multiplayer shooter like Battlefield 6 where there are particles and explosions everywhere, I really can't say I'd be happy to sacrifice performance for better lighting, although it would've been nice as an option in the game's campaign.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nScott has been freelancing for over three years across a number of different gaming publications, first appearing on GamesRadar+ in 2024.

The footage is obviously rough around the edges - textures are unfinished and there isn't any sound, so do your best pew pew impression for extra immersion.\nIt's worth noting that there's no guarantee this Tajikistan mission makes it into the final game at all; it's just a video file for now, and like any work-in-progress leak, it's subject to change. In a follow-up comment, however, the dataminer also says, \"it looks like we\u2019ll be getting a prologue and eight missions set in various locations - including Egypt, Tajikistan, the USA, and Gibraltar.\"\nThat's not all, though. A battle royale mode might also be incoming, which wouldn't be too outlandish considering Battlefield 5 and Battlefield 2048's short-lived swings at the subgenre.\nOver on Reddit, temporyal claims they've dug deep enough to find details on Battlefield 6's battle royale mode, too. \"Drop into the combat zone and prepare for hostile contact,\" the Labs' files reportedly read. \"Loot weapons, gadgets, and call-ins for tactical advantage. Complete missions, secure intel, and custom weapon drops, and stay ahead of the collapsing NXC flamefront. Be the last squad standing to win.\"\nThe whole mode apparently revolves around missions you can take up, netting you with rewards, such as weapons drops, vehicles, or \"field upgrades,\" which sound like boons for your class's traits. The most exciting (alleged) feature in my mind is a new 'Oversight' system that allows dead players to stay in the action with drones, remote cameras, and other gadgets. Here's hoping Battlefield 6's battle royale mode lives slightly longer than its predecessors, if it even makes it into the final game to begin with.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAnother Battlefield 6 leak showed some sick-looking tank-on-tank action.\nBattlefield 6 doesn't have a release date yet, so why not check out some other new games of 2025 and beyond.\nKaan freelances for various websites including Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and this one, Gamesradar.
