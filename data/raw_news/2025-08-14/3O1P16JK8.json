  "description": "Democratic mayoral hopeful, Zohran Mamdani, responded to criticism about his proposed city-run grocery stores, which are part of his affordability-focused campaign platform.",
  "content": "New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said it will be possible for a \"partnership\" between the city and grocery store and bodega owners, despite his plan to open five city-run grocery stores if elected mayor this November.\"What do you say to the grocery-store owners who are concerned that this could create a ricochet effect, if there are more and more city-owned grocery stores in the city?\" Fox News Digital asked Mamdani at an anti-Trump event in the Bronx on Thursday afternoon. \"I am interested in working with each and every New Yorker, and I've actually spoken with a number of grocery store owners and made clear to them that I both recognize and I appreciate the work that they have done. The fact is that they are a critical part of our communities,\" Mamdani replied. Mamdani told Fox News Digital that a majority of grocery stores in New York City are family-owned, as he expressed gratitude to those families for investing in New York City, particularly in the 1970s, when he said large retailers left, but these small-business owners stayed because \"they believed in this city.\"SOCIALIST MAMDANI'S SUPERMARKET PLAN WOULD BE 'BULLET TO THE HEART' OF BLUE-COLLAR AMERICA, LAWMAKER WARNS\"There's so much partnership that we can still offer those same stores in assisting them on the skyrocketing rents that they are facing, the questions of insurance, so much of that which creates instability in their business model, while also ensuring we're using every tool at our disposal to create a more affordable city for New Yorkers,\" Mamdani said. NYC OFFICIAL WARNS BUSINESSES WILL FLEE 'IN DROVES' IF DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST CANDIDATE WINS MAYORAL RACELike many of his progressive policies, Mamdani's plan to open city-run grocery stores if elected mayor of New York City has raised some eyebrows about its feasibility. But Mamdani explained on Thursday, \"It's not in opposition to grocery store owners or bodega owners. This is something that can together be actually used to increase competitiveness, as we've seen public options do so in the past.\"Like former President Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential election, Mamdani has made affordability the central theme of his campaign. One way Mamdani is seeking to lower prices for New Yorkers is by opening one city-owned grocery store in each of the five boroughs. \"As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers,\" according to Mamdani's campaign website. The Mamdani campaign said the city-run grocery stores will \"buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing.\"The 33-year-old mayoral hopeful said it's time to redirect public money to create a real \"public option.\"Mamdani told Fox News Digital on Thursday that his plan \"is part of a vision of a public option for produce, an understanding that for far too many New Yorkers, groceries are out of reach, and the importance in city government of reasonable policy experimentation.\"He said New Yorkers deserve the same access to produce as they do \"fast food restaurants just around the corner.\"Economists and Wall Street executives sounded the alarm on Mamdani's plan in interviews with Fox News Digital soon after his Democratic primary victory. John Catsimatidis, owner of the Gristedes supermarket chain, has largely criticized Mamdani's city-run grocery store idea, arguing it would \"hurt New York.\"\"If the city of New York is going socialist, I will definitely close, or sell, or move or franchise the Gristedes locations,\" Catsimatidis told Fox Business in an interview in June. And Rep. Michael Rulli, R-Ohio \u2013 whose family owns and operates Rulli Brothers, a small chain of two grocery stores in the Youngstown, Ohio, area \u2013 echoed Catsimatidis' concern in an interview with Fox News Digital last month. \"This will be a bullet into the heart of the U.S. grocery industry, if this caught on,\" Rulli said. Fox News Digital's Amanda Macias and Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Mamdani\u2019s public grocery stores may have devastating effects on city's food supply\nEconomists and Wall Street executives sound alarm over Mamdani's socialist agenda that includes $60M taxpayer-funded grocery stores\nEconomists and business leaders are sounding alarms over New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s plan to roll out city-owned grocery stores that he says will lower food costs.\n\"You don\u2019t lower grocery bills by having government-run stores,\" Ryan Bourne, a top economist at the libertarian leaning Cato Institute think tank, told Fox Business. \"Government-run entities have no market discipline \u2014 no need to earn profits, compete, or serve customers efficiently. That leads to bloated costs, empty shelves, and zero accountability.\"\nBourne called Mamdani's city-run grocery stores \"the height of political hubris\" by failing to acknowledge that grocers operate in competitive arenas and on razor-thin profit margins.\nEJ ANTONI WARNS NYC OF MAMDANI'S 'ECONOMICALLY ILLITERATE' POLICIES\n\"If we just do the simple math here, there's no way you can sell these products at lower prices and still make money,\" said E.J. Antoni, chief economist at the conservative leaning Heritage Foundation think tank.\n\"The other problem is that if he (Mamdani) is selling things substantially less than the private market, who is going to want to go to the private market? Everyone is going to want to go to these grocery stores,\" Antoni told Fox Business, adding that the city-run grocery stores have the potential to exacerbate food shortages in New York City.\nMamdani, the underdog winner of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary, has placed affordability at the forefront of his campaign to helm America\u2019s largest city.\nThe 33-year-old says the public grocery stores will be exempt from paying rent or property taxes, a move aimed at lowering overhead costs. Other efforts to pass on savings to shoppers include buying at wholesale prices, partnerships with local farms on product sourcing and centralizing warehouses and supply chain distribution.\nWASHINGTON POST BASHES SOCIALIST ZOHRAN MAMDANI AS POTENTIAL DISASTER FOR NEW YORK CITY\nThe socialist upstart says it will cost a total of $60 million to launch one grocery store in each of New York City\u2019s five boroughs. Mamdani has previously said he will redirect some of the $140 million in private grocery store tax breaks to finance the pilot program.\n\"If the government is going to make it impossible for the private market to compete, then the private market will stop competing. If you make it unprofitable for a grocer to do business in Manhattan, then people like John Catsimatidis are going to pull the plug,\" Antoni said, referencing the billionaire supermarket magnate.\nIn an interview with Fox Business, Catsimatidis said retail food was the toughest company in his Red Apple Group portfolio, which also includes real estate, energy and insurance assets.\n\"If the city of New York is going socialist, I will definitely close, or sell, or move or franchise the Gristedes locations,\" he said. Catsimatidis, a high-profile political donor in conservative circles, operates more than 15 Gristedes and nearly a dozen D'Agostino grocery stores in Manhattan.\n\"It\u2019s going to hurt New York,\" Catsimatidis said of Mamdani's economic agenda should he win the November general election. He added that he is considering moving his corporate offices to New Jersey if that happens.\nBILLIONAIRE CEO WARNS HE'LL CLOSE GROCERY STORES IN NEW YORK IF ZOHRAN MAMDANI ELECTED MAYOR\nWhat's more, Wall Street executives have emerged as some of the loudest critics of Mamdani\u2019s economic agenda, which also includes free buses and rent freezes for residents in rent-stabilized units.\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman pledged to finance an alternative candidate to Mamdani, should one emerge. He also warned that Mamdani's financial plan would \"destroy jobs and cause businesses and wealthy taxpayers\" to leave New York.\n\"Socialism has no place in the economic capital of our country,\" the Pershing Square chief wrote in a post on X.\n\"We have two choices, which is to support Mamdani and try to get on his good side, or try to see if we can resurrect Eric,\" Jeff Gural, chair of GFP Real Estate, told Bloomberg, referring to New York City's current mayor.\nGural, who has donated to Andrew Cuomo\u2019s PAC, added that he would \"certainly\" prefer Adams over Mamdani.\nDan Loeb, the hedge fund founder of Third Point, wrote following Mamdani's win on X that it was \"officially hot commie summer.\" Loeb has previously donated to super PACs supporting Adams and Cuomo.\nCITY-RUN GROCERY STORES, DEFUNDING POLICE: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT NYC'S NEXT POTENTIAL MAYOR\n\"As the weeks go on, Mamdani's going to be ripped to pieces,\" FOX Business' Larry Kudlow said Friday.\n\"Before it's over, a lot of the younger people will realize that he will financially bankrupt us, and they'll lose their jobs, and I think he'll lose them too,\" added Kudlow, who served as White House economic advisor during President Donald Trump's first year.\nThe three-term assembly member says the city-run grocery stores will not only address rising food prices, but food deserts.\nMamdani, whose district includes the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing project in North America, says residents there have called for low-cost grocery options.\n\"What I hear from so many of my constituents there is, \u2018Why is it that there are five or six fast food restaurants in a five-block radius, but I can\u2019t find anywhere where I can actually afford to buy groceries?\u2019\" he said in an interview with Bon App\u00e9tit.\n\"What this network of municipally-owned grocery stores would provide is a guarantee of cheaper groceries and a recognition that food is a non-negotiable for New Yorkers,\" he added.\nCLICK HERE TO GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson proposed opening a city-run grocery store in 2023 to deal with food insecurity in the Windy City. His administration sidelined the project but recently announced a city-run public food market as an alternative, according to the Chicago Tribune. Meanwhile, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens is set to open the city\u2019s first municipally subsidized grocery store in 2026.\n\"Cooperative grocery stores are a feature of many American communities; they provide competition to for-profit groceries and this helps to lower costs for everyone,\" James Galbraith, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin, told Fox Business. \"Mr. Mamdani's proposal seems comparable; obviously it resonated with New York voters on Tuesday.\"\nMamdani\u2019s campaign did not respond to Fox Business' request for comment.\nJudge Glock, the director of research and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox Business that Mamdani could expand food stamps or the SNAP program in order to address \"concerns about the unaffordability of food for some families.\"\n\"But running a grocery store is a famously low-margin business for which the city could not realistically find any excess profit to squeeze,\" Glock added."

Born in Uganda and raised in South Africa, Mamdani moved to New York City at age 7. A Muslim, he transitioned from making rap music to pursuing a career in politics and is married to Rama Duwaji.\nHis father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a Columbia University professor affiliated with an organization that supports boycotts of Israel. Zohran Mamdani co-founded Students for Justice in Palestine at Bowdoin College, where he wrote articles advocating for an academic boycott of Israel.\nDespite controversy surrounding his Columbia University application and SAT scores, Mamdani is running on a progressive platform that includes a citywide rent freeze, taxpayer-funded childcare and \u201cfast and free\u201d public buses. He also pledges to address gun violence, hate crimes and homelessness.\nAs part of his housing policy, Mamdani proposes allowing the city to take control of properties from negligent landlords. His broader economic agenda includes raising the minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030, redirecting tax funds to open city-owned grocery stores and expanding hate violence prevention funding by 800%. His campaign aims to build a more equitable New York City."

      "text": "Mayor Eric Adams, chief among Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani's detractors, quickly undercut Mamdani's ambitious policy agenda after the socialist declared victory in New York City's mayoral primary last Tuesday, arguing Mamdani does not have authority to deliver key campaign promises as mayor.\n\"He\u2019s a snake-oil salesman,\" Adams said of Mamdani on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"He would say and do anything to get elected.\"\nThe 33-year-old democratic socialist, who was born in Uganda and would be New York City's first Muslim mayor if elected this November, has a laundry list of radical campaign promises readily available on his website. Those promises include freezing the rent, city-owned grocery stores, free buses, free childcare, raising corporate taxes and increasing the minimum wage.\nMamdani triggered a political earthquake with his decisive Democratic primary win last week as Republicans and moderate Democrats criticized his socialist policies and accused him of being antisemitic. His opponents have claimed that Mamdani does not have the authority to deliver many of his campaign promises. The reality is a little more complicated.\nFreeze the rent\n\"As Mayor, Zohran will immediately freeze the rent for all stabilized tenants, and use every available resource to build the housing New Yorkers need and bring down the rent,\" according to Mamdani's campaign website.\nMamdani has accused Adams of appointing Rent Guidelines Board members to raise rents on stabilized apartments. While landlords and advocates argue the freeze would be illegal, Mamdani can accomplish this goal by appointing members to the board who wouldn't vote to increase the rent.\nFormer Mayor Bill de Blasio's board voted to freeze the rent three times during his tenure.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the primary to Mamadani, called the socialist's plan to freeze rent \"politically convenient posture,\" and said such a move would hurt landlords who would be \"unable to maintain their buildings.\"\nCity-owned grocery stores\nMamdani has committed to creating a \"network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit.\"\n\"Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing,\" Mamdani has promised.\nThe mayor of New York City has control over city-run programs, so he can accomplish this goal by securing New York City Council approval. Other cities have implemented similar programs.\nJohn Catsimatidis, Owner of Gristedes and D\u2019Agostino\u2019s, the largest independent supermarket chain in New York City, held a rally this week protesting Mamdani's proposal, calling it a \"direct threat to the jobs, dignity, and livelihoods of the tens of thousands of hardworking New Yorkers who keep our city fed every single day.\"\nFree buses\nMamdani has vowed to \"permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus \u2014 and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue-jump signals, and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way.\"\nThis proposal would require coordination with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). MTA is a state-run agency, which the mayor of New York City does not have direct control over.\nAccording to City & State New York, Mamdani's free bus fare promise would require an additional expense, possibly more than $700 million. It's unclear how Mamdani plans to pay for the additional fee.\nFree childcare\n\"Zohran will implement free childcare for every New Yorker aged 6 weeks to 5 years, ensuring high quality programming for all families,\" according to Mamdani's campaign website.\nThis would likely require a series of steps, including sign-off from state legislators in Albany, as reported by Bloomberg. Mamdani has floated a tax increase on the wealthiest New Yorkers and corporations to pay for the increased services, which would require state-level approval.\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul has vocalized her opposition to tax hikes, which could create some hurdles for Mamdani. However, Hochul pushed for an increase in the state's child tax credit earlier this year, and she has nearly doubled funding for state-subsidized child care programs to about $2 million, according to The New York Times.\nTaxing corporations & the 1%\nMamdani said he will fund his programs through a \"revenue plan\" that would \"raise the corporate tax rate to match New Jersey\u2019s 11.5%, bringing in $5 billion. And he will tax the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers \u2014 those earning above $1 million annually \u2014 a flat 2% tax.\"\nWhile Mamdani has certainly done the math, a plan like this requires approval from the state legislature and the signature of the governor.\nAs Hochul doubles down on her opposition to tax hikes, Mamdani could face some roadblocks in delivering this marquee campaign promise, as reported in The New York Times.\nRaising the minimum wage to $30 by 2030\n\"As Mayor, Zohran will champion a new local law bringing the NYC wage floor up to $30/hour by 2030. After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases,\" Mamdani claims on his campaign website.\nIt's unclear if the mayor has that power.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBy allowing the City Council to create its own minimum wage law, Mamdani has proposed a way to raise the minimum wage in New York City without the state's approval.\nBut a state-level increase is unlikely, since a similar effort by the state legislature to raise the minimum wage statewide to $21.25 failed to garner much support, as reported by The New York Times.\nBill Ackman, the billionaire founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, said on X, \"His policies would be disastrous for NYC. Socialism has no place in the economic capital of our country.\"\nMamdani did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nFox News' Remy Numa contributed to this report."

      "text": "New York City democratic socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing harsh criticism from business owners and local officials in the Big Apple, some of whom warn his progressive platform could drive companies and the middle class out of the city.\nCouncilwoman Vickie Paladino sounded the alarm during an appearance on \"America Reports\" Friday, claiming Mamdani\u2019s proposals would cripple the city\u2019s economy and send businesses packing.\n\"We will lose businesses in droves,\" Paladino argued. \"You got NASDAQ, you got Wall Street. They could work anywhere. They could work in Jersey, they could work in Connecticut. They don't need to be in Lower Manhattan.\"\nPaladino, a Republican representing parts of Queens, argued that Mamdani\u2019s democratic socialist agenda would send businesses fleeing to states with lower costs, such as neighboring New Jersey.\nOne of Mamdani\u2019s most controversial proposals is a plan to launch government-run grocery stores in underserved neighborhoods. The 33-year-old state assemblyman, also from Queens, says the program would aim to combat food insecurity and bring down grocery prices.\n\"As mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit,\" his campaign website states.\n\"Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers.\"\nLIZ PEEK: NEW YORK'S SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE IS JUST BEGINNING BUT THERE'S STILL A WAY OUT\nSupporters of Mamdani\u2019s proposal, often younger, more progressive Democrats, have pointed to the rising cost of groceries in the city. A study by SmartAsset, a financial advisory website, found that grocery prices in the New York metropolitan area increased by 3.3% between March 2024 and March 2025.\nThis rise was among the highest in the nation, surpassed only by cities such as Honolulu, parts of Florida, and areas near San Diego, California.\nBut not everyone is convinced this type of program could work in the nation\u2019s largest city. Gristedes Supermarkets CEO John Catsimatidis compared the plan to failed systems in communist regimes and threatened to close stores if Mamdani is elected.\n\"You\u2019re going to end up like Havana,\" Catsimatidis told \"America Reports\" on Thursday.\n\"I was there in Havana with Fidel Castro. The shelves were empty. He promised the world to the people. He says, \u2018Get rid of Batista, and things will be great.\u2019 Well, it was all one big lie.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the Mamdani campaign for comment on both criticisms.\nPaladino had similar concerns. She noted that New York has long been a refuge for immigrants fleeing communism and warned that Mamdani\u2019s platform could potentially hurt the Middle Class, especially if small businesses are pushed out.\n\"We lose small business, we lose it all,\" she said. \"We're [going to] lose middle-class people.\"\nThe concerns over Mamdani\u2019s views are something Paladino argues has been brewing in the Democratic Party for some time, starting in schools.\n\"They have been training and indoctrinating,\" she said. \"Now the chickens have come home to roost, and guess what? The Democratic Party cannot control them.\"\nDAVID MARCUS: DEMOCRAT BUS HEADING OFF THE CLIFF, AS NYC SOCIALISTS HIT GAS PEDAL\nMamdani\u2019s broader platform includes eliminating subway fares, offering free municipal housing and childcare, and ending all Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the city. He defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month in a stunning primary victory and secured the Democratic nomination.\nIn November\u2019s general election, Mamdani could face Republican Curtis Sliwa, incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, and Cuomo, who remains on the ballot as an independent."

      "text": "A House Republican who's had experience with his own family grocery store chain is criticizing New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's call for government-owned markets.\n\"This will be a bullet into the heart of the U.S. grocery industry, if this caught on,\" Rep. Michael Rulli, R-Ohio, told Fox News Digital in an interview.\nMamdani, a self-declared democratic socialist, has proposed a pilot program of five government-owned grocery stores \u2013 one in each New York City borough \u2013 in a bid to reduce food insecurity in underserved areas and bring down grocery costs.\nCOMER DISMISSES BIDEN DOCTOR'S BID FOR PAUSE IN COVER-UP PROBE: 'THROWING OUT EVERY EXCUSE'\nBut skeptics like Rulli note that grocery stores already operate on razor-thin profit margins, generally between 1% and 3%.\nHis family owns and operates Rulli Brothers, a small chain of two grocery stores in the Youngstown, Ohio, area.\n\"My brothers run that store, our family store\u2026they have gone between [1.25%] and 1.7 net in the last five to six years,\" Rulli said.\nAnd while the pilot program only calls for five stores now, the Ohio Republican argued the idea could affect businesses both large and small if widened.\n\"Say you're going to Cleveland, Ohio. And the mayor opens up ten government-run stores, half the cost of all the other different stores,\" Rulli posed.\n\"Whether it's a mom-and-pop or\u2026a Kroger, or you can have a Harris Teeter, all these different players \u2013 all of them would go out of business, and you'd only have the government-run business. So once you have only government-run business, there's no incentive for there to be creativity, competition, variety.\"\nHe said costs could eventually go up as well if competition was muted. And Rulli argued that would affect working-class Americans the most with a loss of affordable variety, as well as the small corner stores in New York City colloquially known as \"bodegas.\"\nRulli referenced a famous photo of former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin making an unscheduled stop at a Texas grocery store while in the U.S. and marveling at the selection of products.\n\"You have the options on different size, amounts\u2026There's so many different things. And you're going to have 15 or 20 kinds of varieties. That makes for a good quality of life,\" Rulli said.\nThen, directed at Mamdani, he said, \"You want to limit the amount of things that they could buy at the grocery store? One of the few things that the blue-collar American, the populist American, can actually take comfort in is the variety of [items] at the grocery store.\"\nMamdani is a 33-year-old member of the New York State Assembly whose success in the New York City Democratic primary stunned politicos who expected at least an initially strong showing by former Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\nHis far-left ideas and support from national-level Democrat firebrands like Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have made Mamdani an effective boogeyman for Republicans.\nFAR-LEFT FIREBRAND SAYS SHE 'NEVER HAD A CONCERN' ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL STATE AS HOUSE PROBE HEATS UP\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSeveral Republicans from the Empire State told Fox News Digital last month that Mamdani winning the race in November could be politically beneficial for the GOP, though they also maintained that they would work against that outcome.\nMamdani is running against Republican Curtis Sliwa and current Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who is running as an independent candidate in the race.\nCuomo is rumored to be eyeing his own bid as an independent as well.\nFox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's campaign for a response to Rulli."

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House.

In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump.

  "argos_summary": "New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has proposed opening five city-run grocery stores to combat food insecurity and lower grocery prices, emphasizing a partnership with local store owners. Critics, including business leaders and economists, argue that government-run stores could harm the private grocery sector and lead to food shortages due to the low profit margins in the industry. Mamdani's progressive platform also includes other ambitious proposals like rent freezes and free public transportation, which have sparked significant debate about their feasibility and potential economic impact.",
