  "content": "Federal law gives presidents the power to take over Washington\u2019s police force after declaring an emergency, but Donald Trump is the first president to do so.\n\nFor D.C., Threats of a Federal Takeover Were Familiar. Now They Are a Reality.\n\nFederal law gives presidents the power to take over Washington\u2019s police force after declaring an emergency, but Donald Trump is the first president to do so.\n\nFor D.C., Threats of a Federal Takeover Were Familiar. Now They Are a Reality.\n\nMuriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, D.C., was born just a year before the city\u2019s residents were given the right to elect their mayor. In the five decades since, Washington has wrestled with challenges common to many U.S. cities, like violent crime. It has also faced challenges that, given its peculiar status under federal law, it shares with no other American city. But even in Washington\u2019s unique history, there was no episode quite like the one that Ms. Bowser, in her third term as mayor, had to confront on Monday afternoon. \u201cWe know that access to our democracy is tenuous,\u201d the mayor said to reporters just hours after the city\u2019s most prominent resident, President Trump, announced that the federal government was going to take over the local police department and deploy the National Guard to the streets of Washington. \u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cI can\u2019t say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised.\u201d Indeed, Mr. Trump has not been shy about his feelings toward the nation\u2019s capital, calling it a \u201cfilthy and crime-ridden embarrassment\u201d and \u201ca rat-infested, graffiti-infested shithole.\u201d\n\nKey roles in the city\u2019s criminal justice system are in federal hands, with the president nominating judges and the U.S. attorney, who serves as the city\u2019s chief prosecutor in most criminal cases. Laws passed by the District of Columbia Council are subject to congressional approval, and budgets are at the mercy of congressional whim. Elsewhere, a state\u2019s governor typically deploys the National Guard. In Washington, however, forces can be deployed on city streets without the local government\u2019s say-so. And with the declaration of an emergency, a president can come in and, temporarily at least, take over the local police. Until Monday morning, no president had. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this because he can,\u201d said Charles Allen, a member of the Council who represents the Capitol Hill neighborhood. \u201cHe has the ability to place the military on our streets. He has the ability to take over our police.\u201d\n\nIn many American cities, the rate of violent crime rose sharply during the coronavirus pandemic and fell in the years afterward, now returning to pre-Covid levels. Washington\u2019s crime spike lasted longer than that of many cities, but over the past 18 months violent crime there has fallen considerably. The murder rate has declined to 2019 levels, and in January, before Mr. Trump took office, the U.S. Justice Department announced that violent crime had fallen to a 30-year low. This was not the city that the president described on Monday, one of \u201ccrime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor\u201d that was in need of \u201cliberation.\u201d In her comments on Monday afternoon, Ms. Bowser said that though she believed the president had a mistaken view of the crime situation, she was still committed to bringing down crime in her city.\n\nIn March, she ordered the removal of the Black Lives Matter mural that was painted on a city street five years earlier as a pointed message to Mr. Trump, who was in his first term as president. Afterward, Ms. Bowser was candid about how she saw her mission in his second term. Washington residents, she said, \u201cwant us to be smart and strategic and get to the other side.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s my job: I\u2019m going to navigate us to the other side,\u201d she added. Some insisted that this approach was the only way that Washington would make it through a perilous era, with a president who has been an unsparing critic of the city and a Congress eager to follow his lead. But some on the Council have not taken a pragmatic approach, said Chuck Thies, a veteran political consultant, who said the city was now paying dearly for that. \u201cThey should have read the room,\u201d he said, arguing that certain members of the Council had been shortsighted in their refusal to \u201cthrow Trump a bone\u201d on criminal justice. Some matters, like the lengths of sentences for juvenile offenders, were mentioned by administration officials in the news conference on Monday morning. Still, universities, law firms and big-city mayors can attest that there really is no guarantee of good graces when it comes to Mr. Trump. For many in Washington, all guarantees now seemed shaky. For example: The likelihood of a full congressional repeal of the Home Rule Act, stripping the city of what limited self-government it now enjoys, seems low given the slim Republican majority in the U.S. Senate. But some fear that the odds of a repeal are perhaps no longer as low as they were before Monday\u2019s announcement.\n\nThere have been other encroachments on the city\u2019s autonomy during 52 years of home rule. Before this week, the most significant was a financial control board, established by Congress in 1995 to steer the city out of a fiscal crisis. Marion Barry, the four-term mayor, had earned a loyal following as the defender of the city from outside forces, only to see its authority curtailed in response to his administration\u2019s mismanagement of city finances. But while the presidentially appointed members of the control board had broad authority over municipal governance for six years, with the power to approve contracts and make personnel decisions, the fiscal emergency that spurred the board\u2019s creation was clear. The emergency behind the president\u2019s declaration is harder to see, which is what troubles George Derek Musgrove, an author of \u201cChocolate City: A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation\u2019s Capital.\u201d",

      "text": "Bowser moves to formally repeal D.C.\u2019s \u2018sanctuary city\u2019 status\nFour lines of text buried deep in a 300-page budget bill reflect the changing posture of D.C. officials on immigration.\nIt was five years ago that Mayor Muriel Bowser called D.C. a \"proud sanctuary city,\" but now she\u2019s trying to scrub the designation and protections it offers some immigrants.\nAs part of her proposed budget for 2026, Bowser is pushing to repeal a 2019 law that limits how and when city agencies \u2013 notably the Department of Corrections and Metropolitan Police Department \u2013 can cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\nThe Sanctuary Values Amendment Act addressed what are known as detainer requests, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ask local law enforcement or a jail to hold someone who would otherwise be released so they can be picked up by immigration agents. The law \u2013 which was unanimously approved by the D.C. Council and signed by Bowser \u2013 prohibits agencies from honoring such detainer requests, unless a warrant or judicial order is provided, and forbids federal immigration officials from questioning people in the city\u2019s custody.\nD.C. lawmakers and supporters of the measure argued that it would promote public safety by reassuring immigrants nervous about interacting with local police that they could safely report crimes. The idea is enshrined in the law itself: \u201cThe District has a responsibility to ensure that all residents are respected and able to interact with public safety officials without fear of adverse civil immigration action,\u201d reads the council legislation. \u201cCollaborating with ICE, including by complying with detainer requests, does not promote public safety.\u201d\nSimilar \u201csanctuary city\u201d measures were enacted liberal cities and jurisdictions across the country, from Arlington County to the state of California.\nSpeaking on Thursday, Bowser said that the sanctuary-city provision may not belong in city law, but could possibly be addressed through other means like executive orders from her office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only place we found in our law that references D.C. as a sanctuary\u2026 It is a pretty specific measure that\u2019s related to how we work with ICE. It is a misnomer for the city. We are happy to work with the council to make sure that provisions that are reflected there are raised up, but we don\u2019t think having it in statute is the way to go,\" she said. \"There\u2019s some question whether it should be in the law at all, and if so, it should pinpoint the issues it addresses directly.\"\nBut Bowser\u2019s proposed repeal \u2013 four lines of text buried deep in a 300-page budget bill \u2013 also reflects her changing posture during the second Trump administration as she tries to stave off more aggressive interference in city affairs by Republicans. It could also increase criticisms that she is compromising too much of the city's practices and values in her attempt to stay on the good side of the Trump administration.\nBowser already quietly removed a city website that touted its support for immigrants months ago, a symbolic step that mirrored her decision to deconstruct Black Lives Matter Plaza, and stopped using the phrase \u201csanctuary city.\u201d But that didn\u2019t stop Republicans from coming after the District: A House committee advanced a bill that would specifically target D.C.\u2019s sanctuary law for repeal in March, and a similar bill is pending in the Senate.\n\u201cUnconscionable that our nation\u2019s capital would facilitate illegality and thwart federal law enforcement efforts,\u201d said Senator Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee) in a statement in late April. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s efforts to enforce immigration laws should not be undermined by local leadership anywhere in the United States, let alone Washington, D.C.\nTrump officials have also questioned whether D.C.'s sanctuary status should prompt Republicans to repeal the city's ability to govern itself, and this month House Republicans also took aim at the city law that allows non-citizens to vote in local elections.\nStill, Bowser has said that she was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by ICE enforcement actions at local restaurants and in neighborhoods. (Federal officials say they arrested 189 people, largely for immigration violations.) And in a letter sent to federal officials in April, she defended the city\u2019s practice of not cooperating on immigration enforcement.\n\u201cMPD has a critical job to make the District of Columbia safe for everyone,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMPD\u2019s policy for more than two decades has been to not ask individuals about immigration status. As law enforcement, MPD knows that when there are groups who hesitate to report crime to the police, they often become targets for serious crime. Allowing that to flourish makes everyone in the city less safe.\u201d\nBowser\u2019s proposed repeal of the city\u2019s sanctuary law will now be considered by the D.C. Council as it reviews her proposed budget."

      "text": "Press Release\nViolent Crime in D.C. Hits 30 Year Low\nFor Immediate Release\nU.S. Attorney's Office, District of Columbia\nWASHINGTON - Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and announced by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves. A breakdown of the data is available here.\nIn addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\n\u201cThe strategy this Office began to employ shortly after I came into this role has been to work with our law enforcement partners to focus on the drivers of violence - those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Graves. \u201cIt takes time to develop these investigations and prosecutions, but this is the fruit of that labor - a reduction in the violent crime - that D.C. is now seeing.\u201d\nA central component of this strategy has been targeting those crews who have preyed upon certain neighborhoods in our community, often operating drug trafficking networks in these neighborhoods. These proactive investigations and prosecutions have yielded immediate reductions in violence that have had lasting impact. For instance, an MPD analysis of crime trends in the area around MLK Mellon before and after a crew operating a drug market in that area was arrested revealed that there was a 66% reduction in violent crime in the area when comparing the six months prior to the arrests to the six months after the arrests. Even two years after these arrests, there was a 56% reduction in the number of homicides that occurred after the arrests when compared to the two years before.\nAnother key component of this proactive approach was implementing in April 2022, Project Safe Neighborhood - a daily review by the Office and our law enforcement partners of every firearms arrest in the District to determine, using objective criteria about the person arrested and the firearm recovered, whether the case should be charged in U.S. District Court or D.C. Superior Court. Since April 2022, the Office has accepted for prosecution in U.S. District Court more than 150 gun offenders under this initiative.\nFinally, the Office has continued to do all that it can to hold accountable those who commit violent crimes with firearms and those who illegally possess firearms. And the Office has committed to provide on a quarterly basis data related to these efforts - data that can be found here. This data reflects that in the first half of 2024, the Office was able to charge at the time of arrest more than 90% of arrests for violent crimes committed with guns and nearly 70% of gun possession arrests. The Office continues to investigate many of these arrests even if it does not charge on the day of arrest. Also in the first half of 2024, the Office obtained convictions in approximately 75% of these gun-related cases.\nThese numbers related to firearms offenses are critical and stand in stark contrast to the overall day-of-arrest charging rate for every arrest in the District of Columbia, which is a significantly less informative metric. The vast majority of arrests in the District of Columbia are for misdemeanor offenses that are often non-violent in nature. For such offenses, the Office has had a longstanding practice of giving great weight to victims\u2019 wishes about whether they want charges brought. For a variety of reasons, a substantial number of victims do not want criminal charges brought for these relatively minor offenses.\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Office expanded into a new section the number of prosecutors devoted to reviewing arrests and examining body-worn camera (BWC) footage - Fiscal Year 2018 was the first Fiscal Year where BWC had been fully deployed for the entire year - to determine whether the BWC footage reflected issues that would later require the Office to dismiss a prosecution or if there were otherwise fatal flaws with the case. This section is called the Early Case Assessment Section (ECAS). The combination of BWC footage and ECAS\u2019s early detection of arrests that, if charged, would later need to be dismissed led to relatively modest decreases in cases charged at the time of arrest in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.\nThe overall day-of-arrest charging rate dropped dramatically in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022, as the global pandemic brought the criminal justice system to a halt and the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences lost its accreditation in 2021.\nOur Office, along with our local partners, worked to overcome these challenges and the overall day-of-arrest charging rate in Fiscal Year 2024 of 57% is virtually identical to the 54% day-of-arrest charging rate that the Office reported in Fiscal Year 2019 after forming ECAS. More significantly, though, the Office dismissed far fewer of the cases it charged in Fiscal Year 2024 than it did in Fiscal Year 2018, so more arrests resulted in a prosecutorial outcome in Fiscal Year 2024 than in Fiscal Year 2018. For felonies, in particular, the percentage of cases with a prosecutorial outcome rose from 66% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 85% in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThere is value in addressing the issues, such as the lack of drug testing, that were preventing our Office from charging, at the time-of-arrest, non-violent misdemeanor offenses. While charging more non-violent offenses can benefit the community and offenders are often sentenced to periods of probation with services that hopefully aid in rehabilitation, these cases typically do not identify and remove violent offenders from the community. As is universally recognized, targeting the relatively limited number of individuals responsible for driving gun violence is the most impactful thing that prosecutors can do to contribute to the kinds of sharp declines in violent crime the District saw in 2024. To that end, multiple proactive investigations are already underway that should further reduce violent crime in 2025.\n##\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube\nOr at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc\nContact\nUpdated January 3, 2025\nTopic\nViolent Crime\nComponent"
