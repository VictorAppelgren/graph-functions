  "title": "We built a $1 billion tech unicorn in Europe, living proof that our economy is just as dynamic as America's. Success comes down to three core principles",
  "description": "The next billion-dollar story might not come from California. It could come from a city where the coffee is stronger and the buildings are older.",
  "content": "The world tends to see Europe as fragmented, bureaucratic, and underfunded \u2014 a tough place to build global companies. But those very constraints are why Europe is producing some of the most resilient billion-dollar businesses today. Scarcity forces discipline. Fragmentation gives startups diverse talent. And limited funding pushes founders to act globally from day one.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, where investors reward efficiency over hype and customers demand solutions that work across borders, Europe\u2019s supposed weaknesses have become its greatest strengths. Our own $1 billion journey proves it.\n\nIn DataSnipper\u2019s early days, our founders didn\u2019t have much capital, brand recognition, and certainly no fancy office. They had a few laptops, a shared workspace that doubled up as the lunchroom, and a product that barely worked. That might sound like a list of disadvantages, but I believe they\u2019re the main reasons why the business moved fast enough to win.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t have extensive resources, you must turn to being creative, resourceful, and fast. Instead of over-engineering, you test ideas quickly. Instead of waiting for the \u201cperfect\u201d conditions, you take action with what you have.\n\nFor example, they ruthlessly focused on getting our product into customers\u2019 hands as quickly as possible. Often, far too early. This was intentional. It created a very swift feedback loop to build and improve our offering. They moved fast and iterated rapidly.\n\nScrappiness changes your psychology. Every obstacle becomes a puzzle to solve, not a reason to pause. They didn\u2019t have the budget for big-ticket marketing campaigns, so they built an army of customer advocates by personally solving their problems. They didn\u2019t have a data science team, so they taught themselves analytics at night to understand the metrics. They didn\u2019t have a dedicated Quality Assurance department, so every single employee diligently tested features, including the founders themselves.\n\nThat constant bias toward progress over polish allowed us to iterate in weeks what typically took larger companies months to decide on. The lean and scrappy approach they used out of necessity became part of our DNA. Even when we could afford to spend more resources down the line, we strived to operate with the same mindset.\n\nUse your European location to sell globally\n\nUnlike U.S. startups that can grow large while staying domestic, European founders operate globally from day one. They have to and it\u2019s an advantage.\n\nFrom a single HQ, we could sell across Europe\u2019s diverse markets, hire multilingual talent, and reach customers in three continents within 24 hours. A morning call with Asia, a midday demo with Madrid, and an afternoon pitch to New York, all without leaving Amsterdam.\n\nEurope\u2019s diverse talent pool makes this even more powerful. You can hire native speakers for your key markets without opening foreign subsidiaries. You can easily hire from outside the EU and sponsor their visa without any of the H1-B visa challenges you would face in the United States. It\u2019s one of the reasons we were able to expand revenue globally while still being headquartered in Europe. Geography, diversity, and time zones turned into strategic advantages.\n\nToo many European founders confine fundraising to their home turf. That\u2019s a mistake. If you want to build a global company, you need global capital.\n\nThat means reaching out to investors in the U.S., Asia, and the Middle East. Not just the individuals a friend can introduce you to over coffee. One of our biggest backers came from cold outreach. You should be picking up the phone (or sending a well-researched email) to explain why your product has worldwide potential.\n\nRaising from global investors also signals ambition to your team and your market. It\u2019s not about asking for money; it\u2019s about showing that you\u2019re building something that transcends local markets. The right investors aren\u2019t just writing a check, they\u2019re opening doors to customers, talent, and partnerships in their regions.\n\nWhy Europe can compete with (and even beat) Silicon Valley\n\nWould we have grown faster in the U.S.? Maybe. But \u201cfaster\u201d isn\u2019t always better. Europe\u2019s constraints forced discipline. We didn\u2019t raise too much too soon. We didn\u2019t hire ahead of revenue. We didn\u2019t chase shiny features no one needed.\n\nToday, our HQ is still in Europe. Our team spans continents. Our customers are in 170 countries. The next billion-dollar story might not come from California. It could come from a city where the coffee is stronger, the buildings older, and the team is already thinking globally from day one.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.",
