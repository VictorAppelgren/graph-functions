  "content": "MSD and Daiichi Sankyo have initiated the Phase III HERTHENA-Breast04 clinical trial, with the first subject receiving a dose of the HER3-directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC), patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), for breast cancer.\n\nThe study is designed to evaluate the therapy in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer.\n\nThis randomised, open-label trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 5.6mg/kg ADC as a single agent in comparison to standard therapies chosen by investigators for this patient group.\n\nDiscovered by Daiichi Sankyo, the ADC is being co-developed with MSD.\n\nThe companies noted that, for the trial, subjects must not be candidates for additional endocrine therapy and must not be given chemotherapy or an ADC for advanced or metastatic disease.\n\nThey must also have experienced disease progression during or within two years of completing adjuvant endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy.\n\nThe trial will involve a 1:1 randomisation of subjects to receive either patritumab deruxtecan or the investigator\u2019s treatment choice, with stratification based on HER2 expression, treatment intent, HER3 expression levels, and the presence of visceral disease.\n\nIts dual primary goals are overall survival and progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded independent central review.\n\nThe trial's secondary goals are safety, objective response rate, and duration of response.\n\nApproximately 1,000 individuals across North America, Asia, South America and Europe are expected to be enrolled in the study.\n\nDaiichi Sankyo therapeutic area oncology development head Mark Rutstein said: \u201cDespite significant development in the treatment landscape, HR positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer is a highly complex and challenging disease with an overall poor prognosis.\n\n\u201cThe promising clinical activity observed in our early phase studies, including ICARUS-Breast01, suggests that patritumab deruxtecan has the potential to become a meaningful new treatment option for this specific type of breast cancer.\u201d\n\nIn June 2025, the companies announced first subject dosing in the IDeate-Prostate01 Phase III trial of I-DXd to treat docetaxel in those with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\n\"MSD and Daiichi Sankyo commence Phase III breast cancer therapy trial\" was originally created and published by Clinical Trials Arena, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\n\n The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.
