  "description": "The singer-songwriter, 43, was spotted sporting a large pendant necklace worth around $22,000 and featuring a tarot card charm symbolizing 'healing and hope.'",
  "content": "Kelly Clarkson was spotted out wearing an outfit featuring a hidden detail with a symbolic meaning after her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock's death.\n\nThe singer-songwriter, 43, was spotted sporting a large pendant necklace worth over $22K and featuring a tarot card charm symbolizing 'healing and hope.'\n\nIt was the first time she stepped out in public since the father of her two children, her former talent manager, died at the age of 48 on August 7 after battling cancer.\n\nShe was wearing Sorellina Jewelry's Le Stelle (The Star) Tarot Card pendant, which costs $22,500.\n\nPer the item description, the star card pendant signifies hope, inspiration, positivity, renewal, healing and rejuvenation.\n\nThe specific tarot card depicts a female kneeling amongst land, sea and stars \u2014 'showing us that even in the darkest of times, there will always come light.'\n\nAccording to the jewelry brand's website, the product description read: 'It serves as a reminder to keep a renewed sense of hope during difficult periods and your courage will be rewarded.'\n\nHer ex-husband passed away earlier this month from melanoma, a form of skin cancer, after a secret three-year battle with the illness.\n\nRight before his tragic death, Clarkson announced that she was postponing her Vegas shows to be 'present' for her kids while her ex was 'ill.'\n\nIn recent months, she made a number of unexplained absences from her television show but remained vague about the personal reason she was taking time off work.\n\nClarkson and Blackstock were married for nearly seven years before she filed for divorce in 2020 and it was finalized in 2022.\n\nThe pair were involved in a contentious legal battle over money but remained amicable to co-parent their two kids: River, 11, and Remington, nine.\n\nThis weekend, the musician was spotted in her first public sighting since her ex's passing.\n\nIn photos exclusively obtained by the Daily Mail, the singer wore funereal black and guarded her eyes with sunglasses as she arrived at LAX.\n\nAlthough she shaded her face with a wide-brimmed hat, her doleful expression was in sharp evidence as she crossed the sidewalk and headed into the airport.\n\nTheir split had been marked by rancorous squabbles over money, with Clarkson even suing Blackstock for allegedly making unauthorized business deals on her behalf, and his romance with her former assistant has also raised eyebrows.\n\nHer latest sighting comes after the Daily Mail revealed Clarkson cannot shake a sense of guilt over his death, with insiders saying she has questioned if the stress of their divorce was detrimental to his health.\n\nJust days earlier, sources exclusively revealed the emotions that Clarkson has been grappling with since the father of her children died.\n\n'Kelly is aware of talk that stress can impact the body and make someone more susceptible to cancer,' an insider told the Daily Mail. 'Although the timing could be purely coincidental, she knows how much tension the divorce and lawsuits put on them.\n\n'She doesn't blame herself but she's conscious that the double whammy of the divorce and the fact that he had to repay her millions of dollars was very tough on him.'",

It led to a brutal fight between the exes, with Clarkson eventually securing primary custody of their two children River, 11, and Remington, nine. She relocated from Los Angeles to New York City for a 'fresh start.'\nThe three-time Grammy winner agreed to a massive one-off payment of $1.3million to Blackstock as well as $115,000 per month in spousal support until January 31, 2024. After that time, she was required to pay him $45,000 in monthly child support until their children turn 18 in 2032 and 2034.\nClarkson also agreed to give a five percent share of her $17.7million Montana ranch to Blackstock after months of back and forth over the property they once shared.\nFor his part, Blackstock was ordered to return $2.6million after he reportedly overcharged Clarkson by millions when he represented her as a manager, collecting fees for booking The Voice and other endorsements like Wayfair and Norwegian Cruise Line.\nClarkson released a bitter break-up album \u2013 Chemistry \u2013 in 2023 which detailed the 'good, the bad and the ugly' of her relationship with her ex.\nDuring an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe that year, the Texas native admitted she 'cried so hard' she 'couldn't even speak' during the years when she realized their marriage wasn't going to survive.\nThe album felt like a cathartic process for the singer who wanted to capture 'the arc of an entire relationship' instead of simply the anger and sadness.\nBut the bitterness is evident on tracks like Red Flag Collector where she seemingly calls out his bid for her money.\nTheir split had been marked by rancorous squabbles over money, with Clarkson even suing Blackstock for allegedly making unauthorized business deals on her behalf, and his romance with her former assistant has also raised eyebrows\nHer latest sighting comes after the Daily Mail revealed Clarkson cannot shake a sense of guilt over his death , with insiders saying she has questioned if the stress of their divorce was detrimental to his health\nThe divorce dragged on for a year and a half before it was ultimately finalized in March 2022. It led to a brutal fight between the exes, with Clarkson eventually securing primary custody of their two children River, 11, and Remington, nine. She relocated from Los Angeles to New York City for a 'fresh start'\nClarkson and Blackstock in 2019, a year before they split, with their children River and Remington, now 11 and nine\n'Sure, you can have the towels / You can take my money,' she sings. 'Drag my name 'round town / I don't mind, I changed it anyway.'\nLittle did fans know, amid the saga, Blackstock had been diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2022.\nClarkson missed multiple episodes of her eponymous talk show in March for what was described at the time as a 'personal matter.'\nThen earlier this month she announced she was postponing the remaining dates on her Las Vegas residency due to her ex-husband falling 'ill.' At the time she didn't give any more details, simply writing: 'While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them.'\nBut hours later a representative for the family confirmed Blackstock's death in a statement: 'It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family.'\nNow the talk show host, who was omitted from Blackstock's obituary which made public his romance with Clarkson's former assistant Brittney Marie Jones, is worried the stress of their bitter battle could have impacted his health.\n'The stress that all this brought is not good for anyone's health,' said a second insider. 'She doesn't want to harp on about what this might have done for Brandon's health, but it does cross her mind. And it does make her think that maybe she could of done more, even though that is unrealistic at its core.'\nInstead she is working through her emotions by focusing on their two children.\n'She separated her personal feelings about Brandon after the divorce, and she progressed from there,' the insider continued. 'While it was frustrating to deal with him in divorce, once the cancer came into the situation, she felt bad, it took a toll on her because she had to think of her kids' feelings and to protect them.\n'Now that he is gone, she doesn't feel great. But being there for her kids is helping her to cope with the onslaught of emotions.'\nMeanwhile, the outing comes comes amid news Blackstock had a 'loving partner' at the time of his death--Jones, according to his newly published obituary.\nThe obituary revealed that Blackstock had been in a relationship with Jones and was quietly building a new life with her in Montana, a fact unknown to many fans.\n'After more than 20 years in the music business, Brandon found his way back to the mountains and the cowboy way of life he always wanted to live,' the obituary read. 'He found a homestead and a love in Butte, Montana.'\nIt went on: 'Brandon, along with his beautiful and loving partner in life and business, Brittney Marie Jones, started building a life, building companies, and working tirelessly to create Headwaters Livestock Auction and what will live on as his legacy, The Valley View Rodeo in Bozeman, Montana.'\nIn a bombshell revelation, a December 2024 report by the US Sun on Blackstock and Jones's rodeo business listed Jones as Clarkson\u2019s \u2018former assistant.'\nA prior LinkedIn profile for Jones highlighted in the 2024 US Sun report reveals she served as an executive assistant to Brandon Blackstock as well as an assistant to Kelly Clarkson while Blackstock managed the singer.\n'After a change in management for Ms. Clarkson, I transitioned to Executive Assistant for Mr. Blackstock\u2019s cattle operation in Montana, where I currently run the office and handle administration work.\n'I also currently fulfill personal assistant duties for Mr. Blackstock.'\nJones\u2019s LinkedIn also identifies her as the Executive Assistant of V Bar V Cattle Co. LLC \u2014 formerly Vintage Valley Ranch \u2014 one of Blackstock\u2019s companies, further tying her to his post-divorce life in Montana."

Even from a young age, we didn\u2019t teach them, just innately you\u2019re like . . . he\u2019s allowed to be somewhere, but you\u2019re not? That is like real interesting.

What! Do you think I just leave and just sit in the park all day?\u201d\u2019\nClarkson's relationship with Blackstock began in 2012, and the two tied the knot the following year.\nThey had both a romantic and professional relationship at first, as her husband also served as her manager.\nHowever, Clarkson filed for divorce in June 2020 on grounds of irreconcilable differences, and the two were subsequently engaged in years of legal wrangling related to their finances.\nTheir messy divorce was reported to have been finalized in March of 2022, but it wasn't until a year later that Clarkson won a $2.6 million judgment against her husband.\nClarkson had claimed her husband owed her millions in commissions that he should not have been able to collect for deals that he set up that should have been handled by a talent agent, rather than her manager, and the California Labor Commissioner ultimately agreed.\nIt ruled that Blackstock had overstepped by working around Clarkson's agents at Creative Artists Agency.\nIn May 2024, the warring exes finally reached a settlement in Clarkson's lawsuit over the commission fees.\nIn May 2024, the warring exes finally reached a settlement in Clarkson\u2019s lawsuit over the commission fees, though the terms weren\u2019t publicly disclosed; pictured in 2019 in LA\nIn 2022, the Moment Like This singer had agreed to pay her ex-husband a $1.3M lump sum as part of their divorce settlement, plus more than $45K per month in child support and $115K in spousal support through January 2024; pictured in 2019 in LA\nThe hitmaker's had previously won the $2.6 million judgement for deals Blackstock had secured for her going back to 2017, but she had claimed he had been taking the place of her talent agents while serving as her manager going back as far as 2007, so she had requested a more thorough accounting of commissions paid to her ex-husband.\nAlthough Clarkson and Blackstock both requested that her lawsuit be dismissed after the settlement was reached, the details of the agreement were not publicly disclosed.\nIn 2022, the Moment Like This singer had agreed to pay her ex-husband a $1.3 million lump sum as part of their divorce settlement.\nThey also agreed that Clarkson would pay Blackstock $45,601 per month in child support payments.\nOn top of that, she had to pay Blackstock $115,000 per month for spousal support, though those payments were set to end in January of last year.\nThe exes agreed to share joint custody of River and Remington, but the children would primarily live in Los Angeles with their mother and would visit Blackstock at his home in Montana for one weekend per month.\nAt the time, he was paying Clarkson rent on the ranch that they had shared in Montana before he was scheduled to move out in June 2022.\nThe settlement allowed Blackstock to retain control of their farm animals, including cattle, dogs and horses, as well as multiple vehicles for use around the property, including an ATV, snowmobiles and two pickup trucks: a Ford F-350 and an F-250.\nEarlier this year, Clarkson missed 10 episodes of her eponymous TV show. She didn't explain the absence but complained in May that its busy scheduled prevents her from touring as much as she wishes she could; pictured with River and Remington on her show's set\nSources previously claimed that Clarkson is unhappy with her talk show, but she may remain on it as a backup if her next album fails to sell well; pictured July 11 in Las Vegas\nClarkson got to keep the small family pets in the deal, as well as a baby grand piano, hunting items and all of their firearms, both from before and during their marriage.\nEarlier this year, the TV star was mysteriously absent from her eponymous talk show for multiple weeks, missing 10 shows in total.\nClarkson didn't explain her absence at the time, though in May she complained on stage about the show's demanding schedule, she she said kept her from touring as much as she wanted to.\nSources close to Clarkson have claimed that she is unhappy with her show and has been considering quitting, and NBC was said to be looking into possible replacements should she step down.\nHowever, a source claimed that the success of Clarkson's next album release, as she may choose to stick with the show as a backup if it fails to sell well."
