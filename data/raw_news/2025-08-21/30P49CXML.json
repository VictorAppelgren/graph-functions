  "title": "Roth or Traditional IRA: Which Is Better in 2025?",
  "description": "Learn the key differences between a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA to decide which type of retirement account is best for you.",
  "content": "Looking to save more for retirement? Opening a traditional IRA or Roth IRA can be one of the best money moves you ever make.\n\nI recently opened a Roth IRA myself -- a choice that will likely save me thousands of dollars in the long run.\n\nHere's what you need to know about traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs -- and why everyone should have at least one of the two.\n\nWhy both types of IRAs are great\n\nAn IRA, or individual retirement account, is a type of personal savings account designed to help you save for retirement.\n\nIt works a lot like a 401(k), except anyone who earns income can open an IRA. And the best part is that your capital gains and dividends aren't taxable.\n\nYou can open an IRA through a brokerage. Then you'll have the option to invest in a wide range of financial products, including stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and mutual funds. In short, they're a great way to grow your retirement savings in the long term.\n\nThere are a few limitations to be aware of with IRAs:\n\u2022 Withdrawing money from your traditional IRA before age 59 1/2 can trigger a 10% penalty. (You can withdraw your contributions from a Roth IRA tax-free and penalty-free, regardless of age -- withdrawing earnings, however, is subject to a penalty.)\n\u2022 You can't contribute to a Roth IRA if you earn more than a certain amount in a year.\n\u2022 There's a limit to how much you can contribute to IRAs: in 2025, it's $7,000 for those under age 50 and $8,000 for those 50 or older.\n\nStill, for most people, the benefits of IRAs make them worth it. Simply put, anyone who earns an income should consider opening one.\n\nThe main difference between traditional and Roth IRAs is when you pay taxes on your contributions and withdrawals.\n\nStart saving for your future today -- see our full list of the best IRA accounts available now.\n\nA traditional IRA can be a smart choice if you expect your tax rate in retirement to be lower than it is today -- in other words, if you think your retirement income will be less than what you make now.\n\nContributions to a traditional IRA can be deducted from your taxable income in the year you make them, which means you save money on taxes up front. It's also available to anyone who earns an income regardless of how much they make.\n\nTraditional IRAs are best if you want immediate tax relief and plan to withdraw funds when your income -- and tax rate -- are lower. They're also a smart choice if you want more money in your pocket today, either for expenses or other investments.\n\nWith a Roth IRA, your contributions are not tax-deductible -- but after that, withdrawals can be made tax-free.\n\nThat means you can lock in your current, potentially lower tax rate, then avoid income taxes on withdrawals later. If you're far off from retirement, expect your income to rise later in life, or don't want to worry about what tax rates will be when you retire, it's probably the right type of IRA for you.\n\nIncome limits apply, so not everyone is eligible to contribute. In 2025, single filers must have a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of less than $165,000 to contribute to a Roth IRA, and married couples must have MAGIs of less than $246,000.\n\nStill, for anyone who qualifies -- and wants their retirement savings to grow substantially, over decades -- a Roth IRA is a great choice.\n\nWhy I went with a Roth IRA\n\nI contribute to a Roth IRA because I'm young (26 years old), I expect my income and tax rate to rise, and I have decades (I hope) to let my investments grow tax-free.\n\nThat's just my situation, though -- the truth is that any IRA is better than no IRA at all. The biggest key is starting early and giving your money time to grow, no matter which account you choose.\n\nReady to explore your options? See our list of the best IRAs available today to get started.",

Learn more about how Motley Fool Money rates brokerage accounts.\nIn my view, assuming you qualify for an individual retirement account, the most important thing you can do is get one set up and use it. The tax advantages have the potential to make a big difference in your retirement.\nThat said, choosing the right broker for your IRA can make a real difference to both your IRA investing and your long-term savings. Let's consider a few of the key reasons.\nNot all IRA brokers offer the same investment options. Even if you use the same broker as your taxable investment account, the options could differ.\nSo one of the first things you need to do is make sure that the investment options for the broker match your needs. For most reputable brokers, you should be able to count on U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds being available.\nIf your investing mix includes options, individual bonds, crypto, or other less-common investments, you'll want to make sure the broker offers it. Likewise, while most brokers will offer mutual funds, which specific funds and fund providers are available can vary.\nMany brokers these days offer $0 commissions on stock and ETF trades. But that can vary from broker to broker, as well as between taxable accounts and IRAs.\nThe commissions for stock and ETF trades -- whether it's actually $0 or a low fee -- is one fee to consider. But mutual fund fees can vary, so if mutual funds are part of your mix, consider both the fees to buy and sell funds as well as expense ratios for the funds. Fees for options contracts and transacting in crypto can also vary.\nOutside of the fees for transacting, some brokers may have fees for inactivity, or simply a monthly account fee. Fees for transacting over the phone rather than on web or mobile are also typical. You'll want to take note of all of these ancillary fees to consider how they would add up for you.\nMany brokers these days offer significant resources and tools to help investors make investment decisions, plan for retirement, and track their portfolio. Many, but not all.\nWhat's important really depends on you and your process, as some tools will be critical for some investors, while others won't use them at all. Common tools and resources include screeners for finding stocks and other investments, investment research, calculators, educational guides, and webinars.\nThe platform interface can significantly impact your investing experience. Consider how you'll primarily interact with your account -- if you're an active trader who needs detailed charting and analysis tools, a robust desktop platform might be critical. But if you primarily check balances and make occasional trades, a solid, easy-to-use mobile app might be sufficient.\nCustomer support can be important, but needs vary by investor. Some brokers offer 24/7 phone support with dedicated retirement specialists, while others primarily rely on chat and email. If you want face-to-face interactions, consider whether the broker has physical branches in your area and what services they offer, as branch availability can be particularly valuable when you need help with complex transactions or account services.\nAnd for those looking for a more hands-off approach, robo-advisors and hybrid services have evolved significantly. These services typically combine algorithmic portfolio management with varying levels of human oversight, and the best platforms offer customization options that you can fit to your retirement goals while targeting the risk levels you want and tax efficiency. Some hybrid services provide periodic access to human advisors for strategy reviews and major life events.\nAccount integration can make your financial management much simpler. Many brokers now offer seamless connections between investment accounts and banking services, which allows quick transfers and the ability to view your accounts holistically on one page.\nMajor banks have aimed to get more customers onto their investing services, sometimes even providing incentives for existing banking customers. These might include preferred pricing on investment services, higher rewards on credit cards, or better rates on banking products. However, while they can be a nice cherry on top, don't let these perks be the sole determining factor -- the quality of the investment platform and available options should take precedence over banking integration benefits.\nAll in all, consider how these features align with your long-term retirement strategy. The best platform for you will be one that provides the tools and services you'll actually use while offering the investment options you need at a reasonable cost.\nCharles Schwab pioneered the low-cost brokerage model decades ago, and that legacy continues with its lineup of no-commission-fee offerings.

IRAs can typically hold a variety of investments including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and options. Which means that for most people, investing in an IRA won't feel much different than investing in their standard brokerage account.\nTwo main types of IRAs are the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA. Both can be useful accounts, but they have slightly different tax advantages. A couple additional types of IRAs exist as well.\nA traditional IRA allows you to invest money pre-tax, allowing you to compound your investments on that pre-tax basis. It's generally only when you withdraw your money from a traditional IRA in retirement that you are taxed. For many people, that could mean paying taxes at a lower rate in retirement versus the tax rate during your peak earning years.\nA Roth IRA has essentially the opposite tax advantage. With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes on the money when you earn it, but then are not taxed on any of the gains you make on your investment earnings. This can be particularly advantageous for younger earners in a lower tax bracket who can pay taxes at a lower rate, then let their investments compound over decades, and enjoy those tax-free earnings in retirement.\nSEP IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs are two additional types of individual retirement accounts that are specifically designed for self-employed people or small businesses. These have contribution guidelines that typically allow qualified individuals to contribute more than they would with a traditional or Roth IRA.\nActually opening an IRA is naturally a crucial first step toward building your retirement savings, and the process is typically straightforward. Here's a detailed look at four steps you'll need to follow to get started.\nBefore you begin the application process, you'll need to have some personal information at the ready. Normally, this includes your Social Security number, current address, employment information, and basic financial details.\nChoosing which type of individual retirement account -- traditional IRA, Roth IRA, etc -- is one of the most important decisions you'll make when setting up an IRA.\nAs discussed earlier, traditional IRAs offer upfront tax benefits by allowing you to invest pre-tax dollars, with taxes paid when you withdraw your money in retirement. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax money but offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. For self-employed individuals, a SEP IRA might be the better choice, as it typically allows for higher contribution limits compared to traditional or Roth IRAs.\nMaking this choice depends on your needs and personal circumstances. Many people may be able to determine this on their own, based on a review of their finances, current tax situation, and future needs. Others may want to consult a finance or tax professional to help them figure out which will make the most sense for them.\nThere are several ways to fund your new IRA, though this can vary a bit depending on the broker you choose. The most common and straightforward method is linking your bank account directly to your IRA. Most brokers make this process simple, often allowing you to set up a one-time transfer to get up and running or recurring transfers for regular contributions.\nTransferring funds from an existing IRA is another option. While this might require some paperwork, direct transfers between institutions are typically straightforward and can usually be initiated by your new broker. This approach helps avoid any potential tax implications that might arise from receiving a distribution check.\nOnce your account is funded, you'll need to select investments. For some investors, this is the fun part, though to others it can sometimes seem overwhelming. The good news is that if you've chosen a top-notch IRA broker, this step can be relatively painless regardless of which side of that spectrum you fall.\nFor investors with a newly-funded IRA account, choosing investments will mainly mean populating your new account with investments that align and compliment the rest of your portfolio. That is, making sure that what you buy in your new IRA doesn't throw off the allocations or risk profile across your investment portfolio as a whole.\nIf this is your first time investing, this means building your portfolio. If you want to get started investing quickly and keep it simple, using low-cost ETFs covering major indexes like the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000 can be a great way to get diversified quickly while keeping your costs low. Tapping into a robo-advisor if your broker offers one can be another easy quick-start option.\nRemember that your investment choices can be adjusted over time as your needs and circumstances change. Many brokers offer research tools and educational resources to help you make informed investment decisions as you build and manage your retirement portfolio.\nContributing to and withdrawing from an IRA requires that you do pay some mind to IRS rules and regulations. While these accounts offer significant tax advantages, they come with specific rules that govern how you can use them effectively for retirement savings.\nThe IRS sets annual limits on how much you can contribute to your IRAs, and these limits apply collectively across all your IRA accounts. For 2025, most individuals can contribute up to $7,000 across their traditional and Roth IRAs combined. If you're age 50 or older, you can make additional \"catch-up\" contributions, bringing your total allowable contribution to $8,000 for the year.\nIRAs are designed for long-term retirement savings, and the IRS enforces this through its withdrawal rules. Generally, you must wait until age 59 1/2 before taking distributions from your IRA to avoid penalties. Early withdrawals from traditional IRAs typically trigger a 10% penalty on top of any income taxes owed on the distribution.\nHowever, there are some exceptions to these early withdrawal penalties. These might include using the funds for a first-time home purchase (up to certain limits), qualified educational expenses, or certain medical expenses. Even when these exceptions apply, you'll still need to pay regular income taxes on distributions from traditional IRAs.\nIndividual retirement accounts are one of the most powerful tools available for building long-term wealth for retirement. These accounts combine the potential for investment growth with significant tax advantages, making them a key retirement planning strategy for many Americans.\nThe best brokers offer a combination of low fees, diverse investment options, useful planning tools, and educational resources that can help you make informed decisions about your retirement savings.\nRemember, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good -- while it's worth taking time to choose the right broker and investment strategy, the benefits of getting started typically outweigh the advantages of waiting for the \"perfect\" moment or setup. Consider using one of the top IRA brokers listed here to open your account today and take the first step toward a more secure retirement future.\nTIP\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen one of our top-rated brokers, you need to make sure you\u2019re buying the right stocks. We think there\u2019s no better place to start than with Stock Advisor, the flagship stock-picking service of our company, The Motley Fool. You\u2019ll get two new stock picks every month, plus 10 starter stocks and best buys now. The average stock pick inside Stock Advisor is up 1019% \u2014 more than 5x that of the S&P 500! (as of 8/4/2025). Learn more and get started today with a special new member discount.\nYes, you can maintain multiple IRAs across different brokers. Some investors do this to access specific investment options or take advantage of different brokers' features.\nHowever, your total contributions across all traditional and Roth IRAs combined still can't exceed the annual IRS limit ($7,000 for 2025, or $8,000 if you're 50 or older). This means you'll need to carefully track your contributions across accounts to avoid excess contribution penalties.\nWhile many brokers now offer commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs in IRAs, you should keep an eye out for other fees. These can include contract fees for options trading, load fees or transaction fees for mutual funds, and annual account maintenance fees. Some brokers might also charge for services like wire transfers, paper statements, or making a trade over the phone.\nWhen comparing brokers, look at their complete fee schedule to understand the total cost of maintaining your account based on your intended investment strategy. Make sure to do this with your own needs in mind -- if there's a fee for paper statements, but you don't use them anyway, then that fee really shouldn't matter to you.\nThe tax advantages of IRAs depend on several factors, including your income, whether you or your spouse participate in a workplace retirement plan, and which type of IRA you choose. For traditional IRAs, the ability to deduct contributions can phase out at higher income levels if you're covered by a workplace plan.\nRoth IRA contributions are subject to income limits, above which your ability to contribute begins to phase out and eventually becomes restricted entirely. If you're self-employed or have a small business, the rules are also different, so be sure to consult IRS regulations with your specific situation in mind.\nHaving a 401(k) doesn't prevent you from contributing to an IRA. In fact, maintaining both types of accounts can be an effective way to maximize your retirement savings.\nHowever, if you're covered by a workplace retirement plan, your ability to deduct traditional IRA contributions may be limited based on your income level. Roth IRA contribution eligibility is determined by income regardless of workplace plan participation.\nIRAs at member firms of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) are protected up to $500,000 per account type if your brokerage firm fails. This includes up to $250,000 in cash.\nIn the fine print at the bottom of their webpage, most brokerages will note that they are SIPC member firms. If you have any doubt, you can confirm with their customer support. It's important to understand that SIPC protection covers the custody of your assets -- making sure they're returned to you if your broker goes bankrupt -- but doesn't protect against investment losses.\nYes, you can. While IRAs offer tax advantages, they don't protect against market risk. The value of your investments can fluctuate based on market conditions and investment performance. So you could lose money, particularly in the short term.\nAdditionally, withdrawing money before age 59 1/2 typically triggers a 10% early withdrawal penalty on top of any taxes owed, which can significantly impact your account balance. This reinforces the importance of viewing IRAs as long-term retirement savings vehicles rather than short-term investment accounts.\nBrokerages we evaluated for consideration on this page: Acorns, Ally Invest, Axos Self-Directed Trading, Betterment, Cash App Investing, Charles Schwab, Delphia, Domain Money, Ellevest, Empower, eToro Brokerage, E*TRADE Core Portfolios from Morgan Stanley, E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, Fidelity Cash Management, Fidelity Go\u00ae, Firstrade, FOREX.com, Interactive Brokers, J.P.

Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are generally not FDIC\u2010insured but are protected by SIPC, except when those funds are held in a sweep account following a deposit or prior to a withdrawal, at which time funds are eligible for FDIC insurance but are not protected by SIPC. See Betterment Client Agreements for further details. Funds deposited into Cash Reserve are eligible for up to $1,000,000.00 (or $2,000,000.00 for joint accounts) of FDIC insurance once the funds reach one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 for each insurable capacity\u2014e.g., individual or joint\u2014at up to four Program Banks). Even if there are more than four Program Banks, clients will not necessarily have deposits allocated in a manner that will provide FDIC insurance above $1,000,000.00 (or $2,000,000.00 for joint accounts). The FDIC calculates the insurance limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable capacity at a bank, not just cash in Cash Reserve. If clients elect to exclude one or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance available through Cash Reserve may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank, including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of Cash Reserve, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not protected by SIPC. For more information see the full terms and conditions and Betterment LLC's Form ADV Part II.\n**The annual percentage yield (\"APY\") on the deposit balances in Betterment Cash Reserve (\"Cash Reserve\") is 4.00% and represents the weighted average of the APY on deposit balances at the banks participating in Cash Reserve (the \"Program Banks\") and is current as of Feb. 6, 2023. This APY is variable and subject to change daily. Deposit balances are not allocated equally among the participating Program Banks. A minimum deposit of $10 is required, but there is no minimum balance required to be maintained. The APY available to a customer may be lower if that customer designates a bank or banks as ineligible to receive deposits. APY applies only to Cash Reserve and does not apply to checking accounts held through Betterment Checking. Cash Reserve and Betterment Checking are separate offerings and are not linked accounts.\nFor Cash Reserve (\u201cCR\u201d), Betterment LLC only receives compensation from our program banks; Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities do not charge fees on your CR balance."

  "argos_summary": "The article explains that both traditional and Roth IRAs are powerful tools for retirement savings, with the main difference being when taxes are paid: traditional IRAs offer upfront tax deductions while Roth IRAs provide tax\u2011free growth and withdrawals. It outlines contribution limits for 2025 ($7,000 or $8,000 if 50+), income eligibility for Roth IRAs, and early\u2011withdrawal penalties. The author shares a personal preference for a Roth IRA due to expected higher future income and long\u2011term tax advantages, and emphasizes the importance of starting early. The piece also reviews top brokerage options, highlighting low fees, diverse investment choices, and useful tools, and advises readers to choose a broker that fits their needs and to monitor contribution limits to avoid penalties.",
