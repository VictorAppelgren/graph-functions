  "description": "Over the past three years, Russian state-backed news channel RT has expanded its international presence.",
  "content": "Javier Gallardo likes to start his morning watching a classical music programme on television - it is part of his routine, and puts him in the right mood for the day before going to work driving trucks.\n\nBut one Monday in June, he turned on the television and, instead of music, the screen was filled with images of a warzone. A news report was playing on a channel he had never heard of.\n\n\"What's happening?\" he asked himself. After 20 minutes, he turned it off. \"I couldn't connect with it.\"\n\nA green logo at the bottom corner of the screen showed the letters: \"RT\". Searching online, he found that this was a Russian channel.\n\nJavier lives in Chile. It is alleged that Telecanal, a privately-owned TV channel in the country, has handed over its signal to Russian state-backed news broadcaster RT, formerly Russia Today.\n\nThe country's broadcasting regulator has opened sanction proceedings against Telecanal for a possible violation of broadcasting law, and is waiting for the channel's response.\n\nTelecanal did not respond to request for comment.\n\n\"I got upset,\" admits Javier. \"They didn't announce anything beforehand, and I couldn't understand why.\"\n\nOver the last three years, the Russian state-backed news channel RT and news agency and radio Sputnik, have expanded their international presence; between them, they now broadcast across Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Latin America.\n\nThis all coincides with bans in Western countries.\n\nFollowing Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, sweeping restrictions were imposed to RT's broadcasting in the US, UK, Canada and across the European Union \u2013 as well as by major tech companies \u2013 for spreading disinformation about the war.\n\nThis culminated in 2024, when US authorities sanctioned RT executives - including its editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan - for alleged attempts to harm \"public trust\" in the country's institutions.\n\nIt came amid accusations of the Kremlin orchestrating a widespread campaign to interfere in the presidential election. RT denied involvement.\n\nYet elsewhere, RT's influence has only expanded.\n\nSince 2023, RT has opened a bureau in Algeria, launched a TV service in Serbian, and started free training programmes aimed at journalists from Africa, Southeast Asia, India, and China.\n\nThe broadcaster has also announced it will open an office in India. Sputnik, meanwhile, launched a newsroom in Ethiopia in February.\n\nAll of this coincides with an apparent weakening from the Western media in some regions. Thanks to budget cuts and changing foreign policy priorities, certain outlets have downsized and even withdrawn from parts of the world.\n\nTwo years ago, the BBC closed its Arabic radio service in favour of its digital-based service - which provides audio, video and text-based news content. It has since launched emergency radio services for Gaza and Sudan. That same year Russia's Sputnik started a 24-hour service in Lebanon, occupying the airwave vacated by BBC Arabic.\n\nMeanwhile, the US government-funded international broadcasting service Voice of America has cut most of its staff.\n\n\"Russia is like water: where there are cracks in the cement, it trickles in,\" says Dr Kathryn Stoner, political scientist at Stanford University.\n\nThe question that remains, however, is, what is Russia's endgame? And what does this apparent creeping of media power in those regions mean in an age with a shifting world order?\n\n\"[Countries outside the West are] very fertile territory intellectually, culturally, and ideologically [because of their] residual anti-American, anti-Western, and anti-imperial sentiments,\" says Stephen Hutchings, a professor of Russian Studies at the University of Manchester.\n\nRussian propaganda, he argues, is also spread smartly: its content is calibrated to cater to specific audiences, even if it means adopting different ideological stances in different regions.\n\nTake the perception of RT. In the West it is often seen as a \"Russian state actor and propagator of disinformation,\" he says. In other parts of the world, however, it is often regarded as a legitimate broadcaster with its own editorial line.\n\nThis makes viewers susceptible to believing it - \"not all crazy conspiracy theorists who naively fall for disinformation\".\n\nThis is how Dr Rhys Crilley puts it. He is a lecturer in international relations at the University of Glasgow, and believes that RT's coverage of the world can appeal to broad audiences - \"people who are rightly concerned about global injustices, or events that they perceive the West to be involved in perpetrating\".\n\nOn the surface, RT's international site looks like a standard news website and it reports some stories accurately. \"[It's] a very careful manipulation\", argues Dr Precious Chatterje-Doody, senior lecturer in Politics and International Studies at The Open University, who wrote a book on RT with Prof Hutchings, Dr Crilley and others.\n\nShe and other colleagues analysed RT's international news bulletins covering a period of two years between May 2017 and May 2019, and concluded that its curation of stories (what it chose to cover and what it left out) fitted certain narratives.\n\nFor example, the researchers found that social unrest was prioritised as a topic to report on when it happened in European countries, whereas one of the frequent preferences in the coverage of Russian domestic affairs was the country's military exercises.\n\nThe broadcaster also makes explicit false claims, such as portraying Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 as a peaceful \"reunification\", denying clear evidence of military involvement. It has systematically denied evidence of Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\nRT has also published stories with commentators blaming Ukraine for shooting down Malaysia airlines flight MH17 in July 2014. (The UN aviation body has concluded that the Russian Federation is responsible for the downing and international investigators found that a missile system transported from Russia to occupied eastern Ukraine had been used by Russians and pro-Russian separatists to hit it.)\n\nWhat was striking was the view of audiences on this coverage.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, the researchers interviewed 109 people who watched RT in the UK before it had its licence to broadcast revoked by media regulator Ofcom. Dr Chatterje-Doody says she observed that many said they felt that \"RT is biased\" but that they had the tools to discern what was truthful from what was not.\n\nHowever, based on her research, she warned: \"[The audience] is not necessarily aware of the precise ways in which RT is biased and where the dishonesty of the coverage comes from.\"\n\nWhy Russia has renewed focus on Africa\n\nRussian state media's biggest recent expansion is in Africa, according to Prof Hutchings.\n\nIn February, Russian authorities travelled to Ethiopia for the launch of a new editorial centre for Sputnik. Sputnik already broadcasts across parts of Africa in English and French languages, and has expanded to include Amharic, one of the official languages of Ethiopia.\n\nRT has also reoriented its French-language channel to target French-speaking African nations, along with redirecting funding from projects in London, Paris, Berlin and the US to the continent, according to RT's editor-in-chief.\n\nLast year Russian state media claimed that RT had seven bureaux in Africa, although this cannot be independently verified.\n\nMany Africans already have friendly views towards Russia - anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist sentiment, together with the legacy of Soviet support for liberation movements during the Cold War made it relatively common.\n\nWith this new focus, Russia hopes to undermine Western influence, build support for its actions, and build economic ties, argues Dr Crilley.\n\nWhen RT launched its first online course aimed at African reporters and bloggers, the BBC's Global Disinformation Unit joined it to find out more.\n\n\"We are one of the best in fact-checking and have never been caught distributing false information,\" RT's general director Alexey Nikolov told students.\n\nOne lesson examined how to debunk misinformation. The instructor stated a chemical weapons attack in the Syrian city of Douma in 2018, by the Russian-backed Assad regime, was a \"canonical example of fake news\", ignoring findings of a two-year investigation by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirming the attacks were carried out by the Syrian Air Force.\n\u2022 None Bowen: Netanyahu is presiding over a divided Israel - the fault lines are now chasms\n\u2022 None The 'strongman' PM who inspired Trump's playbook - but now finds his power crumbling\n\u2022 None Putin and Trump's relationship has soured - but behind the posturing, a Ukraine deal is still possible\n\nThe host also dismissed the mass killing of Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces in the Ukrainian town of Bucha in 2022, calling it \"the most well-known fake\". (This, despite overwhelming UN and independent evidence blaming Russian forces.)\n\nSpeaking to those who took part after the course, many seemed unperturbed by this - some told the BBC they believed RT was a standard international TV broadcaster, comparable to CNN or Al Jazeera.\n\nWhen we interviewed an Ethiopian journalist in December 2024, they echoed RT's claims by calling the Bucha killings a \"staged event\". Their social media profile picture was a photograph of Putin.\n\nA journalist from Sierra Leone acknowledged the risks of misinformation and disinformation but, at the time, added that every media institution has its own \"news value and style\".\n\nFrom the Middle East to Latin America\n\nIn the Middle East, Russian state media like RT Arabic and Sputnik Arabic are tailoring their coverage of the Israel-Gaza war to appeal to pro-Palestinian audiences, according to Prof Hutchings.\n\nElsewhere, including in Latin America, RT is also attempting to expand its reach.\n\nRT is available for free in 10 countries in the region according to its website. Argentina, Mexico, and Venezuela are among them. It's also on cable television in 10 other countries.\n\nOffering international news in Spanish in free-to-air television is \"part of its success,\" says Dr Armando Chaguaceda, a Cuban-Mexican historian and political scientist, who is a researcher from the think tank, Government and Political Analysis (focused on civic education and the promotion of democratic culture).\n\nAnd although RT has been banned on YouTube around the world, since March 2022, it still creeps its way onto the platform in some places.\n\nIn Argentina, 52-year old carpenter An\u00edbal Baigorria records TV reports from RT and uploads them to his YouTube channel, along with his reactions.\n\n\"Here in Buenos Aires the news focuses too much on the city,\" he argues. \"RT gives an overview of all the places in Latin America and, of course, global news.\"\n\n\"Everyone has the right to decide what they believe is true.\"\n\nUltimately, it's difficult to quantify the impact of Russian state-backed media around the world.\n\nRT claims to be available to more than 900 million TV viewers in more than 100 countries and says its content attracted 23 billion online views in 2024.\n\nBut, as Dr Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, professor of communication at the University of Copenhagen, points out: \"Availability is not meaningful measure of audience size.\"\n\nHe also argues that the 900 million viewers figure is \"extremely unlikely\" and describes online views as a vague and easily manipulated metric.\n\nDr Chatterje-Doody agrees that assessing the direct impact is hard. But she points to one case which might suggest some success for Russia. In Africa's Sahel region, which extends from Senegal eastward to Sudan, Russia has played significant military roles \"with relatively little public resistance\", even considering the challenging landscape. (It has entrenched itself by supporting military juntas in countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.)\n\nAnother narrative that has stuck has been Russia's justification for the invasion of Ukraine. Russia has long framed Nato's eastward expansion and Ukraine's growing ties with the alliance as a key reason for its full-scale invasion, claiming it posed a \"security threat\" and that Russia acted in \"self-defence\". Though widely debunked in the West, this false claim lingered across the Global South.\n\n\"The idea\u2026 is a pretty well-received narrative, especially in academic circles, in Mexico and in Latin America in general,\" says Dr Chaguaceda of the Nato expansion argument.\n\nSome Global South leaders have been hesitant in condemning the Russian war against Ukraine. In the first UN General Assembly vote after the full-scale invasion in 2022, an overwhelming majority of countries condemned the war, but 52 countries either voted against the resolutions, formerly registered their abstention, or refrained from voting. Among them, Bolivia, Mali, Nicaragua, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nDr Crilley has his own take on what Russia's endgame is.\n\n\"[The Kremlin is trying] to reduce Russia's relative isolation on the world stage by portraying Russia as a fellow victim of 'Western' aggression and a defender of the Global South.\"\n\nThe risk, he warns, \"is that RT and other Russian disinformation efforts prey on and exploit the weaknesses of liberal democracy, while normalising Russia's aggression in Ukraine, and presenting Russia not as an authoritarian state but as some sort of benign power in global politics.\"\n\nAsked for a response to the allegations raised in this article, RT said: \"We are indeed expanding around the world.\"\n\nThey declined to comment further on specific points.\n\nSputnik did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUltimately, Prof Hutchings believes we should all be concerned about Russian state activities - particularly in the context of the future of the global world order and democracy.\n\nHe believes the West is taking its \"eye off the ball\" by cutting media funding and \"leaving the field open to the likes of Russia Today.\"\n\n\"There's a lot to play for and a lot to lose\u2026 And Russia is winning ground - but the battle is not lost.\"\n\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

      "text": "Listen to Steve read this article\nHas the relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin gone off the rails? A popular Russian newspaper thinks so. It turned to trains to illustrate the current state of US-Russian ties.\n\"A head-on collision seems unavoidable,\" declared tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets recently.\n\"The Trump locomotive and the Putin locomotive are speeding towards each other.\n\"And neither is about to turn off or stop and reverse.\"\nFor the 'Putin locomotive', it's full steam ahead, with the so-called 'Special Military Operation': Russia's war in Ukraine. The Kremlin leader has shown no desire to end hostilities and declare a long-term ceasefire.\nMeanwhile, the 'Trump locomotive' has been accelerating efforts to pressure Moscow into ending the fighting: announcing deadlines, ultimatums, threats of additional sanctions against Russia and hefty tariffs on Russia's trading partners, like India and China.\nAdd to all of that the two US nuclear submarines which President Trump claims he's repositioned closer to Russia.\nWhen you switch from talking about locomotives to nuclear subs, you know things are serious.\nBut does that mean the White House is really on a \"collision course\" with the Kremlin over Ukraine?\nOr is a visit to Moscow this week by Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, a sign that for all the posturing, a deal between Russia and America to end the fighting is still possible?\nA warm start following Trump's return\nIn the early weeks of the second Trump presidency, Moscow and Washington appeared well on track to reboot their bilateral relations.\nNo hint of a head-on collision. Far from it. At times it seemed as if Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump were in the same carriage, moving in the same direction. In February the United States sided with Russia at the United Nations, opposing a European-drafted resolution that had condemned Russia's \"aggression\" in Ukraine.\nIn a telephone call that month the two presidents talked about visiting each other's countries. It felt like a Putin-Trump summit could happen any day.\nMeanwhile the Trump administration was exerting pressure on Kyiv, not on Moscow, and picking fights with traditional US allies, such as Canada and Denmark. In speeches and TV interviews, American officials were fiercely critical of Nato and of European leaders.\nAll of this was music to the Kremlin's ears.\n\"America now has more in common with Russia than Washington does with Brussels or with Kyiv,\" political scientist Konstantin Blokhin from the Russian Academy of Sciences Centre for Security Studies told the Izvestia newspaper in March.\nThe following month the same newspaper was crowing:\n\"The Trumpists are revolutionaries. They are wreckers of the system. They can only be supported in this. The unity of the West is no more. Geo-politically it is no longer an alliance. Trumpism has destroyed the Transatlantic consensus confidently and quickly.\"\nMeanwhile Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, had become a regular visitor to Russia. He made four trips here in just over two months, spending hours in talks with Vladimir Putin. After one meeting, the Kremlin leader presented him with a portrait of Donald Trump to take back to the White House.\nPresident Trump was said to be \"clearly touched\" by the gesture.\nBut President Trump was looking for more than just a painting from Moscow. He wanted President Putin to sign up to an unconditional comprehensive ceasefire in Ukraine.\nTrump's increasing frustration\nConfident that Russia holds the initiative now on the battlefield, Vladimir Putin has been reluctant to stop fighting, despite his claim that Moscow is committed to a diplomatic solution.\nWhich is why Donald Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin.\nIn recent weeks he has condemned Russia's relentless attacks on Ukrainian cities as \"disgusting\", \"disgraceful\" and accused President Putin of talking \"a lot of bullshit\" on Ukraine.\nLast month, Donald Trump announced a 50-day ultimatum to President Putin to end the war, threatening sanctions and tariffs. He subsequently reduced that to ten days. The deadline is due to expire at the end of this week. So far, there is no sign that Vladimir Putin will yield to pressure from Washington.\nThen again, how much pressure does Vladimir Putin really feel under?\n\"Because Donald Trump has changed so many deadlines and he's twisted one way or another, I don't think Putin takes him seriously,\" believes Nina Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at The New School, a university in New York City.\n\"Putin's going to fight for as long as he can, or, unless Ukraine says, 'We're tired, we are willing to accept your conditions.'\n\"I think Putin sits there in the Kremlin and thinks that he's fulfilling the dreams of the Russian tsars, and then the general secretaries such as Joseph Stalin, in showing the West that Russia should not be treated with disrespect.\"\nA deal is still possible\nFrom the picture I've painted so far it may look as if a head-on collision between the Putin and Trump locomotives is inevitable.\nNot necessarily.\nDonald Trump sees himself as a great dealmaker and, from the look of things, he hasn't given up trying to secure one with Vladimir Putin.\nSteve Witkoff is due back in Russia this week for talks with the Kremlin leader. We don't know what kind of an offer he may bring with him. But some commentators in Moscow predict there will be more carrot than stick. It did not go unnoticed that on Sunday President Trump said Russia \"seem to be pretty good at avoiding sanctions\".\nOn Monday, Ivan Loshkarev, associate professor of political theory at MGIMO University, Moscow, told Izvestia that to facilitate dialogue, Mr Witkoff may present \"advantageous offers of cooperation [to Russia] that would open up after a deal on Ukraine\".\nMight that be enough to persuade the Kremlin to make peace after three-and-a-half years of war?\nThere's no guarantee.\nAfter all, so far in Ukraine Vladimir Putin hasn't budged from his maximalist demands on territory, Ukraine's neutrality and the future size of the Ukrainian army.\nDonald Trump wants a deal. Vladimir Putin wants victory.\nMore from InDepth\n- Published1 August\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

      "text": "Hungarians have a popular saying: \"Visszanyal a fagyi\". Translation: \"The ice-cream licks back.\" In other words, watch out, because what you enjoy devouring, might enjoy devouring you.\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has assiduously attacked a liberal world view for at least two decades, transforming the country into what he has variously called an \"illiberal democracy\" and nation of \"Christian liberty\".\nMeanwhile he has drawn admirers around the world, including US Vice President JD Vance and Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. US President Donald Trump has called Orban \"smart\" and \"a tough person\".\n\"One of the most respected men, they call him a strong man,\" Trump said in September 2024.\nAhead of the next Hungarian election in April 2026, the LGBTQ community appear to be among Orban's targets \u2013 his Fidesz party rubber stamped a new law that sought to ban Pride from going ahead. And yet between 100,000 and 200,000 people turned out last month - up from just 35,000 last year.\nBut watching huge crowds march through Budapest to celebrate gay pride, free speech and the right to assemble - all in defiance of the ban - many wonder: could the liberal worldview bite back?\nAnd in some ways, that in itself is the wrong question. Orban's power is indeed now under threat, but not in the way \u2013 or from the people \u2013 one might expect.\nAs the real challenge comes not from the liberal left, but the centre right.\nA surprise challenger from Orban's own circle\nPeter Magyar, a 44-year-old formerly of Orban's own circle, appeared as a surprise challenger in February 2024.\nThis followed a scandal involving a decision to pardon a man convicted of covering up child sexual abuse that led to President Katalin Novak resigning on live television. Justice Minister Judit Varga (Magyar's ex-wife) also resigned - and the scandal dealt a blow to Orban's claim to stand for traditional family values.\nMagyar gave a long interview to Partizan, the flagship opposition YouTube channel, blasting what he called the nepotism and corruption of the governing party.\nRobert Puzser, an opposition activist who heads a new, non-party initiative called Citizens Resistance, says that Magyar is treading carefully, amid Fidesz officials and certain quarters of the media trying to portray him as a liberal or leftist.\nMagyar, he argues, is trying to avoid alienating his conservative base in the countryside, which until recently was Orban's undisputed heartland. And he has created his own powerful narrative \u2013 of a Hungary that is collapsing.\nMost national polls put Tisza, Hungary's main opposition party led by Magyar, between 9% and 18% ahead of Orban's party. Only one, the pro-government thinktank Viewpoint Institute, still puts Fidesz narrowly ahead.\nThe parlous state of state hospitals, state schools, and state railways are all being used against Orban by Magyar and his party. Now, Orban's long-established playbook, so admired abroad, is starting to fail at home \u2013 and it leaves Hungary closer than ever to ousting a man who has ruled it for the past 15 years.\nOrban's tried-and-tested strategy\nOrban has been in power for 19 of the 35 years since the fall of Communism in 1990, making him one of the most experienced leaders in the EU. In the early 1990s, Fidesz broke away from its liberal roots, and Orban instilled a new conservative, nationalist, right-wing identity.\nIn 2015, as over a million people travelled to Europe asking for asylum, Orban referred to them as part of \"a migratory movement composed of economic migrants, refugees and also foreign fighters\". He has opposed military support for Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022, and also opposes Ukraine's bid for EU membership.\nA cornerstone of Orban's playbook has been his ability to identify what his voters fear: this was true of each of his landslide victories, in 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022.\nA public opinion survey by the Publicus agency carried out from 23-25 June found 45% of people were in favour of the Pride march in Budapest and 48% were against. Just 8% of Fidesz voters approved, however, so it was a flag to rally his own camp behind.\nSince the march, Fidesz supporters have shared some provocative images from Budapest Pride, including nudity and the tale of a man arrested by police for masturbating in public.\nAfter the event, folk singer Marianna Majorosi, whose song was performed during a drag queen show at the Pride event, said, \"it deeply upsets me that as a performer I have no right to prevent someone from doing this to my voice\". Orban expressed his support for her on Facebook.\nIn 2022, the government organised a referendum on child protection to coincide with the general election. The questions included: \"Do you support allowing children in public schools to participate in sexual orientation classes without parental consent?\" And, \"do you support the promotion of gender reassignment for minors?\"\nA total of 3.7 million Hungarians took part, with the vast majority voting, \"No\". Government officials have since cited that referendum result as proof that Hungarians oppose what Pride stands for.\nThe winner takes all\nAnother key to Orban's playbook is that the winner takes all. Orban lost power in 2002 then returned to office in 2010, and in a new electoral law of 2011 he shrank Parliament from 386 seats to 199 and abolished the second round of elections, effectively channelling votes to the strongest party.\nWhile the fractious opposition parties fought for the crumbs, Fidesz took the cake. They took 45% of the vote in 2014, which translated to 67% of seats in Parliament. The former system of proportional representation was replaced by something closer to the first-past-the-post system, as used in the UK.\nHe has also appointed Fidesz-friendly judges to the Constitutional and Supreme Court.\nIn 2014 he said that the \"illiberal state\" he was constructing \"does not reject the fundamental principles of liberalism such as freedom\u2026 but it does not make this ideology the central element of state organisation\".\nOrban is still struggling to find the right name for his invention. Andr\u00e1s L\u00e1nczi, a philosopher widely considered a strong influence on the prime minister, calls it \"political realism\u2026 Ideas based on experience rather than the utopias and moralising that leftists like so much\".\nHow he won over world leaders\nOrban rules by bullet-points, simple messages culled from unpublished opinion surveys commissioned by his government to find out what is worrying the public. Pro-government media, social media, and nationwide billboards then act as an echo chamber for these messages.\nSome leaders overseas appear to admire his approach, while many MAGA Republicans love Orban for confronting \"woke\" culture.\nThe Slovak and Georgian prime ministers are also seemingly firm admirers, as are Alice Weidel (Alternative for Germany), Geert Wilders (Dutch Party for Freedom), and Herbert Kickl (Austrian Freedom Party).\nOrban has instilled in his countryfolk \"a new self-confidence\", Mr L\u00e1nczi suggests, after centuries of foreign rule. \"This nation has become stronger, and we would like to believe that we are not inferior to any other nations.\"\nBut just as he reaches the height of his fame abroad, the carpet is apparently being tugged from under his feet at home.\nAre cracks starting to appear?\nPeter Magyar has toured the country almost continuously, attacking the government for conditions in hospitals, a failing rail network and public service wages that are among the lowest in Europe.\nHe draws large crowds, and his visits to hospitals, schools or care homes are broadcast live on Facebook, with many attracting tens of thousands of views.\n\"We will re-build this country together, brick by brick,\" Magyar repeats. \"Brick by brick!\" chant the crowds, in unison.\nFidesz publicists have dismissed him as a hollow \"messiah\", or a traitor from their own ranks. But Magyar has given the public an alternative vision of repairing the homeland.\nOrban has himself started to make some mistakes, like backing the ultra-nationalist candidate George Simion in the recent Romanian presidential election, despite a long history of anti-Hungarian remarks. He considered him to be a useful ally in the European Parliament where he shares Orban's message that \"Christian Europe\" is under threat. But Simion was the surprise loser of the second round of that election.\nOrban's failure to stop Pride, after he promised his supporters it would not take place, also suggests some weakening of his power.\nBut perhaps most seriously, the Hungarian economy, heavily dependent on the German market, especially German cars manufactured in Hungary, is stagnating. Orban can no longer deliver an improved standard of living.\nEven Andr\u00e1s L\u00e1nczi, who believes Orban will win the next election, says: \"Unavoidably, there are so many conflicts during such a long time [in power]\", conflicts that \"erode trust, erode respect, erode a lot of positive things that unite that political community.\"\nBattle for the soul of Hungary\nDefeat for Orban, who has ruled Hungary for the past 15 years, would be monumental.\n\"Orban is able to mobilise his core electorate, which is about two million people, but it's not enough to win the elections,\" says Zoltan Kiszelly, a political analyst close to Fidesz.\nThe Tisza party now also has about two million supporters. More than five million Hungarians voted in the 2022 election, with a 69% turnout - so the election in April 2026 will likely be decided by those who are currently undecided.\n\"We are looking for policy issues that can attract these 500,000 to one million more voters who are needed to outnumber the opposition,\" Mr Kiszelly explained.\nIn 2022, amid the war in Ukraine, Orban portrayed himself as the \"peace\" candidate, and claimed the opposition would drag Hungary into war. It was a successful tactic in a country, often overrun in its history by foreign armies. In 2026, Ukraine could help Orban win again, Mr Kiszelly believes.\nYet if the war in Ukraine is over by then, Orban \"the political realist\" will be able to claim credit as the Western leader who warned that Ukraine cannot defeat the might of Russia. Or, if the war continues, Fidesz could step up its campaign against Manfred Weber, leader of the European People's Party (EPP), which supports continued Western military supplies for Ukraine.\n\"Orban can present himself, once again, as the dove of peace,\" Mr Kiszelly explains.\nOrban also depicts his good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin as a guarantee of cheap Russian gas and oil for Hungarian consumers - constantly under threat from EU sanctions against Russia. (Though Orban has not successfully blocked any of the 18 packages of EU sanctions against Russia so far.)\nBut his opponents hope that Tisza, and Magyar, can maintain their polling lead. Mr Puzser, the opposition activist, believes Tisza will win \"sooner or later\".\nHe describes Hungary as being at a crossroads. \"There is a path leading to a democratic transition from this semi-authoritarian, semi-constitutional system,\" he argues, \"and there is a despotic path leading to a dictatorship.\"\nAs for Orban, he said in March that there was a struggle \"for the soul of the Western world\" \u2013 some see next April's election as a battle for the soul of Hungary.\nCorrection 4 August: An earlier version of this article referred to scores of people travelling to Europe asking for asylum in 2015.

      "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister and by far the dominant force in its politics, has not budged from what he believes is the essential truth about the war in Gaza.\nHe has given Israel \u2013 and the outside world \u2013 a consistent message since Hamas attacked Israel almost two years ago. He stated it clearly when he ordered the first big ground offensive of the war into the Gaza Strip on 28 October 2023, three weeks after the attacks, and since then he has repeated the themes many times.\n\"We will fight to defend our homeland. We will fight and not retreat. We will fight on land, at sea and in the air. We will destroy the enemy above ground and below ground. We will fight and we will win.\n\"This will be a victory of good over evil, of light over darkness, of life over death. In this war we will stand steadfast, more united than ever, certain in the justice of our cause.\"\nHis speech adopted the cadences of Winston Churchill's rallying call in June 1940 of \"we shall fight on the beaches,\" after Britain's defeat by Germany in northern France and the evacuation of more than 338,000 allied soldiers from Dunkirk.\nBefore Churchill told the British in his celebrated peroration that \"we shall never surrender,\" he had not spared them from the truth that they had suffered a \"colossal military disaster\".\nHamas inflicted Israel's worst defeat in a single day on 7 October, and the horror that it could break open the borders, and kill and take so many hostages, is still very real in Israel. It is a big factor shaping attitudes to the war, the way it is being fought, and how it might end.\nVery few Israelis have ever doubted that their cause is just, but Netanyahu's statement that they would be \"more united than ever\" could not have been further from the condition of Israel almost two years later.\nIsrael is as divided now as at any time in its history, and Netanyahu, a deeply divisive figure when Hamas attacked, is presiding over fault lines in Israel that have opened into chasms.\nIsraeli views on the suffering in Gaza\nOn the edge of the anti-Netanyahu demonstration in Tel Aviv, several hundred Israelis stood silently, each holding a placard with the name of a Palestinian child killed by Israel in Gaza.\nMany of the signs had a photograph of a smiling girl or boy, next to the day they were born and the day they were killed. Children who did not have a photo were represented by a drawing of a flower.\nThe silent demonstrations to stop the killing are getting bigger - some are held outside airbases, where they try to catch the eye of pilots arriving for bombing raids into Gaza - but the demonstrators still hold a minority view.\nTimina Peretz, one of the organisers, says they started after Israel broke the last ceasefire with Hamas on 18 March and went back to war.\n\"We realised how many children died just in the same week. I refuse to stay silent while it's happening, a genocide and starvation of people...\n\"On the street, we're getting a lot of good reactions, like people saying, 'thank you'. And we have many people cursing us and [getting] really offended and upset from these images.\"\nI asked if they get called traitors. \"Of course, they do a lot of them, they say that if we think the way we think, or we act the way we act, we should just go\u2026 to live in Gaza.\n\"They can't understand how the basic idea of criticising the state is something that is rooted in democracy.\"\nOpinion polls taken since the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) went back to war in Gaza in March, breaking the last ceasefire, suggest that a large majority of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering in Gaza.\nA sample recorded in the last three days of July by the Israeli Democracy Institute says that 78% of Jewish Israelis, who make up four-fifths of the population, believe that given the restrictions of the fighting, Israel \"is making substantial efforts to avoid causing unnecessary suffering to Palestinians in Gaza\".\nThe pollsters also chose a more personal question, asking whether individuals were \"troubled or not troubled by the reports of famine and suffering among the Palestinian population in Gaza?\"\nSome 79% of Jewish Israelis surveyed said they were not troubled. Meanwhile 86% of those in Israel's Palestinian Arab minority who were asked the same question said they were very or somewhat troubled.\nNetanyahu, his ministers and spokespeople insist that Hamas, the United Nations, witnesses, aid workers and foreign governments are telling lies about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\nIn a news conference conducted in English for the international media on 10 August, Netanyahu condemned reports of starvation in Gaza. He wanted \"to puncture the lies\u2026 the only ones that are being starved in Gaza are our hostages\".\nHe has, for many years, equated criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Accounts of hunger, and IDF soldiers killing Palestinians struggling to find food that have been believed and condemned by Israel's allies, including Britain, France and Germany, should he said be viewed in the context of the long history of the persecution of Jews in Europe.\n\"We were said to be spreading vermin to Christian society, we were said to be poisoning the wells, we were said to slaughter Christian children for their blood.\n\"And as these lies spread around the globe, they were followed by horrific, horrific massacres, pogroms, displacements, finally culminating the worst massacre of them all \u2013 the Holocaust.\n\"Today the Jewish state is being maligned in a similar way.\"\n'We are in a trauma time - hostages are dying'\nMs Peretz blames the Israeli media for not showing the suffering and deaths of Palestinians.\nThat subject went closer to the heart of the national conversation when it was raised on a popular Saturday evening television talk show hosted by Eyal Berkovic, the former West Ham United football player.\nOne of the regular guests was an Israeli journalist called Emmanuelle Elbaz-Phelps. They had been discussing, as they had previously, the suffering of the hostages and their families, and Israeli soldiers who had been killed fighting in Gaza.\nThen, she told me, she felt it was her duty as a journalist to mention something that was not often spoken about on Israeli TV.\n\"I just [said] that the war is also killing a lot of Palestinians in Gaza, which is a very simple statement, no political point of view. There was no patience to listen to it.\"\nVoices were raised. Eyal Berkovic has made a name for himself as a TV host by not holding back.\nMs Elbaz-Phelps, who also works as a correspondent for French TV, recalled his response. \"He said, I do not have to worry about the people in Gaza, they are my enemies. To which I responded, you can let me say that I worry about the horrific images coming out of there.\n\"And he said, for sure, you can finish your point. This is very representative of the Israeli public opinion.\"\nMore from InDepth\n- Published16 June\nShe defended the work of Israeli journalists. \"I think 95% of what the world knows about Israel's government and decisions is brought by the Israeli journalists,\" she argues.\n\"But I think there is a huge difference when you talk about something and when you show something, and you will see images of Gaza from above that mainly are going to show the people how IDF is winning the war on the ground.\n\"You don't have human stories, you don't have faces\u2026 because Israelis are in pain, and the stories also are happening inside of Israel.\"\nMs Elbaz-Phelps believes the reason is that Israelis are still dealing with their trauma, after 7 October.\n\"The word outside is covering Gaza and talking about the suffering of the population in Gaza. Which is right, but there is not, I think, acknowledgement of how much the Israeli people is living in a trauma.\n\"We are not in a post-traumatic area. We are in a trauma time. Hostages are dying inside the tunnels of Hamas. [People are] begging the government to find a way and make a hostage deal.\n\"Only when the hostages will come home, then maybe the healing can start. The pain of the Israeli public, how much they're still on 7 October, is something that is not completely grasped outside of Israel.\"\nToo hard to cope with\nAround 20 Israeli hostages are still believed to be alive in Gaza. Israelis of all political persuasions were horrified by recent videos posted by their captors showing two badly emaciated young men in tunnels under Gaza.\nTheir fate is front and centre of the attitudes of most Israelis to the war.\nI met the pollster Dahlia Scheindlin, who has often criticised Netanyahu's conduct of the war in her column in the liberal daily newspaper Haaretz, in \"hostage square\" next to Israel's military headquarters in Tel Aviv.\nSince October 2023, this has been the centre of the hostage families' campaign to get their people out of Gaza.\n\"The reason why the majority of Israelis consistently support ending the war is to get the hostages back,\" she says.\nSpeaking about the lack of concern in Israel for the people in Gaza, she tells me: \"It's because a large portion of Israelis believe that the suffering has been exaggerated or even partly fabricated by Hamas.\"\nIsraelis, she continues, are inclined to believe that the problem is the messaging. \"Israelis have been obsessed with PR for a long time. They call it Hasbara.\n\"That inclination to blame criticism of Israel on poor public communications has gone into overdrive during the war, and [is] on steroids [in] relation to the accusations of starvation.\n\"The far-right wing calls it the campaign of fabrication. They think [even the way] the Israeli media is starting to cover it is amplifying Hamas' narrative.\n\"But I think mainstream Israelis are sort of suppressing it because it's too hard for them to cope with. This is the kind of thing you hear people say in private conversation.\n\"They are too consumed with the hostages or their own family members who are fighting in Gaza, and they just can't handle the sense that Israel might be doing something wrong.\"\n'It's very easy to judge\u2026'\nOutside the secular Israeli mainstream of Tel Aviv and the cities on the Mediterranean coast, I have found few doubts about the justice of Israel's conduct of the war.\nDeep in the occupied West Bank, down a dirt road, is a Jewish settlement called Esh Kodesh, which is part of a complex of small settlements. Just a generation ago these were a collection of caravans on hilltops, but they are now well established.\nAaron Katzoff, a father of seven who is originally from Los Angeles, has created a winery and a bar called \"Settlers,\" which feels like a small piece of the American west. He labels his wine \"liquid prophecy\".\nIt is a social centre, not just for his community but for an overwhelmingly right-wing and religiously observant clientele who make special journeys there.\nMany of the customers were armed when I visited. A soldier with a dusty uniform sat eating a burger and drinking red wine with his M-16 cradled on his lap. Others had left their assault weapons behind the bar. A woman had a 9mm pistol in a holster strapped on over her flowery dress. The young men at the corner table were, Aaron said, decompressing after a stint in Gaza.\nAaron still does reserve duty as an IDF officer and has fought in Gaza. He has no doubts about the justice of Israel's actions.\n\"Come down to a tunnel in Gaza,\" he told me. \"See what it means not to have oxygen and in the humidity and heat try to fight terrorists that are hiding behind women and children and shoot at you\u2026\n\"It's very easy to sit in an air conditioning room and judge people who do that, war is not easy.\"\nWhat, I asked him, about ending the war now, as so many Israelis want.\n\"Sometimes you can't always get there now... You want everything to be Wonderland... but the world's not like that.\n\"Things take time, and it's sad, but that's reality.\"\nA 'collapse of support' before 7 October\nIn the months leading up to 7 October 2023, thousands of Israelis had been demonstrating in the streets against plans to change the judicial system in what they saw as an assault on democracy.\n\"This has been an unpopular government since well before the war,\" argues Ms Scheindlin.\n\"Once the war began, by contrast to most other countries where you see a rallying of support for the government, there was a complete collapse of support.\"\nEnough of Netanyahu's political base on Israel's right wing accepts his insistence that the war cannot end until total victory over Hamas, for him to have rebuilt his poll ratings from rock bottom. But he is still trailing opposition parties.\nThey have pointed to evidence that they say shows he is prolonging the war to stay in office. As a private citizen he would face a national inquiry into the security failures that gave Hamas its opening on 7 October 2023.\nHis long running trial on corruption charges serious enough to carry a potential prison sentence would also accelerate from its current glacial pace.\nUltranationalists in his coalition, the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and the national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir have threatened to topple his government if he makes any kind of deal with Hamas.\nThey want not just the defeat of Hamas, but the annexation of Gaza, the removal of Palestinians and their replacement by Jewish settlers.\nThe families of the hostages, meanwhile, have appealed to Netanyahu to do a deal with Hamas before the men still being held die.\nBut the prime minister, doubling down on his theme of a fight until total victory, announced a new offensive that has appalled many hostage families and been condemned by many of Israel's allies.\nNetanyahu's plans were also opposed by the current leadership of the IDF. Its chief of staff General Eyal Zamir made it known that he opposes the Netanyahu plan for a new offensive in Gaza, reportedly telling the cabinet that it would endanger the hostages and worsen the humanitarian crisis.\nZamir was appointed in March when his predecessor resigned after falling out with the prime minister over the conduct of the war.\nNow the Israeli media is speculating that Netanyahu will force Zamir to resign. One report says Zamir is convinced he's been \"marked for dismissal\" for challenging Netanyahu's plan.\n'This is like a miracle period'\nThe war has also widened Israel's most bitter division, between the secular population and the religious right. Shuttling between demonstrations by secular Israelis in Tel Aviv and their religious fellow citizens in Jerusalem can feel like commuting between two different countries.\nWar is always painful. But for some in Israel's hardline religious nationalist right wing, it is also an opportunity, even a time of miracles that heralds the coming of the messiah.\nOrit Strock, a minister from Smotrich's Religious Zionism party, said last summer that the war had turned events in their direction. \"From my point of view, this is like a miracle period,\" she said.\nSome see an opening granted by God to transform Israel into a state ruled by the Torah, the law of God as revealed to Moses and laid out in the five books of the Hebrew scriptures.\nWar also can speed up their desire to change the map. They believe God gave all the land between the Mediterranean and the River Jordan to the Jews.\nNo space can be allowed for the shrinking number of Palestinians who still believe it might be possible to make peace with Israel by creating an independent state in Gaza and the West Bank, with a capital in east Jerusalem.\nSmotrich has said the Jewish state should be on both sides of the river Jordan, taking in Jordan and stretching up to Damascus, the Syrian capital.\nExtending religious law is not government policy, nor is expanding Israel's borders across the River Jordan. But blocking a Palestinian state is a cornerstone of the Netanyahu coalition.\nAnd the coalition can only stay in government as long as Smotrich and Ben-Gvir agree to support it. That gives them a disproportionate influence over the prime minister.\nOn 6 May Smotrich laid out his vision for Gaza and the West Bank, which Palestinians want for a state. Most western governments, including the United Kingdom, see Palestinian statehood alongside Israel as the only way to escape a conflict that has lasted more than a century for control of the land Arabs and Jews both want.\nInstead, Smotrich said that within six months Gaza's population would be confined to a narrow piece of land. The rest of the territory would be \"totally destroyed\" and \"empty\".\nPalestinians in Gaza would be \"totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places\".\nTension in the old city\nIn the occupied old city of Jerusalem on Sunday 3 August, many Palestinians shut shops and businesses and stayed off the streets as Israeli Jews marked Tisha B'Av.\nIt is a day of mourning for the destruction by the Babylonians of Jerusalem's first Jewish Temple and of its second one by the Romans.\nThe area where the Temples stood later became the third holiest place for Muslims, now dominated by al-Aqsa mosque where Muslims believe the prophet Muhammad ended his night journey from Mecca, and the golden rotunda of the Dome of the Rock where he ascended to heaven.\nTo try to keep the peace in an area that is a religious and national symbol for Israelis and Palestinians, a set of laws and customs, known as the status quo, is supposed to be observed.\nOne rule bans Jewish prayer within al-Aqsa compound, known by Palestinians as the Noble Sanctuary. It has been flouted in recent years with the encouragement of Ben-Gvir.\nOn Tisha B'Av he went there himself to lead prayers, an action that in the fragile and tense holy city was seen by some as a provocative political move.\nDozens of his followers \u2013 and heavily armed police that he commands as national security minister \u2013 followed as he strode through the narrow street of the Old City, through the gates of the place Israelis call the Temple Mount.\nAs well as praying, he made a speech linking his presence and prayers in Jerusalem to the war in Gaza and the way he wants to change Israel.\nThe videos of the two starving Israeli hostages were, he said, an attempt to put the state of Israel under pressure, which had to be resisted.\n\"From Temple Mount - the place where we proved that sovereignty and governance can be done - from here of all places we should send a message and make sure that today itself we conquer the whole of Gaza Strip, announce sovereignty of the whole of Gaza Strip, take down every Hamas man and encourage voluntary emigration.\n\"Only this way will we return the hostages and win the war.\"\n'We want our house back'\nAfter Ben-Gvir had left, a big crowd of his young religious supporters stayed on to pray in a long, covered arcade.\nThe sound of their prayers echoed off the vaulted stone roof. Two young women, Ateret and Tamar, sad about the religious commemoration but seemingly excited by the future, explained why they believed the Temple Mount was the heart of Judaism.\nAteret said the destruction of the Temples meant, \"it's like having a body, but your heart is not there.\n\"We just want to say that we want our hostages back. We want everybody to have peace. This is the heart of the whole world, not only our hearts. When God will be here the world will have peace.\"\nThey explained they prayed every day for the construction of a third Temple on the site. \"This is our house for thousands of years, and now we're back here, we want our house.\"\nWhen I asked what would happen to the Muslim holy places that stand there now, they said they didn't know.\nAteret and Tamar seemed to be gentle souls, suffused with religious fervour.\nAccording to senior diplomatic sources, the nightmare for security services in both Israel and its Arab neighbours is that a violent Jewish extremist might try to damage al-Aqsa mosque to bring on the third temple, an act that would risk igniting the region.\n'We are torn from inside'\nOn the other end of the political spectrum is Avrum Burg, a writer and strong critic of Netanyahu, who used to be one of Israel's most prominent centre-left politicians. He was speaker of the Knesset, the parliament, from 1999 to 2003 and before that he chaired the Jewish Agency and the World Zionist Organisation, two venerable Zionist institutions.\nToday, he is among those who do not see the war as a miraculous chance to transform the country.\nIsraelis, Mr Burg reflects, are \"somewhere between religious excitement and psychological despair\".\nThere is no middle ground, he argues. \"A few Israelis, a majority of government, believe that we're living in a miraculous time. It's an opportunity. It's God given. It is a once in a lifetime opening in order to realign, reorganise, re-something with history.\n\"And so many Israelis feel and sense \u2013 what for? What does that mean? Why do I have to pay the price? It's a meaningless war. In between, there is no Israel. Israel is a fragmented, broken, torn apart social fabric.\"\nThat psychological despair \u2013 and anger \u2013 at Israel's government can be found at the regular demonstrations calling for Netanyahu's resignation.\nAt one, on a hot and humid night in Tel Aviv, secular opponents of the government waved the blue and white Star of David flag, chanted and banged drums until they stood silent for the national anthem.\nAfter, they listened to speeches from retired veteran commanders of the army and the police demanding a ceasefire.\nBackstage, Nava Rosalio, the organiser of many mass rallies against the Netanyahu government, spelled out their position.\n\"We wish to replace Netanyahu's government, but specifically to bring back all hostages in a deal at once, ending Netanyahu's war in Gaza, which at this point has become completely political and serving nothing but his own political survival, of Netanyahu and his partners.\"\nI suggested some might accuse her of repeating the Hamas position. (For more than a year Hamas negotiators have offered to return all the hostages if the IDF pulled out of Gaza and the US and others guaranteed that the Israel would not go back to war once it had its people back. Israel, however, insists that Hamas must be fully disarmed, play no future role in Gaza and that Israel would retain security control in Gaza with the freedom to decide what comes next.)\nBut Ms Rosalio dismissed the suggestion that a ceasefire deal could be any kind of a win for Hamas. \"That's for propaganda. We have a great army\u2026 which can stay outside of the Gaza Strip and just protect the border.\n\"There is no reason to stay either, unless they imagine or wish to conquer Gaza and to transfer the people of Gaza.\n\"We just don't believe the excuse of we're protecting you, the people of Israel. If you wish to protect us, you would have ended this war to allow the people of Israel to rehabilitate, for society to recover.\n\"We are torn from inside.\"\nIn God's hands\nIn the last three weeks I have travelled between the two sides of Israel, from leftists in Tel Aviv silently protesting the killing of Palestinian children, displaying the \"psychological despair\" described by Avrum Burg, the former speaker of parliament.\nBut on the other side of Israel, I have witnessed an overwhelming sense that Israel should ignore the mounting pressure and condemnation by some of its allies as well as its enemies, a feeling that its actions are justified by everything Hamas did on 7 October and the continued imprisonment of Israeli hostages in brutal conditions in tunnels.\nIsrael's prime minister, still backed in public by US President Donald Trump despite murmurings that he is becoming exasperated by Netanyahu's refusal to make a hostage deal possible, is planning another offensive and accuses Israel's allies of deep seated antisemitism.\nMessianic religious Zionists who support him believe God is with them and granting miracles.\nDeep in the West Bank, overlooking the Jordan Valley, Aaron Katzoff and his friends in the Settlers wine bar believe they are fulfilling the prophecies of the scriptures, as they drink wine from grapes he says proudly were grown using the methods of Biblical times.\nHis relaxed and happy customers believe the secular liberals protesting against Netanyahu in Tel Aviv are yesterday's Israelis. Now, the future of their state is in their hands, and in God's - and they are confident it will all end well.\nLead image: AFP via Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

  "argos_summary": "Russian state\u2011backed broadcaster RT has expanded its international reach over the past three years, establishing bureaus in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Latin America while Western sanctions and bans limit its presence in the West.  The channel tailors its content to local audiences, mixing factual reporting with propaganda that exploits anti\u2011Western sentiment and undermines democratic institutions, according to scholars and media analysts.  In Chile, the regulator has opened proceedings against Telecanal for airing RT content without notice, reflecting a broader trend of Western media withdrawal and budget cuts that create a vacuum RT is filling.  Despite US sanctions on RT executives and accusations of disinformation, the broadcaster claims a global audience of 900\u202fmillion viewers and 23\u202fbillion online views, though experts question those figures and warn of the channel\u2019s subtle influence on public opinion worldwide.",
