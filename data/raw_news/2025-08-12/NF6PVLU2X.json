  "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York Mets slugger Pete Alonso hit his 253rd career homer on Tuesday night, breaking the franchise record held by Darryl Strawberry for 37 years.\n\nThe 30-year-old Alonso drove a 95.1 mph fastball from Atlanta Braves right-hander Spencer Strider just over the wall in right-center for a two-run shot in the third inning. Alonso\u2019s 27th homer of the season lifted the Mets to a 5-1 lead.\n\nThe Mets celebrated the accomplishment with a scoreboard graphic with the number 253 alongside pictures of Alonso and polar bears in honor of the slugger\u2019s nickname. Alonso embraced Brandon Nimmo, who scored ahead of him, and another longtime teammate, on-deck hitter Jeff McNeil, before doffing his cap and blowing kisses to a near-sellout crowd that included New York owner Steve Cohen.\n\nLed by manager Carlos Mendoza, the Mets poured out of the dugout to exchange embraces with Alonso as the crowd chanted his name. Alonso emerged for another curtain call during McNeil\u2019s at-bat.\n\nFollowing the inning, the Mets played the theme from \u201cThe Natural\u201d and Alonso again doffed his cap as the camera lingered on Strawberry\u2019s No. 18 hanging above foul territory in left field at Citi Field.\n\nIt was Alonso\u2019s fifth homer in 10 games this month \u2014 as many as he hit in 43 games from June 10 through July 30. He tied Strawberry\u2019s record by going deep against the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday.\n\nA homegrown star, Alonso broke into the big leagues with a bang in 2019, hitting 53 home runs to set a major league rookie record and establish a franchise high for a single season.\n\nThe five-time All-Star has reached 40 two other times and been one of the most consistent sluggers in baseball since his arrival. After a protracted negotiation, he returned to the Mets as a free agent in February on a $54 million, two-year contract that includes a $24 million player option for 2026 which Alonso likely will decline.\n\nThe only other active players who lead their current franchise in home runs are Manny Machado (Padres) and Mike Trout (Angels).\n\nGiancarlo Stanton, now with the New York Yankees, holds the Miami mark with 267 for the Marlins.\n\nStrawberry broke the previous Mets record with his 155th home run on May 3, 1988, passing Dave Kingman. The sweet-swinging outfielder hit 252 in 1,109 games for New York during his first eight major league seasons from 1983-90. He later played for the Dodgers, Giants and Yankees, finishing his 17-year career with 335 homers.\n\nAlonso played his 965th regular-season game Tuesday. The durable first baseman has played in 372 straight, a team record.\n\nThe Diamondbacks and Padres are the lone major league teams who haven\u2019t had a player hit more than 252 homers for them. Luis Gonzalez holds the Arizona record with 224, and Machado entered Tuesday with 187 for San Diego.",

We\u2019re getting more tests done and hopefully this is not going to be a long-term thing.\u201d\nEspada added that they don\u2019t yet know the severity of the injury and should know more after additional testing.\nEspada said he would not name a closer to fill in while Hader is out, but would use his relievers based on matchups.\n\u201cI feel good about all those guys,\u201d Espada said.\nHader, who is in his second season in Houston, is 6-2 with a 2.05 ERA and is tied for third in the majors with 28 saves in 48 appearances this season.\nTo take his spot on the roster, the AL West-leading Astros reinstated right-hander Shawn Dubin from the 15-day injured list. They also designated right-hander Hector Neris for assignment and recalled left-hander Colton Gordon from Triple-A Sugar Land.\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb"

He posted a 12.05 ERA in six rehab appearances and was 3-2 with a 6.38 ERA in eight games, including seven starts, for the Mets.\nMontas has not pitched more than 5 2/3 innings for the Mets, who haven\u2019t gotten more than six innings out of a starter \u2014 with the exception of David Peterson \u2014 since June 7. In that span, New York is 22-31.\nThe Mets have lost seven straight games heading into Tuesday\u2019s series opener against the Atlanta Braves and trail NL East-leading Philadelphia by six games.\nMontas last pitched Saturday against MLB-leading Milwaukee, throwing 72 pitches and allowing three runs, one earned, in three innings. He worked his usual side session Tuesday and was expected to be available in the bullpen starting Thursday.\nMontas hasn\u2019t pitched out of the bullpen regularly since his rookie season with the Oakland Athletics in 2017.\n\u201cWe just need to see consistency \u2014 and he\u2019ll be the first one that tells you,\u201d Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a battle for him, health-wise. And then after he got back, we saw flashes for a couple of outings, but then it\u2019s been a battle. And he understands where we\u2019re at in the season and that\u2019s why we made the decision.\u201d\nMendoza said New York has not made a decision who will take Montas\u2019 spot in the rotation on Saturday against Seattle.\nThe Mets are currently without a long man in the bullpen with the injured Paul Blackburn scheduled to make another minor league rehab appearance Wednesday. That could lead to New York to promote one of two prospects \u2014 Nolan McLean or Brandon Sproat \u2014 from Triple-A Syracuse.\nMcLean last pitched Sunday. The 24-year-old right-hander, selected in the third round of the 2023 draft, is 8-5 with a 2.45 ERA and 127 strikeouts in 113 2/3 innings in 21 games, including 18 starts, this year at Syracuse and Double-A Binghamton.\nSproat, a 24-year-old righty who was a second-round pick in 2023, last pitched Thursday. He is 7-5 with a 4.10 ERA and 86 strikeouts in 101 innings in 22 starts for Syracuse.\nMcLean has pitched at least six innings 10 times, while Sproat has gone six innings in five appearances.\n\u201cThey are in the conversation, we just haven\u2019t decided who the guy is,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where it goes. But whoever comes up here, if it\u2019s one of the prospects, the plan is to give them a good look here.\u201d\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb"
