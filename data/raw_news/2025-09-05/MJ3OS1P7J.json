  "content": "The average rent being advertised across Britain hit a record high of \u00a31,577 per month in August, according to a leading property website.\n\nData reveals London as the most expensive area to rent and the North East as the cheapest.\n\nAverage advertised rents were 3% higher than a year earlier, with a constrained supply of homes contributing to rising rents, Rightmove said.\n\nWhile the number of available homes to rent across Britain is 8% higher than a year earlier, it is still 27% lower than in August 2019, the website added.\n\nAverage advertised rents are rising fastest in the north-west England, with average rents around 10% higher than a year earlier, and slowest in London, where average rents are 2% higher annually.\n\nHere are average advertised rents per month in August and the annual increase, according to Rightmove:\n\nColleen Babcock, a property expert at Rightmove said: \u201cThere are challenges for both tenants and landlords in the current market.\n\n\u201cWhile tenants looking to move have more choice and less competition from other tenants compared with a few years ago, some may still find their options limited with rents at record levels.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cLandlords provide vital homes to tenants and have already faced an increase in taxation through stamp duty changes.\n\n\u201cIt is essential that it remains attractive and viable to be a landlord so that tenants have comfortable places to live.\n\n\u201cIf more landlords are driven out of the sector by more and more taxation, it will be tenants who lose out in the long run.\u201d",
