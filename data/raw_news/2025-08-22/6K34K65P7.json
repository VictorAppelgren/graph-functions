  "description": "Karmelo Anthony faces first-degree murder charge for allegedly stabbing Austin Metcalf at Frisco track meet, case sparks nationwide controversy and debate",
  "content": "The judge in the murder trial against Karmelo Anthony, accused of stabbing Frisco, Texas teen track star Austin Metcalf to death in April, has issued a gag order in the case. Collin County Judge John Roach issued the order, citing pre-trial publicity that could affect the outcome of the case, according to FOX 4. The public will not hear from attorneys, witnesses, law enforcement or any other entities related to the case until after the trial, scheduled for June 2026, is over. TRIAL DATE SET FOR AUSTIN METCALF\u2019S SUSPECTED KILLER IN TRACK MEET STABBINGThe alleged murder and the events thereafter set off a firestorm nationwide, sparking outrage over Metcalf's death. Metcalf, 17, a student at Memorial High School, was participating in a track championship event at Kuykendall Stadium in Frisco when he was stabbed to death. Anthony, then 17, was taken into custody almost immediately and charged with murder. His bond was set at $1 million, and he was initially held in the Collin County Jail.Anthony was a student at Centennial High School, but did not participate in the track meet that day. The stabbing was allegedly preceded by a dispute inside the Memorial High School tent. Metcalf died in the arms of his brother, Hunter. \"My son is gone, and he'll never come home again,\" Jeff Metcalf said on the program. \"Austin was the light of my life.\"Metcalf discussed the bond between Austin and his twin brother, Hunter. \"They were so tight. They had the best bond. They were best friends,\" Metcalf said of the pair. \"And now, I have to focus on taking care of Hunter.\"Fox News Digital obtained Anthony's arrest report, which detailed the circumstances under which he was detained. A school resource officer was the first on scene, and detained him without incident. \"I gave the suspect instructions to keep his hands up in the air. During this time, the suspect said verbally out loud, \u2018I was protecting myself,\u2019\" the report from the responding resource officer said. \"It should be noted that I had not questioned him about the incident when he made that comment.\"AUSTIN METCALF'S ACCUSED KILLER NEEDS SUPPORT FIGHTING 'WHITE SUPREMACY' AFTER MURDER INDICTMENT: SPOXAnthony said Metcalf \"put his hands on him.\"When Anthony overheard a group of officers saying he \"allegedly\" killed Metcalf, he said \"I'm not alleged; I did it,\" according to the report. He asked officers if Metcalf would be OK, and whether what he did could be considered self-defense. In the wake of the stabbing, Anthony's mother, Kayla Hayes, established a GiveSendGo campaign for her son's defense. Less than a week after the stabbing, the fund had reached about $150,000. The crowdfunding campaign has been a source of contention since it was created as tensions have flared in the case.\"As a family of faith, we are deeply grateful for all of your support during this trying period,\" the Anthony family said in a statement on GiveSendGo. \"Your prayers and assistance mean more to us now more than ever.\"The fund has garnered just shy of $550,000. Its goal is more than $1.3 million.Fox News Digital obtained an arrest report describing a heated seating dispute in the Memorial High School track tent. A witness told police that Metcalf ordered Anthony to leave the team's tent, before Anthony said he \"grabbed his bag, opened it and reached inside it\" and said, \"Touch me and see what happens.\"\"Austin stood up and pushed the male to get him out of the tent,\" the arrest report said.That's when police allege Anthony pulled out a knife and stabbed Metcalf to death.AUSTIN METCALF\u2019S SUSPECTED KILLER INDICTED ON FIRST-DEGREE MURDER CHARGE IN TRACK MEET STABBINGAnthony's then-attorneys, Bill Clark of the Clark Law Firm and Kim Cole of K Cole Law, asked for a reduction of the $1 million bond, calling it \"excessive.\"Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis announced that Anthony could not face the death penalty or life without parole under Texas state law because he was a juvenile at the time of the alleged crime.Anthony's family hired his current attorney, Mike Howard, who successfully argued for Anthony's bond to be reduced to $250,000. Anthony was released on bond and required to wear an ankle monitor and remain on house arrest unless granted permission to leave by a judge. \"Every Texan has the right to defend themselves when they reasonably fear for their life,\" Howard said. \"Self-defense is a protection that applies to each and every one of us. There are two sides to every story.\"\"This is a tragedy all the way around for both families,\" he added. \"Rushing to judgment, trial by public perception, and trial by media is not how we ensure justice is done. We are confident that, after a full investigation, that the truth will come out.\"SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS FATAL STABBING OF AUSTIN METCALF AT TEXAS TRACK MEET, OFFICIALS SAYThe Anthony family retained the New Generation Action Network (NGAN) to speak on their behalf. The group is headed by Dominique Alexander, a stalwart Black Lives Matter and defund the police activist with a prior criminal history.NGAN largely injected race into the conversation about Anthony's arrest. At the April 17 news conference, Jeff Metcalf showed up to attend. The event was open to the public. However, he was removed by Dallas Police under the threat of criminal trespass charges. Alexander blasted the elder Metcalf during the conference. \"What we've seen at the beginning of this press conference, of the father being at this press conference, these are my words \u2014 don't quote anybody \u2014 is a disrespect to the dignity of his son,\" Alexander said. SUSPECT IN AUSTIN METCALF KILLING MOVED TO 'UNDISCLOSED LOCATION' FOR PROTECTION: FAMILY SPOKESMAN\"Next Generation Action Network from the beginning has respected the loss of life, no matter our opinion of it. We have kept our opinion close,\" he said. \"We have not attacked. We have not shared the information that was shared with us about Austin Metcalf because we respect the dignity of life and loss.\"That was disrespectful and just shows you all the character,\" Alexander said. \"He was not invited. He knows that it's inappropriate to be near this family, but he did it. So, I say to people, actions speak louder than words.\"\"What he has felled [sic] into is the political operatives that want to make this thing a political thing of hate and yet bigotry and yet racism,\" he said. \"We have conservative operatives that have been posting nonstop about this case.\" Citing people loitering near the Anthony home, mailing them flyers, and unwanted pizza deliveries, the Anthony family moved to a new location. \"We are sharing images and documentation of the threats the family has faced this past weekend to make the public aware of the dangerous atmosphere that has been created \u2014 an atmosphere fueled by organized hate, systemic racism, and intentional misinformation,\" NGAN said.Collin County Judge Angela Tucker, who lowered Anthony's bail, was doxxed, with people posting personal information about her.\"Due to the nature of the situation, we are coordinating with the FBI and our Fusion Center to monitor for any concerning rhetoric or propaganda that could incite violence,\" the Collin County Sheriff's Office said at the time.After Alexander and NGAN verbally attacked Jeff Metcalf for a second time, Austin's father responded.\"I don't allow [Alexander] to live rent free in my mind,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"It really doesn't matter about the lies this man spreads. He just wants more attention. Don't give it to him. Justicer [sic] will prevail.\" Alexander returned to discussing the April 17 news conference via a video posted to his social media account.\"This press conference wasn't organized by him,\" Alexander said. \"This press conference wasn't about him. This press conference didn't invite him. Yet at the end of the day, it's a criminal case y'all.\"SELF-DEFENSE CLAIM IN AUSTIN METCALF SLAYING IS 'UPHILL BATTLE': EXPERTAlexander then launched into a tirade about those online who have criticized him for his past criminal behavior and posted his past mugshots.\"I really don't care what no one says about me, I really don't,\" he said. \"I don't care about the racist p----- who want to say something about Dominique and say something about my past. I really, quite frankly, don't. If you know me, you know your attacks towards me only do one thing: boost my ego. The reality is, I really don't, quite frankly, give a damn.\"Frisco ISD said that despite first-degree murder charges, Anthony would be allowed to graduate on May 22, though he would not be allowed to attend the ceremony. He was not expelled from school despite allegedly stabbing another Frisco ISD student to death. Superintendent Mike Waldrip took offense to social media rumors that Anthony would be able to attend the graduation ceremony. \"Frisco ISD has learned that misinformation is being shared regarding Centennial High School\u2019s graduation via several media outlets and perpetuated through social media,\" he told WFAA. \"It is disheartening that the incredible accomplishments and achievements of our Centennial seniors may be dampened by needless fearmongering, attention-seeking and media vitriol. Our students, staff and community deserve better.\"NGAN also weighed in. \"We are proud to share that Karmelo Anthony will graduate and receive his high school diploma, and that his academic achievements will not be disrupted,\" Alexander said. Anthony was indicted for his alleged murder of Metcalf.\"For weeks, my team has been presenting evidence to the grand jury. Today, I summarized that evidence, and I asked the Grand Jury to return a first-degree murder indictment against Karmelo Anthony \u2014 which they did,\" Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis said. Jeff Metcalf told Fox News Digital that though he was pleased with the indictment, nothing will bring his son back.\"I am pleased that we are moving forward,\" he said. \"With the first-degree murder indictment, it now goes into the court system. I fully believe that justice will be served for Austin Metcalf. I look forward to the forthcoming trial. But it will never bring my son back.\"Howard, Anthony's attorney, downplayed the indictment. TEXAS PRESS CONFERENCE IN AUSTIN METCALF KILLING DEVOLVES INTO CHAOS OVER TRACK MEET STABBING\"Today's indictment is an expected and routine step in the legal process,\" he said, adding that there is an indictment in nearly every felony case. \"To the racists, the bigots, and those filled with hate who\u2019ve targeted Karmelo, his family, and even myself \u2013 you do not intimidate us. We are not backing down,\" Alexander said. \"This case is yet another example of what it means to be Black in America, where even our self-defense is questioned, scrutinized and politicized. My involvement \u2013 like many others \u2013 came as a direct response to the overwhelming hate, threats and outside influence that have surrounded this case since day one.\"He then asked Anthony's supporters for prayers, to support due process, and to \"[s]tand with us in the fight against white supremacy.\"Anthony's trial date was set for June 1, 2026. Roach, the Collin County judge on the case, issued a gag order amid concerns that continued press coverage might jeopardize a fair trial.Prosecutors, defense attorneys, the Metcalf family and Alexander have remained silent since the gag order took effect.

He was freed from the Collin County Jail after his bond was reduced from $1 million to $250,000 last Monday. He is charged with first-degree murder.\nGRIEVING TEXAS FATHER SPEAKS OUT AFTER SON WAS STABBED TO DEATH AT HIGH SCHOOL TRACK MEET\nAccording to the release, the threats include people loitering and taking photos of the Anthony family's current residence, unwanted food deliveries that NGAN said were \"made to disturb and harass the family\" and a mailing of Metcalf's obituary to the home, which was also described as \"disturbing.\"\n\"We are sharing images and documentation of the threats the family has faced this past weekend to make the public aware of the dangerous atmosphere that has been created \u2014 an atmosphere fueled by organized hate, systemic racism, and intentional misinformation,\" the group said.\nTEXAS TRACK MEET STABBING SUSPECT TOLD RESPONDING OFFICERS HE \u2018DID IT\u2019: DOCS\n\"It is both heartbreaking and infuriating to see the depths of hate and bigotry still alive and well in our society,\" NGAN president Dominique Alexander said. \"No family should have to live under siege simply because they are demanding their constitutional rights. We will not be silent, and we will not back down. We are committed to doing whatever is necessary to protect this family and to ensure that justice is pursued without intimidation or fear.\"\nThe Frisco Police Department told Fox News Digital, \"our department does not have any reported cases involving the Anthony family being threatened.\"\nLast week, Alexander held a press conference where Anthony's mother, Kayla Hayes, spoke for the first time since her son's arrest. Jeff Metcalf, Austin's father, tried to attend the conference, and was swiftly removed from the property by Dallas police.\nAlexander criticized Jeff Metcalf at the outset of the conference.\n\"What we've seen at the beginning of this press conference, of the father being at this press conference, these are my words \u2014 don't quote anybody \u2014 is a disrespect to the dignity of his son,\" he said.\n\"Next Generation Action Network from the beginning has respected the loss of life, no matter our opinion of it.

We have not shared the information that was shared with us about Austin Metcalf because we respect the dignity of life and loss.\"\nAlexander later brought up the issue of race.\n\"Because these racist bigots try to prevent us from standing up for our baby, our boy, he should be afforded the same rights that Kyle Rittenhouse had, Daniel Penny and all the people who have claimed whatever their defense was \u2013 he should be afforded the same right,\" Alexander said.\n\"Nobody in the public media has one video, but we got the video of Kyle Rittenhouse with an AK-47 shooting three people in the back,\" he said. \"We got that, and he raised more than $2 million publicly, and nobody said anything about that.\"\nThat night, Jeff Metcalf's home was swatted.\nOver the weekend, a \"Protect White Americans\" rally was held in Frisco. It was hosted by Jake Lang, best known for his imprisonment after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack at the U.S. Capitol.\nLang, who is from Florida and is now running for U.S. Senate, was reportedly admonished by Jeff Metcalf over the phone during the rally.\n\"You\u2019re trying to create more race divide than bridging the gap,\" Metcalf told Lang, according to The Dallas Morning News.\nFox News Digital reached out to Lang.\nMetcalf has tried to tone down the political rhetoric since the April 2 stabbing.\nHe previously told Fox News, \"I want to clarify something right off to start because I've already heard some rumors and gossip.

I don\u2019t think it's a surprise to see that,\" said Wilson. \"One of the things that potential jurors are asked is if they have seen media coverage of the case and that impacts how they view the case.\"\nRussell Wilson also tells FOX 4\u2019s Peyton Yager that there may be additional information that may come out at those public hearings, but the parties will not be able to tell us in advance what they are anticipating during the trial.\nIf they do, there could be consequences.\nDig deeper:\nThe Next Generation Action Network shared a statement acknowledging the gag order shortly after it was issued.\n\"From the very beginning of this case, our organization has been clear and consistent in our position: we have no interest in trying this case in the court of public opinion. Our role has always been to advocate for justice, protect the integrity of the legal process, and ensure that Karmelo Anthony is afforded a fair and unbiased trial,\" NGAN said.\nDespite speaking on behalf of the Anthony family in the past and the term \"spokesperson\" being included in the judge's order, NGAN founder Dominque Alexander said the gag order doesn't apply to his organization because it \"is not a party to the legal proceedings and has not been sworn into court.\"\nAlexander said NGAN will continue working to ensure that Anthony's rights are upheld and that racial bias and hate are not a factor.\n\"This case must be tried in a courtroom not through headlines, hashtags, or hateful narratives.

      "text": "Amid an ongoing investigation over the fatal stabbing of high school student Austin Metcalf at a Frisco, Texas, track meet, the school district announced it has surveillance footage of the stabbing.\nThe Frisco Independent School District confirmed to Fox News Digital that it possesses surveillance footage of the April 2 incident at Kuykendall Stadium but will not be publicly releasing the video.\nThe fatal altercation between 17-year-old Metcalf of Memorial High School and allegedly 17-year-old Karmelo Anthony, a student at Frisco Centennial High School, unfolded during a rain delay on April 2 at the district track and field championship.\nAnthony is facing first-degree murder charges.\nTEXAS PRESS CONFERENCE IN AUSTIN METCALF KILLING DEVOLVES INTO CHAOS OVER TRACK MEET STABBING\nAuthorities say that Anthony fatally stabbed Metcalf in the chest. Though the two students reportedly had no prior relationship, a brief altercation escalated quickly.\nAn arrest report obtained by Fox News sheds new light on the pre-stabbing clash after Metcalf reportedly told Anthony that he needed to move out of the Memorial team's tent, a witness told Frisco police. The report noted that Anthony \"grabbed his bag, opened it and reached inside it\" and said, \"Touch me and see what happens.\"\n\"Austin stood up and pushed the male to get him out of the tent,\" the arrest report said.\nSUSPECTED TEXAS TRACK MEET KILLER EXPECTED TO WALK FREE AFTER BOND SLASHED\nThe witness told police that Anthony then \"reached into his bag and the male took a knife out of the bag and stabbed Austin,\" per the report. The witness then told the officer that Anthony left the scene after the stabbing. Metcalf, 17, died in his twin brother's arms.\nAnthony was arrested at the scene and has since been charged with first-degree murder. He and his supporters say he acted in self-defense and that Metcalf pushed him out of the tent.\nHis bond has since dropped from $1 million to $250,000. His bond conditions include house arrest and an ankle monitor, and he will only be able to leave his home with the judge's permission.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital's Peter D'Abrosca contributed to this report."

He is accused of stabbing Metcalf to death at a track meet April 2.\n\"What we can share is that Mr. Karmelo Anthony, his family, his legal team, and his broader support team are looking forward to the opportunity to present the facts in a court of law,\" the Next Generation Action Network (NGAN), whose president, Dominique Alexander, acts as a spokesperson for the Anthony family, told Fox News Digital Thursday.\nSURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS FATAL STABBING OF AUSTIN METCALF AT TEXAS TRACK MEET, OFFICIALS SAY\n\"We have full confidence in Attorney Mike Howard and his ability to represent Mr. Anthony in this matter,\" the group said.\nHoward declined to comment Thursday.\nMetcalf was 17 when he was stabbed to death during a scuffle inside the Memorial High School track team's tent at the meet.\nAnthony was arrested on school property minutes after the stabbing and was indicted on first-degree murder charges June 24.\n\"For weeks, my team has been presenting evidence to the grand jury. Today, I summarized that evidence, and I asked the grand jury to return a first-degree murder indictment against Karmelo Anthony \u2014 which they did,\" Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis said in response to the indictment.\n\"With that indictment, the case now moves formally into the court system,\" he said. \"From this point forward, we\u2019ll continue doing our part \u2014 fully and fairly \u2014 to pursue justice under the law. The trial schedule will be set by the court. But when the time comes, we\u2019ll be ready.\"\nHoward responded to the indictment with a message of his own.\n\"Today's indictment is an expected and routine step in the legal process,\" he said, adding there is an indictment in nearly every felony case.\nSUSPECT IN AUSTIN METCALF KILLING MOVED TO 'UNDISCLOSED LOCATION' FOR PROTECTION: FAMILY SPOKESMAN\n\"We expect that when the full story is heard, the prosecution will not be able to rule out the reasonable doubt that Karmelo Anthony may have acted in self-defense,\" he said.\nThe arrest report from the incident said Anthony \"grabbed his bag, opened it and reached inside it\" and told Metcalf, \"Touch me and see what happens.\"\nA witness told police that Anthony then \"reached into his bag, and the male took a knife out of the bag and stabbed Austin.\"\nThe witness told the officer Anthony fled after the stabbing. Metcalf died in his twin brother's arms.\nAnthony allegedly told the responding school resource officer, who cuffed him upon his arrival, that he was protecting himself. The officer also noted blood on Anthony's left middle finger.\nOne officer who responded referred to Anthony as the alleged suspect, and Anthony made a \"spontaneous statement,\" according to the report.\n\"I'm not alleged. I did it,\" he allegedly said.\nInitially, Anthony was held in the Collin County Jail on a $1 million bond, which was later reduced to $250,000. He bonded out of jail and is on house arrest.\nSELF-DEFENSE CLAIM IN AUSTIN METCALF SLAYING IS 'UPHILL BATTLE': EXPERT\nAfter the alleged murder, the Anthony family set up a GoFundMe, and donations poured in from across the country, sparking controversy and questions about how the money would be spent. To date, that fundraiser has accrued more than $544,000.\nSoon after, the Anthony family hired Alexander of the Dallas-based NGAN as their spokesperson. Alexander has a history of Black Lives Matter activism and has called for defunding the police.\nHe has injected race into the case from the beginning.\n\"To the racists, the bigots and those filled with hate who\u2019ve targeted Karmelo, his family and even myself \u2013 you do not intimidate us,\" Alexander said after Anthony's indictment. \"We are not backing down.\n\"This case is yet another example of what it means to be Black in America, where even our self-defense is questioned, scrutinized and politicized. My involvement \u2014 like many others \u2014 came as a direct response to the overwhelming hate, threats and outside influence that have surrounded this case since day one.\"\nAt a chaotic press conference that followed Anthony's bond release, Alexander slammed Jeff Metcalf, Austin's father, who attempted to attend the event.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"What we've seen at the beginning of this press conference, of the father being at this press conference, these are my words \u2014 don't quote anybody \u2014 is a disrespect to the dignity of his son,\" Alexander said at the time.\n\"What he has felled [sic] into is the political operatives that want to make this thing a political thing of hate and yet bigotry and yet racism,\" he said. \"We have conservative operatives that have been posting nonstop about this case.\"\nJeff Metcalf did not immediately return a comment request."

      "text": "Chaos unfolded during a press conference in Dallas Thursday afternoon as the spokesman for Karmelo Anthony's family took jabs at Austin Metcalf's father, who was escorted from the site of the event before it began.\nAnthony is accused of fatally stabbing fellow 17-year-old Austin Metcalf at an April 2 high school track meet in Frisco, Texas.\nJeff Metcalf, Austin's father, attempted to attend the news conference Thursday led by Dominique Alexander, the head of the Next Generation Action Network, an activist group speaking on Anthony's behalf.\nTEEN SUSPECT FREE ON BOND AFTER ALLEGEDLY STABBING TEXAS TRACK STAR AUSTIN METCALF TO DEATH\nMetcalf confirmed to Fox News Digital he was escorted from the event under the threat of criminal trespass charges.\n\"The preliminary investigation determined that one person was asked to leave the location and did so without incident,\" the Dallas Police Department told Fox News Digital. \"No offense was reported.\"\nAnthony is facing first-degree murder charges for allegedly stabbing Metcalf to death during a dispute under a tent at a track meet.\nHe was released from the Collin County Jail after his bond was reduced from $1 million to $250,000.\nThe news conference addressed more than $450,000 in GiveSendGo funds that have been donated to the Anthony family after his arrest and rumors the money was being spent improperly. The second focus was supposed to be Anthony's mother, Kayla Hayes, who read a statement on behalf of the family that was prepared by attorneys.\nBut the event devolved into accusations of racism and bigotry, along with Alexander's admonishment of Jeff Metcalf before either topic was even discussed.\n\"What we've seen at the beginning of this press conference, of the father being at this press conference, these are my words \u2014 don't quote anybody \u2014 is a disrespect to the dignity of his son,\" Alexander said.\n\"Next Generation Action Network from the beginning has respected the loss of life, no matter our opinion of it. We have kept our opinion close,\" he said. \"We have not attacked. We have not shared the information that was shared with us about Austin Metcalf because we respect the dignity of life and loss.\nGRIEVING TEXAS FATHER SPEAKS OUT AFTER SON WAS STABBED TO DEATH AT HIGH SCHOOL TRACK MEET\n\"That was disrespectful and just shows you all the character,\" Alexander said. \"He was not invited. He knows that it's inappropriate to be near this family, but he did it. So, I say to people, actions speak louder than words.\"\nAlexander said Jeff Metcalf wanted to focus on politics and bigotry.\n\"What he has felled [sic] into is the political operatives that want to make this thing a political thing of hate and yet bigotry and yet racism,\" he said. \"We have conservative operatives that have been posting nonstop about this case.\"\nHe then moved onto the issue of the online fundraiser.\nAlexander said none of the money from the GiveSendGo has been spent, and any suggestion otherwise is \"intentional disinformation.\"\n\"Let's be clear,\" he said. \"The family has not received one dime.\"\nAlexander then ranted about the Frisco Independent School District's plans to expel Anthony a month before graduation. He noted that Anthony has a 3.7 GPA, and that even if he didn't go to class for the rest of the year, he would still be able to graduate.\nTHE STABBING DEATH OF AUSTIN METCALF DEVASTATED OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY, SAYS GREG WILLIS\nHe also appeared to subtly shift blame for Metcalf's death from Anthony to the school district, intimating that the school should have canceled the April 2 track meet in the first place because of inclement weather.\n\"Because as a person who is the administrator of yet children, you are responsible for the safety of the children,\" he said. \"And so it seems as if Frisco ISD is trying to push this off by making [the decision to expel Anthony] that they do not have to make.\"\n\"While Frisco ISD cannot comment on an individual student's disciplinary record due to student privacy law, we can provide general information about district protocol and relevant law,\" a spokesperson for the district told Fox News Digital.\n\"If the school recommends expulsion, which means the student is removed from school, the student is not allowed to go on any Frisco ISD property while the decision is being made,\" the spokesperson said. \"A meeting will be held where the student can share their side of the story and show any evidence. After the meeting, the district will decide whether to go through with the expulsion and will let the student and parents know.\"\nBefore finally turning the conference over to Hayes, Alexander commented on Judge Angela Tucker, a Black Republican presiding over the case.\n\"But the ugly attacks on her just shows Black America that no matter what you pick in the ballot box \u2014 and that is your constitutional right \u2014 it's people out here reminding us of the Black struggle in America.\"\nTEXAS TRACK MEET STABBING SUSPECT TOLD RESPONDING OFFICERS HE \u2018DID IT\u2019: DOCS\nAn emotional Hayes spoke only briefly.\n\"Our family has been under attack,\" she said. \"Whatever you think, what happened between Karmelo and the Metcalf boy, my three younger children, my husband and I didn't do anything to deserve to be threatened, harassed and lied about.\"\nShe said such lies have put her family in danger, along with the community and those involved in the investigation.\n\"Our address and my husband's previous employer's address has been put on all social media platforms,\" she said. \"My husband had to take a leave of absence because he's afraid of what may happen to our family.\"\nShe said her husband's mental health is deteriorating, and her daughter is afraid to sleep in her own bed.\nHayes echoed Alexander's sentiment that the GiveSendGo funds have not been used by the family at all.\nAfter Hayes spoke, Alexander returned to the issue of race.\n\"Because these racist bigots try to prevent us from standing up for our baby, our boy, he should be afforded the same rights that Kyle Rittenhouse had, Daniel Penny and all the people who have claimed whatever their defense was \u2013 he should be afforded the same right,\" Alexander said.\n\"Nobody in the public media has one video, but we got the video of Kyle Rittenhouse with an AK-47 shooting three people in the back,\" he said. \"We got that, and he raised more than $2 million publicly, and nobody said anything about that.\"\nJeff Metcalf previously told Fox News, \"I want to clarify something right off to start because I've already heard some rumors and gossip. This was not a race thing. This is not a political thing.\n\"Do not politicize this. It's not \u2026 this is a human being thing. This person made a bad choice and affected both his family and my family forever.\"\nMetcalf added that \"Austin was the light of my life.\"\nHe said on \"America Reports\" that Austin died in the arms of his twin brother, Hunter, who desperately tried to stop the bleeding.\n\"They were so tight. They had the best bond. They were best friends,\" Metcalf said of the pair. \"And now I have to focus on taking care of Hunter.\"\nMetcalf also mentioned forgiveness.\n\"People ask me, how can you forgive this other person? I said I forgive the other person because the forgiveness is not for him. The forgiveness is for me so I can have peace,\" he said. \"His life is destroyed. My life is destroyed.\"\nMetcalf was killed after an altercation under a Memorial High School tent at the track meet. The arrest report from the incident said Anthony \"grabbed his bag, opened it and reached inside it\" and told Metcalf, \"Touch me and see what happens.\"\nIn the next moment, a witness told police, Anthony \"reached into his bag and the male took a knife out of the bag and stabbed Austin.\"\nThe witness told the officer Anthony fled after the stabbing. Metcalf died in his twin brother's arms.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAnthony told the responding school resource officer, who cuffed him upon arrival, he was protecting himself. The officer also noted blood on Anthony's left middle finger.\nOne responding officer referred to Anthony as the alleged suspect. Anthony made a \"spontaneous statement,\" according to the report, saying, \"I'm not alleged, I did it.\"\nAnthony also asked the officers if Metcalf was \"going to be OK\" and asked if what happened could be considered \"self-defense,\" the report said.\nFox News Digital's Madison Colombo contributed to this report."

According to police, Anthony responded by stabbing Metcalf in the chest.\nRendelman stressed that the public does not know all the facts in the case, but said that, given what she's read, Anthony does not have a clear-cut self-defense claim.\n\"If the scenario is\u2026 that the victim told [Anthony] to leave, and then in some way physically touched him without more, then I'm not comfortable \u2013 I don't believe that a self-defense claim will work,\" she said.\nAnthony was released from the Collin County Jail on Monday, April 14, after his bond was reduced from $1 million to $250,000.\nRendelman said such an outcome would be unlikely where she practices law, because New York tends to set very high bail, if not remand, for any type of murder allegations, but that in most states, offering monetary bail to homicide suspects is common.\n\"I'll also add that this case does involve a 17-year-old who's never been in trouble,\" she said. \"And [the court] did add conditions, so it wasn't that they were just reducing the bail. They reduced it with the ankle monitor, with the housing confinement limited to going to\u2026 necessary appointments, [and] that he has to report [to the judge]. So it wasn't a reduction without any conditions.\"\nShe also addressed the widening divide between those who support Metcalf and those who support Anthony. The case has become a flash point partly because of a GiveSendGo fundraiser for the suspected killer, which has accrued nearly $500,000 in donations.\n\"I feel incredible sympathy for the victim's family,\" Rendelman said. \"Because no matter how you look at it, he's still a 17-year-old boy who was kind of at the beginning of his life.\"\nShe acknowledged how difficult it must be for the Metcalf family not only to deal with the tragic loss of their son, but to see their son's alleged killer raising money from the ordeal.\n\"At the same time, the defendant has a right to due process, has a family that supports him, and his day in court will come,\" she said.\nOn Thursday, Anthony's family made their first public comments during a news conference that went off the rails when their activist spokesman, Dominique Alexander, began criticizing Austin's father, Jeff Metcalf, who attended the news conference. The event was supposed to focus on how the GiveSendGo funds are being used.\nJeff Metcalf showed up before it began, but was threatened with criminal charges and escorted off the property by Dallas Police officers.\nGRIEVING TEXAS FATHER SPEAKS OUT AFTER SON WAS STABBED TO DEATH AT HIGH SCHOOL TRACK MEET\n\"What we've seen at the beginning of this press conference, of the father being at this press conference, these are my words \u2013 don't quote anybody \u2013 is a disrespect to the dignity of his son,\" Alexander said.\n\"Next Generation Action Network from the beginning has respected the loss of life, no matter our opinion of it. We have kept our opinion close,\" he said. \"We have not attacked. We have not shared the information that was shared with us about Austin Metcalf because we respect the dignity of life and loss.\"\n\"That was disrespectful and just shows you all the character,\" Alexander said. \"He was not invited. He knows that it's inappropriate to be near this family, but he did it. So, I say to people, actions speak louder than words.\"\nJett Metcalf previously told Fox News, \"This person made a bad choice and affected both his family and my family forever.\"\nHe said Austin, who died in his twin brother's arms, \"was the light of my life.\"\n\"People ask me, how can you forgive this other person? I said I forgive the other person because the forgiveness is not for him,\" he said. \"The forgiveness is for me so I can have peace. His life is destroyed. My life is destroyed.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Frisco Police Department (FPD) released a statement two days after the stabbing asking people not to spread \"disinformation, hate, fear and division.\"\nOn Friday, the department declined to comment further.\nFox News Digital reached out to Anthony's attorney."
