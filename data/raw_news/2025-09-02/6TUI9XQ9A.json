  "description": "Sunday night\u2019s powerful magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck several provinces, causing extensive damage. It flattened villages and trapped people under the rubble of homes constructed mostly of mud bricks and wood that were unable to withstand the shock.",
  "content": "A partially collapsed house is seen in an area devastated by Sunday\u2019s powerful 6.0-magnitude earthquake that killed many people and destroyed villages in eastern Afghanistan, in Dara Noor, Kunar province, Tuesday.\n\nThe Taliban said the death toll from a major earthquake in eastern Afghanistan passed 1,400 on Tuesday, with more than 3,000 people injured, as the United Nations warned of an exponential rise in casualties.\n\nThe figures provided by Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid were just for the province of Kunar.\n\nSunday night\u2019s powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck several provinces, causing extensive damage. It flattened villages and trapped people under the rubble of homes constructed mostly of mud bricks and wood that were unable to withstand the shock.\n\nRough terrain is hampering rescue and relief efforts, forcing Taliban authorities to air drop dozens of commandos to evacuate the injured from places where helicopters cannot land.\n\nAn aftershock of 5.2 close to the epicenter of Sunday\u2019s quake rattled the country, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of damage.\n\nIndrika Ratwatte, the U.N.\u2019s resident coordinator for Afghanistan, said rescuers are scrambling in a \u201crace against time\u201d to reach the mountainous and remote area hit. In a media briefing in Geneva Tuesday, he warned of a surge in casualty numbers.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to forget the people of Afghanistan who are facing multiple crises, multiple shocks, and the resilience of the communities has been saturated,\u201d Ratwatte said, while urging the international community to step forward.\n\n\u201cThese are life and death decisions while we race against time to reach people,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is the third major earthquake since the Taliban seized power in 2021, and the latest crisis to beset Afghanistan, which is reeling from deep cuts to aid funding, a weak economy, and millions of people forcibly returned from Iran and Pakistan.\n\nRatwatte said that when the walls of wooden and mud homes collapse, the roof falls on the occupants, causing injury or death. While the area was low-density, the earthquake struck when everybody was asleep.\n\n\u201cIf you were to model it based on what has happened before, clearly there\u2019s no question that the casualty rate is going to be rather exponential,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Taliban government, which is only recognized by Russia, has appealed for assistance from the international community and the humanitarian sector. However, help for Afghanistan is in short supply due to competing global crises and reduced aid budgets in donor countries.\n\nThe U.K. has pledged \u00a31 million ($1.3 million) to be split between humanitarian agencies rather than going to the Taliban government, which it does not recognize.\n\nThe European Union is sending 130 tons of emergency supplies and providing one million euros ($1.16 million). Other countries, including the United Arab Emirates, India, and China, have pledged disaster relief support.\n\nThere is also opposition toward the Taliban government\u2019s restrictive policies on Afghan girls and women, including a ban on them working for nongovernmental organizations. Earlier this year, the U.S. gutted aid to Afghanistan, partly due to concerns that money was going to the Taliban government.\n\nKate Carey, the deputy head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Afghanistan, said more than 420 health facilities had closed or were suspended due to the \u201cmassive reduction\u201d in funding, with 80 of them in the eastern region, the heart of Sunday\u2019s quake.\n\n\u201cThe consequence is that the remaining facilities are overwhelmed, have insufficient supplies and personnel, and are not as close to the affected populations as the more local facilities at a time when providing emergency trauma care is needed in the first 24 to 72 hours of the earthquake response,\u201d said Carey.\n\nTaliban authorities have set up a camp in Kunar to organize supplies and emergency aid. There are also two centers to coordinate the transportation of the injured, the burial of the dead, and the rescue of survivors.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report.",

      "text": "As Noem confirms more ICE resources are heading to Chicago, mayor is defying crackdown\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that immigration operations will soon be expanded in Chicago, confirming plans for a stepped-up presence of federal agents in the nation\u2019s third-largest city as President Trump continues to lash out at Illinois\u2019 Democratic leadership.\nNoem\u2019s comments came a day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson struck back against what he called the \u201cout-of-control\u201d plan to surge federal officers into the city. The Chicago Police Department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to an executive order Johnson signed Saturday.\nThe Homeland Security Department last week requested limited logistical support from officials at the Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency\u2019s anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago ... but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,\u201d Noem said during a Sunday appearance CBS News\u2019 \u201dFace the Nation.\u201d\nNoem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, saying they were needed to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.\nTrump lashed out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago\u2019s crime problems quickly \u201cor we\u2019re coming.\u201d The Republican president has also been critical of Johnson.\nJohnson and Pritzker, both Democrats, have denounced the expected federal mobilization, noting that crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.\nIn his order signed Saturday, Johnson directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents \u201camidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government.\u201d\nAsked during a news conference about federal agents who are presumably \u201ctaking orders,\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cYeah, and I don\u2019t take orders from the federal government.\u201d\nJohnson also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their identities, as most federal immigration officers have done since Trump launched his crackdown.\nThe federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Friday and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.\nPritzker, in an interview aired Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d said that Trump\u2019s expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to \u201cstop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.\u201d\nNoem said it was a Trump \u201cprerogative\u201d whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of protests there against immigration raids.\n\u201cI do know that L.A. wouldn\u2019t be standing today if President Trump hadn\u2019t taken action,\u201d Noem said. \u201cThat city would have burned if left to devices of the mayor and governor of that state.\u201d\nUnlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, the Chicago operation is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration, rather than being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime, Trump administration officials have said.\nChicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country\u2019s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda.\nJohnson\u2019s order builds on the city\u2019s longtime stance, that neither Chicago nor Illinois officials have sought or been consulted on the federal presence and they stand against Trump\u2019s mobilization plan.\nDuring his news conference Saturday, Johnson accused the president of \u201cbehaving outside the bounds of the Constitution\u201d and seeking a federal presence in Democratic cities as retribution against his political rivals.\n\u201cHe is reckless and out of control,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s the biggest threat to our democracy that we\u2019ve experienced in the history of our country.\u201d\nIn response, the White House contended that the potential flood of federal agents was about \u201ccracking down on crime.\u201d\n\u201cIf these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email Saturday.\nCritics have noted that Trump, while espousing a tough-on-crime push, is the only felon ever to occupy the White House.\nMadhani and Beck write for the Associated Press and reported from Washington and Chicago, respectively."

      "text": "Pope meets with LGBTQ+ Catholic advocate, vows to continue Francis\u2019 policy\n- Share via\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Leo XIV met Monday with one of the most prominent advocates for greater LGBTQ+ inclusion in the Catholic Church and encouraged his ministry, sending a strong signal of welcome in the early months of his pontificate.\nThe Rev. James Martin, a New York-based Jesuit author and editor, said Leo told him he intended to continue Pope Francis\u2019 policy of LGBTQ+ acceptance in the church and encouraged him to keep up his advocacy.\n\u201cI heard the same message from Pope Leo that I heard from Pope Francis, which is the desire to welcome all people, including LGBTQ people,\u201d Martin said after the audience. \u201cIt was wonderful. It was very consoling and very encouraging and frankly a lot of fun.\u201d\nThe meeting, which lasted about half an hour, was officially announced by the Vatican in a sign that Leo wanted it made public. It came just days before LGBTQ+ Catholics participate in a Holy Year pilgrimage to the Vatican in another sign of welcome.\nThe audience was significant because it showed a strong sign of continuity with Francis, who more than any of Leo\u2019s predecessors worked to make the Catholic Church a more welcoming place for LGBTQ+ Catholics. From his 2013 quip, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d about a purportedly gay priest, to his decision to allow priests to bless same-sex couples, Francis distinguished himself with his message of welcome.\nDuring his 12-year papacy from 2013 to 2025, Francis met on several occasions with Martin and named him an advisor in the Vatican\u2019s communications department and a member of his big multiyear meeting on the future of the church. Still, Francis never changed church teaching, saying homosexual acts are \u201cintrinsically disordered.\u201d\nLeo\u2019s position on LGBTQ+ Catholics had been something of a question. Soon after he was elected in May, remarks surfaced from 2012 in which the future pope, then known as the Rev. Robert Prevost, criticized the \u201chomosexual lifestyle\u201d and the role of mass media in promoting acceptance of same-sex relationships that conflicted with Catholic doctrine.\nWhen he became a cardinal in 2023, Catholic News Service asked Prevost whether his views had changed. He acknowledged Francis\u2019 call for a more inclusive church, saying Francis \u201cmade it very clear that he doesn\u2019t want people to be excluded simply on the basis of choices that they make, whether it be lifestyle, work, way to dress, or whatever.\u201d\nPrevost then underlined that doctrine had not changed. \u201cBut we are looking to be more welcoming and more open and to say all people are welcome in the church,\u201d he said.\nNews of the audience was met with consternation among some conservatives who had criticized Francis\u2019 outreach and had hoped Leo would be less accepting. Taylor Marshall, a podcaster active on Catholic social media, merely posted the official Vatican photo of the encounter on X. John-Henry Weston, co-founder of the LifeSite news site, called the audience a \u201cnightmare scenario.\u201d\nFrancis DeBernardo \u2014 executive director of New Ways Ministry, which advocates for LGBTQ+ Catholics \u2014 said the audience was a great first step. In a statement, he called it \u201ca strong indication that Leo affirms Pope Francis\u2019 welcoming model and that previous repressive approaches are now just history.\u201d\nMartin, who knew Prevost from their time working together in the synod on the church\u2019s future, said he wasn\u2019t worried about Leo\u2019s views given that Martin always had found him to be \u201ca very open, welcoming, inclusive person.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s wonderful to hear this continuation,\u201d Martin said, adding that Leo told him his priorities are to work for peace and unity, citing in particular the conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Myanmar.\n\u201cBut he also wanted to remind people that this is a church for \u2018todos, todos, todos,\u2019\u201d Martin said, quoting Francis\u2019 famous line in Spanish about how the church is open to everyone.\nMartin helped found Outreach, a ministry promoting LGBTQ+ acceptance, which will participate in a big Holy Year pilgrimage Friday and Saturday sponsored by Italian LGBTQ+ Catholic group Jonathan\u2019s Tent. Significantly, the pilgrimage of about 1,200 people includes a Mass at the Jesuit church in Rome celebrated by the second-highest member of the Italian bishop\u2019s conference.\nThe pilgrimage is not officially sponsored by the Vatican, but is listed on the Vatican\u2019s calendar of Holy Year events. Vatican officials say such a listing doesn\u2019t signify endorsement, but is merely a logistical help to those groups that wish to organize pilgrimages and walk through the Holy Door of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.\nWinfield writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "Border Patrol\u2019s arrest of Oregon firefighter was illegal, lawyer says\n- Share via\nSEATTLE \u2014 Lawyers are demanding the release of a longtime Oregon resident arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol while fighting a Washington state wildfire, saying that the firefighter was on track for legal status after helping federal investigators solve a crime against his family.\nHis arrest was illegal, the lawyers said Friday, and violated Department of Homeland Security policies that say immigration enforcement must not be conducted at locations where emergency responses are happening.\nHe is one of two firefighters arrested last week while working the Bear Gulch fire in the Olympic National Forest, which as of Friday had burned about 14 square miles and was only 13% contained, forcing evacuations.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement Thursday that it had been helping the Bureau of Land Management with a criminal investigation of two contractors working at the fire when it discovered two firefighters who it said were in the country without permanent legal status.\nThe firefighter, whose name and country of origin have not been made public, has lived in the U.S. for 19 years after arriving with his family at age 4. He received a U visa certification from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Oregon in 2017 and submitted his U visa application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services the following year.\nThe U visa program was established by Congress to protect victims of serious crimes who assist federal investigators, and the man has been waiting since 2018 for the immigration agency to decide on his application, according to Stephen Manning, a lawyer with Innovation Law Lab, a Portland-based nonprofit that\u2019s representing the firefighter.\nAnother Homeland Security policy says agents can\u2019t detain people who are receiving or have applied for victim-based immigration benefits, his lawyer said. Charging the man with an immigration violation was \u201can illegal after-the-fact justification\u201d given his U visa status, the attorney said.\nHis lawyers said Friday that they located him in the immigration detention system and were able to make contact. They were still processing information and are demanding his immediate release, they told the Associated Press in an email.\nA senior Homeland Security official said in a statement to the AP on Friday that the two men apprehended were not firefighters and were not actively fighting the fire. Officials said they were providing a supporting role by cutting logs into firewood.\n\u201cThe firefighting response remained uninterrupted the entire time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNo active firefighters were even questioned, and U.S. Border Patrol\u2019s actions did not prevent or interfere with any personnel actively engaged in firefighting efforts.\u201d\nWhen the U.S. Bureau of Land Management was asked to provide information about why its contracts with two companies were terminated and 42 firefighters were escorted away from the state\u2019s largest wildfire, it declined to answer. It would only say it cooperates with other federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cThese law enforcement professionals contribute to broader federal enforcement efforts by maintaining public safety, protecting natural resources, and collaborating with the agencies, such as the Border Patrol,\u201d Interior Department spokesperson Alyse Sharpe told the AP in an email.\nManning said in a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that the arrest violated Homeland Security policy.\nWyden was critical of the Border Patrol\u2019s operation, saying the Trump administration was more concerned about conducting raids on fire crews than protecting communities from catastrophic fires. Firefighters put their lives on the line, Wyden emphasized, including the Oregon firefighter who died Sunday while battling a wildfire in southwestern Montana.\n\u201cThe last thing that wildland firefighter crews need is to be worried about masked individuals trampling their due process rights,\u201d Wyden said in an email to the AP.\nMeanwhile, wildfire officials were still trying to get control of the Bear Gulch fire. The number of personnel working on the blaze was listed at 303 on Friday, down from 349 a day earlier.\nBellisle writes for the Associated Press."
