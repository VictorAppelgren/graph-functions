      "feedback": "Up | 3–6 months | Overseas AUM expansion and higher-margin fee mix from cross-border push, anchored by MUFG AM outside-Japan (~$164B) and Mizuho AM One outside-Japan (~$489B) and a combined ~$1.3 trillion in assets | Watch the cadence of overseas deal activity and the evolution of MUFG AM and AM One outside-Japan AUM; a faster-than-base-case overseas AUM growth pace and a clearer shift to higher-margin fee streams would support a ROIC uplift toward or above the cost of capital | 65% (PA57YBYVQ)\nUp | 6–12 months | With policy stability and ongoing overseas expansion, incremental overseas AUM could translate into durable fee income and a structural ROIC uplift if cross-border monetization scales | Watch the evolution of MUFG AM and AM One’s outside-Japan AUM and cross-border deal cadence to confirm above-base-case growth; evidence of sustained higher-margin fees would imply ROIC above WACC over the horizon | 60% (PA57YBYVQ)\nDown | 3–6 months | Reforms stall and cross-border monetization falters, leaving domestic growth constrained and fee pools under pressure as overseas flows disappoint | Watch for policy signals on the overseas push, and any stall in MUFG AM/AM One outside-Japan AUM growth; a failure to monetize cross-border flows would compress ROIC and curb asset-pricing upside | 40% (PA57YBYVQ)\nDown | 6–12 months | Ford’s EV-loss episode underscores the cyclicality and capex risk; persistent EV losses or tariff/inflation shocks would raise discount rates and threaten cross-border monetization upside | Watch Ford’s EV profitability trajectory and broader auto-cycle indicators as proxies for margin and capex risk; sustained EV losses (EV losses ≈ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%; ROIC ≈ 10.1%; revenue CAGR ≈ 2.5% 2014–2024) and higher tariffs could push discount rates higher (22PL3Q360) | 35% (22PL3Q360)",
