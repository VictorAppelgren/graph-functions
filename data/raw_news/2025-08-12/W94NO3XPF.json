  "title": "Top Tory warns Notting Hill Carnival must be ticketed as \u2018crush' feared",
  "description": "The event in west London has also seen violence, such as the murder of a mother in front of her daughter last year.",
  "content": "Notting Hill Carnival should be ticketted in the future to avoid a crush such as the one seen at Hillsborough in 1989, a senior Conservative has suggested. Susan Hall AM, who ran for Mayor against Sir Sadiq Khan last year, said in a report published today that the event had narrowly \"avoided a mass crush on the scale of the Hillsborough disaster\" in recent years. The Mayor of London has expressed concern himself in the past. At a meeting of the London Assembly in July, he said he had \"seen images of some of the crowds at some parts\" of the carnival, and \"watching them made me frightened\". Ms Hall also expressed concern at recent violence at the festival. More than 61 police officers were injured last year, and people were killed in separate knife attacks, including Cher Maximen, 32, who was caught up in a fight involving multiple men and was stabbed in front of her three-year-old daughter. Three firearms were also recovered, and police made 334 arrests.\n\nA spokesman for the Mayor told the Telegraph: \"The carnival ultimately belongs to the community who decide where it is held and organise the event. \"The Mayor continues to work with partners to help ensure everyone can enjoy the carnival safely and honour its cultural importance.\" A spokesman for Notting Hill Carnival Ltd said the event \"was founded and remains a community-led event\", and highlighted that organisers \"pull on the expertise from each agency for the betterment of the event\". They then invited Ms Hall to visit their HQ during this year\u2019s carnival - which will take place over the weekend of August 24 - to \"witness the operation in action\". In April, the London Assembly said the Metropolitan Police Service has \"consistently raised concerns about the possibility of 'a mass casualty event' at Notting Hill Carnival\". It added: \"The London Assembly Police and Crime Committee has called on the Mayor to commission a review of crowd density and safety at the event.\"\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Federation - which represents 30,000 rank and file officers \u2013 produced a \"hard hitting 24-page dossier documenting what their members really think about their safety at the Notting Hill Carnival\". Simon Hill, Deputy General Secretary of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: \"For years we have made it known that officers don\u2019t like the event. But we had no tangible evidence to support that. \"I felt it was important to get some concrete evidence, to hear the views of officers who work Notting Hill Carnival so we could truly understand what they think of the event and whether they enjoy policing it. \"We chose to focus our survey on the Notting Hill Carnival rather than another large-scale event because of the consistent volume of assaults reported by officers after the event every year. \"Officers also work approximately 30 to 40 hours over the two days, which can have a significant impact on their wellbeing. \"We are also extremely concerned about the public who attend the event being victims of crime that officers feel powerless to prevent due to the sheer number of attendees and crimes committed. No other event in London has this combination or level of issues for officers.\"",

      "text": "\u201cUtter lawlessness... We are practically powerless to police this event\u2026 It\u2019s a war zone we are sent into year after year\u201d\nThe Metropolitan Police Federation - representing 30,000 rank and file officers \u2013 has produced a hard hitting 24-page dossier documenting what their members really think about their safety at the Notting Hill Carnival.\nBased on astonishingly candid quotes and comments from front line officers who have worked at the annual event, survey results, newspaper cuttings from the last 10 years and crime statistics from the Carnival, the dossier is being made publicly available with a view to improving safety for both the public and the police at future events.\nHard copies of the dossier are being handed to Scotland Yard, Downing Street and City Hall today (Monday) by representatives of the Federation, and it is being made available on the Federation website.\nSee the document here https://indd.adobe.com/view/8f2c320d-ea3f-43c7-9f30-eb367d870272?fbclid=IwY2xjawG6SJBleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHdAAu3M2mOmU1hcGSaUZ1_bFI2Qj1OI2Q_lPWR654uodHy3_CsoA3V-_iQ_aem_la_YHtNhITsIwqxtvu_cUA\nSimon Hill, Deputy General Secretary of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: \u201cFor years we have made it known that officers don\u2019t like the event. But we had no tangible evidence to support that.\n\u201cI felt it was important to get some concrete evidence, to hear the views of officers who work Notting Hill Carnival so we could truly understand what they think of the event and whether they enjoy policing it.\n\u201cWe chose to focus our survey on the Notting Hill Carnival rather than another large-scale event because of the consistent volume of assaults reported by officers after the event every year.\n\u201cOfficers also work approximately 30 to 40 hours over the two days, which can have a significant impact on their wellbeing.\n\u201cWe are also extremely concerned about the public who attend the event being victims of crime that officers feel powerless to prevent due to the sheer number of attendees and crimes committed. No other event in London has this combination or level of issues for officers.\u201d\nOther comments received from officers in the Federation survey include:\n\u2022 \u201cPunched, kicked, hit with objects including bottles. Spat at and sexually assaulted.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt is a dangerous environment with no concern for officer safety.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cAs an ethnic minority, I often feel anxious about policing carnival.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cI would rather crawl naked through broken glass.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cI dread this event every year, it gets more violent each time. How many more officers have to get injured or innocent members of the public killed before anything is done?\u201d\nA host of other quotes and views from front line officers can be seen in the full survey document.\nSimon added: \u201cI\u2019m actually quite shocked by some of the responses. I knew that the event wasn\u2019t popular, for a whole variety of reasons. But the candour from the officers and some of their descriptions of how they feel, how they felt at carnival and their experiences of being assaulted, quite frankly were shocking.\n\u201cOne thing that jumped out was that the number of officers who had been assaulted at the event was at 29% of respondents, while the number of officers who said they felt unsafe was up at 89%. I think this disparity is down to the size of the crowd you\u2019re policing. I think it\u2019s the close proximity of everybody in such a confined area.\u201d\nFollowing the most recent Carnival at the end of August, there were 2 murders, 8 stabbings and 349 arrests: 72 for possession of an offensive weapon, 1 for possession of a firearm, 13 arrests for sexual offences, and 53 for assaults on emergency workers.\n61 police officers were assaulted over the weekend event.\nA series of open questions from the Federation for the Metropolitan Police Service and partner agencies on behalf of London officers - holding them to account on safety ahead of the 2025 event over the August Bank Holiday weekend - are included at the conclusion of the dossier.\nSimon concluded: \u201cWe understand the cultural significance of the event. We just want the event to be safe.\n\u201cWhat that safety looks like is operational \u2013 with the Met working with its partners, with the local authority, with Notting Hill Carnival Limited and with the Mayor\u2019s office, to make it safe.\n\u201cThat could be restricting the numbers of people that come to the area. It could be looking at alternative sites or looking at making it some form of a ticketed event.\n\u201cBut it could equally be looking at things such as the quality of the stewards, the quality of the communications, the quality of licensing decisions. If there\u2019s lots of evidence in relation to alcohol consumption and violence, why is the sale of alcohol allowed?\n\u201cThe event seems to run, in terms of success, by the number of murders that are had. That, to me, is astonishing. I don\u2019t see how you can judge the success of an event by whether you\u2019ve had a murder or not. With the crowd\u2019s density, I don\u2019t think it would take too much to have a significant crushing event.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think the event needs to be made safer, because the public are at risk with this event, with the potential for a serious and potentially fatal crushing incident. Our whole emphasis on Carnival is to make it safe. Now we need the Metropolitan Police and its partner agencies to step up and make it so.\u201d"

      "text": "Review Notting Hill Carnival crowd numbers before \u2018mass casualty event\u2019 occurs\nThe Met has consistently raised concerns about the possibility of \u2018a mass casualty event\u2019 at Notting Hill Carnival.1 The London Assembly Police and Crime Committee has called on the Mayor to commission a review of crowd density and safety at the event.\nThis follows the Committee investigation into public order policing in London, specifically looking at:\n- Protests related to the conflict in Gaza\n- Notting Hill Carnival\n- The policing of football\nThe Committee found that:\n- The Met continues to raise concerns about the risk of a crush scenario at Notting Hill Carnival, due to high crowd density and inadequate stewarding provision from the organisers. The Committee shares these concerns.\n- Increased public order demand is putting the Met under strain, and this has not been matched with an increase in funding from the Government. The increase that the Government did announce in December 2024 (in the form of an increased National and International Capital Cities grant) does not go far enough towards bridging the financial shortfall.\n- Officers who have undertaken specialist public order training are now stepping back from public order work in increasing numbers, due to the demand of regular weekend shifts and impact on family life.\n- The Met continues to rely on \u2018abstraction\u2019, where local officers are taken away from regular duties at short notice to support public order operations in central London. Taking neighbourhood officers away from their regular duties is having a continuing impact on local policing services.\nNotting Hill Carnival is an important date in London\u2019s calendar. It is a unique celebration of Caribbean culture and history within the city and attracts around two million visitors each year.2 This volume of people also creates a complex policing challenge.\nAs part of its policing operation for the 2024 Carnival, the Met had around 7,000 officers on duty, drawn from local policing teams as well as specialist units, with a total of around 14,000 officer shifts across the whole event.\nKey recommendations from the report - Public order policing \u2013 the Met\u2019s approach - include:\n- The Mayor must commission a review of crowd density and crowd safety at Notting Hill Carnival to inform stewarding requirements. This must include a full review of pinch points and strict guidance for the number of stewards required across the Carnival.\n- The Government must ensure the National and International Capital City (NICC) Grant it provides to the Met is updated yearly in line with inflation and operational requirements.3\n- The Met must publish its Aid Reduction Plan, or a summary thereof, to provide reassurance to local communities concerned about the impact of abstractions on neighbourhood policing.\nSusan Hall AM, Chairman of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, said:\n\u201cThe Carnival is an important part of London\u2019s cultural calendar. Bringing millions of visitors to London is essential for the economy and providing a wide range of events for Londoners is important for the city.\n\u201cHowever, we have seen and heard a number of incredibly worrying incidents with crowd density at the event, which severely impacts the Met\u2019s ability to keep visitors safe or to respond to any incidents that occur.\n\u201cThe Met told us during our investigation that there is a real possibility of a mass casualty event, and we cannot stand by and wait for a tragic incident to happen, action must be taken.\n\u201cTwo people tragically lost their lives at last year\u2019s event due to violent crime, and it is absolutely essential that the Met is on hand to carry out its duties, and not fill in for a lack of stewarding from the organisers.\n\u201cWe urge the Mayor to commission a review of crowd density and safety at the Carnival, to ensure the event is well managed and to let the Met do its job in keeping us safe.\u201d\nFollow us @LondonAssembly.\nNotes to editors\n- London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, Transcript of Agenda Item 6 - Question and Answer Session with the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime and the Metropolitan Police Service, 11 September 2024, p. 1\n- BBC News, Fabulous costumes and a 'feast for the senses' as thousands turn out for Notting Hill Carnival, 26 August 2024\n- Zo\u00eb Garbett AM dissents from Recommendation 1. She does not agree with the call to: \u201censure the National and International Capital City (NICC) Grant it provides to the Met is updated yearly in line with inflation and operational requirements.\u201d The Committee received written evidence from Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol) highlighting how: \u201cabstraction from local neighbourhood police teams to deploy thousands of officers in central London for public order policing was a choice made by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner\u201d. Assembly Member Garbett agrees that this is a choice made by the Met and believes that the response should not be to increase the Met\u2019s funding, but instead to look at the choices made around how protest and other public order events are policed.\n- Notting Hill Carnival Ltd were invited to give evidence to the Committee, but the Committee did not receive a response.\n- Read the report in full.\n- Susan Hall AM, Chairman of the Police and Crime Committee, is available for interview.\n- Find out more about the work of the Police and Crime Committee.\n- As well as investigating issues that matter to Londoners, the London Assembly acts as a check and a balance on the Mayor.\nFor more information, please contact Tony Smyth in the Assembly Media Office on 07763 251727 or [email protected].
