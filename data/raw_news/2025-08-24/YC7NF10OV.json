  "content": "Vice President JD Vance remains confident the U.S. can broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine despite potential hang-ups that have emerged since President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d the vice president added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s top diplomat, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, put a damper on hopes that Trump will propel a swift end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nHe told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker that Ukraine has hindered the process, saying Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders \u201cdon\u2019t want peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cZelenskyy said no to everything,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cHow can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?\u201d\n\nLavrov said Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy \u201cwhen the agenda is ready.\u201d But he suggested that Putin would not sign a peace agreement with Zelenskyy, whose legitimacy Moscow has questioned since Ukrainian elections were postponed last year amid martial law.\n\n\u201cWhen we come to a stage when you have to sign documents, we would need a very clear understanding by everybody that the person who is signing is legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd according to the Ukrainian constitution, Mr. Zelenskyy is not at the moment.\u201d\n\nJustice Department gave Ghislaine Maxwell \u2018a platform to rewrite history,\u2019 family of Virginia Giuffre says\n\nFamily members of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Jeffrey Epstein accuser, said they were \u201coutraged\u201d by the Justice Department\u2019s decision to release transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s testimony last month, arguing the interviews provided Maxwell a \u201cplatform to rewrite history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe content of these transcripts is in direct contradiction with felon Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s conviction for child sex trafficking,\u201d the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre said in a statement. The family added, \u201cThis travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department on Friday released audio and transcripts of the two-day interview, during which Maxwell disputed several allegations of wrongdoing against her and Epstein, including by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.\n\nMaxwell said she never witnessed any inappropriate conduct from any man, including Trump, and denied the existence of an incriminating \u201cclient list\u201d of those who benefited from Epstein\u2019s crimes.\n\nOn \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Adam Schiff echoed the Giuffre family\u2019s view, claiming that Maxwell has the motivation to say anything that could potentially get her pardoned.\n\n\u201cShe says exactly what her lawyers tell her is going to be necessary to get a pardon. No one should be surprised here,\u201d Schiff said.\n\u2022 Padding passage: The Republican-controlled Texas state Senate passed the party\u2019s new congressional maps \u2014 designed to pad the GOP majority in the U.S. Congress \u2014 completing a legislative odyssey that sparked a nationwide scramble over redistricting.\n\u2022 Undelivered: Postal services across the world are halting parcel deliveries to the United States amid mounting confusion over new import duties imposed on small shipments under Trump\u2019s new tariff regime.\n\u2022 Baltimore next? Trump on Truth Social threatened to send the military into Baltimore to \u201cquickly clean up\u201d crime, the latest in a line of threats to replicate the deployment of National Guard troops to Washington.\n\nThe federal takeover of Washington has sparked a fierce debate over the state of crime in the city. What\u2019s beyond dispute is that carjackings exploded during the pandemic and are not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s a particularly brutal crime, experts say, one that often causes lasting psychological damage.\n\n\u201cIt became the crime of the pandemic,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based organization of current and former law enforcement officials focused on improving policing. \u201cAnd the reason you still have it is because juveniles learned how to do it. That presents a lot of challenges for the justice system.\u201d\n\nThe soaring number of young people who have engaged in carjacking is indeed one of the key factors that has driven the surge in the Washington area and beyond, according to interviews with more than half a dozen police officials, criminologists and youth advocates.\n\nSome of these perpetrators stole vehicles to use them to commit more crimes. Many others commit carjackings simply for the thrill of it, or to earn respect and attention on social media, according to police investigators and advocates who have spoken to the young offenders.\n\nOver the last 18 months, the carjacking numbers have fallen in the area. Sgt. Josh Scall, a supervisor in the carjacking unit in neighboring Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, said he\u2019s proud of the progress, but even one carjacking is one more than he wants to see in his county.\n\n\u201cWe can parade that we\u2019re not at 573,\u201d Scall added, referring to the record number of carjackings recorded in Prince George\u2019s in 2023. \u201cBut it\u2019s still unacceptable in our books.\u201d\n\nSending a freshman off to college is almost always an expensive endeavor, but the latest viral trend is taking back-to-school shopping to the next level.\n\nExtreme dorm makeovers are becoming increasingly popular, with some parents shelling out tens of thousands of dollars and hiring professional interior designers to transform their kids\u2019 humble abodes into the dorm rooms of their dreams.\n\nFar removed from the beat-up mini-fridges and crooked posters of the past, the dramatic transformations are unnecessary, some say, and reflect the widening line between the haves and have-nots in the United States.\n\n\u201cWealth disparity just becomes obvious on a college campus, because suddenly your lifestyle is either funded by you or it\u2019s not,\u201d said Mya Mendola, who graduated from the University of Minnesota last year.\n\nFrank Ilett announced last October he wouldn\u2019t trim his locks until his beloved Manchester United won five soccer matches in a row. More than 320 days later, he\u2019s still waiting.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\u2022 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongfully deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, now faces removal to Uganda after being freed from federal custody.\n\u2022 Police on Saturday identified the five people who were killed in a tour bus crash in western New York.\n\u2022 Jerry Adler, best known for playing a mobster\u2019s confidant on \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d dies at 96.\n\u2022 A judge in Mexico said boxer Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. will stand trial over alleged cartel ties and arms trafficking but could await that trial outside of detention, the boxer\u2019s lawyer said.\n\u2022 The son of \u201cWalking Dead\u201d star Norman Reedus was arrested and charged following an alleged assault in a New York City apartment.\n\u2022 More than 20 hospitals and health systems have temporarily or indefinitely rolled back transgender care for minors and some young adults this year amid threats of federal investigations and cuts to government funding.\n\u2022 Home Depots have become prime locations for immigration enforcement as federal agents target day laborers in search of work.\n\u2022 A lawsuit against Delbarton, an elite all-boys Catholic school where several former students have come forward with sex abuse allegations, is set to be the first civil trial involving the Catholic Church in New Jersey.",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The sight of masked federal agents in tactical gear descending on Home Depots across Southern California is forcing undocumented day laborers to weigh earning badly needed income against the risk of being arrested or deported.\nAt least two Home Depot parking lots in the Los Angeles area were targeted Friday amid the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown. Day laborers were detained in North Hollywood and Alhambra as organizers shouted demanding to see warrants and attempted to obtain as much information as possible from handcuffed workers.\nThe scene has become familiar this summer to day laborers, who are desperate to maintain a steady income in a local economy still recovering from January's wildfires and the rising cost of building materials caused by tariffs.\nThey wait in parking lots each morning, hoping to earn a day\u2019s wage or, if they\u2019re lucky, get hired for a long-term project that could mean weeks or months of steady pay.\nBut the constant threat of arrest is taking a toll on many workers, who say they are traumatized and can\u2019t sleep after watching friends and family members being arrested and taken to jail.\n\u201cWhat can you do? In this country you can\u2019t stay home. You need money for kids, bills, rent, food,\u201d said Arturo, a day laborer who lives in Los Angeles and spoke in Spanish.\nArturo and other laborers interviewed by NBC News spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared being targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents or other federal officers.\nFriday's Home Depot operations took place about a week after Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez, a day laborer from Guatemala, died after fleeing from agents at a Home Depot parking lot in Monrovia. He ran onto a nearby freeway and was hit by a car.\nImmigration advocates and community members said Montoya, who was in the U.S. without legal authorization, was not a criminal but a hardworking father.\n\u201cHe came here to work hard. My uncle was not a criminal,\u201d his niece, Mariela Mendez, told mourners during a vigil last week for Montoya. \u201cHe wanted what a lot of us want: a better life.\u201d\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Montoya was not being pursued by federal agents when he died.\nHome Depot declined to comment on his death or say how many arrests have occurred on its properties.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t notified that ICE activities are going to happen, and in many cases, we don\u2019t know that arrests have taken place until after they\u2019re over,\u201d the Atlanta-based company said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe\u2019re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.\u201d\nSitting in his truck parked close to where Montoya started running, Jose quietly sobbed as he looked at the small tree where his friend used to lock up his bike every morning.\nJose said he had known Montoya for about five years and described him as friendly and chatty with the other workers who assembled every morning in the parking lot.\nOn the day Montoya died, Jose said he arrived a few hours later than usual and was confused by all the commotion. Helicopters roared overhead and traffic came to a standstill.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like it happened to all of us,\u201d he said in Spanish through tears. \u201cWe all know each other. We\u2019re all the same.\u201d\nJose said that returning to the scene of Montoya\u2019s death was heartbreaking, but his choices were limited. He needs to work, and the idea of not earning money every day keeps him up at night.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a criminal. He wasn\u2019t a bad guy,\u201d Jose said, adding that he doesn't understand why Montoya ran onto the freeway. \u201cI wish he had taken his chances with an immigration judge.\u201d\nA few paces away, Felipe stood in the shade of a tree, waiting for someone to hire him. He has lived in the U.S. since 2015 and worked in restaurants until the Covid pandemic crippled the industry, he said. He has returned to this Home Depot most days for five years, but the opportunities have dried up, he said. First it was the wildfires, then it was the tariffs and now it\u2019s the fear of immigration enforcement.\nFelipe remembers a time when he could pick and choose which jobs to do on which days. Now, he\u2019s lucky to be hired even for a few hours.\n\u201cThank God I wasn\u2019t here when they got Carlos,\" he said. \"I\u2019d be in Mexico without clothes.\u201d\nWhen asked about the last time he saw Montoya, Felipe pointed to the little tree nearby.\n\u201cHe was sitting there talking with somebody,\u201d Felipe said. \u201cHe seemed happy.\u201d\nNancy Meza, an organizer with the National Day Laborers Organizing Network, works with dozens of volunteers stationed at Home Depots across Southern California. They patrol parking lots and street corners, watching for incoming signs of immigration enforcement activity. When spotted, volunteers signal each other in a group chat and shout warnings to nearby workers.\nMeza said she hears a mix of stress and determination from day laborers. Many vow to continue working for a sense of normalcy and to maintain a steady income, despite the personal cost.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling of, 'If we stay home and just sit back in fear, it makes things worse, we feel really anxious, powerless,'\u201d she said. \u201cThey would rather take their chances.\u201d\nStanding outside a different Home Depot on a blistering hot day, Arturo said he has lived in the United States for 25 years and regrets not learning English or trying to become a citizen. When he first arrived, he said, he was too embarrassed to attend night classes covered in sweat and paint after a day\u2019s work.\nThe citizenship process also is costly and time-prohibitive, he said, noting that many of his friends who managed to obtain lawyers and go through the process said it cost them some $15,000 and nearly a decade of waiting. Arturo thought his time would be better spent earning money so he could leave sooner.\nLike many undocumented people, Arturo intended to return home to Mexico within a few years of arriving. But he fell in love and had two children. They are now teenagers and he can't leave them behind, he said. If he took them to Mexico, he worries they would feel too out of place in a country they have never visited.\nInstead, he encourages them to study hard and attend college. To help make that happen, he works six days a week, leaving Sundays open to spend with his children and attend church.\nHe said the benefit of what he is doing outweighs the risk.\n\u201cAll you can do is work to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration or no, people come out because they have to eat.\u201d"

      "text": "Jerry Adler, best known for playing a mobster\u2019s confidant on \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d died on Saturday at the age of 96, according to an obituary from the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York.\nThe obituary did not provide details. Adler\u2019s friend Frank J. Reilly confirmed his death Saturday on X.\n\u201cYou know him from one of his iconic roles [and] from many of his guest appearances,\u201d Reilly wrote. \u201cNot bad for a guy who didn\u2019t start acting until he was 65.\u201d\nAdler came from a theater family, the son of Group Theatre manager Phil Adler and the nephew of actor Jacob Pavlovich Adler, he told the Southern New England Jewish Ledger in 2014.\nHe was a theater veteran who worked behind the curtain on some of Broadway\u2019s biggest shows. Adler worked as stage manager for the original 1956 production of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d featuring Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison.\nHe\u2019d later direct the revival in 1976 after having worked on shows like \u201cAnnie,\u201d \u201cMarlene Dietrich\u201d and \u201cWe Interrupt This Program...\u201d as a production supervisor and director.\nAdler wouldn\u2019t receive his first acting credit until 1991, when he appeared on an episode of \u201cBrooklyn Bridge.\u201d He appeared on popular television series such as \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d and \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and even had some leading roles in shows like \u201cHudson Street.\u201d\nBut the world will most likely best remember Adler for his six seasons on the HBO series \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d\nHesh Rabkin, played by Adler, was a confident to lead character Tony Soprano, a troubled New Jersey mafia boss struggling with his work and his family.\nA recurring character, Rabkin was a loan shark who often doled out advice to the younger mafioso.\n\"Sopranos\" actor Michael Imperioli paid tribute to his former co-star on Instagram, describing Adler as a \"true class act\" and saying he loved spending time with him.\n\"JERRY ADLER (1929-2025) was a fantastic actor and the kindest of human beings,\" Imperioli wrote. \"He brought so much humor, intelligence and truth to the role of Herman 'Hesh' Rabkin and was one of my favorite characters on The Sopranos.\nAdler made appearances in a number of other hit series, such as \u201cBroad City,\u201d \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d He was a recurring guest on \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d a legal procedural led by Julianna Margulies.\nRobert King, co-creator of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d recalled Adler\u2019s role on the show as Howard Lyman in a social media post Sunday. He described Adler as \u201cone of our favorite collaborators.\u201d\n\u201cThe intent was only to have him for one episode of THE GOOD WIFE, but he was so funny in a diner scene, yelling \u2018I said ice cream, you stupid b----\u2019 we had him back for six years of Good Wife and three years of Good Fight,\u201d King wrote.\nWhat was meant to be one episode turned into 30 for Adler, according to his IMDb page. He then appeared in two episodes of the show\u2019s spinoff \u201cThe Good Fight.\u201d\nPeople shared kind words about Adler in the comments of his online obituary, with some who knew him personally sharing memories. A woman named Sharon Aiuvalasit wrote that she was able to go to the set of her favorite show, \"Santa Barbara,\" because of a family friend who knew Adler.\n\"Jerry welcomed my mom, dad and little brother to the set for 12 hours and it continues to be one of the most magical memories of my life,\" Aiuvalasit wrote.\nA man named Jimmy Horton recalled that his very first job at 18 was working with Adler on the drama \"Search for Tomorrow.\" He worked on Broadway over the years and reunited with Adler in Larry David's 2015 play, \"Fish in the Dark.\"\n\"When rehearsals started I reintroduced myself and we reminisced about Search and the great people there and I got to see Jerry as an actor six nights a week for several months and he was a delight, a real mensch and a terrific actor to see up close,\" Horton wrote.\nAdler wrote a memoir released last year called \"Too Funny for Words,\" writing about moments like his first job working for his father as an assistant stage manager on \"Gentleman Prefer Blondes.\" He told CT Insider in an interview promoting his book that he had to lead Carol Channing by flashlight because she was \"terribly near-sighted.\"\nAsked about his career, Adler told the outlet that \"it's been a glorious run.\"\n\"I wrote this book during the pandemic because I thought the world could use some laughs,\" Adler said. \"I still have more stories to tell, too, about working on the Tony Awards shows, about all the summer stock productions, about all the 'My Fair Lady' revivals. Maybe there can be 'Too Funny for Words, Part Two.'\""

      "text": "The son of \u201cWalking Dead\u201d star Norman Reedus was arrested and charged following an alleged assault in a New York City apartment on Saturday.\nMingus Reedus, 25, pleaded not guilty to five charges Saturday, according to court records. The model faces charges of third-degree assault, assault recklessly causing injury, criminal obstruction of breathing, second-degree harassment and aggravated harassment.\nOfficers responded to an assault in progress in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood at 8:40 a.m. Saturday, New York police said. A 33-year-old woman was observed with \u201cminor injuries\u201d to her neck and leg.\nShe was taken to Bellevue Hospital, and Mingus Reedus was taken into custody, police said.\nMingus Reedus\u2019 attorney, Priya Chaudhry, insisted in a statement Sunday that her client\u2019s innocence would become clear as the facts of the case emerged.\n\u201cDespite what the prosecutor said in court \u2014 which is not evidence \u2014 they chose to charge Mingus with misdemeanors or less,\u201d Chaudhry said. \u201cThis speaks volumes, and much louder than the prosecutor\u2019s unsupported in-court comments.\u201d\nShe also noted that the judge released Mingus Reedus on his own recognizance, \u201cwith neither bail nor supervision.\u201d\nMingus Reedus is the son of Norman Reedus and model Helena Christensen. He accepted a plea deal in 2022 after he was accused of assaulting a woman at the San Gennaro festival in New York City\u2019s Little Italy, according to E! News.\nThe woman alleged that Mingus Reedus punched her in the face after a verbal argument, but he told the New York Daily News that the woman and her friends \u201cswarmed\u201d him after having bumped into his group of friends. He described the incident as an accident."

      "text": "Sending a freshman off to college is almost always an expensive endeavor, but the latest viral trend is taking back-to-school shopping to the next level.\nExtreme dorm makeovers are becoming increasingly popular, with some parents shelling out tens of thousands of dollars and hiring professional interior designers to transform their kids\u2019 humble abodes into the dorm rooms of their dreams.\nFar removed from the beat-up mini-fridges and crooked posters of the past, the dramatic transformations are unnecessary, some say, and reflect the widening line between the haves and have-nots in the U.S.\n\u201cWealth disparity just becomes obvious on a college campus, because suddenly your lifestyle is either funded by you or it\u2019s not,\u201d said Mya Mendola, who graduated from the University of Minnesota last year.\nNevertheless, transformation videos are all over TikTok, showing drab, undecorated freshman dorms elevated into luxurious oases. Crystal chandeliers, plush bedding and monogrammed pillows overflow in the small spaces.\n\u201cThey\u2019re away from home for the first time,\u201d said Shelly Gates, a professional dorm designer. \u201cThey need their own little comfortable space.\u201d\nGates, who owns Mary Margaret Designs, an interior design company in Mississippi, has gone viral for her elaborate room transformations. Her dorm makeover videos have garnered hundreds of thousands of views online, showing her clients\u2019 shocked reactions at their unrecognizable rooms.\n\u201cMy end goal is not to be on TikTok,\" Gates said. \"It\u2019s not to show off these designs, but my goal is always for the moms to be happy and the girls to be happy.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cOld people like me grew up in dorms that literally were cinder block prison cells, and now our kids are the age to go to college, and we don\u2019t want them to have that experience.\u201d\nThe viral makeovers are not just for girls. Some parents are transforming their sons' freshman rooms into full-fledged man caves with gaming chairs, brick wallpaper, leather couches and neon signs.\nA market for elaborate dorm designs has grown since 2020, when Tamara Wingerter and Stephanie Knight started the Facebook group Dorm Rooms of Mississippi and Beyond to share their extravagant renovations.\nWingerter, who now has her own business, said she has seen designs costing anywhere from $500 to $20,000.\n\u201cIf someone has a $100,000 budget, I mean, I have never seen one of those yet, but you never know,\u201d said Wingerter. \u201cPeople drop that on a birthday party, so why not for nine months?\"\nAfter countless vision boards and full online shopping carts, Wingerter says her favorite part is seeing the students\u2019 reaction when a room is finished.\n\u201cCollege is hard enough. It\u2019s such a big transition for our children, why shouldn\u2019t we make their rooms somewhere where they\u2019re comfortable and happy that expresses their personality?\u201d said Wingerter.\nMendola, the recent college grad, said the extravagant dorm rooms are nothing like what she had in school.\n\u201cEveryone had, like, a funny, cool, interesting theme,\u201d said Mendola. \u201cNobody was going for aesthetics.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes you wonder \u2014 she went on \u2014 what level of individuality is coming into your room versus what level is something you curated online? Are we losing some self-expression, because so much of it is based on what\u2019s cool on the internet?\u201d\nMendola and Megan Stout, who graduated from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 2018, said they were shocked to hear what some people were paying for makeovers.\n\u201cI shopped at Target. I got the $5 floor-length mirror,\u201d Stout said. \u201cI think our futon at the time was like $100. So, nothing crazy.\u201d\nStout said she didn't see the point of spending so much money on a \u201ccinder block dorm room.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-thousand dollars, that\u2019s literally a down payment!\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s always families that can afford more and buy their kids more.\u201d"

      "text": "Family members of a prominent Jeffrey Epstein accuser said they were \u201coutraged\u201d by the Justice Department\u2019s decision to release transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s testimony last month to a federal prosecutor, arguing it provided Maxwell a \u201cplatform to rewrite history.\u201d\n\u201cThe content of these transcripts is in direct contradiction with felon Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s conviction for child sex trafficking,\u201d the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre said in a statement. The family added, \u201cThis travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\u201d\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month questioned Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on sex trafficking charges, for two days as part of a stated effort by the Trump administration to uncover more information about Epstein\u2019s crimes.\nThe Justice Department on Friday released audio and transcripts of the two-day interview, during which Maxwell disputed several allegations of wrongdoing against her and Epstein, including by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.\nGiuffre accused Maxwell of grooming her to be sexually abused by Epstein and trafficked to several of his powerful friends, including Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Giuffre separately sued Andrew in 2021 alleging he sexually abused her as a minor, which he has denied. The two later settled the case for an undisclosed amount in 2022.\nDuring the interview last month with Blanche, Maxwell said Giuffre\u2019s allegation against Andrew \u201cdoesn\u2019t hold water,\u201d and disputed key facts in the case, including an alleged photo of Giuffre with Andrew.\n\u201cI believe that this whole thing was manufactured, and I can point you to some potentially corroborating evidence of this,\u201d Maxwell told Blanche.\nGiuffre\u2019s family accused the deputy attorney general of not sufficiently challenging Maxwell\u2019s assertions during her testimony, suggesting that by publicly releasing the interview, the Justice Department provided Maxwell the opportunity to dispute her case in the court of public opinion.\n\u201cDuring [Deputy Attorney General] Todd Blanche\u2019s bizarre interview, she is never challenged about her court-proven lies, providing her a platform to rewrite history,\u201d the family statement read.\nMaxwell also said she never witnessed any inappropriate conduct from any man, including Donald Trump. She denied the existence of an incriminating \u201cclient list\u201d of individuals who benefited from Epstein\u2019s crimes and maintained her innocence after being convicted of sex trafficking in 2021.\nOn Sunday, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., criticized Maxwell\u2019s statements to Blanche, claiming that she has the motivation to say anything that could potentially get her pardoned.\n\u201cThey go and they do this interview without the presence of a prosecutor who actually knows the facts,\u201d Schiff told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d referring to Blanche.\n\u201cShe wants a pardon. She says exactly what her lawyers tell her is going to be necessary to get a pardon. No one should be surprised here,\u201d Schiff added.\nIn a statement, Maxwell's attorney David Oscar Markus called Schiff \"flat-out wrong.\"\n\"Ghislaine Maxwell has been consistent from day one, and her testimony is backed by documents \u2014 not politics. If she wanted to make up stories to curry favor, she could have targeted Democrats like President Clinton. She didn\u2019t because she\u2019s telling the truth. The good Congressman may fancy himself a mind reader, but on this he\u2019s flat-out wrong,\" Markus said.\nGiuffre\u2019s family has for months been critical of the Justice Department\u2019s interactions with Maxwell amid the Trump administration\u2019s claimed push to uncover more information about Epstein\u2019s crimes, a key topic of interest among Trump\u2019s base.\nIn late July, after Maxwell met with Blanche, the family urged the government not to provide Maxwell any favorable treatment, describing her then as a \u201cmonster who deserves to rot in prison for the rest of her life.\u201d\nTrump has not ruled out the idea of pardoning Maxwell, whom he has known for several decades. When asked last month about the prospect of granting Maxwell legal relief, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m allowed to do it, but it\u2019s something I have not thought about.\u201d\nAbsent a pardon from Trump, Maxwell is seeking legal relief from the Supreme Court, which has indicated it will decide whether to review Maxwell\u2019s appeal of her conviction during a private conference in September.\nGiuffre\u2019s family also condemned the Justice Department\u2019s decision to transfer Maxwell to a minimum-security prison following her meeting with Blanche.\n\u201cBy moving convicted felon Maxwell to a minimum-security, country club prison, the DOJ sends a disturbing message that child sex trafficking is acceptable and will be rewarded,\u201d the family said Saturday in a statement.\nFederal officials moved Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s co-conspirator and confidant, from a co-ed, low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to a women-only, minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas. The Bureau of Prisons at the time did not specify why Maxwell was transferred to the facility, which also houses reality television star Jen Shah and disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.\nThe release of the Maxwell transcripts came as the Justice Department also partially fulfilled a subpoena by the House Oversight Committee for all files related to the federal investigation of Epstein. The Justice Department released roughly 33,000 documents, however Democrats on the committee have said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the records included in the first batch were already public."

      "text": "Russia\u2019s top diplomat laid out the wide gaps between Moscow and Kyiv and put a damper on hopes that President Donald Trump will propel a swift end to the war in Ukraine.\nForeign Minister Sergey Lavrov told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker in an exclusive interview taped Friday that there was no meeting planned between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and that key issues \u2014 including security guarantees for Ukraine and territorial disputes\u2014 remain unresolved.\nPutin \u201cis ready to meet with President Zelenskyy, provided this meeting is really going to decide something,\u201d he said. \u201cTo meet, for Zelenskyy to have another opportunity to be onstage, is not what we believe is useful.\u201d\nEven as Trump has met separately this month with Putin, Zelenskyy and European leaders, his overtures for peace have been undermined by Russia\u2019s continued deadly strikes on Ukraine, including on a U.S.-owned factory last week.\nThe White House is now seeking a Putin-Zelenskyy summit, but Lavrov\u2019s grievances underscored just how far apart the two sides remain.\nHe said it was Ukraine that was hindering the peace process, along with European leaders who Lavrov said \u201cdon\u2019t want peace.\u201d\n\u201cThey say, \u2018We cannot allow defeat of Ukraine. We cannot allow Russia to win.\u2019 They speak in these terms: win, defeat and so on,\u201d he said.\nUkraine, which celebrated its independence day on Sunday, is being pressured to give up Russian-annexed Crimea as well as its eastern Donbas region and abandon any hope of joining NATO, the U.S.-led military alliance founded after World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union.\n\u201cZelenskyy said no to everything,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cHow can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?\u201d\nRussian invasion\nLavrov, whose country launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, claimed Russia had \u201cproposed several times a peaceful resolution on a diplomatic basis.\u201d\nRussia has been unwilling to discuss giving up the 20% of Ukraine it occupies, and insists that Ukraine remain nonaligned and unarmed.\nWhen Welker pressed him on whether Russia had indeed invaded Ukraine, Lavrov declined to use the term, instead using Russia\u2019s preferred phrase of \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d\nLavrov acknowledged that Ukraine \u201chas the right to exist\u201d but said it must \u201clet people go.\u201d\nPutin has long claimed, without evidence, that Kyiv has committed genocide against Russian speakers in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region, almost all of which his forces now occupy.\nRussia doesn\u2019t have \u201cany interest in territories,\u201d Lavrov said, but is concerned about people identifying as ethnically Russian \u201cwho live on those lands, whose ancestors lived there for centuries and centuries.\u201d\nMost of the international community rejects the idea that Ukraine is repressing Russian language and culture and says Russia launched its invasion under false pretenses.\nCivilians under fire\nRussia has killed or injured close to 50,000 civilians during the war including in strikes on maternity wards, churches, schools and hospitals, U.N. experts say, with civilian casualties reaching a three-year monthly high in July. Last week, a kindergarten was among the dozens of buildings hit in a deadly Russian strike on the western city of Lviv.\n\u201cEither the Russian military has terrible aim or you are targeting civilians,\u201d Welker said. \u201cWhich is it?\u201d\nLavrov said Russia only targeted sites linked to the Ukrainian military.\n\u201cWe never targeted the civilian targets of the kind you cited,\u201d he said, going on to say it was Ukraine that was \u201cpurposely\u201d hitting churches and civilian settlements. Ukraine denies targeting civilians.\nOvernight Thursday to Friday, Russia launched its largest assault since early July, firing nearly 600 drones and 40 ballistic cruise missiles, including at a U.S.-owned factory in western Ukraine that makes coffee machines and other electronics. At least 15 workers were injured.\nLavrov said that he had not heard of the factory incident, but that some people are \u201creally na\u00efve, when they see a coffee machine in the window, when they believe that this is the place where coffee machines are produced.\u201d\nFlex Ltd., the Texas-based company that owns the factory, said in a statement last week that the factory is \u201cstrictly focused on civilian consumer manufacturing\u201d and \u201cdoes not produce, supply, or support any military equipment or defense-related components.\u201d\nPutin and Trump\nRussian attacks on Ukraine have doubled since Trump took office in January and continued during talks with Putin in Alaska, leading some lawmakers to ask whether Putin is stringing Trump along.\n\u201cIf President Putin has so much regard for President Trump, why is he taking actions that are undermining his push for peace?\u201d Welker asked.\nLavrov said Putin respected Trump\u2019s focus on the U.S. national interest, and that he believed \u201cPresident Trump respects the same attitude of President Putin to protecting national interests of Russia.\u201d\nWhatever Trump and Putin discuss \u201cis not a secret\u201d and both leaders \u201cwant peace in Ukraine,\u201d he said.\nOn Friday, Putin praised Trump and said that it might be possible for the U.S. and Russia to fully restore relations he said were at \u201can extremely low point.\u201d\n\u201cWith President Trump, I believe that a light at the end of the tunnel has nonetheless appeared,\u201d he said, calling their meeting in Alaska \u201cvery good.\u201d\nSecurity guarantees\nLavrov addressed Russian demands that it should be a part of any international talks on Ukraine\u2019s security after defense chiefs from the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Ukraine and NATO met Wednesday to hash out protections that Kyiv\u2019s allies could offer in a deal.\n\u201cSecurity guarantees must be subject to consensus,\u201d he said, claiming Russia had presented security guarantees \u201cseveral times.\u201d\nPutin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy \u201cwhen the agenda is ready,\u201d Lavrov said. But he suggested that Putin would not sign a peace agreement with Zelenskyy, whose legitimacy Moscow has questioned since Ukrainian elections were postponed last year amid martial law.\n\u201cWhen we come to a stage when you have to sign documents, we would need a very clear understanding by everybody that the person who is signing is legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd according to the Ukrainian constitution, Mr. Zelenskyy is not at the moment.\u201d\nOn Friday, optimism appeared to be on the wane in Washington.\nIn a separate interview with Welker, Vice President JD Vance said Russia had made \u201csignificant concessions\u201d to Trump, including recognizing Ukraine\u2019s \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d after the war and not trying \u201cto install a puppet regime in Kyiv.\u201d\nBut Vance acknowledged there were \u201chills and valleys\u201d in the negotiations. \u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall,\u201d he said.\nTrump also appeared to temper his expectations.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he told reporters on Friday. \u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go. And I better be very happy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very important decision, and that\u2019s whether or not it\u2019s massive sanctions or massive tariffs, or both,\u201d he continued. \u201cOr do we do nothing and say, \u2018It\u2019s your fight.\u2019\u201d"

      "text": "It was just after 8 p.m. when Michael Waller pulled up to his home on a well-to-do block near Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Waller, then 59, glanced at his phone to check his email. Within seconds, two men appeared on either side of his gray Mercedes waving Glock handguns.\nThe man on the passenger side opened the door and slammed his gun into Waller\u2019s right ear and scalp, knocking him out for a moment. When he came to, he was still strapped into his seat belt, blood flowing down the side of his head.\nThe gunmen ordered him out of the car and commanded him to throw his phone into the bushes. As they began to drive away, one pointed his gun at Waller and threatened to kill him on the spot \u2014 prompting Waller, battered and bloodied, to duck into an alley.\n\u201cThese guys knew what they were doing, and they were so smooth about it,\u201d said Waller, a defense and foreign policy strategist at the Center for Security Policy, a conservative think tank. \u201cThey seemed like real professionals.\u201d\nThe carjacking in August 2021 made no headlines. It was part of a crime wave that shook the city during the pandemic. Four years later, the capital is teeming with National Guard troops and federal officers called in by President Donald Trump, who also took over the Metropolitan Police Department after highlighting the recent attempted carjacking of an administration staffer.\nThe takeover has sparked a fierce debate over the state of crime in D.C. What\u2019s beyond dispute is that carjackings exploded in Washington and several other major cities in the U.S. after 2019.\nIt\u2019s a particularly brutal crime, experts say, one that often causes lasting psychological damage. And while most types of crime that surged during the pandemic have since dropped off, carjackings are one of the few that have remained well above pre-pandemic levels in certain big cities like D.C., police data shows.\n\u201cIt became the crime of the pandemic,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a D.C.-based organization of current and former law enforcement officials focused on improving policing. \u201cAnd the reason you still have it is because juveniles learned how to do it. That presents a lot of challenges for the justice system.\u201d\nThe soaring number of young people who have engaged in carjacking is indeed one of the key factors that has driven the surge in the Washington area and beyond, according to interviews with more than a half-dozen police officials, criminologists and youth advocates.\nSome of these perpetrators stole vehicles to use them to commit more crimes. Many others commit carjackings simply for the thrill of it, or to earn respect and attention on social media, according to police investigators and advocates who have spoken to the young offenders.\nMany of those who were arrested in or around Washington were out of police custody in a day or two, the investigators and advocates said. In Waller\u2019s case, court records show that the men who were later arrested for being in the stolen car were not prosecuted at all \u2014 an outcome that those familiar with the system in D.C. said was not uncommon.\nOver the last 18 months, the carjacking numbers have fallen in the D.C. area. Sgt. Josh Scall, a supervisor in the carjacking unit in neighboring Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, said he\u2019s proud of the numerous arrests his unit has made in recent years, and the impact that\u2019s having on the crime rate. But even one carjacking is one more than he wants to see in his county.\n\u201cPeople look at these numbers and they don\u2019t take a minute to realize, numbers are people,\u201d Scall said. \u201cThese are people who were violently removed from their vehicle and are going to be psychologically changed for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\u201cWe can parade that we\u2019re not at 573,\u201d Scall added, referring to the record number of carjackings recorded in Prince George\u2019s in 2023. \u201cBut it\u2019s still unacceptable in our books.\u201d\n'Spiraled out of control'\nPeter Newsham was entering his fourth year as the chief of Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department when Covid began to sweep across the country. Crime skyrocketed in D.C. and other major cities spurred by a perfect storm of factors, including school closures, mass layoffs and social unrest following the death of George Floyd.\n\u201cI had never seen anything like it in my time in Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Newsham, who joined the force in 1989.\nCarjacking was among the crimes that rose the highest and the fastest. Newsham\u2019s department was dealing with a staffing crisis, low morale and new legislation that reduced penalties for young offenders.\nEven when investigators were successful in tracking down suspects, Newsham said, they were often right back on the street in a matter of days. That was especially true for those under the age of 18, who amounted to 65% of the 243 arrests the department made for carjacking in 2020 and 2021, according to police data.\n\u201cThese young people knew they could get away with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was very little consequence, and it spiraled out of control.\u201d\nRoughly 150 carjackings took place in the district in 2019. In 2020 that number more than doubled to 360, according to police data.\nNewsham left the department in January 2021 to become chief of police in Prince William County, Virginia. That year, the number of carjackings in D.C. rose to 424. It went even higher \u2014 to 484 \u2014 in 2022.\nBut the next year was when the situation got really out of hand. A total of 957 carjackings \u2014 nearly three a day \u2014 were reported in D.C. in 2023, according to police data.\nLt. Scott Dowling, who leads the more than two dozen detectives in the Metropolitan Police Department carjacking task force, said a relatively small group of offenders helped drive the explosion in cases.\n\u201cThe same people were committing multiple, multiple, multiple offenses,\u201d Dowling said. In one case in 2023, a search warrant led to the arrest of three people suspected of carrying out roughly 50 carjackings and thefts, according to Dowling.\nThe carjacking trajectory in D.C. during the pandemic mirrored that of other major U.S. cities.\nPhiladelphia went from 224 carjackings in 2019 to 409 in 2020. The numbers kept rising over the next two years \u2014 to 866 in 2021 and 1,311 in 2022.\nIn Chicago, carjackings rose from 603 in 2019 to 1,852 in 2021. The city experienced a slight dip in 2022, recording 1,649.\nThe numbers began to drop sharply in those cities and many others in 2023. Not so in D.C. or one of its closest neighbors \u2014 Prince George\u2019s County.\nSituated along Washington\u2019s eastern border, the sprawling, 900,000-person county is more residential than the nation\u2019s capital. It's home to the National Harbor and the main campus of the University of Maryland but also has pockets of low-income areas with high crime.\nSgt. Scall, the carjacking unit supervisor, said the volume of cases was so extreme in 2023 that he would go to bed with his phone in his hand.\n\u201cWe had some really bad incidents happen where we were surveilling for cars and we were shot at,\u201d Scall said. \u201cThat happened three times. It was pure insanity.\u201d\nScall said the stolen cars were rarely going to chop shops, where the perpetrators could make quick cash. It was far more common for people to steal cars for the thrill of it, to get recognition online or to use them to commit other crimes, he said.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just young people from poorer neighborhoods behind the crimes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no quintessential carjacker,\u201d Scall said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done search warrants at million-dollar houses. It really crossed over financial lines.\u201d\nThe number of carjackings in Prince George\u2019s County dropped to 368 in 2024, down nearly 40% from 2023. So far this year, there have been 113, which is roughly 50% fewer than the 250 recorded at this point in 2024.\nScall attributes the drop to his unit\u2019s increased prowess in busting the carjackers.\n\u201cIf you do a carjacking in Prince George\u2019s County, we\u2019re usually closing it in a day or two,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sharpened our skills. We know what to do. We know where to look.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not lost on Scall that the numbers this year are still trending far higher than the 93 recorded in 2019. He said policy shifts have helped keep repeat offenders off the street for longer than before, but he thinks the juvenile justice system is \u201cstill playing catch up.\u201d\n\u201cIf they are a juvenile, I don\u2019t expect them to go to jail for 20 years,\u201d Scall said. \u201cBut I think if you violently rob someone you should probably sit out for a little bit.\u201d\nIn D.C., 183 carjackings were recorded through July of this year. That\u2019s about 40% fewer than the same period in 2024. But it\u2019s already higher than the 152 incidents in all of 2019.\nThe case that got Trump\u2019s attention \u2014 the attempted carjacking of Edward Coristine, 19, better known by his online nickname \u201cBig Balls \u2014 took place in the early morning hours of Aug. 3. According to the police report, officers on patrol spotted about 10 \"juveniles\" assaulting Coristine, who worked under Elon Musk at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, before moving to the Social Security Administration. The officers managed to arrest two suspects \u2014 a boy and a girl, both 15.\nDowling said he believes new tracking software in cars, as well as new laws that raised penalties for gun crimes and thefts, helped to bring down the incidents of carjacking. But old-fashioned police work also played a significant role, he said.\n\u201cMy detectives are phenomenal,\u201d Dowling said. \u201cI often say that I don\u2019t get impressed very easily, but they impress me.\u201d\nHelping teens\nJawanna Hardy, the founder of the nonprofit Guns Down Friday, has devoted her adult life to helping victims of crime and young people caught up in the criminal justice system in the D.C. area. That gave her an intimate glimpse into the factors driving the carjacking crisis.\nAs the pandemic took hold, children suddenly lost the structure that school brought. Many in lower income areas experienced losses far dearer to them, Hardy said.\n\u201cA lot of my kids lost their grandparents, their strongest support system, during Covid,\u201d said Hardy.\nVideo clips glorifying car thefts caught fire on social media. Hardy noticed that young people in different cities were boasting about their exploits.\n\u201cEverybody had a name. They had a song,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cI could understand why the children were into it. It was exciting.\u201d\nAs the months went on, Hardy also noticed that the youths who were being brought to her for mentorship after getting caught up in the justice system were younger than she was used to seeing.\n\u201cFor some reason, the 15-year-olds were tearing the city up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d say 75% of the kids I was working with were 15 when they started committing these crimes.\u201d\nWhen NBC News first reached out to Hardy last week, she was with a 15-year-old who had recently been arrested for stealing cars. He was one of the so-called Kia Boys, who had been using basic tools to break into the vehicles and start them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what made me decide to do it,\u201d the teen said. \u201cThere was just a freedom. You\u2019re not supposed to be inside a vehicle, but it\u2019s moving fast at your feet. I enjoyed feeling that rush.\u201d\nAccounts like that sparked a light bulb moment for Hardy.\n\u201cI realized we were addressing the violent piece, but we weren\u2019t addressing the need to want to drive,\u201d she said.\nSo for young people who were at least 16, she began to help them navigate how to get a learner\u2019s permit. It was clear they wanted to drive. Why not help them do it legally?\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get kids into the mindset of, \u2018I can get a license. I can get a car. I can do this the right way.\u2019\u201d\n\u2018Why have laws?\u2019\nA day after Waller\u2019s Mercedes was stolen, Prince George\u2019s County officers spotted it at a busy intersection 6 miles from his home. When they tried to pull the car over, the driver sped off, according to a police spokesperson. The Mercedes crossed into D.C. but crashed into another vehicle on a highway there.\nD.C. police arrested the four occupants, one of whom had a handgun with an extended magazine, according to a police report on the incident. Investigators also recovered pills with labels indicating they were oxycodone, according to the report.\nThe suspects included two brothers, Davon Alston, 18, and Juvan Alston, 19. The two other suspects were 18 and 21. The four were booked on a range of charges, including carrying a pistol without a license, unauthorized use of a vehicle, fleeing a law enforcement officer and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, the police report says. (It does not make clear who was hit with the gun charge.)\nFor reasons unknown, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges, according to court records obtained by NBC News. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia did not respond to a request for comment.\nWaller, for his part, knew that his car had been recovered and that some suspects had been arrested. A detective had asked him to participate in a virtual line-up, but Waller said it took him too long to identify the one gunman he got a decent look at, the one who had pistol-whipped him.\nWaller said he never heard back from the police or prosecutors. When NBC News informed him this week that the men in the car weren\u2019t charged, Waller noted that he had no way of knowing whether the four were involved in the carjacking.\nEven still, he was aghast.\n\u201cThey\u2019re literally letting criminals in a stolen car, who are escaping police, back on the streets,\u201d Waller said. \u201cThen why have laws?\u201d\nEleven months after the carjacking, a 17-year-old was shot dead outside a home in Southeast D.C. Two teenagers were arrested and charged with murder: the Alston brothers.\nThey have pleaded not guilty and their trials are slated for next year.\nPolice charging documents say a video posted to Instagram 30 minutes after the fatal shooting showed Davon Alston and a second person riding in a Mercedes that was believed to have been used in the shooting.\nAccording to the documents, it had been carjacked about an hour earlier."

      "text": "The Republican-controlled Texas state Senate passed the party\u2019s new congressional maps overnight, completing a legislative odyssey that included significant Democratic delays and sparked a nationwide scramble over redistricting in the process.\nThe vote means the maps, which were designed to pad the Republican majority in the U.S. Congress, will go into effect when signed by Gov. Greg Abbott, a proponent of the plan who has been cheered on by President Donald Trump.\n\u201cThe One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate and is on its way to my desk, where it will be swiftly signed into law,\u201d Abbott said in a statement issued Saturday.\nDemocrats have promised to challenge the measure in court.\nTrump initially led the calls for Texas to redraw its congressional map, saying his party is \u201centitled to\u201d five more congressional seats from the state. That\u2019s what the maps intend to do: By redrawing congressional district boundaries in key cities as well as along the state\u2019s border, Texas will have 30 congressional districts that Trump carried last fall by a double-digit margin.\nThe GOP currently controls 25 of the state\u2019s 38 congressional districts.\nRepublicans have been adamant, and blunt, from the start of the process that their exercise has been a political one aimed solely at increasing their party\u2019s power in Washington, where the House is almost evenly balanced. Democrats need a net gain of just three seats in the 2026 elections to take the majority.\nDemocrats have accused Republicans of setting a dangerous precedent by not waiting until 2031 to redraw the lines, as is customary, and they said the new maps would hurt minority representation in the state, a charge their Republican colleagues denied.\nUnlike the state House, where business ground to a halt earlier this month when dozens of Democrats fled the state to deny the body a quorum to move forward with legislation, forcing Abbott to call another special session, the Senate has not been stymied by those efforts.\nThe move drew swift condemnation from opponents of the measure.\n\u201cThis is not democracy, this is disgraceful,\u201d state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said on X.\nDemocrats had planned to push back the Senate vote into the morning Saturday in a last-ditch attempt to delay passage.\nEarlier, state Sen. Carol Alvarado, leader of the Senate Democratic caucus, announced on social media that she planned to filibuster the bill with a long speech and intended to speak for several hours. But just when she expected to start, the Senate broke for a long dinner break.\nWhen members returned, Alvarado never had a chance to filibuster because Republicans accused her of breaking Senate rules by attempting to fundraise off the coming filibuster.\nSen. Charles Perry said it \u201cappears to be potentially unlawful, at least unethical, using state resources for a campaign purpose.\u201d\nWith Abbott poised to sign the new maps into law, the spotlight shifts to California, where Democratic lawmakers have their own proposal to redraw their state\u2019s congressional boundaries as political retribution for Texas\u2019 move. Unlike in Texas, where regular legislation is enough to change the maps, California Democrats\u2019 proposal must also be approved by the voters in a special election this fall in order to take effect."

      "text": "LONDON \u2014 Postal services across the world are halting shipments to the United States this week amid mounting confusion over new import duties that will apply to parcels starting Friday.\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order last month abolishing the trade loophole known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d which since 2016 had allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.\nThe end of the exemption is being extended worldwide after the loophole was closed in May for packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.\nUnder the new rules, personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free, but all other packages will face the same tariffs as standard imports from their country of origin.\nThe planned policy shift, which operators say lacks clear procedures, has raised concerns about backlogs as services are put on hold.\nPostal providers in Belgium, Denmark and New Zealand are among several operators that have already suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. until they can retool their systems to comply with the new rules. Letters and documents are generally unaffected.\nServices in Germany, France, Britain and India have announced they will follow suit in the coming days.\nFrance\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said in a statement that the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time to prepare for new customs procedures. New Zealand\u2019s postal service said parcel deliveries to all U.S. states and territories would be \u201ctemporarily unavailable until further notice\u201d while systems are updated to meet new U.S. customs requirements.\nDHL, one of the world\u2019s largest courier companies, said Friday that it will stop accepting parcels containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S. beginning Monday.\nThe company cited unresolved \u201ckey questions\u201d about the process, including \u201chow and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\u201d\nDHL will, however, continue to deliver private parcels labeled as gifts valued under $100, in line with White House assurances.\nThe White House said ending the duty-free exemption would help combat \u201cescalating deceptive shipping practices, illegal material, and duty circumvention,\u201d claiming some shippers had \u201cabused\u201d the exemption to send illicit drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.\nIt said the number of de minimis parcels jumped from 134 million in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024 as shippers \u201cdeceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law.\u201d\nMost of those packages came from mainland China and Hong Kong, which the Trump administration initially targeted as part of efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value goods from China-linked retailers such as Temu and Shein.\nThe White House briefly closed the loophole for mainland China and Hong Kong in February, but quickly extended the deadline to May 2 amid confusion over how the new duties would be collected."

      "text": "More than 20 hospitals and health systems have temporarily or indefinitely rolled back transgender care for minors and some young adults this year amid threats of federal investigations and cuts to government funding, an NBC News analysis found.\nTwelve hospitals have announced they have discontinued or will discontinue puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans patients younger than 19. Four announced they are no longer providing transition-related surgeries to those patients; one said it discontinued gender-affirming care for teens; and four said they temporarily stopped transgender care for those under 19 after an executive order from President Donald Trump in January but resumed after a judge blocked part of the order in March.\nIn addition to those 21 hospitals, another five have removed webpages dedicated to trans care for minors from their websites this year \u2014 one said it is still providing trans care to minors, one would only say it continues \u201cto comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations,\u201d and three did not respond to requests for comment. And separately, a health center in Iowa stopped providing hormone therapy to trans adults due to a Trump order that prohibits federal funds from being used to \u201cpromote gender ideology,\u201d the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported.\nThe changes have come as hospitals attempt to comply with state laws, which in many instances prohibit discriminating against trans people in medical care, as well as federal guidance, which in recent months has threatened to revoke hospitals\u2019 federal funding or charge them with civil or criminal penalties if they continue to provide trans care to patients younger than 19.\nPatients and families affected by these changes in care have described the effects as devastating.\nOne Florida mom, who asked that her name not be published due to fears that she could face harassment or be targeted by the federal government, recently bought one-way tickets to Berlin so she and her 15-year-old trans daughter could move there next month. The mom has acquired a language-learning visa, and her daughter will be able to live with her because she is a minor.\nWhen her daughter first sought access to transition care, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 administration and state Republican legislators were trying to ban it, so in September 2021, the teen and her dad started driving 11 hours to Alabama every few months so she could access care at the University of Alabama\u2019s gender clinic. Then, in August 2023, a court allowed a care ban to take effect in Alabama. Last July, they began flying to Washington, D.C., to receive care at Children\u2019s National Hospital.\nLast month, the hospital announced in a message on its website that \u201cin light of escalating legal and regulatory risks to Children\u2019s National, our providers, and the families we serve, we will be discontinuing the prescription of gender-affirming medications\u201d effective Aug. 30.\nThe mom said even if she could find another doctor in the U.S. for her daughter, she fears the family might have just one visit \u201cbefore the government steps in again.\u201d\n\u201cWhere can we go?\u201d she said. \u201cGrowing up, we were always told that America is the greatest country in the world, and now we\u2019re having to flee so that my child can get the health care she needs, and for our safety.\u201d\n\u2018These threats are no longer theoretical\u2019\nSince 2021, 27 states have enacted measures prohibiting access to puberty blockers, hormone therapy and/or surgeries for trans minors as part of a wider effort to restrict trans rights.\nSupporters of the legislation say the care has not been adequately studied, can have harmful long-term effects and that minors cannot actually consent to it. However, doctors who treat trans youth say puberty blockers and hormone therapy have been provided to minors who are not trans for decades to treat other conditions, such as precocious puberty. In addition, nearly all major medical associations in the United States support access to transition-related care for minors and oppose restrictions on it, with the American Medical Association calling government restrictions \u201ca dangerous intrusion into the practice of medicine.\u201d\nA study published earlier this year in JAMA Pediatrics found that less than 0.1% of adolescents in the U.S. with private insurance in the United States are trans and are prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones. A 2024 study published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the rate of teens ages 15 to 17 undergoing gender-affirming surgery was 2.1 per 100,000.\nThe remaining states where care is legal \u2014 particularly California, Colorado, Oregon, Illinois, Washington, Connecticut and Pennsylvania \u2014 have seen an influx of out-of-state patients, with some parents of trans minors even relocating their families to those states to maintain care for their kids.\nParents of trans youths have seen those states \u2014 and hospitals such as the Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, which is home to one of the nation\u2019s oldest gender clinics \u2014 as safe havens.\nHowever, in January, the Trump administration began targeting providers of trans care, including an executive order that sought to bar federal funding from going to medical schools and hospitals that provide such care to people younger than 19. In March, a federal judge blocked that part of the order, and some hospitals resumed treatments.\nBut then, in April, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo that said the Justice Department would investigate doctors who provide transition care to minors under existing laws, including laws against genital mutilation. In July, the DOJ sent subpoenas to more than 20 doctors and clinics that provide such care. A subpoena sent to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, which was made public Monday as part of a legal filing attempting to block the investigations, requested the names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, addresses and parent/guardian information of all patients who were prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission have also taken action to restrict care, both for minors and adults.\nChildren\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles mentioned all of these actions and more in a June 12 letter to hospital staff detailing its decision to close the Center for Transyouth Health and Development, which has been running for three decades, effective July 22.\nThe letter, which a spokesperson for the hospital shared with NBC News, described an HHS review published in May \u201cdismissing current evidence-based care protocols and standards of care while promoting alternative best practices for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria.\u201d The HHS review \u201cincluded dozens of references to CHLA and the Center for Transyouth Health and Development,\u201d the letter said.\n\u201cTaken together, the Attorney General memo, HHS review, and the recent solicitation of tips from the FBI to report hospitals and providers of [gender-affirming care] strongly signal this Administration\u2019s intent to take swift and decisive action, both criminal and civil, against any entity it views as being in violation of the executive order,\u201d this hospital\u2019s leadership wrote. \u201cThese threats are no longer theoretical. The federal government has already cut off hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. academic and research institutions for noncompliance with executive orders, often with little to no warning.\u201d\nEarlier this month, more than a dozen states, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, sued the Trump administration to block investigations into doctors and hospitals who provide gender-affirming care to minors.\nThe complaint argued that the federal government was trying to institute a national ban on such care when Congress has not passed one, violating the 10th Amendment by trying to usurp the power of states that have not passed bans. It also argued that hospitals were being forced to either defy the federal threats or comply and violate state laws against discrimination in medical care.\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement at the time that Americans support Trump\u2019s efforts to stop \u201cthe despicable mutilation and chemical castration of children,\u201d using inflammatory language to describe transition care.\n\u201cThe President has the lawful authority to protect America\u2019s vulnerable children through executive action, and the Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on this issue,\u201d Rogers said.\nRobin Maril, an assistant professor of constitutional law at Oregon\u2019s Willamette University, said the Trump administration is attempting to restrict access to transition care through guidance issued by regulatory agencies. That guidance tells doctors and hospitals \u201cexactly how the government is going to go after them,\u201d Maril said.\nHospitals are weighing losing all federal funding, which could force them to close, Maril said, or standing up to the Trump administration.\n\u201cTo stand up to the Trump administration at this point would result in kids losing care for all sorts of things,\u201d Maril said.\n\u2018That\u2019s just not fair\u2019\nThe climate created by the administration\u2019s policies, the investigations and the legal battles have been surreal for Dr. Kade Goepferd, the chief education officer at Children\u2019s Minnesota and a pediatrician in the hospital\u2019s Gender Health Program, which has not ceased or paused trans care for minors.\nGoepferd, who uses they/them pronouns, said their patients\u2019 parents are scared, and the kids don\u2019t understand why their friends can access any health care when needed, but they might not be able to access this specific type of care because they\u2019re trans.\n\u201cThey feel very singled out,\u201d Goepferd said. \u201cThe teenagers feel a lot of hopelessness. The younger kids feel a lot of fear for what their future may or may not be like.\u201d\nGoepferd said they have several patients who have moved or plan to move out of the country due to the increasingly restrictive care landscape for trans youth, and the number of out-of-state patients they see has increased over the last few years. The clinic\u2019s waitlist for a first appointment is about six months.\nThey said one of their greatest concerns \u201cis that we are tying the ability of transgender young people to access care they need, and the ability of their parents to make medical decisions for them, to the general public\u2019s ability to understand who they are and what their medical care is.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not fair,\u201d they said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that with other areas of medicine. We rely on medical guidelines and expertise to make decisions. So we\u2019re treating essential health care for transgender youth as exceptional in some way, and what I wish people knew more than anything is that it is not. I provide this type of health care the same way I provide any other type of health care.\u201d\nAs for the Florida mom, she said that as soon as her daughter could talk she would point to Daphne in the cartoon \u201cScooby Doo\u201d and say, \u201cI that girl.\u201d A psychiatrist said the child was \u201cpersistent, insistent and consistent\u201d in her gender for years, and they have supported her and spent at least $7,500 on travel to access care in other states.\nBut now, she said, it feels like they\u2019re out of options, and she\u2019ll be flying to Berlin with her daughter in September and leaving her three other children in the States with their dad.\n\u201cIt was like a nice fantasy that I would live in Europe one day, but then it became this absolute necessity, and I have to leave my other kids, and I don\u2019t even know how to explain how fearful I feel and how heartbreaking this is,\u201d she said."

      "text": "Delbarton, an elite all-boys Catholic prep school in northern New Jersey where several former students have come forward to allege abuse at the hands of the Benedictine order\u2019s monks, could soon find itself under a harsh spotlight.\nA trial resulting from a lawsuit by a former Delbarton student who says he was 15 when he was sexually abused by a monk is scheduled to begin Sept. 2 in Morris County Superior Court in what would be the first civil trial involving the Catholic church in the Garden State.\nIdentified by the initials T.M., the ex-student alleges he was assaulted by a former Delbarton teacher, the Rev. Richard Lott, and he\u2019s accused the Benedictine order of \u201cenabling that abuse,\u201d according to court records.\nThe lawsuit names Delbarton School and its connected monastery, St. Mary\u2019s Abbey as defendants. Lawyers from both sides have been barred by the judge from discussing the case, according to a letter the school sent to the greater school community, including students, their families, alumni and faculty on Aug. 15.\nT.M.\u2019s case is one of dozens that have been filed against Delbarton, a college prep school in Morristown where the tuition is $48,725-a-year and that boasts well-known alumni like New York Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star Peter Dinklage, and the sons of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\nIn the lawsuit he alleges that in 1975 Lott plied him with liquor before assaulting him in a barn on campus where the priest lived, and he also alleges in his lawsuit that Lott would invite other underaged students over for frequent illicit parties.\nT.M. said he reported the alleged assault to Abbott Brian Clarke in a letter after he graduated in 1977, court records show.\nClarke, however, said he did not discipline Lott or notify the police, and admitted, when he was deposed on Sept. 13, 2018, that he destroyed the letter \u201cBecause it\u2019s bad for the reputation of a school when there is sexual abuse associated with it,\u201d according to a transcript of Clarke\u2019s testimony.\nClarke, who was the abbot of St. Mary\u2019s Abbey from 1975 to 1995, died in 2019. Lott, who is 89 and no longer lives on campus, could not be located for comment. Lott\u2019s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn a joint statement, Abbot Jonathan Licari, St. Mary\u2019s Abbey administrator, and the Rev. Michael Tidd, the Order of St. Benedict and Delbarton School headmaster, said they \u201ccannot comment on any current litigation.\u201d\nIn 2018, the school publicly acknowledged that at least 30 men had come forward with allegations that over the course of three decades they had been victimized by 13 past or current priests and monks at the school \u2014 and by a lay faculty member who is now retired.\nThen-Abbot Richard Cronin and Tidd, in a letter dated July 20, 2018, said that eight civil actions against the school and St. Mary\u2019s Abbey, which is the monastery on the campus, had been settled and seven remained. In the letter, the school said it had notified the Morris County Prosecutor\u2019s Office of each allegation and continue to work closely with the office through its investigation.\n\u201cIn every single case that was settled, there was no admission of liability by the order,\u201d said Greg Gianforcaro, a lawyer who represented some of the accusers.\nAfter the initial lawsuits in 2018, more than 30 more people have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse against the school\u2019s monks and have either filed their own lawsuits or joined existing cases, he said. In 2019 to 2021, New Jersey\u2019s Child Victim\u2019s Act went into effect, allowing people to file civil claims of sexual abuse even when that abuse fell outside of the statute of limitations. It is unclear how many cases are still pending against the school; a spokesperson for the school said they could not provide those numbers.\nBilly Crane, who along with his twin brother, Tom, sued Delbarton in 2012 alleging sex abuse by two priests in the 1970s, had his case settled in 2018. He said the school did not have to admit liability as part of the settlement. The brothers did not attend the school but were on campus regularly because their father was a teacher there.\nIn an interview with NBC News, Crane said that some of the monks had coined a name for the dozens of former students who have come forward with allegation of sexual abuse at the hand of the school\u2019s clergymen \u2014 \"termites.\"\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that from other survivors going through the legal system now,\u201d Crane told NBC News. \u201cIt shows what they really think of us.\u201d\nThe \u201ctermites\u201d reference appears in a 2011 interview conducted by Steve Ordway of the mediation firm Little Voices, with the Rev. Donal Fox, one of the Delbarton monks accused of sexual misconduct. That interview could be entered into evidence for T.M.\u2019s trial.\nIn the interview, Ordway asked Fox, who is now deceased, whether there were \u201cany more termites out there\u201d and Fox replied there were seven other \u201cincidents of concern.\u201d\nThe firm was put in place to make sure the accused monks were complying with their \u201csafety plan,\u201d which includes enforcing restrictions that would bar them from having contact with the children, according to court records and Ordway\u2019s wife, Ann Ordway, who also worked with Little Voices.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like the kind of language he would use,\u201d Ann Ordway, said of her husband, an ailing Vietnam vet, in an interview. \u201cBut he could have been repeating language he heard from the monks.\u201d\nThe court record that includes the quote does not make clear the origins of the term and does not indicate whether Ordway was repeating a word someone else used first.\nIn reference to accusers being referred to as \u201ctermites,\u201d the school said that \u201cderogatory remarks made by either a monk or a layperson are neither condoned nor tolerated at St. Mary\u2019s Abbey or Delbarton School.\u201d\nAmong the monks who\u2019ve been accused in lawsuits of preying on students decades ago are the Revs. Benedict Worry, 73, and Jude Salus, 79, both of whom still live in the monastery on the 187-acre campus that is only a short stroll from the classrooms and athletic facilities used by the students, the school confirmed.\nLicari and Tidd said that the two monks are \u201coverseen by Abbey leadership and the Abbey\u2019s Safe Environment policies.\u201d\n\u201cThese monks have no contact with our students and are not permitted in or near any school facilities,\u201d they said.\nOf the two cases involving Worry, one has been settled and the other is pending. The lawsuit filed against Salus is ongoing, Gianforcaro said.\nCrane said he found it \"very disturbing\" that Worry and Salus were still living on campus, \"that they could potentially have contact with students.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re like unsupervised predators,\" he said.\nCrane went on to say, \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing besides their consciences to stop them from walking out. \u2026 And their consciences have been corrupted.\u201d\nThe school, however, made clear that the monks are heavily supervised.\n\u201cAs required by the Abbey\u2019s Safe Environment protocols, each monk\u2019s activities and movements are monitored under a Safety Plan that is annually reviewed by Abbey leadership and independent, third-party oversight from the Abbey Review Board,\" Licari and Tidd said in a statement. \"Both men are disabled, have limited mobility, and must be accompanied by an adult informed about their Safety Plan\u2019s requirements on the infrequent occasions that they leave campus, typically for a doctor\u2019s appointment.\""

      "text": "A judge in Mexico said boxer Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. will stand trial over alleged cartel ties and arms trafficking but could await that trial outside of detention, the boxer\u2019s lawyer said.\nCh\u00e1vez\u2019s lawyer, Rub\u00e9n Fernando Ben\u00edtez Alvarez, confirmed that the court imposed additional measures and granted three months of further investigation into the case. He described the claims against his client as \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201curban legends\u201d following the court hearing on Saturday in the northern Mexican city of Hermosillo.\nIf convicted, Ch\u00e1vez \u2014 who took part in the hearing virtually from a detention facility \u2014 could face a prison sentence of between four and eight years, Alvarez said.\nCh\u00e1vez, 39, who had been living in the United States for several years, was arrested in early July by federal agents outside his Los Angeles home for overstaying his visa and providing inaccurate details on an application to obtain a green card. The arrest came just days after a fight he had with famed American boxer Jake Paul in Los Angeles.\nSince 2019, Mexican prosecutors have been investigating the boxer following a complaint filed by U.S. authorities against the Sinaloa Cartel for organized crime, human trafficking, arms trafficking and drug trafficking.\nThe case led to investigations against 13 people, among them Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez \u2014 the son of convicted drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n \u2014 along with some collaborators, hitmen and accomplices of the criminal organization. Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was arrested in January 2023 and extradited to the U.S. eight months later.\nFollowing the inquiry, the Federal Attorney General\u2019s Office issued several arrest warrants, including one against Ch\u00e1vez.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Ch\u00e1vez was wanted since 2023 in Mexico, but that he wasn\u2019t detained because he spent most of the time in the U.S.\n\u201cThe hope is that he will be deported and serve the sentence in Mexico,\u201d Sheinbaum said in July.\nThe boxer, who is the son of Mexican boxing great Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, was deported by the U.S. on Aug. 19 and handed over to agents of the Federal Attorney General\u2019s Office in the state of Sonora, who transferred him to the Federal Social Reintegration Center in Hermosillo.\nThe high-profile case comes as the Trump administration is pressuring Mexico to crack down on organized crime, canceling visas of notable Mexican artists and celebrities and ramping up deportations.\nCh\u00e1vez has struggled with drug addiction throughout his career and has been arrested multiple times. In 2012, he was found guilty of driving under the influence in Los Angeles and was sentenced to 13 days in jail.\nHe was arrested last year for weapons possession. Police reported that Ch\u00e1vez had two rifles. He was released shortly afterward upon posting $50,000 bail, on the condition that he attend a facility to receive treatment for his addiction."

His death was ruled a suicide, but that ruling sparked numerous conspiracy theories, some of which were fueled by Trump and his allies. The DOJ-FBI memo agreed his death was a suicide, while also rejecting conspiracies that he'd had an incriminating \u201cclient list\u201d and had blackmailed prominent individuals."

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who was wrongfully deported to a high-security prison in El Salvador, was notified by immigration authorities that he may be deported to Uganda, less than 24 hours after his release from federal custody.\nAbrego \"may be removed to Uganda no less than 72 hours absent weekends,\" a source familiar with the case told NBC News on Saturday.\nIt is unclear if Abrego would be imprisoned or walk free in Uganda if he is deported there.\nSimon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego\u2019s attorneys, said he would \"fight tooth and nail against any form of deportation to Uganda\" or nearby countries in Africa.\n\u201cIt is preposterous that they would send him to Africa, to a country where he doesn\u2019t even speak the language, a country with documented human rights violations, when there are so many other options,\" he told reporters. \"This family has suffered enough.\"\nThe father of three was accidentally deported to the El Salvador\u2019s CECOT prison, notorious for its harsh conditions, in March, in what they called an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d\nHis deportation conflicted with a withholding of removal order from 2019 that prevents Abrego's deportation to El Salvador, where is originally from, due to concerns that he would be persecuted by violent gangs. The 2019 protective order does not bar Abrego from being deported to another country.\nAfter months of resisting, the Trump administration brought Abrego back to the U.S. in June.\nThe administration immediately jailed Abrego and charged him with conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nFor months, the administration has also accused Abrego of being a member of the violent gang MS-13, which his lawyers and family members have repeatedly denied. Abrego's lawyers have said he illegally immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland to escape gang violence in El Salvador.\nOn Friday, Abrego was released on parole from the jail where he was held, near Nashville, Tennessee, and immediately returned to Maryland. He was reunited with his family after spending nearly half a year away from home.\nImages of the reunification, released by advocates, show a teary-eyed Abrego holding his youngest son, who was with his father when Abrego was picked up by immigration authorities in March.\n\"Today has been a very special day because I have seen my family for the first time in more than 160 days,\" he said in a statement on Friday.\n\"I'd like to thank all the people who have supported me because after this long time I have witnessed that so many people have been by my side with such positivity,\" he added. \"Today I am grateful to God because He has heard me and today I am out. We are steps closer to justice, but justice has not been fully served.\"\nSean Hecker, another one of Abrego\u2019s attorneys, said in a court filing on Saturday that the Trump administration offered Abrego a plea deal earlier this week to deport him to Costa Rica.\nHecker wrote that if Abrego agreed to pause his release from federal custody until Monday, and plead guilty to both counts of the criminal indictment against him in Tennessee, \u201cthen the government would promise to deport Mr. Abrego to Costa Rica after serving any sentence imposed by the Court.\u201d\nThe court filing contains correspondence from the Trump administration and Costa Rican government, showing that the Costa Rican government said it would not detain Abrego upon his arrival to the country.\n\u201cThere can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,\u201d Hecker wrote.\nSandoval-Moshenberg appeared to suggest that deportation to Costa Rica might be favorable for his client.\n\"That\u2019s a pretty reasonable option, right? I mean, Costa Rica makes sense,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a Spanish speaking country. It\u2019s proximate to the United States. His family can visit him there easily.\"\nThe White House continued to berate Abrego on Friday, accusing him of being a violent gang member.\n\"He will face justice for his crimes. It\u2019s an insult to his victims that this left-wing magistrate intervened to put him back on the streets,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement. \"Garcia will be subject to ankle monitoring to ensure the safety of the American public until further action can be taken.\"\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Abrego's release \"a new low.\"\n\"By ordering this monster loose on America\u2019s streets, this judge has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the American people,\" she wrote on X. \"We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.\"\nAbrego's lawyers have now notified the judge in the Middle District of Tennessee that ICE has informed Abrego of its intent to deport him to Uganda. Abrego could not face the criminal charges of human smuggling brought against him by Department of Justice in that case if he is out of the country.\nHis trial is set for January."

      "text": "Vice President JD Vance remains confident the U.S. can broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine despite potential hang-ups that have emerged since President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\nVance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d\nTrump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.\n\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.\nDuring his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d\nWelker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.\nVance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d\nAsked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.\n\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d\nThe interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.\nOn Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.\nMeanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.\nIn the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.\n\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d\nTrump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d\nWhile acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.\n\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d\nPutin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d\nAsked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d\n\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d\nThe interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.\n\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nOn the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.\n\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d\nWelker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.\n\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to send the military into Baltimore to \u201cquickly clean up\u201d crime.\n\u201cBut if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the \u2018troops,\u2019 which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social, referring to the Democratic governors of Maryland and California and using a derogatory nickname for Gavin Newsom.\nTrump\u2019s comments are the latest in a line of threats to replicate the D.C. deployment in cities across the country after hundreds of National Guard troops were brought to D.C. in what he\u2019s described as an effort to fight crime, though critics have painted the move as an overreach for political purposes.\nReached for comment, Moore said in a statement that Trump \u201cwould rather attack his country\u2019s largest cities from behind a desk than walk the streets with the people he represents.\u201d\n\u201cThe President should join us in Baltimore because the blissful ignorance, tropes, and the 1980s scare tactics benefit no one,\u201d Moore continued. \u201cWe need leaders who are there helping the people who are actually on the ground doing the work.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s push to deploy National Guard troops to cities like D.C. is a significant departure from how presidents typically deploy the Guard, which is usually used to respond to situations like natural disasters and civil unrest.\nThe president first deployed thousands of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in June amid protests against immigration enforcement actions. Newsom vehemently opposed the move, accusing Trump of \u201choping for chaos so he can justify more crackdowns, more fear, more control.\u201d\nTrump deployed the National Guard to D.C. this month as part of a stated effort to fight crime, though at the time of his announcement, violent crime had decreased 26% compared to last year, according to D.C. police data.\nNBC News reported last week that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed an order authorizing about 2,000 National Guard troops in D.C. to carry weapons. Law enforcement agents have arrested hundreds of people in D.C. since Aug. 7, according to a White House official.\nMaryland\u2019s Moore said Friday that \u201cmany of the comments that are being made from the White House come off as so, so tone deaf and so ignorant\u201d about fighting crime.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they have not walked our streets,\u201d he said on CNN on Friday. \u201cThey have not been in our communities, and they\u2019re more than happy of just making these repeated tropes about us, but not actually working with us to be able to make sure that our streets are safe and that people can have a real opportunity to feel safe in their own neighborhoods.\u201d\nTrump criticized Moore\u2019s remarks in his Sunday Truth Social post, saying he assumed that Moore \u201cis talking about out of control, crime ridden, Baltimore.\u201d\n\u201cAs President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a \u2018walk,\u2019\u201d Trump added.\nHomicides in Baltimore have decreased by more than 24% this year compared to the same period last year, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said this month. His office has also said that nonfatal shootings have declined 18% this year.\nMoore said this month on CNN that Trump was using the military as a \u201ctool\u201d for political purposes.\n\u201cI take very seriously about how, when and why I deploy members of our National Guard in cases of emergency and in true crises,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cAnd I will not authorize the usage of Maryland National Guard forces for missions that I do not deem to be either mission critical or mission aligned.\u201d\nThe president on Sunday also threatened to pull federal funding for the replacement of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in 2024. The federal government had previously agreed to pay for the bridge\u2019s replacement.\n\u201cI gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cI will now have to rethink that decision???\u201d\nMoore slammed Trump\u2019s message, saying in a statement that \u201cany threats to this funding will cause irrevocable damage to the national economy and to the entire State of Maryland.\u201d\n\u201cWe have already begun rebuilding, and now that Maryland is showing great progress, our President is threatening to intentionally harm Maryland,\u201d he continued.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., slammed Trump's comments, saying the president's \"desire to play dictator with our military on American soil should be alarming to everyone, as should his unlawful threats to claw back federal funding that Congress explicitly approved.\"\nHe added that \"we have made important strides in public safety,\" and though \"there\u2019s more we can do together, Trump\u2019s threats to invade our cities are not the answer.\"\nSen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., also responded to Trump's threats Sunday afternoon, saying that her focus and that of \"Team Maryland\" will be to continue their work for the state.\n\"Trump is now threatening to extend his drastic overreach by using the U.S. military against Americans \u2014 we are not interested in his distractions away from his disastrous policies that have cut health care, raised the cost of insurance, and the cost of living for all of us,\" Alsobrooks said in a statement.\nSeparately, Rep. Johnny Olszewski, D-Md., said in a statement responding to Trump's post that \u201cBaltimore is making real progress, but sustaining our momentum requires collaboration at all levels of government.\u201d\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s threats to deploy troops to American cities and cancel funding approved by Congress are illegal, unhelpful and directly at odds to that progress,\u201d added Olszewski, who represents parts of Baltimore.\nIn recent days, Trump has also threatened to deploy the National Guard to other cities. He praised the National Guard\u2019s work on Friday, going on to say, \u201cI think Chicago will be our next, and then we\u2019ll help with New York.\u201d\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker hit back on Saturday, accusing Trump in a post to X of \u201cattempting to manufacture a crisis, politicize Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he\u2019s causing families.\u201d"

The decision has recently led to anguish, frustration \u2014 and more than a year without a haircut.\nUnlike Liverpool, which cruised to the English Premier League title last season, Manchester United struggled from the get-go. By early October it sat in 14th place, its worst start since 1989.\nHoping to lighten the mood of a fan base in the doldrums, Ilett announced on social media he would not cut his hair until the club won five matches in a row.

And with no signs of stopping anytime soon.\nManchester United opened the season with a 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal last weekend, taking Ilett and his bet back to square one. A trim could be possible soon. United\u2019s upcoming schedule features a run of smaller clubs, starting with Fulham on Sunday followed by Grimsby Town and Burnley. But perennial power and rival Manchester City awaits on the road before a home clash with Chelsea.\nThere\u2019s a high likelihood, barring upset victories, Ilett will be sporting a dark, thick shock of hair well into the fall. He says his girlfriend doesn\u2019t mind.\n\u201cShe likes the king\u2019s guard look,\u201d he joked.\nIlett says the wager largely stemmed from boredom. He moved from outside Oxford, England, to Castell\u00f3n, Spain, in November 2023 to be closer to his girlfriend\u2019s family and raise their 14-month-old daughter. Without any family or friends nearby and in between jobs, he entertained himself by watching Manchester United games.\nBut on Oct. 6, following four straight winless matches, he decided something needed to be done. Something that really spoke to the soccer gods and helped get the club back in a positive light.\nSo Ilett buzzed his hair and hit \u201cpost\u201d on Instagram.\n\u201cDay 1 of not cutting my hair until Man United win five games in a row,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cAston Villa today. I\u2019m not feeling that confident.\u201d\nThe team drew 0-0 that day and the rest is history.\nThe rules of the challenge were simple: be victorious in five competitive matches in a row. That meant any Premier League, Europa League or domestic cup game counted, while friendlies and exhibitions did not.\nOver the first 10 days of the challenge, he said, he noticed \u201ca few people were interested.\u201d It slowly started to build to 2,000, then 10,000 and then a month later 50,000. As of Aug. 20, \u201cThe United Strand\u201d has 227,000 followers.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to go on for this long. I thought it would be a few months,\u201d he said. \u201cA funny little thing to do. Make some Man United fans laugh in a tough time, and then that would be it, it would be all over. We\u2019d be back to normal, back to winning ways. But it hasn\u2019t quite worked out like that.\u201d\nSome of his followers are Manchester United fans who are supporting him during this trying time. Others, he said, are opposing fans rooting for losses to keep the hair growing.\n\u201cOn the whole, I\u2019ve been really pleased. It has been very positive. Everyone\u2019s been very nice, very supportive, and everyone\u2019s kind of behind me, I suppose, rooting for me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s even a lot of rival fans. I\u2019ve had a few Liverpool fans say, \u2018You\u2019re the only Man United fan that I like.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s the biggest compliment that you could ever get.\u201d\nIlett\u2019s videos are typically less than 10 seconds long and simply state the challenge rules with the current day number. The real fun, however, is how he wears his hair. It\u2019s become so long he\u2019s now taking requests on how to showcase it.\nSome days it\u2019ll be poofy while others it\u2019ll be curly or straight. Some days he\u2019ll dunk it in a pool or put it up in colorful hair ties. The newest request is pulling items out of his mane \u2014 a recent video has him playing with multiple fidget spinners.\nIlett says while he\u2019s enjoying his newfound fame, he\u2019s ready for it to be over. Though there\u2019s a very small chance he never cuts his hair again, he sees the challenge ending this year.\n\u201cI am genuinely optimistic that it will happen this season,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if you ask me in a year\u2019s time, if it hasn\u2019t happened, then maybe I might not be smiling as much. I\u2019m quite positive, quite optimistic that we\u2019re going to have a good season this season, and at some point those five wins are going to come together.\u201d\nWhen his hair is cut, he intends on donating his locks to Little Princess Trust, a U.K.-based charity that makes wigs for people diagnosed with cancer.\nEven more incentive for the bet to be completed.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve come this far now,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to see it through to the end, however long that might take.\u201d\nThough Manchester United has won England\u2019s top division 20 times, tied with Liverpool for most in history, the last United championship came in 2013. The team made moves this offseason it believes will get it back into contention. After loaning Marcus Rashford to Barcelona, the club brought in forwards Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Its latest addition may be the most crucial: striker Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko from RB Salzburg, considered among the top young scoring talents in the world.\nNBC Sports\u2019 Joe Prince-Wright said manager Ruben Amorim knows \u201ca top-six finish and a strong cup run is the very least United need to achieve this season if they\u2019re going to show people they\u2019re back on the right path.\u201d\n\u201cUnited has been going through this rebuild for most of the last decade, but it still feels very similar to the New England Patriots\u2019 current painful rebuild after the glory days of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady,\u201d Prince-Wright said. \u201cBut there\u2019s hope that United can be competitive, and if they can stay solid defensively, they now have the right combination of players, and characters, in attack to win games.\u201d\nHopefully five of them in a row, for Ilett\u2019s sake.\nHe said if the team wins four, he would love to possibly experience the final win in person at Old Trafford.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like the Champions League final for me. It\u2019s going to be crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we got to four wins in a row, and I went to the fifth game and I was watching it and we didn\u2019t win, I think it would be the most heartbreaking moment of my entire life.\u201d"
