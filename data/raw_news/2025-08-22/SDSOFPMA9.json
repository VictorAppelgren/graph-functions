  "title": "European space tech has data to sell \u2014 but where are the buyers?",
  "description": "Europe\u2019s space industry is producing valuable data. It just needs to convince more people to use the information \u2014 and pay for it.",
  "content": "The European space industry is booming. Yet despite the boom, the industry is struggling to find commercial buyers for arguably its most valuable output: data.\n\nAt the Living Planet Symposium 2025 in Vienna, the European Space Agency (ESA) and private sector leaders laid out Europe\u2019s bold space ambitions and called for increased cooperation to address deep commercial gaps. Josef Aschbacher, ESA\u2019s director general, highlighted one key focus.\n\n\u201cEarth observation within the European Space Agency is a major priority,\u201d he said.\n\nESA has had recent successful missions. Its miniature satellite \u03a6sat-2, for example, has started transmitting high-definition images back to Earth and will support wildfire, earthquake, and flood disaster management. The satellite can also be used to detect ships, gather data on illegal fishing, and monitor marine pollution.\n\nHowever, for European startups looking to develop innovative new services from space, the industry can feel like a siloed bubble. Daniel Smith, Trade and Investment Envoy for Space for the Scottish Government and founder of AstroAgency, warned there are major fractures between the different players.\n\nHe pointed to the disconnect between launchers, upstream and downstream space companies, and European businesses that\u2019s preventing them from benefiting from space data.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, because these companies are still struggling to commercialise,\u201d Smith told TNW. \u201cThey\u2019re still struggling to sell that data to other sectors. Because the space sector doesn\u2019t want to buy the data.\u201d\n\nGetting the message right\n\nThis year, ESA began operations with a budget of \u20ac7.68bn (about $7.91bn). This represents a 1.4% decrease in funds from 2024, and is dwarfed by NASA\u2019s $25.4bn allocation for 2025. It also fails to compete with the estimated budget of the China National Space Administration (CNSA).\n\nTo fill the budget gaps, maintain a competitive edge in space, and meet its ambitions, ESA has turned to the private sector. It aims to become a leader in Earth observation services, but can only get there by engaging with the local private sector, which, according to Smith, is out of the loop on uses for space technology.\n\nThis could be a big problem. If European companies do not create solid demand for space tech services, the entire industry will be put at risk. This includes spaceports, satellite manufacturers, and rocket makers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing Earth observation companies going out of business, some of which are more than 10 years old, and they\u2019re closing down because they can\u2019t commercialise,\u201d said Smith.\n\nWhile government organisations like ESA offer grants and incentive programs, the applicants often don\u2019t focus on monetisation and commercialisation, Smith added.\n\nThat leaves them missing out on big opportunities. Earth observation primarily utilises data from low-Earth obit (LEO) satellites, which have extensive use cases.\n\nLEO is already well-established in weather prediction and climate change applications. Sectors like agriculture, energy, infrastructure, logistics, maritime, and finance are also applying the satellite data to drive real-world impact. Adoption depends largely on leadership vision and data capability.\n\nInnovative use cases continue to emerge. For example, Scottish tech company Space Intelligence uses satellite data to create trust in the carbon offset financial market. The key to unlocking Earth observation\u2019s potential, according to Smith, is reframing how we think about the tech:\n\n\u201cSpace technology is ultimately about Earth, not about space.\u201d\n\nThe space industry is typically divided into upstream and downstream sectors. Upstream covers everything from manufacturing to launch, including rockets, spaceports, and satellite operations. Downstream services, meanwhile, offer ready-to-use space data for private companies.\n\nDownstream space data providers \u2014 driven by software developers and coding experts \u2014 retrieve satellite data, analyse it, and make it accessible for private companies.\n\nThe data they collect in LEO orbits can be immensely valuable. It could drive the European space industry and advance the development of its spaceports, rocket launchers, and satellite companies. Currently, however, commercialising the data is challenging.\n\nAs Smith explained, many space companies are struggling to sell their Earth observation data to other sectors.\n\n\u201cThe space sector and rocket companies don\u2019t want to buy the data,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThey want to enable the data, they want to launch the satellites, so it\u2019s still a big gap.\u201d\n\nThe reasons why European companies do not use space data in their operations are diverse. They include a lack of understanding of use cases, stigmas associated with space \u2014 such as slow and expensive processes \u2014 and the industry\u2019s failure to open up and clearly communicate its value to potential private partners.\n\nEuropean companies considering Earth observation data for new ventures need to focus on downstream space services, Smith said.\n\nSpire provides a positive example. The company operates a vast constellation network of affordable nano-satellites that operate in LEO, where they collect rich, granular data.\n\nThe data has supported a variety of use cases. These include greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, IoT system optimisation in manufacturing, natural disaster monitoring, and maritime data analytics for commodity traders.\n\nSpire breaks apart the upstream-downstream business model by taking a holistic approach to the entire space data supply chain. The company has manufactured and launched more than 200 satellites, building them in Europe and launching them from spaceports around the world.\n\n\u201cThey focus very much on constellations to provide [continual] coverage,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey build the satellites for customers, but they build them for themselves as well, and then they sell their data that comes from their satellites,\u201d he added.\n\nSpire is not the only company providing innovative downstream services in Europe. Other examples include Catalyst, which recently signed ESA\u2019s \u201cStatement for a Responsible Space Sector,\u201d and Hydrosat, which specialises in water, irrigation, and crop management solutions.\n\nHydrosat\u2019s latest satellite launched in June. It aims to advance the use of thermal satellite data and AI for food production, security, and natural resource management.\n\nPowerful use cases are also emerging in critical infrastructure and resource management. Forestry services, for example, are using space data from downstream providers to transform processes that were previously done manually. Tasks like inspecting and measuring forest health, size, and volume, or assessing dams and pipes are now supported by satellites.\n\nTraditional, manual approaches to these tasks can be dangerous, time-consuming, and expensive. Today, they can be streamlined and enhanced with space data from LEO satellites equipped with various sensors, including radio frequency, radar, high-definition cameras, and infrared.\n\nCompanies also merge the LEO Earth observations data with IoT or ground-based sensor information. \u201cIt\u2019s never just space data,\u201d Smith said.\n\nEuropean companies don\u2019t necessarily need to build their own satellites to benefit from space data. Many providers already operate extensive constellations offering rich, actionable insights. Startups and enterprises alike can reap the benefits.\n\nThe growth and impact of Earth observation will hinge on a stronger push from European companies to harness this wealth of space-derived data. As Smith told us, \u201cSatellites are already up there, and they\u2019re going up there more and more. We need people to use them.\u201d",

      "text": "Big business opportunities are brewing in the cosmos. Morgan Stanley predicts the space economy will grow from \u20ac355 billion in 2020 to over \u20ac1 trillion by 2030 \u2014 and competition for the rewards is fierce.\nThe USA remains a celestial superpower, while China is emerging as a powerful challenger. Europe has historically lagged behind the world leaders \u2014 but is now carving out a promising niche.\nAcross the continent, countries are converging around a single segment of the market: small satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO).\nAs the name suggests, low-Earth orbits are relatively close to the globe\u2019s surface: a maximum of 2,000km above the planet, and sometimes as low as 160km. Commercial planes, by comparison, rarely fly at altitudes much higher than 14km.\nIn the 50 years since astronauts last stepped on the Moon, human space exploration has been confined to LEO. Crewless probes still fly deeper into our solar system, but most satellites \u2014 as well as the International Space Station \u2014 are now found in low-Earth orbit.\nThe LEO appeal\nSmall satellites in LEO may lack the glamour of spaceships taking astronauts to the moon, but they offer compelling advantages.\nThe lower altitude alone has numerous attractions. The costs, risks, and time required for more distant missions have reduced their allure, while the appeal of low-Earth orbit has increased. Among its advantages are speed boosts from gravity\u2019s pull; better signal-to-noise ratios for radar and lidar; higher geospatial position accuracy; expanded launch vehicle options; more convenient journeys and \u2014 crucially \u2014 fewer resource needs.\n\u2018The pandemic highlighted the need for high-speed connectivity.\nInvestments have surged as the use cases have expanded. LEO can provide internet connectivity, Earth observation, satellite navigation, and weather forecasting \u2014 and it\u2019s becoming more accessible.\nAs a result, the number of projects in low-Earth Orbit is increasing rapidly. Dan York, who led the Internet Society\u2019s 2022 LEO satellite report, attributes this growth to three key factors: the ceaseless demand for connectivity, the plummeting costs of satellites, and an expanding funding pool.\n\u201cThe pandemic highlighted the need for high-speed connectivity that can be used for video communication, online learning, e-commerce, and more,\u201d York told TNW. \u201cLEO satellite systems have emerged as a powerful way to provide that high-speed, low-latency connection.\u201d\nIn the race to commercialise LEO, a single target has been assigned pivotal significance: the first-ever orbital launch from Western Europe.\nThe territorial advantage\nEurope already has a functioning equatorial spaceport \u2014 in South America. The Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, has been in operation since 1968. Originally, it served as the spaceport of France, but it\u2019s now shared with the European Space Agency (ESA), which covers two-thirds of its budget.\nDespite being 6,000km from mainland Europe, the site has a propitious location. Its position near the equator reduces the energy required for geostationary orbits, which match the rotation of the Earth. Rockets launching east can harness this momentum, while the centre\u2019s proximity to open sea reduces risks to human habitations.\nIn Western Europe, however, a satellite has still never been sent into orbit \u2014 but the milestone is getting closer.\nThe achievement would provide more mere than bragging rights. A homegrown spaceport would be a powerful launchpad for a budding LEO sector.\nThe location also has advantages. Western Europe can harness Earth\u2019s rotation to power polar orbits, a flight path that passes the planet from north to south. This trajectory gives satellites extensive views of the planet rotating below, which is particularly useful for observation, mapping, and surveillance.\nFurther benefits would arise from the proximity to Europe\u2019s production sites, talent, and connected industries.\n\u201cFor the first time, the EU will have its own telecommunications constellation.\nThe war in Ukraine has exposed another lure of LEO. As a result of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, Ukraine\u2019s terrestrial internet connection has been disrupted by damage, outages, and jamming. In response, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX offered free access to the Starlink satellite internet system, which has kept the country connected.\n\u201cThe success of SpaceX\u2019s Starlink service throughout Europe, and particularly in Ukraine, has shown the power of LEO satellite systems,\u201d said York.\nThe EU is now developing its own satellite constellation. Known as IRIS2, the network is designed to maintain internet access during crisis situations. The $6.2 billion project is scheduled to launch by 2027.\n\u201cFor the first time, the European Union will have its own telecommunications constellation, in particular in low orbits, the new frontier for telecommunication satellites,\u201d said MEP Christophe Grudler, rapporteur on the EU secure connectivity programme.\nThe bloc has grand plans to compete with Starlink \u2014 and that\u2019s just one of Europe\u2019s LEO ambitions.\nAll around the continent, countries are trying to reap the benefits. The first one to reach orbit will get an edge over the competition.\nContenders in the race\nOnly nine countries and one international organisation (the aforementioned ESA) currently have orbital launch capability, according to the Pentagon.\nBooming demand is expected for their services. The number of operational satellites is projected to grow from 5,000 today to 100,000 by 2040 \u2014 and spaceports across Europe are sprouting up to launch them.\nAmong them is a Spaceport Cornwall in the UK. In January, the site tried to send a satellite into orbit, but the attempt ended in bitter disappointment. After the Virgin Orbit rocket was successfully released, an engine malfunction brought the mission to a premature close.\nThe failure was a painful setback for Britain\u2019s launch sector, but by no means a fatal one. Virgin Orbit is considering another go in Cornwall, while the SaxaVord spaceport in the Shetland Islands is set to attempt a launch before the end of the year. Further sites are under development in Sutherland, Argyll, Prestwick, Snowdonia, and the Outer Hebrides.\nThe UK does, however, face growing competition from spaceports in the EU. Most are located in isolated areas of Northern Europe, where populations are sparse and the sea is close.\nSweden\u2019s Spaceport Estrange, for instance, recently became Europe\u2019s first mainland satellite launch facility. The inaugural take-off from the complex is expected in late 2023.\n\u201cEurope has its foothold in space and will keep it,\u201d said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the centre\u2019s opening in January.\nAnother contender in the race is And\u00f8ya Space in Norway, which hopes to launch its first satellite rocket this year. Sites in Iceland, the Azores, Andalusia, the Canary Islands, and the North Sea are also in the running.\n\"This is exactly the infrastructure we need, not only to continue to innovate but also to explore the final frontier further.\" -Ursula von der Leyen, President of the @EU_Commission\nWe are so excited about this new spaceport, which has now been inaugurated.#SpaceportEsrange pic.twitter.com/ASoofEtsZR\n\u2014 SSC \u2013 Swedish Space Corporation (@SSCspace) January 13, 2023\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a proliferation of space bases in Europe,\u201d Marie-Anne Clair, head of the Guiana Space Centre, told AFP in December. \u201cThe commercial aspect is real: there is also an abundance of micro-satellites which will require missions from micro-launchers.\u201d\nAn LEO island\nA satellite launch provides a springboard for the host nation\u2019s space sector \u2014 even if it fails. The UK\u2019s attempt last month, for instance, added impetus to the local industry.\nBefore malfunctioning, the rocket did reach space, while Spaceport Cornwall became the world\u2019s newest space launch operations centre. The build-up also boosted domestic satellite development and connected an array of talent, businesses, and public sector organisations.\nAmong them is Open Cosmos, an Oxfordshire-based startup that had a satellite onboard the Virgin Orbit rocket.\n\u201cWe delivered a satellite in record time,\u201d Open Cosmos CEO Rafel Jord\u00e1 Siquier told TNW. \u201cIt\u2019s sad not to have it in orbit, but we\u2019re ready to come back and rebuild the satellite at an even faster pace if needed.\u201d\nDespite the ill-fated launch, Jord\u00e1 believes that the UK is now a major player in LEO.\n\u201cThe UK, with its leadership and its growing commitment towards the space sector, now has a seat at the global table in this industry. And it\u2019s very important that we keep our team there and keep developing our capabilities.\u201d\nThose capabilities now encompass downstream applications, data and information services, and the upstream satellite and launch capabilities.\nAccording to Jord\u00e1, the UK\u2019s small satellite technology is particularly impressive. Alongside startups such as Open Cosmos, the country is home to OneWeb, one of the world\u2019s leading satellite internet players. In January, the company announced that it now had 542 satellites in orbit \u2013 more than 80% of the fleet for its first-generation constellation.\n\u201cWe now have a truly pan-UK capability.\nThe landscape also encompasses Surrey Satellite Technologies\u2019 world-leading small satellite platforms, alongside first-rate \u201cCubeSat\u201d nanosatellites produced by Open Cosmos, Clyde Space, and Spire.\nAnother drawing card is a strong supply chain for space hardware and software. British luminaries in this area range from SMEs such as Teledyne, to aerospace giants like Airbus UK and BAE Systems.\nPaul Febvre, CTO at Satellite Applications Catapult and a professor at Bradford University\u2019s new space AI centre, said launch sites will complete the package.\n\u201cNow that we are establishing small-satellite launch facilities in both Cornwall and Scotland, with new ventures being developed in East Anglia, we have a truly pan-UK capability which creates the conditions for competition and success,\u201d Febvre told TNW.\nUntil the British sites are operational, Open Cosmos will take off from other nations. But in the near future, Jord\u00e1 plans further launches from the UK and France.\n\u201cThe nice thing about the launch landscape at the moment is that it\u2019s very diverse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very competitive and that means we have multiple partners that we can work with for different types of orbits.\u201d\nSpace on the mainland\nAnother nation with eyes on LEO is France, which has the largest national space programme in Europe.\n\u201cFrance\u2019s space startup ecosystem is particularly strong in LEO satellites, and I think we will see a number of winners emerging from there,\u201d Maureen Haverty, VP at Seraphim, a prolific investor in space tech startups, told TNW.\n\u201cFrance is also the most successful country at encouraging US companies to set up in Europe and is the European hub for a number of key players.\u201d\n\u201cWe will have our own SpaceX.\nA further asset for France is Arianespace, Europe\u2019s leading satellite space launch company. The aerospace giant is currently developing a new reusable rocket, called Ma\u00efa, to challenge SpaceX. The launcher is due to be operational by 2026.\n\u201cFor the first time Europe\u2026 will have access to a reusable launcher,\u201d said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire last year. \u201cIn other words, we will have our SpaceX, we will have our Falcon 9.\u201d\nCritics have dismissed the prospect of Ma\u00efa competing with SpaceX, but the rocket would at least offer a European alternative. PLD Space in Spain plans to provide another.\nThe company aims to produce Spain\u2019s first rocket to reach orbit \u2014 as well as Europe\u2019s first reusable launch vehicle.\nNamed Miura 1, the 12.5-meter tall vehicle has a payload capacity of 100kg \u2014 just a fraction of the SpaceX Falcon 9\u2019s 25,000kg and the Rocket Lab Electron\u2019s 200\u2013300kg. But PLD Space is confident it can serve the booming demand for small payload launches to LEO.\n\u201cWe have demonstrated that PLD Space is the most promising company to improve European competitiveness in the microlaunchers race to space,\u201d Ezequiel S\u00e1nchez, the company\u2019s executive president, said after a successful test last year.\n\u201cThis fact makes our project strategic not only for Spain but with a European perspective and a reference to show the profitability of reinforcing investment in new players.\u201d\nThe public investment in Arianespace provides an edge over rivals that rely on private funding \u2014 but the competition is growing.\n\u2705Ensayo de misi\u00f3n de vuelo completado con \u00e9xito\nAhora s\u00ed, #MIURA1 est\u00e1 listo para volar?\n\u2014\n\u2705Full Mission Test successfully completed.\nNow, #MIURA1 is ready to fly ? #VAMOSMIURA1 pic.twitter.com/sOCLbppnQd\u2014 PLD Space (@PLD_Space) September 15, 2022\nSmaller startups are also fighting for a spot in low-Earth orbit. Haverty, who oversees Seraphim\u2019s investments in LEO satellite businesses, has seen success from those that tap into domestic expertise.\nAs an example, she points to Seraphim portfolio company ICEYE, which applies Finland\u2019s strengths in hardware and avionics to world-leading synthetic aperture radar. In Lombardy, meanwhile, D-Orbit has harnessed Italy\u2019s space heritage to establish the planet\u2019s only commercial in-space delivery orbital tug company. The firm recently launched its seventh and eighth missions on SpaceX\u2019s transporter mission.\n\u201cOverall, I think Europe\u2019s route to success lies in focusing on where they can be world leaders rather than trying to develop a European alternative to an American solution,\u201d said Haverty.\nPoints of differentiation could also compensate for some shortcomings.\nRejuvenating the old world\nThe barriers to LEO are lowering, but they remain daunting. Funding in Europe still can\u2019t compete with what\u2019s in the US; space projects are susceptible to delays that can push customers to bigger competitors; nascent markets are tricky to target with commercially viable products.\nStartups providing satellite internet services face further obstacles. The established leaders of SpaceX and OneWeb already have LEO constellations in space, customer equipment available, and regulatory approvals in many countries.\n\u201cThe single biggest challenge for these [European] projects is to get all the components launched and in orbit,\u201d said York, who led the Internet Society\u2019s recent LEO report. \u201cThe second biggest challenge is to obtain the regulatory approvals in every country in which they want to operate.\u201d\nThe growing demand for sparse skills is also difficult to meet. Rewards on offer in the US are often far more lucrative, and the finance and gaming sectors suck up much of the top tech talent.\n\u201cWe need to encourage and stimulate the understanding in our new generation of engineers, innovators, and entrepreneurs that space is a fantastic place to develop a career and business opportunities, and universities are the knowledge engine for the future economy,\u201d said Febvre, CTO at Satellite Applications Catapult.\nFurther problems have emerged in Europe\u2019s commercial launch sector. As well as lacking spaceports, the continent is short on effective rockets. Arianespace\u2019s Vega launcher has been marred by repeated failures, the Araine-5 rocket will soon be retired, and its replacement may not be available for over a year.\nThe rocket shortage could delay the launch of satellites into LEO. Consequently, Europe has become reliant on commercial launch partners, particularly SpaceX.\n\u201cEurope does not have the \u2018SpaceX Mafia\u2019 effect.\nHaverty adds two further weaknesses compared to the US: a limited product focus in satellite projects and a scarcity of second-generation spacetech founders.\n\u201cEurope does not have the \u2018SpaceX Mafia\u2019 effect,\u201d she said. \u201cEuropean governments focus more on grants rather than on contracts, which makes it harder to grow startups into big businesses.\u201d\nThe growing popularity of LEO has created another problem. There\u2019s only so much space in space \u2013 and it\u2019s starting to get crowded.\nThe ESA estimates that there are 36,500 chunks of space debris larger than 10cm, and 130 million between 1mm and 1cm. As these numbers grow, so do the risks of crashes and light pollution.\nThese threats can also scupper business plans. Regulators consider environmental concerns before deciding whether to allow a satellite launch, but their rules can place heavy burdens on LEO startups. Haverty hopes regulators exert greater pressure on the major operators than their smaller challengers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the vast majority of debris and causes of potential collisions are caused by the deliberate destruction of satellites by China and Russia,\u201d she said. \u201cMost operators are doing their best to keep space clean.\u201d\nOn the plus side, the problems of space debris and pollution are presenting business opportunities for space robotics, manufacturing, and in-space servicing. European startups have pitched a range of solutions, from AI monitoring of debris to towing satellites out of LEO.\nCleaning up is one of many emerging opportunities in LEO \u2014 and Europe is well-poised to grab a share\nDespite the challenges, the continent has an enviable array of major satellite operators, affordable engineering talent, a rich history of multinational efforts, and a superlative satellite supply chain.\nInsiders hope the spaceport race will further stimulate the sector. The first country across the line may not end up as the best, but the competition can be a boon for all contenders.\nThe capital flooding into LEO suggests the prospects are strong. Across the continent, investors are betting that a rising tide will lift all spaceships.\nGet the TNW newsletter\nGet the most important tech news in your inbox each week."

      "text": "List of government space agencies\n| Part of a series on |\n| Spaceflight |\n|---|\n| Spaceflight portal |\nGovernment space agencies, established by the governments of countries and regional agencies (groupings of countries) are established as a means for advocating for engaging in activities related to outer space, exploitation of space systems, and/or space exploration. The listings summarize all countries' and regional authorities' space agencies with a comparative summary of demonstrated capabilities.[citation needed]\nThe objectives include national prestige, exploitation of remote sensing information, communications, education, and economic development. These agencies tend to be civil in nature (vs military) and serve to advance the benefits of exploitation and/or exploration of space. They span the spectrum from old organizations with small budgets to mature national or regional enterprises such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States, the European Space Agency (ESA) which coordinates for more than 20 constituent countries, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities (Roscosmos) of Russia, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and the China National Space Administration (CNSA).\nThe space agency listings are segregated to enable identification of subsets of the complete list that have advanced to higher levels or technical or programmatic proficiency in accordance with the following:\n- Establishment of agency, initial exploitation of space-based systems\n- Development of launch capability\n- Capacity for extraterrestrial exploration\n- Demonstration of human spaceflight capability across one or more of these domains\nOverview\n[edit]As of 2024,[update] nearly 80 different government space agencies are in existence, including more than 70 national space agencies and several international agencies.\nLaunch capability\n[edit]This group of agencies have developed or are developing launch infrastructure including space launch sites, suborbital launch technology, orbital launch systems, cryogenic rocket technologies and reusable hardware technologies.\nExtraterrestrial exploration capability\n[edit]This group of agencies have developed advanced technological capabilities required for travel and study of other heavenly bodies within the Solar System. These involve the capacity to leave the local area around the planet Earth for lunar and/or missions to other bodies in the Solar System.\n| Space agency | Demonstrated capability | |||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Operates flyby spacecraft | Operates extraterrestrial orbiter | Controlled surface impact | Uncrewed soft landing | Uncrewed rover operation | Sample return | |\n| CNSA[123] | (Chang'e 5-T1) |\n(Chang'e 1) |\n(Chang'e 1) |\n(Chang'e 3) |\n(Yutu-1) |\n(Chang'e 5) |\nESA[124]\n|\n(Ulysses) |\n(Mars Express) |\n(Rosetta) |\n(Huygens) |\n||\n| ISRO[125] | (Chandrayaan-3) |\n(Chandrayaan-1) |\n(Moon Impact Probe)[39] |\n(Chandrayaan-3) |\n(Pragyan) |\n|\n| JAXA[126] | (Hiten) |\n(Hiten) |\n(Hiten) |\n(Hayabusa) |\n(MINERVA-II) |\n(Hayabusa) |\n| Soviet space program \u2020 | (Luna 1) |\n(Luna 10) |\n(Luna 2) |\n(Luna 9) |\n(Lunokhod 1) |\n(Luna 16) |\n| NASA | (Pioneer 4) |\n(Lunar Orbiter 1) |\n(Ranger 7) |\n(Surveyor 1) |\n(Sojourner) |\n(Apollo 11) |\n| Roscosmos | (Exomars Trace Gas Orbiter) |\n(Luna 25) |\nWithout launch capabilities\n[edit]This category is formed by agencies that operate and construct satellites in extraterrestrial environments, but do not have the capability to transport those satellites to the desired orbit/trajectory/landing spot. As far as we know as of the 10th May 2024, five space agencies have achieved the requirements to be listed here: [a]\n| Space agency | Demonstrated capability | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Operates extraterrestrial orbiter | Controlled surface impact | Uncrewed soft landing | Uncrewed rover operation | Sample return | |\n| LuxSpace | (Manfred Memorial Moon Mission, flyby only) |\n||||\n| ASI | (ArgoMoon) |\n||||\n| KARI | (Danuri) |\n||||\n| UAESA | (Emirates Mars Mission) |\n||||\n| SUPARCO | (ICUBE-Q) |\nHuman spaceflight capability\n[edit]This small group of countries/space agencies have demonstrated the highest technological capacity with systems and solutions that support human spaceflight along with the ancillary technological capabilities to support human activity in orbit and/or on extraterrestrial bodies. The missions identified (and personnel when appropriate) are the first successful accomplishments of each activity.\n| Space agency | Demonstrated capability | |||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Crewed space launch | EVA | Rendezvous and docking | Space station | Crewed circumlunar flight | Crewed Moon landing | |\n| CNSA | (Shenzhou 5) |\n(Shenzhou 7) |\n(Shenzhou 8 to Tiangong-1) |\n(Tiangong-1) |\n||\n| ISRO | (SDX01 to SDX02 \u2014 as part of SpaDeX) |\n|||||\n| Roscosmos | (Soyuz TM-14) |\n(Mir, Aleksandr Volkov and Sergei Krikalev) |\n(Soyuz TM-14 to ISS) |\n(Mir) |\n||\n| Soviet space program \u2020 | (Vostok 1) |\n(Voskhod 2, Alexei Leonov) |\n(Soyuz 4 to Soyuz 5) |\n(Salyut 1) |\n||\n| NASA[102] | (Mercury-Redstone 3) |\n(Gemini 4, Ed White) |\n(Gemini 8 to GATV) |\n(Skylab) |\n(Apollo 8) |\n(Apollo 11) |\nProposed agencies\n[edit]- Albanian Space Office (ASO), proposed in 2020, at progress stage.[127]\n- Armenian Space Agency (ArmCosmos), proposed in 2013 with the goal to launch satellites, currently negotiating with the International Telecommunication Union to clear the path for its prospective launch.[128]\n- Bhutan Space Office (BSO), proposed in 2016, at progress stage.[129]\n- Botswana Aeronautics and Space Agency (BotswanaSpace), proposed in 2020, at progress stage.[130]\n- Cambodian Aeronautics and Space Office (CASO), proposed in 2016, at progress stage.[131]\n- Croatian Space Agency (CROSA), proposed in 2020, currently operates as NGO Adriatic Aerospace Association (A3), at progress stage.[132][133]\n- Djibouti National Space Office (DNSO), announced in 2022, at bill stage.[134]\n- Guatemala Space Agency, proposed in 2019, at progress stage.[135][136]\n- Honduras Space Agency (AEH), proposed in 2018, at progress stage.[137]\n- Iraqi National Aeronautics and Space Office (INASO), proposed in 2019, at progress stage.[138]\n- Lao Aeronautics and Space Agency (LaoSpace), proposed in 2015, at progress stage.[139]\n- Latvia Space Office (LSO), proposed in 2020, at progress stage.[140]\n- Malta Space Office (MSO), proposed in 2022, at progress stage.[141]\n- Moldova National Space Office, proposed in 2018, at progress stage.[142]\n- Monaco Space Agency, proposed in 2020, at progress stage.[143]\n- Montenegrin National Bureau of Space, announced in 2022, bill stage.[144]\n- Myanmar Aeronautics and Space Agency (MASA), proposed in 2019, at progress stage.[145][146]\n- Nepal Aeronautics and Space Office (NepalSpace), proposed in 2018, at progress stage.[147]\n- Nicaraguan Space Agency (AEN), announced in 2021, bill stage.[148][149]\n- Oman Space Agency (OSA), proposed in 2020, at progress stage.[150][151]\n- Panama Space Agency (AEP), proposed in 2014, at progress stage.[152]\n- Serbian Space Office (SerbSpace), proposed in 2016, at progress stage.[153]\n- Slovenian National Bureau of Space, proposed in 2019, at progress stage.[154][155]\n- Sri Lanka Aeronautics and Space Agency (SLASA), proposed in 2009.

      "text": "Successful contact confirms the satellite is healthy and commissioning is underway to enable delivery of high-resolution thermal infrared data for agriculture.\nMountain View, Calif. \u2013 June 24, 2025 \u2013 Muon Space, a leading provider of end-to-end space systems specializing in mission-optimized satellite constellations, today announced the successful launch and initial contact 6 minutes after deployment with VanZyl-2, its latest mission satellite developed for Hydrosat, a company leveraging thermal satellite data and AI to address critical global challenges in food production, security, and natural resource management. The satellite is healthy and currently undergoing commissioning. The mission represents a significant advancement in Earth observation capabilities supporting agricultural productivity, drought detection, and security use cases.\nBuilt on Muon\u2019s mission-optimized Halo\u2122 platform, VanZyl-2 launched aboard SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-14 mission from Vandenberg Space Force Base. The satellite integrates Hydrosat\u2019s VanZyl-2 high-resolution multispectral and thermal infrared (IR) imaging instruments. These sensors will provide continuous monitoring of critical Earth systems.\nThe launch expands Hydrosat\u2019s constellation, advancing its goal of delivering daily thermal and multispectral imagery to support agricultural monitoring, environmental intelligence, and additional capabilities such as infrastructure assessment and nighttime detection of ships and other heat sources. The Hydrosat VanZyl-2 mission, leveraging Muon\u2019s Halo satellite platform, increases collection capacity by 4X over the initial VanZyl-1 mission \u2013 enabling the capture of eight million square kilometers of data per day. By building out this constellation, Hydrosat aims to offer unprecedented insight into planetary heat dynamics and water stress across ecosystems for users and AI-driven applications.\n\u201cThis launch perfectly exemplifies our mission-optimization philosophy in action. Rather than forcing customers to adapt to a generic satellite platform, we\u2019ve optimized our Halo platform specifically around Hydrosat\u2019s thermal IR requirements. The result is a spacecraft that delivers significantly more collection capacity than the original mission \u2013 that\u2019s the power of purpose-built space systems.\u201d\n\u201cThis mission marks a major step forward in Hydrosat\u2019s vision to deliver game-changing insights to address agricultural challenges worldwide. Partnering with Muon Space has enabled us to rapidly deploy our thermal infrared sensing technology on a high-performance platform, accelerating our ability to support agriculture and environmental monitoring at scale.\u201d\nThis mission highlights the flexibility of Muon\u2019s Halo platform and the company\u2019s ability to deliver high-performance, mission-ready spacecraft on accelerated timelines. By leveraging a vertically integrated approach to satellite development and operations, Muon enables customers to rapidly deploy and scale advanced sensing capabilities without the burden of building or operating their own satellites.\nAbout Muon Space\nFounded in 2021, Muon Space is an end-to-end space systems company that designs, builds, and operates mission-optimized satellite constellations to deliver critical data and enable real-time compute and decision-making in space. Its proprietary technology stack, Halo\u2122, integrates advanced spacecraft platforms, robust payload integration and management, and a powerful software-defined orchestration layer to enable high-performance capabilities at unprecedented speed \u2013 from concept to orbit. With state-of-the-art production facilities in Silicon Valley and a growing track record of national security and commercial customers, Muon Space is redefining how critical Earth intelligence is delivered from space.\nFor more information on Muon Space, click here.\nAbout Hydrosat\nHydrosat leverages thermal satellite datfood production, security, and natural resource management. Hydrosat currently monitors millions of acres for customers such as NOAA, NRO, Bayer, SupPlant, and Nutradrip, who trust the company\u2019s high-resolution, timely satellite thermal imagery to deliver advanced analytics that convey precise crop yield forecasts and improved irrigation tools to agricultural, commercial, and public sector customers around the globe.\nRead the original article here."

      "text": "\u03a6sat-2 begins science phase for AI Earth images\n\u03a6sat-2, a miniature satellite, has completed its commissioning and has begun delivery of science data, using algorithms to efficiently process and compress Earth observation images, as well as detect wildfires, ships, marine pollution and more.\nThe cubesat measuring 22 x 10 x 33 cm was launched in August 2024 and the first image was delivered four days after launch. Since then, the \u03a6sat-2 team has spent nine months commissioning the satellite\u2019s multispectral imager and its onboard AI applications, which carry out a range of activities.\nThese AI capabilities include selecting images with clear visibility, while discarding images obscured by cloud cover. The algorithms can also detect and analyse disaster areas, for example zones affected by wildfires, earthquakes or floods, and identify access routes for emergency response teams. It can also be used to detect ships, gather data on illegal fishing and marine pollution. Commissioning was concluded in the second quarter of this year and the satellite is now delivering scientific data.\nThe satellite orbits at an altitude of 510 km. It generates images using seven multispectral bands, from visible to near-infrared, as well as one panchromatic band, with a ground sampling distance of about 5 m. This type of remote-sensing instrument is particularly useful for environmental monitoring, land management and mapping.\nTo mark the transition from commissioning to science phase, five images have been selected to show a range of capabilities for various end-uses over diverse types of terrain. All images are true colour using red, green and blue spectral bands, except for the image of the Bahia Blanca Estuary, which is false colour using near-infrared spectral band.\n- Clavering \u00d8er glaciers, Greenland\n- Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina\n- City of Innsbruck, Austria\n- Sediment in Gulf of Tunis, Tunisia\n- Ships in Port Said, Egypt\n\u03a6sat-2 was designed with the purpose of demonstrating and testing the use of onboard AI in Earth observation. According to Nicola Melega, ESA Earth observation system engineer and responsible for commissioning \u03a6sat-2, the initial plan was to process data onboard and then transmit information generated by the AI applications back to Earth. Nicola said, \u201cAs often happens, we realised during the commissioning phase that there were ways of making the mission more interesting for AI developers and instead of making available only the end results of the onboard processing chain (Level 2 data) we now provide users with an entire collection of Level 1 data products that will help the application development and the training process.\u201d\nThe ground segment is provided by Open Cosmos and CGI Italy; while Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) provides a ground station service, mainly from antennas in Svalbard. Data are made available on the Insula platform by CGI Italy \u2013 and are freely available to anyone who wants to register (requests for registration should be sent to insula-info.it@cgi.com).\n\u03a6sat-2 is still a demonstrator mission: it is designed to find the limitations and gaps in new technology. Nicola explained, \u201cBut its purpose is also to build our understanding of the processes. We can check the performance of the applications and we can also see what resources are needed to manage the mission and process the data.\u201d"
