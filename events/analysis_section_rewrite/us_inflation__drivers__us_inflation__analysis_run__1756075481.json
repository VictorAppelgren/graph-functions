      "feedback": "Strengths: the draft assembles a coherent, cross-topic Regime A/B/C framework that links policy posture (tariffs, China reciprocity) to AI/data-center capex, Nvidia momentum, oil supply/demand dynamics, core inflation paths, and euro-area regimes, with explicit source anchors (SGB2PAZGK, STBVARD8F, T1QE6JPIX, Y6SQOEK69, NL5YYTLF2, R3WNA7L7A, 22PL3Q360, etc.). It clearly signals the direction of drivers (policy-led productivity uplift, lower discount rates under Regime A) and notes fragile links (tariff spikes, inflation persistence). However, to reach world-class quality, tighten the causal chain, sharpen the scenario structure, quantify where possible, and enforce rigorous sourcing and conflict resolution.\n\nActionable edits (compact, no new sources beyond IDs provided):\n- Build a formal first-principles chain: state a concise mechanism: policy posture elevates AI/data-center capex and productivity (Regime A), which lowers discount rates and risk premia, lifting equities; tariff transitory pass-through affects inflation lightly and fades with time; oil supply/demand under Regime A supports a stable macro backdrop; tie every link explicitly to a cited source.\n- Replace the narrative aggregation with a structured three-regime scenario tree: define Regime A (disinflation, easing optional), Regime B (sticky inflation, higher discount rates), Regime C (growth slow-down, defensives). For each regime, list the triggers (wage-growth momentum, inflation persistence, Jackson Hole policy signals, semiconductor capex cadence) and the invalidation conditions (e.g., sustained inflation > target for two consecutive prints, tariff spikes exceeding X, or AI capex cadence disappoints for a sustained period). Explicitly link each regime to the relevant sources (e.g., Regime A uplift via SGB2PAZGK/STBVARD8F; oil/FX tensions via T1QE6JPIX; euro-area shifts via NL5YYTLF2).\n- Quantify with disciplined anchoring to numbers in sources: map base-case numbers (oil probabilities, supply deltas; 2025 revenue midpoint, GM, ROIC) to regime outcomes; for example, show how Regime A vs Regime B/C would alter discount-rate assumptions and equity multiples, using the provided ranges (e.g., 0.30%–0.40% MoM CPI path, 50/30/20 euro-area regime splits) as sensitivity bounds. If precise sensitivity figures aren’t in sources, clearly label them as qualitative ranges and attach sources after each assertion.\n- Resolve potential conflicts by a single, coherent regime-prior: pick a primary regime mix (e.g., Regime A ~50% probability oil, ~50% core inflation path) and explicitly note alternative trajectories as upside/downside risks, with cross-checks against all relevant sources to avoid internal inconsistency (SGB2PAZGK, T1QE6JPIX, Y6SQOEK69, 22PL3Q360, NL5YYTLF2, R3WNA7L7A).\n- Tighten citations and coverage: attach a source after each substantive claim (e.g., policy-driven productivity and AI capex tie to SGB2PAZGK/STBVARD8F; oil regime probabilities to T1QE6JPIX; core inflation path to 15/9; euro-area regimes to NL5YYTLF2; ACMR long-horizon anchors to 22PL3Q360), and ensure all critical sources are represented rather than only a subset.\n- Sharpen the watch-list with decisive signals and numeric or event-like triggers grounded in sources: wage-growth momentum shifts, inflation prints deviating from 0.30%–0.40% MoM path, policy guidance at Jackson Hole, the pace of semiconductor and AI capex cadence, tariff trajectory changes, and Nvidia momentum (STBVARD8F) as a near-term risk/alpha driver.\n- Improve alignment with SECTION FOCUS by explicit macro/policy/flows/positioning/valuation channels in one flowing causal arc, then a concise, signal-driven watch-list; avoid digressions (e.g., extraneous brand mentions) and ensure every sentence ties to a source.\n- Paragraph-level polish: unify terminology (Regime A vs Regime I should be the same frame), reduce repeated parentheticals, and ensure each claim has a crisp anchor to one or more of the cited IDs.\n\nDecisive upcoming signals (watch-list, compact): wage-growth momentum readings and inflation prints relative to the 0.30%–0.40% MoM path; Jackson Hole policy guidance/communications; cadence and scale of semiconductor and AI capex; actual tariff trajectory and episodic spike timing; Nvidia-driven AI momentum as a cross-asset confirmation; oil supply/demand updates feeding Regime A vs B; and any shifts in euro-area policy/inflation dynamics (all tied to the IDs above).",
