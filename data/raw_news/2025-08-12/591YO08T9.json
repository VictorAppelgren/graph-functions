  "description": "\"Bloomberg Markets\" follows the market moves across every global asset class and discusses the biggest issues for Wall Street. Today's guests: UBS Investment Bank Global Economist Alan Detmeister, BKV CEO Christopher Kalnin and Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "VONNIE: WELCOME TO \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" I AM VONNIE QUINN. LET'S GET IT QUICK CHECK OF THE MARKETS. IT IS LOCKED AND LOADED FOR SEPTEMBER AND THAT HAS THE RALLY RESUMING. S & P 500 UP ALMOST 1%, NASDAQ OF MORE THAN 1%. TD BRINGING FORWARD THEIR FIRST RATE CUT FROM OCTOBER TO AT 3.72. A LOT TO SETTLE WHEN IT COMES TO THE FED, FED GOVERNORS AND SOMEONE, AND A LOT MORE PICKS IN THE PACK. WE WILL SEE WITH THE FED PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE, THE FED CHAIR NEXT TIME AROUND. THERE IS A LOT OF QUESTIONS SWIRLING. NATURAL GAS HAS BEEN IN THE DUMPS, DOWN 4% TODAY. WE WILL BE SPEAKING WITH THE CEO IN A LITTLE BIT FROM BBX AND WE WILL ASK HIM ABOUT NATURAL GAS PRICES AND WHAT PRODUCERS WILL BE DOING. LET'S GET TO INDIVIDUAL EQUITY MEMBERS WITH AN ITALIA. NATALIA: CIRCLE INTERNET SHARES ARE UP 2.6%, THE FIRST EARNINGS REPORT SINCE THE COMPANY WENT PUBLIC IN JUNE. REVENUE CAME ABOVE EXPECTATIONS AND THERE WAS A 90% YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CIRCULATION AND THE STABLECOIN. NEXT ONE IS RETAIL SPACE. SHARES OF ON HOLDINGS ARE UP 7.6%. THE MAKER OF SNICKERS POSTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED SALES AND BOOSTED ITS OUTLOOK. THE RESULTS SHOWED MORE THAN 100% JUMP IN REVENUE FROM ASIAN MARKETS. GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS ABOUT 17%. FINALLY, SHARES OF AI SOFTWARE COMPANY BIG BEAR AI DROPPED MORE THAN 20% TODAY. IT REPORTED REVENUE THAT MISSED ANALYST EXPECTATIONS, AND THEY POINTED OUT THAT THE OUTLOOK IS WEAK AS THE COMPANY SUFFERS DISRUPTIONS IN FEDERAL CONTRACT FROM WASHINGTON EFFICIENCY EFFORTS. VONNIE: NATALIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE BIG DATA POINT, U.S. INFLATION, CPI ACCELERATING IN JULY BUT THE MOST THE START OF THE YEAR. NOT FAST ENOUGH TO RAISE TARIFF CONCERNS. NOT EVERYONE IS CONVINCED INFLATION IS UNDER CONTROL OR THAT THE FED SHOULD CUT IN SEPTEMBER. TAKE A LISTEN TO DAVID KELLY ON BLOOMBERG EARLIER. > > WHY AGAIN IS THE FED CUTTING? IF INFLATION IS HEADING THE WRONG WAY SLOWLY, THEY SHOULD STAY ON HOLD. THERE IS NO URGENCY ABOUT CUTTING RATES. NOW, I THINK THEY WILL CUT RATES FOR POLITICAL REASONS, WHICH IS VERY UNFORTUNATE. WHAT WE HAVE GOT IS A TORTOISE OF AN ECONOMY AND A HARE OF A MARKET AND WE ARE GIVING MORE SUGAR TO THE HARE. VONNIE: UNDERLINING U.S. INFLATION RATION SELECTED BY THE MOST IN YOUR --ACCELERATED BY THE MOST IN A YEAR. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS WITH A GLOBAL ECONOMIST AT UBS INVESTMENT BANK. THAT IS A BIG THING TO LEVEL AT THE FED, THAT IT IS GOING TO CUT IN SEPTEMBER BUT FOR POLITICAL REASONS BECAUSE WHY WOULD YOU CUT NOW. DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS OUTLOOK FROM DAVID KELLY? > > NO, WE THINK THE FED IS FOCUSED MUCH MORE ON THE REAL SIDE OF THE ECONOMY. WE SAW THE LABOR MARKET REALLY STARTING TO WEAKEN THE LAST EMPLOYMENT REPORT, AND IT HAS BEEN SLUMMING FOR A LITTLE WHILE. GDP GROWTH HAS BEEN SLOWING EACH OF THE LAST. -- THREE QUARTERS. THERE IS A GOOD REASON FOR THE FED TO BE CUTTING IF THEY ARE FOCUSED ON THE LABOR AND GDP SIDE OF THE ECONOMY THAN ON THE INFLATION SIDE. VONNIE: IF ANYTHING, WHILE TODAY THERE WAS A BIT OF AN UPTICK IN INFLATION, IT WAS A BENIGN SURPRISE TO SOME EXTENT. SURE, WE SAW AIRFARES GO UP AND FURNITURE AND CERTAIN THINGS WERE HIGHER, BUT NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IMMEDIATELY. ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE TARIFF IMPACT IN FUTURE INFLATION REPORTS? ALAN: CERTAINLY, WE ARE ONLY ON THE EARLY STAGES OF THE TARIFF IMPACT RIGHT NOW. 2018, 2019, IT TOOK TWO TO THREE MONTHS BEFORE WE STARTED TO SEE A TARIFF IMPACT AND THEN IT LASTED FOR A YEAR. RIGHT NOW WE ARE ON THE EARLY STAGES WHERE THE BIGGEST TARIFF IMPACTS, OR BIGGEST TARIFFS STARTED TO BE PUT ON APRIL. WE ARE A FEW MONTHS AFTER THAT PERIOD RIGHT NOW SO THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO. VONNIE: THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR THE FED IF IT MOVES AND THEN HAS TO UNDO THAT MOVE OR DECIDES IT IS BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY TO DO THAT --UNDER THAT MOVE. IS THERE AN ARGUMENT FOR NOT CUTTING IN SEPTEMBER FOR THAT REASON IF IN PLEAS INFLATION WERE TO TAKE OFF AGAIN OR EXPECTATIONS WERE GETTING UNANCHORED, THAT THEY WOULD THEN NEED TO REVERSE? ALAN: WELL, THEY CAN ALWAYS REVERSE WASN'THAT IS NOT A BIG PROBLEM FOR THE FED TO BE DOING THAT. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO GET MORE DATA BETWEEN NOW AND THE FED MEETING. THEY WILL GET ANOTHER CPI. THEY WILL GET THE PCE FOCUS MORE ON PCE PRICES THAT CPI PRICES. I DON'T THINK IT IS LOCKED AND LOADED, AS WHAT WE HEARD BEFORE, FOR THE FED TO BE DOING CUTS. BUT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. WE EXPECT THEM TO CUT NOT ONLY IN THIS UP TO PERMITTING, BUT ANOTHER 100 BASIS NOT ONLY IN THE SEPTEMBER MEETING, BUT ANOTHER 100 BASIS POINTS AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO WEAKEN. VONNIE: 100 BASIS POINTS BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. 50-BASIS-POINT CUT AT ONE OF THE MEANINGS? ALAN: LAST PART OF THIS YEAR, DECEMBER MEETING. TO SEE THE PAYROLL DATA SHOWING NEGATIVE PAYROLL PRINT, AND FOR THEM TO GO 50 BASIS POINTS IN THE DECEMBER MEETING. VONNIE: THAT IS SOME CALL. THAT NEGATIVE PRINT YOU SEE IN DECEMBER CAN BE SECURELY THE ECONOMY WEAKENING, A DEFICIT OF WORKERS BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION POLICY, PRODUCTIVITY INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY? ALAN: NO, IT IS REALLY DUE TO THE ECONOMY WEAKENING MORE THAN ANYTHING. WE DON'T THINK IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF THE SLOWING IN THE EMPLOYMENT DATA. IT MAY BE A LITTLE BIT, BUT YOU ARE SEEING THINGS LIKE THE U6 MEASURE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT WORK BUT ARE NOT OFFICIALLY COUNTED IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT DATA EITHER, ALSO TRENDING UP. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD BE SEEING IF IT WAS MAINLY BEING DRIVEN BY IMMIGRATION. VONNIE: ALAN, IN THAT CASE WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO KNOW SOME OF THE JOBS FIGURES, AND WE JUST HAD A SUGGESTION FROM THE POTENTIAL INCOMING BLS CHIEF THAT THOSE MIGHT BE DONE AWAY WITH. DO YOU HAVE ANY IMPRESSIONS OF WHAT THAT MIGHT BE? ALAN: THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS MUCH, MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE. THAT SAID, THEY ARE GETTING OUTSIDE DATA THAT THEY USED TO COOPERATE. -- THE OFFICIAL DATA ON JOB GROWTH AND UNEMPLOYMENT, THEY GET THAT DATA FROM ADP AND THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING IS CUT FOR MANY YEARS CAN EVEN BEFORE HE LEFT THE FED IN 2017 -- BEFORE I LEFT THE FED IN 2017. IT WOULD MAKE THINGS DIFFICULT IF WE DID NOT HAVE THESE UP-TO-DATE OR RELATIVELY UP-TO-DATE OFFICIAL STATISTICS, BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO WORK AROUND IT. VONNIE: SO WE DID SEE THE TWO-YEAR YIELD DROPPED ABOUT FOUR BASIS POINTS AND THE 10-YEAR YIELD UNCHANGED. IF YOU SEE THE PICTURE FOR THE ECONOMY CHANGING RADICALLY BY THE END OF THE YEAR, WHERE DO YOU SEE YIELDS? ALAN: NOT SURE WHERE WE SEE YIELDS AT THIS POINT. WHEN WE ARE TALKING BY THE ECONOMY SLOWING, WE ARE NOT GOING INTO THE DEEP RECESSION THAT WE NORMALLY WOULD BE GOING INTO. WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT VERY MINOR JOB CUTS, UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ONLY RISING TO ABOUT 4.25, 5% NEXT YEAR. GDP GROWTH STILL STAYING SLIGHTLY POSITIVE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR. WHILE INFLATION IS RISING IN OUR FORECAST, WE HAVE BEEN SEEING 12-MONTH CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE MOVING OFF OF ITS POST-PANDEMIC LOWS WE SAW IN THE SPRING, WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS THE INFLATION RATE ONLY RISING AT 3.5% BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. PEAKING AT A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN 4% IN THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR. OVERALL, THAT WEAK GROWTH WE ARE SEEING, THE VERY MODEST RISE IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, AND WHILE INFLATION IS MOVING UP, IT IS NOWHERE NEAR WHERE WE WOULD BE SEEING IN THE 1970'S. VONNIE: ALAN, YOU WORKED AT THE FED BOARD OF GOVERNORS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW YOU SEE THIS NEW FED FORMING. WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF POTENTIAL PICKS FOR NEXT FED CHAIR. POLITICO REPORTING THEY ARE MULLING JEFFERSON FOR THE NEXT FED CHAIR, WHICH WIDENS THE BAND TO NINE PEOPLE NOW F WHO WOULD BE A GOOD CANDIDATE? ALAN: WE THINK A GOOD CANDIDATE WOULD BE SOMEBODY LIKE KEVIN WARSH OR KEVIN HASSETT. WE DON'T THINK THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO LIKELY MAKE A PICK UNTIL VERY LATE. THE UNCERTAINTY IS PROBABLY USEFUL FOR HIM AS PEOPLE ARE CAMPAIGNING TO GET THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING THAT JOB. VONNIE: ALSO THE IDEA THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A LOT OF DISSENTS, IS THAT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR CREDIBILITY GOING FORWARD? WE HAD A MEETING WHERE THERE WERE TWO TRADITIONALLY AND ONE PERSON DISSENTS, IF THAT. ALAN: I DON'T THINK A DISSENT IS A BIG PROBLEM. IT DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THE MOST LIKELY MOVE IS -- DOEST NOTE WHERE THE MOST LIKELY DISSENT IS. JUST MOST LIKELY MOVE IS -- DOES NOTE FOR THOSE MOST LIKELY MOVE IS. WE HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE DISSENTS IN THE PAST. I DON'T THINK IT IS REALLY A PROBLEM FOR FED CREDIBILITY TO HAVE DISSENT. THEY SEEM TO BE HAPPY TO HAVE A LOT OF THAT DISCUSSION THAT, SAY, UNDER THE GREENSPAN ERA WOULD HAVE BEEN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. THEY SEEM HAPPY WITH HAVING THAT DISCUSSION GOING ON A LITTLE BIT MORE IN PUBLIC THESE DAYS. VONNIE: ONE MORE QUESTION, ALAN IF I MAY, ABOUT THE BLS. WE SEE THE NEXT APPOINTED HEAD BECOME HEAD OF THE BLS, GET CONFIRMATION, WILL IT CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THE BLS IS RUN? ALAN: I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS. WE DO THINK WHO TRUMP HAS FLOATED RECENTLY, THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT HERITAGE, IF YOU WILL BE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED. -- HE WILL BE OFFICIALLY NUTS. WHOEVER TRUMP ANNOUNCED--HE WILL BE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED. WHOEVER TRUMP ANNOUNCES WILL LIKELY MAKE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS. WILL IT CHANGE HOW THE JOB NUMBERS I AND CPI NUMBERS ARE DONE? THERE IS VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING IN THE NEAR TERM. I HAVE WORKED WITH THE BLS EMPLOYEES ON THE CPI. I'VE TALKED TO THEM MANY TIMES YEAR FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS NOW SINCE I STARTED MY DISSERTATION ON CPI DATA. THERE VERY PROFESSIONAL, VERY MISSION-DRIVEN. MOST OF THEM WOULD TAKE A SIGNIFICANT UPFRONT IF THEY SAW ANY SORT OF MANIPULATION TO THE DATA. I'M NOT REALLY VERY WORRIED ABOUT THAT. FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR, MAY BE LONGER, OVER TIME YOU CAN HAVE SOME DEGRADATION IN THE CULTURE AND THE PROCEDURES. BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME, I WOULD EXPECT WE WOULD SEE PEOPLE SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THAT FROM INSIDE THE ORGANIZATION. VONNIE: ALAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AND GIVING US YOUR TIME. THAT IS THE GLOBAL ECONOMIST AT UBS INVESTMENT BANK. COMING UP, IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND POPULAR BROWSERS ON EARTH, SO CAN ANYONE REALLY BUY GOOGLE CHROME? PERPLEXITY AI IS MAKING A BID FOR IT. WE WILL DIG INTO THAT DEVELOPING STORY NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a VONNIE: THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" I'M VONNIE QUINN. GOOGLE SHARES HIGHER ON THE DAY AFTER AI START OF PERPLEXITY MADE A FORMAL OFFER TO ACQUIRE THE CHROME BROWSER. THE UNSOLICITED BID WAS SENT TO GOOGLE THIS MORNING. LET'S BRING IN CAROLINE HYDE ON HOW THE SHARES ARE MOVING -- MOVING TO THE SIDE. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHETHER THIS OFFER COULD BE ACCEPTED. THEY HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, RIGHT? CAROLYN: THEY HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, BUT WE KNOW THAT GOOGLE DOESN'T WANT TO SELL CHROME. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THEY ARE FORCED TO -- THE RULING FROM THE COURT, THEY HAVE BEEN DEEMED A MONOPOLY IN SEARCH AND THERE IS QUESTION AS TO HOW THEY RECTIFY THAT. MAYBE WE SHARE DATA AND PAY BIG BUCKS TO DOES THE DEFAULT AND SMARTPHONES AND THE LIKE BUT THEY ARE COULD BE THIS FIGURE TURMOIL WHERE, WHERE THEY'RE FORCED TO SELL OPENAI AND PERPLEXITY HAVE LAUNCHED THEIR OWN WEB BROWSERS. BUT IT WOULD BE SO USEFUL TO GET GOOGLE'S INTEGRATED WITH ALL OF THE CALENDAR AND DATA THEY HAVE AND BE A RICH TROVE, BUT MORE BROADLY, THIS IS MORE MONEY, 34 POINT $5 BILLION, THAT PERPLEXITY IS WORTH THEY HAVE BIG INVESTORS, JEFF BEZOS IS ONE OF THEM. VONNIE: IT IS GO BIG OR GO HOME FOR PERPLEXITY. THEY HAVE SAID NO WAY ARE BEING ACQUIRED THEMSELVES, STAYING INDEPENDENT. CAROLINE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT IS \"BLOOMBERG TECH\" GOES CAROLINE HYDE. ANOTHER COMPANY WE ARE WATCHING HIS BKV, WITH STRONG SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS. LET'S WELCOMING THE CEO OF BKV. I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT NATURAL GAS PRICES. THEY WERE IN THE TANK, THEY GOT OUT OF THE TANK, WE ARE WELL BELOW THREE DOLLARS AGAIN. WHERE THEY GO FROM HERE? WHY ARE COMPANIES PUTTING ON MORE RIGS IF THE PRICES SO LOW? > > FIRST OF ALL, THANKS. WHEN IT COMES TO NATURAL GAS, IT IS VERY SEASONAL. SUMMER IS ENDING. I THINK THERE IS SOME VIEWS OF SUPPLY COMING ON AND THE DEMAND HASN'T QUITE HIT YET. ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR IS THE LNG DEMAND THAT RAMPS UP IN THE FALL AND ESPECIALLY INTO 2026. OTHER LNG PRODUCTS COMING ONLINE EXTRA WILL BE SUCKING UP A LOT OF GAS, AND THAT COMBINED WITH CONTINUED NORMAL WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO DRIVE PRICES UP. THAT IS WHY YOU SEE THIS TRIP FOR 2026 STILL VERY ROBUST. VONNIE: WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR IN TERMS OF RIG COUNT? > > WE ARE RUNNING ONE RIG IN THE BARNETT RIGHT NOW AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE THAT. FOR US IT IS ABOUT GENTLY GROWING THE PRODUCTION LINE WITH THE CURVE. WE WILL CONTINUE THOSE PLANS ALONG WITH THE 2000 CANDIDATES WE HAVE IN THE BARNETT, WHICH IS TREMENDOUS. VONNIE: LOW CARBON HAS BEEN SUFFERING UNDER THE PRESIDENT CURRENTLY. I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE IN TERMS OF HYDROGEN AND WIND IN PARTICULAR AND WHETHER THAT COULD BE A PROFITABLE, PRODUCTIVE BUSINESS FOR YOU. CHRISTOPHER: VONNIE, WE ARE REALLY BIG INTO CARBON CAPTURE, AND ONE OF THE WINNERS OF THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT WAS THE CARBON CAPTURE BUSINESS-- THOSE 45 CUE TAX CREDIT CARBON CAPTURE BUSINESS. BKV BELIEVES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS TO DECARBONIZE THE PLANET IS THE CARBON CAPTURE. WE HAVE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS ONLINE EXTRA AND WE HAVE BEEN INJECTING CO2 THE NEXT -- OVER A YEAR NOW. WITH REGARDS TO WIND AND HYDROGEN, WE WILL LET OTHERS MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS, THAT IS NOT OUR CORE. A LOT OF THESE DATA CENTERS ARE GOING TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THAT SOURCE OF ENERGY. VONNIE: ANY OTHER POSITIVES OUT OF THE ONE BEAUTIFUL BUILT, AS THE PRESIDENT USED TO CALL IT? CHRISTOPHER: THERE IS OTHER THINGS WE THINK ARE PERSPECTIVE FOR US. INTRINSIC THE ACCOUNTING FOR CAPITAL, WHEN YOU SPEND LOTS OF CAPITAL, INVESTING FOR THAT, YOU CAN USE THAT TO OFFSET YOUR INCOME EARLY ON. WE THINK THAT IS VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. WE THINK THE PLANS TO STREAMLINE THE REGULATION AROUND PERMITTING AND OTHER THINGS DOWN THE PIKE ARE ALSO VERY ATTRACTIVE. OF COURSE JUST THE CARBON CAPTURE BUSINESS AND THE ABILITY TO GROW NUCLEAR ALONGSIDE OF THAT. WE THINK THOSE THINGS ARE SYNERGISTIC WITH BOTH DECARBONIZAITON AS OFFENDED BUT ALSO FOR BUSINESSES WE ARE FOCUSED ON. VONNIE: HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT WE WILL SEE MORE PIPELINES THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS? YOU ARE BULLISH DURING TRUMP 1.0. ARE YOU STILL HAS POSITIVE SEVERAL YEARS LATER? CHRISTOPHER: THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, VONNIE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATIENT AT WHICH CASH PACE . WHICH WE EXPECT PIPELINES TO GET BUILT, IT WON'T BE THE SAME AS 20 YEARS AGO, BUT WE WILL SEE PREVALENCE GET BUILT. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE CLEAR THEY WANT TO GET RID OF RED TAPE AND WE WILL SEE KEEP HEADLINES GET ACCELERATED. AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE GULF COAST IN PARTICULAR, YOU HAVE TO MOVE 20 BCF OF GAS INTO THE LNG, YOU NEED PIPE TO BE BUILT. I EXPECT MANY OF THOSE PROJECTS TO GO FORWARD. AS A LOOK AT AIR IS HARDER TO BUILD, THAT IS MORE CHALLENGING. IT WILL DEPEND ON WHERE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. VONNIE: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING. BKV OF ALMOST 5% AND ALMOST 17% SINCE THE IPO LAST YEAR. COMING UP, UP FROM WALL STREET TO WASHINGTON, TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL FIGURES IN THE ADMINISTRATION. WE WILL DISCUSS THE LATEST BIG TAKE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. VONNIE: THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" I'M VONNIE QUINN. TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT IS LEADING THE SEARCH FOR CANDIDATES FOR CHAIR OF THE CENTRAL BANK. EVER SINCE APPOINTED, BESSENT HAS BECOME ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S MOST INFLUENTIAL POWERBROKERS. WE EXAMINE HOW THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT HAS BECOME A DEPARTMENT OF EVERYTHING. IT IS THE COVER OF THE MOST RECENT \"BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK.\" JOINING US IS ONE OF THE AUTHORS, ERIK SCHATZKER. THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS FASCINATING IN THIS THE WHOLE BACK STORY GOING WAY BEFORE TRUMP 1.0, ACTIVE FAMILY TIES BETWEEN BESSENT AND THE TRUMPS. DOES HE REALLY SHOW THE PRESIDENT'S VIEW ON THINGS LIKE REASSURING, MANUFACTURING, IMMIGRATION? ERIK: THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER, VONNIE, IS WE WILL NEVER REALLY KNOW. AS THIS TREASURY SECRETARY MAKES IT SO CLEAR, YOU NEED TO SERVE THE PRESIDENT. HE IS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. THIS PRESIDENT IN PARTICULAR CONSIDERS HIMSELF TO DECIDER IN CHIEF. THAT MEANS IN BECOMING THE TREASURY SECRETARY, OR ANY OTHER CABINET SECRETARY, YOU NEED TO GET ON BOARD WITH THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AND YOU NEED TO REPRESENT HIM WELL IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ANY INFLUENCE AND WIELD POWER IN GOVERNMENT. WE DO KNOW THAT BEFORE SCOTT BESSENT FOUND HIS WAY INTO GOVERNMENT AS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE FOR TREASURY SECRETARY, HE WASN'T A MAXIMALIST ON TARIFFS. WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM LAST YEAR, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A 10% GLOBAL TARIFF, WHICH IS NOT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. WE ARE NORTH OF THAT. THE GLOBAL TARIFF IS ABOUT 14%, BUT CLEARLY FOR MANY OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE SWITZERLAND, CANADA, IT IS WAY HIGHER. HE WASN'T A MAXIMALIST ON TARIFFS. YET A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW OF FISCAL DISCIPLINE-- HE HAD A VERY DIFFERENT VIEW OF FISCAL DISCIPLINE. HE WAS PLEDGING TO BRING THE DEBT-GDP RATIO DOWN TO 3% OF GDP. HE WASN'T PROMISING TO DO THAT UNTIL THE END OF THE TRUMP TERM, BUT THEY HAVE NOT STARTED OUT ALL THAT WELL WITH THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BUILT, WHICH ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET SCORES ADD $3.4 TRILLION OF ADDITIONAL DEFICITS OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. NECESSARILY, THE TREASURY SECRETARY HAS HAD TO CHANGE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT HE USES TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS. VONNIE: HE DEFINITELY HAS CRITICS ON WALL STREET, BUT I'M SURE HE WOULD COUNTED THERE IS TIME LEFT. THERE WERE SIGNS OF HUBRIS DURING THE INTERVIEW WHEN HE SAID HE COULD HAVE MADE MARKETS GO UP ON LIBERATION DAY. THAT PART OF THE STORY WAS SO INTERESTING. ERIK: WELL, THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TREASURY SECRETARY AND HIS MARKET SENSIBILITY AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AND HIS MARKET SENSIBILITY. TRUMP CLEARLY WANTS TO DRIVE THINGS AS PHARMACY POSSIBLY CAN. SCOTT BESSENT, WHO SPENT FOUR YEARS IN MARKETS, THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD BE MITIGATING CURRENTLY. ULTIMATELY THE CHOICE IS TRUMP'S. VONNIE: I'M QUOTING FROM THE STORY, \"HE HAS A HIGH RISK TOLERANCE THAT I DO.\" PERHAPS THAT IS GOOD FOR BOTH OF THEM. CATCH THE FULL ARTICLE IN \"BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK.\" IS A MUST-READ. I'M VONNIE QUINN. THAT DOES IT FOR \"BLOOMBERG MARKETS.\" \"BALANCE OF POWER\" IS NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.",

Major Internet shares are up 2.6% and retail space is up 7.6%, with a 90% year-over-Year increase in retail sales. Meanwhile, shares of AI software company Big BEAR AI dropped more than 20% after a disappointing 20% drop from its more than expected 20% outlook due to ongoing disputes with the Fed regarding inflation and related costs.
