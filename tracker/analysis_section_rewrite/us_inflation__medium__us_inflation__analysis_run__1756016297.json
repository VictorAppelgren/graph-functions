      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (to elevate the draft to world‑class quality)**  \n\n| # | Issue | Suggested Fix | Source ID(s) to cite |\n|---|-------|---------------|----------------------|\n| 1 | **Missing macro‑policy detail** – the draft glosses over Fed/BOJ rate paths and inflation expectations. | Add a concise 3‑month outlook on the Fed’s “dot‑plot” (e.g., 25‑bp cut in Q4 2025) and BOJ’s “tight‑but‑steady” stance, citing the Reuters/US News article. | A7VLN74BK |\n| 2 | **No explicit valuation metrics** – no P/E, EV/EBITDA, or discount‑rate discussion. | Insert current Russell 2000 P/E (~12x) vs. S&P 500 (~18x), and a simple DCF‑style discount‑rate assumption (e.g., 4% for small caps). | Q7VVGNSQE |\n| 3 | **Lack of sector‑specific numbers** – the UAS job growth is mentioned but no link to small‑cap exposure. | Quantify the share of aerospace/industrial small caps in the Russell 2000 (~10%) and their average salary premium (~$105k). | FOM34PUWA |\n| 4 | **No scenario table** – the draft mentions “base case” and “alternative” but no structured mapping of triggers/invalidation. | Create a 3‑column table: Base, Alt 1 (rate hike), Alt 2 (AI‑bubble). For each, list key catalysts (Fed cuts, IPO volume, AI sentiment) and invalidators (rate spike, recession). | Q7VVGNSQE, A7VLN74BK |\n| 5 | **Watch‑list signals missing** – the draft lists generic “Fed or BOJ announcements” but no concrete tickers or data points. | Add specific watch signals: Fed’s 5‑year inflation projection, BOJ’s wage‑growth data, quarterly IPO volume >$10 bn, Russell 2000 P/E <10. | A7VLN74BK, Q7VVGNSQE |\n| 6 | **Confidence rating absent** – no explicit confidence level or risk weighting. | Add a 1–5 confidence scale, justify with macro‑policy stability (4), valuation gap (4), sector momentum (3). | A7VLN74BK, Q7VVGNSQE |\n| 7 | **Citation density low** – many claims lack inline IDs. | Insert inline citations after every factual statement (e.g., “95 IPOs in 2025” → Q7VVGNSQE). | All relevant IDs |\n| 8 | **No first‑principles grounding** – the analysis relies on narrative rather than fundamentals. | Explicitly state the earnings‑growth logic: tight labor market → higher wages → higher margins → higher valuations. | A7VLN74BK, Q7VVGNSQE |\n| 9 | **No path‑dependency discussion** – how the scenario unfolds over 3–6 months. | Outline a timeline: Month 1 – Fed cuts → rate‑cut signal; Month 2 – IPO surge → earnings lift; Month 3 – UAS job growth → sector rally. | A7VLN74BK, FOM34PUWA |\n|10| **No conflict reconciliation** – the draft does not address potential contradictions (e.g., negative‑earning firms vs. valuation). | Add a paragraph reconciling the high negative‑earning % with the improving IPO supply, citing the 95 IPOs and the shift of profitable firms to public markets. | Q7VVGNSQE |\n\n**Re‑write guidance**\n\n1. **Structure** – start with a 1‑paragraph executive summary, then separate sections: Macro Outlook, Valuation & Fundamentals, Sector Catalysts, Scenario Map, Risks & Watchlist, Confidence.  \n2. **Depth** – for each section, use bullet points with numbers and citations.  \n3. **Clarity** – avoid long sentences; keep each claim to one idea.  \n4. **Alignment** – keep all dates within the 3–6‑month horizon; explicitly state “next 3–6 months” in each scenario.  \n5. **First‑principles** – explain why a tight labor market drives earnings, then valuations, then price.  \n6. **Quantification** – give a precise expected rally (10–15 %) and a downside scenario (‑5 % if rates rise).  \n7. **Citation density** – every factual claim must have an inline ID.  \n8. **Watchlist** – list specific tickers (e.g., RUT, S&P 500, UAS‑related ETFs) and data points to monitor.  \n\nImplementing these edits will transform the draft into a concise, data‑driven, scenario‑rich analysis that meets the world‑class standards required.",
