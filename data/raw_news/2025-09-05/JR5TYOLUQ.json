  "content": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 Asian shares rose on Friday after U.S. stocks climbed to a record as Wall Street made its final moves ahead of an update on the American job market that could clear the way for cuts to interest rates that investors love.\n\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 added 0.9% to 42,945.16 after data released Friday showed Japan\u2019s labor cash earnings rose 4.1% year-on-year in July, up from 3.1% in June. Another report showed household spending climbed 1.4% in July from the same month a year ago, marking growth for the third month in a row.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also signed an executive order Thursday implementing the U.S. trade deal with Japan in July, with lower tariffs on Japanese car imports.\n\nIn Chinese markets, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index moved up 0.5% to 25,194.85, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.4% to 3,778.95.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi edged up less than 0.1% to 3,203.13, and Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to 8,855.20.\n\nIndia\u2019s BSE Sensex was 0.2% higher, while Taiwan\u2019s Taiex jumped more than 1%.\n\nU.S. futures were higher while oil prices edged down.\n\nOn Wall Street on Thursday, the S&P 500 added 0.8% to top the all-time high it set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 350 points, or 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1%.\n\nStocks got some lift from easing pressure from the bond market, where Treasury yields fell following the latest reports on the U.S. job market to come in worse than economists expected. One report suggested employers, not including the government, nearly halved their hiring in August from the prior month. Another said that more workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in an indication of rising layoffs.\n\nNeither number is flashing a recession, and a third report on activity for businesses in the information and other services industries showed stronger-than-expected growth.\n\nThe upside for investors of a slowdown in the job market is that it could push the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate for the first time this year at its next meeting in a couple weeks. Such cuts can kickstart the economy and job market, though they can also accelerate inflation.\n\nSo far this year, the Fed has kept its main interest rate on hold because it\u2019s been more worried about inflation potentially worsening because of Trump\u2019s tariffs than about the job market.\n\nA more comprehensive report on the job market\u2019s health during August will arrive Friday from the U.S. Labor Department and it will likely carry much weight with the Fed. Ahead of it, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.16% from 4.22% late Wednesday.\n\nIn other dealings Friday, benchmark U.S. crude lost 13 cents to $63.35 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, slid 11 cents to $66.88 per barrel.\n\nThe U.S. dollar slipped to 148.13 Japanese yen from 148.05.

      "text": "Powell signals Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain\nPowell signals Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain\nJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door ever so slightly to lowering a key interest rate in the coming months but gave no hint on the timing of a move and suggested the central bank will proceed cautiously as it continues to evaluate the impact of tariffs and other policies on the economy.\nIn a high-profile speech closely watched at the White House and on Wall Street, Powell said that there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation. Yet he suggested that with hiring sluggish, the job market could weaken further.\n\u201cThe shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\u201d he said, a reference to his concerns about weaker job gains and a more direct sign that the Fed is considering a rate cut than he has made in previous comments.\nStill, Powell\u2019s remarks suggest the Fed will proceed carefully in the coming months and will make its rate decisions based on how inflation and unemployment evolve. The Fed has three more meetings this year, including next month, in late October, and in December, and it\u2019s not clear whether the Fed will cut at all those meetings.\nAP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on prospects of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\u201cThe stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,\u201d Powell said. That suggests the Fed will continue to evaluate jobs and inflation data as it decides whether to cut rates.\nThe stock market jumped in response to Powell\u2019s remarks, with the broad S&P 500 index rising 1.5% in midday trading.\n\u201cWe see Powell\u2019s remarks as consistent with our expectation of\u201d a quarter-point cut to the Fed\u2019s short-term rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. The Fed\u2019s rate currently stands at 4.3%.\nPowell spoke with the Fed under unprecedented public scrutiny from the White House, as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted Powell and has urged him to cut rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.\nTrump also says a cut would boost the moribund housing market. A rate cut by the Fed often leads to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing, but it doesn\u2019t always.\nWhile Powell spoke, Trump elevated his attacks, telling reporters in Washington, D.C. that he would fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down over allegations from an administration official that she committed mortgage fraud.\nIf Cook is removed, that would give Trump an opportunity to put a loyalist on the Fed\u2019s governing board. The Fed has long been considered independent from day-to-day politics. The president can\u2019t fire a Fed governor over disagreements on interest rate policy, but he can do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is generally seen as malfeasance or neglect of duty.\nLater Friday, Trump told reporters, referring to Powell, \u201cWe call him too late for a reason. He should have cut them a year ago. He\u2019s too late.\u201d\nPowell spoke at the Fed\u2019s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a conference with about 100 academics, economists, and central bank officials from around the world. He was given a standing ovation before he spoke.\nCook, who is also attending the conference, declined to comment on the president\u2019s remarks.\nIn his remarks, the Fed chair underscored that tariffs are lifting inflation and could push it higher in the coming months.\n\u201cThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts,\u201d Powell said.\nInflation has crept higher in recent months though it is down from a peak of 9.1% three years ago. Tariffs have not spurred inflation as much as some economists worried, but they are starting to lift the prices of heavily imported goods such as furniture, toys, and shoes.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year ago, above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%.\nPowell added that higher prices from tariffs could cause a one-time shift to prices, rather than an ongoing bout of inflation. Other Fed officials have said that is the most likely outcome and as a result the central bank can cut rates to boost the job market.\nThe Fed chair said it is largely up to the central bank to ensure that tariffs don\u2019t lead to sustained inflation.\n\u201cCome what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem,\u201d he said, suggesting deep rate cuts, as Trump has demanded, are unlikely.\nRegarding the job market, Powell noted that even as hiring has slowed sharply this year, the unemployment rate remains low. He added that with immigration falling sharply, fewer jobs are needed to keep unemployment in check.\nYet with hiring sluggish, the risks of a sharper downturn, with rising layoffs, has risen, Powell said.\nPowell also suggested the Fed would continue to set its interest-rate policy free from political pressure.\nFed officials \u201cwill make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.\u201d\nPowell dedicated the second half of his speech to announcing changes to the Fed\u2019s policy framework that was issued in August 2020. The framework, which has been blamed for delaying the Fed\u2019s response to the pandemic inflation spike, provides guidelines on how the Fed would respond to changes in inflation and employment.\nIn 2020, after a decade of low inflation and low interest rates following the financial crisis and Great Recession in 2008-2009, the Fed changed its framework to allow inflation to top its 2% target temporarily, so that inflation would average 2% over time.\nAnd after unemployment fell to a half-century low in 2018, without pushing up inflation, the 2020 framework said that the Fed would focus only on \u201cshortfalls\u201d in employment, rather than \u201cdeviations.\u201d That meant it would cut rates if unemployment rose, but wouldn\u2019t necessarily raise them if it fell.\nThe Fed reviewed its framework this year and concluded that it was tied too closely to the pre-pandemic economy, which has since shifted. Inflation spiked to a four-decade high in 2022 and the Fed rapidly boosted interest rates afterward.\n\u201cA key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions,\u201d Powell said."

      "text": "Wall Street steadies itself as Alphabet rallies and pressure eases from the bond market\nWall Street steadies itself as Alphabet rallies and pressure eases from the bond market\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street steadied on Wednesday after Alphabet and other technology stocks rallied. It also got some relief from easing pressure from the bond market, where the latest discouraging report on the U.S. job market bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon to support the economy.\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.5% to break the two-day losing slide it had been on since setting its latest all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 24 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1%.\nGoogle\u2019s parent company was one of the strongest forces lifting the market and jumped 9.1% after avoiding some of the worst-case scenarios in its antitrust case. A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine but did not force a sale of its Chrome browser.\nBecause Alphabet is one of Wall Street\u2019s most valuable companies, its stock movements carry much more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than the typical company\u2019s.\nAlso helping to steady Wall Street was a calming bond market. A day earlier, yields climbed worldwide on worries about governments\u2019 abilities to repay their growing mountains of debt, as well as concerns that President Donald Trump\u2019s pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates could lead to higher inflation in the long term.\nSuch worries have pushed investors to demand higher yields before lending money to governments. And when bonds are paying more in interest, investors feel less need to pay high prices for stocks, which are riskier investments.\nOn Wednesday, Treasury yields retreated following the latest report on the U.S. job market to come in weaker than expected. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.22% from 4.28% late Tuesday, for example.\nThe report showed that U.S. employers were advertising 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, fewer than economists had forecast. The number bolsters the sense on Wall Street that the job market may be ossifying into a low-hire, low-fire state.\nA weakened job market could push the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate for the first time this year at its next meeting, which is scheduled for later this month. That\u2019s the widespread expectation among traders, with the next big data point coming on Friday via an update on U.S. hiring during August.\nLower interest rates could give the job market and overall economy a boost. The downside is that they can also push inflation higher when Trump\u2019s tariffs may be set to raise prices for all kinds of imports.\nTrading on Wall Street was mixed outside of tech stocks, which benefited from the Alphabet ruling. Apple rose 3.8% after analysts highlighted how the ruling will still allow it to sign lucrative search deals with Google.\n\u201cThis is a relief, an outcome that is much better than feared for Google and for Apple,\u201d according to Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer of value at Gabelli Funds.\nMacy\u2019s jumped 20.7% for one of the market\u2019s bigger gains after the retailer reported stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The owner of Bloomingdale\u2019s delivered the best growth in an important measure of sales in three years, and it also raised its forecasts for sales and profit this fiscal year.\nAmerican Bitcoin, a bitcoin treasury and mining company linked to the Trump family, rose 16.5% in a manic first day of trading after completing its merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. Its stock price more than doubled at one point, and its movements were so frenetic that trading was halted several times through the day.\nCampbell\u2019s rose 7.2% after the company behind the Goldfish and V8 brands reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also said, though, that customers are continuing to be \u201cincreasingly deliberate\u201d and that tariffs may help drag its overall earnings lower in its upcoming fiscal year.\nOn the losing end of Wall Street was Dollar Tree, even though the retailer likewise reported a better profit than analysts expected. A chunk of that performance came because of the timing of tariffs, which could drag down its results in the current quarter.\nAnalysts also said expectations were high for the value retailer coming into its report. Its stock fell 8.4%, slicing into its gain for the year that came into the day at a stellar 48.6%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 32.72 points to 6,448.26. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 24.58 to 45,271.23, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 218.10 to 21,497.73.\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes climbed following a weaker finish across much of Asia.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.9% amid uncertainty about the political future of Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.\n___\nAP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed."

That\u2019s more than the 231,000 new applications economists were expecting.\nWeekly applications for jobless benefits are seen as a proxy for layoffs and have mostly settled in a historically healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since the U.S. began to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic nearly four years ago.\nWhile layoffs are low, hiring has also weakened as part of what many economists describe as a \u201cno hire, no fire\u201d economy. Still, the unemployment rate remains a historically low 4.2%.\nOn Wednesday, the government reported that U.S. employers were advertising 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, fewer than economists had forecast and the latest sign of weakness in the U.S. labor market.\nLast month\u2019s grim July jobs report, which showed job gains of just 73,000 and included massive downward revisions for June and May, sent financial markets spiraling.\nPresident Donald Trump fired the head of the agency that compiles the monthly data.\nThe government issues its August jobs report on Friday, with economists expecting that U.S. employers added a slim 80,000 private non-farm jobs.\nNew jobs numbers are being closely watched on Wall Street and by the Federal Reserve as the most recent government data suggests hiring has slowed sharply since this spring. Job gains have averaged just 35,000 a month in the three months ending in July, barely one-quarter what they were a year ago.\nGrowth has weakened so far this year as many companies have pulled back on expansion projects amid the uncertainty surrounding the impacts of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies. Growth slowed to a 1.3% annual rate in the first half of the year, down from 2.5% in 2024.\nThe sluggishness in the job market is a key reason that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the central bank may cut its key interest rate at its next meeting Sept. 16-17. A cut could reduce other borrowing costs in the economy, including mortgages, auto loans, and business loans.\nThe Labor Department\u2019s report Thursday showed that the four-week average of claims, which softens some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 2,500 to 231,000.\nThe total number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits for the previous week of Aug. 23 fell by 4,000 to 1.94 million."

      "text": "Stocks add a bit to their records on Wall Street\nWall Street notched more milestones Thursday after gains in technology stocks helped push the market to another all-time high.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.3%, lifting the benchmark index to its second record high in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed an early slide and gained 0.2%, enough to move past its record high set last Friday.\nThe Nasdaq composite closed 0.5% higher, finishing just short of its all-time high set two weeks ago.\nAbout 55% of the companies in the benchmark S&P 500 closed lower, but gains in the technology and communication services sectors offset losses elsewhere in the market. Broadcom rose 2.8%, Amazon added 1.1% and Google parent Alphabet finished 2% higher.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a continuation of a theme that has been in place really all year long, and that is communication services, information technology, really the areas that are surrounding this incredible capital expenditure cycle, have been the primary beneficiaries,\u201d said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Asset Management.\nHeading into the final day of trading in August, the S&P 500 and Dow were on pace for their fourth straight monthly gain, while the Nasdaq was closing in on its fifth.\nThe market\u2019s latest gains came as traders pored over a mixed batch of earnings reports from big U.S. companies and new reports on the job market and U.S. economy.\nTech giant Nvidia fell 0.8% a day after reporting quarterly earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 forecasts, though the company noted that sales of its artificial intelligence chipsets rose at a slower pace than analysts anticipated.\nStocks were slightly down in early trading. The AP\u2019s Seth Sutel reports.\nInvestors consider Nvidia a barometer for the strength of the boom in artificial intelligence because the company makes most of the chips that power the technology. Its heavy weighting also gives Nvidia outsized influence as a bellwether for the broader market.\nShares in several retailers fell following their latest quarterly results.\nBest Buy dropped 3.7% after the consumer electronics chain\u2019s second-quarter snapshot was overshadowed by an outlook clouded due to the tariffs the U.S. is imposing on trading partners.\nDespite also posting better-than-expected quarterly results, Urban Outfitters slid 10.7% after the retailer warned that it expects tariffs will increase pressure on its gross margins in the second half of the year.\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods fell 4.8% despite reporting second-quarter results that beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\nVictoria\u2019s Secret & Co. gave up an early gain and closed 0.5% lower.\nBurlington Stores bucked the trend. The retail chain climbed 5.3% after its latest earnings topped analysts\u2019 estimates.\nElsewhere in the market, Spam maker Hormel sank 13.1% for the biggest decline among S&P 500 companies after its earnings fell short of Wall Street\u2019s forecasts and the company cut its outlook for the year.\nTraders also had their eye on new government reports on the job market and economy.\nThe Labor Department reported that applications for unemployment benefits fell last week, the latest sign that employers are holding onto their workers even as the economy has slowed.\nThe most recent government data suggests hiring has slowed sharply since this spring.\nMeanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product \u2014- the nation\u2019s output of goods and services \u2014 grew at a 3.3% annual pace in the April-June quarter after shrinking 0.5% in the first three months of this year due to the fallout from the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars.\n\u201cThe GDP print reinforces the fact that this continues to be an economy, domestically, that is continuing to show a great deal of resilience in terms of producing economic growth,\u201d Northey said.\nStill, the sluggishness in the job market is a key reason that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the central bank may cut its key interest rate at its meeting next month.\nLower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow, but they risk worsening inflation.\nTraders are still betting the Fed will trim its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting in September. Traders see an 85.3% chance that the central bank will cut the rate by a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group.\nFriday will bring another update on inflation: the U.S. personal consumption expenditures index. Economists expect it to show that inflation remained at about 2.6% in July, compared with a year ago. Businesses have been warning investors and consumers about higher costs and prices because of tariffs.\nTreasury yields were mixed in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.21% from 4.24% late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Federal Reserve action, rose to 3.63% from 3.62%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 20.46 points to 6,501.86. The Dow added 71.67 points to 45,636.90, and the Nasdaq gained 115.02 points to close at 21,705.16.\nEuropean and Asian markets closed mixed."

Nikkei gained 0.9% on stronger labor earnings and household spending, while Hong Kong and Shanghai indices edged up. U.S. futures and oil prices were mixed, with Treasury yields falling to 4.16% on job market concerns. The rally reflects optimism that a softer labor market may prompt the Fed to cut rates in September, potentially supporting global equity markets.",
