  "title": "People Are Livid That Pete Hegseth Reposted A Video Saying Women Shouldn't Have The Right To Vote",
  "description": "\"If politicians don\u2019t want me to vote, then they can give me back most of the tens of thousands of dollars of taxes I've paid over the decades.\"",
  "content": "The segment is filled with proud Christian nationalists who believe women should submit to their husbands and blah blah blah. Doug also called for the return of sodomy laws and had some terrible things to say about \"decent human beings\" who owned slaves. Obviously, not the kind of people you'd invite over for dinner.\n\nDid the Secretary of Defense repost the video to call it out or shame these church leaders? Of course not! He simply added the caption: \"All of Christ for All of Life.\" You'll remember Pete, of course, as the incompetent fool who allegedly sent war plans to a journalist . THAT GUY is promoting content saying women shouldn't have the right to vote.\n\nNaturally, the internet has a lot to say about all this: Comments were included from Reddit threads here, here, here, and here.\n\n Editor's Note: While we can't endorse what X has become, we can bring you the worthwhile moments that still exist there, curated and free of the surrounding chaos.\n\n\"If politicians don\u2019t want me to vote, then they can give me back most of the tens of thousands of dollars of taxes I've paid over the decades. If I'm paying their salaries, then I absolutely get to vote in their elections. And I don\u2019t give a fuck what any religious figure says.\"\n\n\"This should be a much bigger deal than it's going to be. Trump will change tariffs or tweet something out in a few hours, and we'll move on. But the guy who leads our entire military just shared a post that says women exist to give birth, maintain the home, and they shouldn't have a right to vote. This should be a career ending deal. In the Trump admin, it's just Friday afternoon.\"\n\n\"Just to be clear, this is the U.S. Secretary of Defense\u2014who multiple women voted to confirm\u2014sharing content advocating for women to not vote. I wouldn\u2019t have believed it if I hadn\u2019t seen it with my own eyes. This is why we must organize and stay in the fight!\"",

      "text": "Trump cuts threaten access to birth control for millions of women\nHow the Trump administration is rolling back access to birth control in the U.S.\nContraception is a routine part of life for many Americans and polls show people across political parties agree that it should be legal and accessible.\nBut the Trump administration is walking back access to birth control for some people \u2014 including withholding funding from a Nixon-era program that guarantees access to contraception for low income people.\nTitle X under threat\nIt's only been a few generations since birth control was widely accessible in the U.S. Married women were not legally allowed to use contraception in some states, until the 1965 Supreme Court decision Griswald v. Connecticut. Shortly after that, in 1970 \u2013 facing poor health outcomes for mothers and babies \u2013 Congress created Title X.\nEnacted under the Nixon administration, the program guaranteed free contraception for people who needed it. In a special message to Congress in July 1969, Nixon wrote: \"It is my view that no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance, because of her economic condition.\"\nThe program has existed ever since. The 2025 budget provided $285.6 million in Title X funds.\nNow, a group of 15 public health organizations is suing the Trump administration, arguing that the federal government jeopardized access to services including birth control for more than 800,000 people due to illegal withholding of Title X dollars.\nOne of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is Bridgercare in Montana, which distributes funding to 20 reproductive health clinics across the state. Stephanie McDowell, Bridgercare's executive director, recalls receiving a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services on March 31st, notifying her that her organization's funding would be suspended the next day. The letter said Bridgercare had violated the Civil Rights Act and Executive Orders issued by President Trump. Other plaintiffs received similar letters.\n\" They were citing statements of anti-racism \u2014 statements that might be what we would commonly understand as DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) efforts,\" says McDowell.\nA message on the organization's website underscores that they welcome patients of different identities, including \"teens, LGBTQ+ individuals, and survivors of sexual assault.\"\nMcDowell says she believes these kinds of statements are what HHS is referring to.\n\" We meet people where they are, and that oftentimes means letting people know that we're a safe, welcoming space for them, regardless of their income, regardless of their identity,\" says McDowell.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\nMcDowell says her organization has been limping by since their funding was revoked, largely relying on donations. Though services haven't been interrupted for patients, the organization is not in a sustainable position without federal funds, she says.\nOther organizations have not been able to shield their patients from the impact of reduced funding.\nIn Utah, Planned Parenthood representatives said they've had to close two clinics as a result of Title X funds being withheld, as well as implement a fee for some contraception services that were previously free.\n\"People are living paycheck to paycheck in our communities,\" says Shireen Ghorbani, who is the interim director of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. \"We are not able to count on the federal government to keep the promise it made to access low cost care and to plan and space their families.\"\nThe National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which is representing the organizations that brought the Title X lawsuit against the government, note that some grant recipients have received notice that their Title X funding will be restored.\nPermission to limit contraception\nIt's not only Title X funds that are jeopardizing access to contraception, says Kimi Chernoby, an attorney with the National Women's Law Center. She points to cuts to Medicaid included in the Republican spending bill that was recently signed into law, which jeopardize access to healthcare \u2014 including contraception \u2014 for millions of women in coming years.\nA number of state efforts have also sought to limit birth control. In Indiana, Republican lawmakers removed IUDs and condoms from a program that aimed to increase access to birth control, replacing them with \"fertility awareness based methods.\" After a Right to Contraception bill passed with bipartisan support in Virginia, Republican Governor Youngkin vetoed it.\nChernoby says the Trump administration has created a permission structure for these kinds of efforts. She points to Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's \"blueprint\" for the new Republican administration. President Trump has adopted many of its policies.\nProject 2025 suggests changing requirements that employer-provided insurance and the Affordable Care Act cover contraception.\nThe Trump administration also included a provision in the most recent budget law that would withhold Medicaid funds from Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. The change could potentially cripple the organization and prevent it from providing healthcare services including contraception.\nThat provision is currently blocked in court, though Planned Parenthood officials say they are preparing for an appeal and underscore that 200 clinics across 24 states are at risk of closure.\n\"They are intent on expanding the population\"\nNeither the Trump administration nor the Heritage Foundation responded to a request for comment on this story or explained why they seek to reduce access to contraception.\nPlanned Parenthood's Ghorbani has a theory.\n\"It is very clear that they are intent on expanding the population,\" says Ghorbani. She points out that the Trump administration has called on Americans to have more babies, and says limits to reproductive care are a means of achieving that goal. \"That can be everything from contraception to access to abortion care,\" she says.\nGhorbani says even though these cuts have hit low-income patients the hardest, attacks on public health impact the whole ecosystem of healthcare.\n\"All of this is building a structure that makes it harder and harder for individuals to control their sexual and reproductive lives, to plan their families and have kids when they want to.\"\nKimi Chernoby, with the National Women's Law Center, draws parallels between the administration's effort to limit contraception with successful efforts to limit abortion.\n\" We are seeing the anti-abortion folks just repurpose their playbook,\" says Chernoby, who notes that contraception may be more difficult to limit than abortion given its widespread popularity.\n\"We see them testing these restrictions on minors and low income communities, but we should regard it very much as a litmus test \u2014 and expect that they are going to expand these restrictions to affect all of us.\""

      "text": "Earlier today, the Atlantic published a story about Fox & Friends Weekend co-host turned Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that would be a huge, huge, huge scandal if it were any other administration, but with this one, we just call it a Monday.\nIn the story, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed that he had been added to a Signal group chat by Mike Waltz called \"Houthi PC Small Group.\" The group chat included 18 other Trump administration officials, including Hegseth, who in the chat discussed a secret war attack against the Houthi in Yemen. This is a significant security breach, so much so that Goldberg thought it wasn't real.\nNeedless to say, people are shocked, but they are probably also not too surprised that something like this would happen. So, I rounded up some of the funniest Twitter (X) reactions to this spectacular train wreck of a security breach:\nEditor\u2019s Note: We dive into X so you don't have to scrub your eyeballs afterward. Here's the good stuff we found floating in the chaos.\nSo there you have it, folks. When he isn't busy deleting the word \"gay\" from the Defense Department, Hegseth is blowing up the group chat! As always, sound off below because, truly, this feels straight out of Veep."

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the controversial views of Christian nationalist pastor Doug Wilson and his followers, including U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who shared a video promoting the idea that women should not have the right to vote. This has sparked significant backlash online, with many expressing disbelief and outrage over Hegseth's endorsement of such views. Additionally, the article highlights the Trump administration's efforts to roll back access to birth control and reproductive health services, raising concerns about the implications for women's rights and healthcare access.",
