  "title": "AYN's flagship gaming handheld confirms a massive screen upgrade",
  "description": "The AYN Odin 3 will feature an exclusive new AMOLED panel that no other gaming handhelds manufacturers can match.",
  "content": "Gaming handhelds often live or die by their screens, and AYN has taken a unique approach with its handhelds this year. The dual-screened Thor turned heads for its design and pricing, but the larger 6-inch screen on the top mostly flew under the radar. Now, AYN has announced that its upcoming flagship Odin 3 will use the same \u201cexclusive\u201d panel.\n\nThe 6-inch 120Hz HD AMOLED panel is unique to AYN\u2019s offerings, and the company likely had it custom-made for its devices this year. On July 30, a few weeks before the AYN Thor was announced, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang stated that there is no 6-inch OLED screen on the market, indicating that this is indeed custom hardware.\n\nTypically, these gaming handhelds use a mix of leftover parts and designs from mobile phones. For example, the AYANEO Pocket DMG, Retroid Pocket Classic, and Retroid Pocket Mini V2 use the bottom screen of the LG Wing, which just so happens to be perfect for retro games.\n\nThis screen is likely to be one of the main selling points of the AYN Odin 3, and it\u2019s a significant improvement over its predecessor. The Odin 2 had a 6-inch HD IPS LCD panel with a 60Hz refresh rate, so it\u2019s nice to see the upgraded specs without an increase in size.\n\nFor comparison, the KONKR Pocket FIT, which is likely to be the main competitor for the Odin 3, uses a 6-inch HD IPS display with a 144Hz refresh rate. It\u2019s very likely that we see more handheld manufacturers pick up this new 6-inch OLED panel in the coming months, but for now, it\u2019s AYN\u2019s ace in the sleeve.\n\nWe still don\u2019t have full specs or pricing for the AYN Odin 3, but if the Thor rollout is any indication, we should learn more by the end of the week. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming days.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nAYANEO just launched a budget-focused sub-brand, and Retroid and ANBERNIC should be scared\nJuly 28, 2025\n- AYANEO just launched a new, budget-focused sub-brand called KONKR.\n- It\u2019s first device is the Pocket FIT, with more details coming soon.\n- This is the first serious threat Retroid and ANBERNIC have faced in the budget/mid-range Android handheld space.\nRight at the end of its three-hour-plus livestream today where it revealed gorgeous dual-screened Pocket DS, AYANEO dropped yet another bombshell on the handheld gaming space. The brand is known for expensive, luxurious gaming devices that spare no expense, but now it\u2019s launching a budget-focused sub-brand to compete with the likes of Retroid and ANBERNIC.\nCalled KONKR, the new sub-brand was initially going to be announced alongside the new Qualcomm gaming chips back in March. That all but ensures that its first device, the Pocket FIT, will be sporting one of these new chips. AYANEO only revealed that it will be a Qualcomm chip in today\u2019s announcement, but my money is on the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2. That\u2019s the same chip that will power the Retroid Pocket 6.\nIn terms of design, it looks strikingly similar to the ultra-premium AYANEO Pocket S2. The Pocket Fit has an all-glass front, with small sticks and stacked shoulder buttons. It\u2019s also almost exactly the same size. However, it has a far more rounded design, with ergonomic grips and buttons on the back. It will also have a \u201chigh refresh rate display,\u201d which rules out the 60hz panel used in the Pocket S2.\nIt was shown off in white, black, and yellow/black colorways to match the rest of AYANEO\u2019s recent releases.\nThe livestream also revealed that KONKR handhelds will be powered by the same software and have the same general design aesthetic as AYANEO\u2019s premium devices. Price is typically the main complaint consumers have about AYANEO products, so providing the same quality at a lower pricepoint might be a recipe for success.\nKONKR is set to put major pressure on competitors like Retroid and ANBERNIC.\nMore details will be revealed in a separate livestream tomorrow, so hopefully we\u2019ll get a full look at specs and release windows then. The device itself will be on display at the Qualcomm booth at ChinaJoy 2025 starting August 1, alongside the newly-announced Pocket DS.\nInterestingly, AYANEO also revealed a budget-focused Windows handheld called the KONKR Fit. Unlike Windows devices from AYANEO, it\u2019s focused on endurance, with a massive 80Wh battery. The company claims the 7-inch device is significantly smaller than alternatives like the ROG Ally X, which is great news for portability. No word yet on pricing, specs, or release dates.\nThe company also teased a new \u201cCode R\u201d lineup of entry level devices. The first has the temporary moniker \u201cCode R-1\u201d and promises to offer a truly affordable experience. It\u2019s not yet clear whether this will fall under the AYANEO or KONKR banners, nor if it will even run Android. It\u2019s entirely possible that it will be a line of cheap Linux handhelds to compete with Miyoo or TrimUI.\nIn any case, this is the first major shakeup we\u2019ve seen in the Android handheld gaming space in years. While a few new brands have popped up offering niche Android handhelds, this is the first time a company with real design sense has challenged the stranglehold that Retroid and ANBERNIC have on the mid-range gaming handheld market.\nIt\u2019s too soon to say whether or not these devices will be successful, but AYANEO is one of the few companies pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with Android gaming handhelds. If KONKR devices can hit the right pricepoint, they might quickly become some of the most desirable handhelds you can buy.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe best Android retro gaming handhelds you can buy\nJanuary 28, 2025\nGaming handhelds have been around for decades now, but with the Steam Deck breaking the market open a few years ago, it feels like we\u2019re having a renaissance of emulation-focused handhelds. And while expensive handheld gaming PCs like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go often get the lion\u2019s share of the attention, Android-based gaming handhelds are absolutely perfect for retro gaming. Here are a few key advantages:\n- Access to Android apps and games (including retro game ports and Android emulators).\n- Improved portability over more powerful handhelds.\n- Better battery life and connectivity options.\n- More touch-friendly than Windows-based handhelds.\n- Much cheaper than gaming phones.\nOf course, you\u2019ll also want to weigh up the advantages of software emulation vs FPGA, or hardware-related emulation. With all that in mind, we\u2019ve selected the best Android retro gaming handhelds to help you hop back in time and get your nostalgia gaming fix.\nThe best Android retro gaming handhelds\nAYN Odin 2 Pro\nAYN is a relative newcomer to the gaming handheld scene, but its Odin 2 Pro device is our pick for the best Android retro gaming handheld for most people. It\u2019s got the right mix of ergonomics, raw power, and accessible pricing to make it an easy recommendation. Note that there is a non-Pro Base version of the Odin 2, but we think it\u2019s worth spending a bit more for the extra RAM and storage.\nMeasuring roughly the same size and shape as the Nintendo Switch Lite, the AYN Odin Pro is the perfect size for portable gaming. It features curved handles on the back, making it more comfortable to hold than the Switch Lite for long gaming sessions, plus a bright 6-inch 1080P LCD screen to make classic games pop.\nThe D-Pad and face buttons offer great tactile feedback, and the triggers have a more modern design with no click. There are customizable backplate buttons on the handles, as well. It runs Android 13, so you can be sure that it can run the latest emulators. Being an Android-based retro gaming handheld, there is a lot of room to tweak features, but it comes with the added ability to swap between performance profiles to eke more game time out of the massive 8,000mAh battery.\nOn the inside, the AYN Odin 2 Pro is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC and 12GM of RAM, which is borderline overkill for playing retro games. For reference, you should be able to run PS2 and Gamecube emulators at a fantastic framerate without tinkering, right out of the box. Even Nintendo Switch emulators aren\u2019t out of the question on this machine, and the 256GB of internal storage is large enough for even recent consoles.\nThe AYN Odin 2 Pro is currently on sale at $369, with a more powerful Max version costing $459. This bumps things up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, but honestly, it\u2019s a worse value overall. Gaming performance won\u2019t be nearly $100 better, so I\u2019d recommend sticking with the Pro model. If you want to save more, the last generation AYN Odin Pro is on sale for just $199, and despite the dated Snapdragon 845 processor, it\u2019s more than capable of PS2 and Gamecube-era emulation. If you want a larger screen, I\u2019d get the Odin 2 Pro Portal, which has the same great performance on a much larger 7-inch OLED panel.\nRetroid Pocket 5\nIf you want something more affordable, the Retroid Pocket 5 is a fantastic alternative. It\u2019s cheaper than even a basic cheap Android phone, but it\u2019s capable of emulating games up to the PS2 and Gamecube era with a powerful Snapdragon 865 processor.\nThe biggest upgrade from the Retroid Pocket 4 Pro is the larger, 5.5-inch AMOLED panel. Most of those gains are a result of reduced bezels, so the overall size of the device is still very pocketable.\nIt has excellent 3D hall sticks and clicky buttons, with the ability to swap the button placement to better suit the types of games you like to play. For example, swapping the A and B buttons to match Nintendo\u2019s (incorrectly) placed buttons.\nThe company also makes a slightly smaller handheld called the Retroid Pocket MINI, which has the same chipset with a smaller, 3.7-inch AMOLED panel. That\u2019s a great size for retro games, but it could be a little restrictive for more recent games from the PS2 era. If you just want to play older games, there are cheaper Android gaming handhelds that will get the job done further down in the list.\nLogitech G Cloud\nThe Logitech G Cloud wasn\u2019t designed to be a retro Android gaming machine, but it\u2019s probably what it\u2019s best at. The cloud-first device was made for streaming services like GeForce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming, or the now-defunct Google Stadia, but in our review we found the lack of WiFi 6 and poor cloud performance to be dealbreakers on that front. The software was also more of a burden than a helpful feature, and we found it less useful than the stock Android 11 it\u2019s plastered over.\nHowever, it\u2019s still a very well-made device, with a 1080p display that\u2019s plenty sharp and bright for retro gaming. The face and shoulder buttons are also great, and the overall build quality is a step above the more budget-friendly devices listed above.\nThe Logitech G Cloud sports a Snapdragon 720G, a mid-range gaming-focused SoC that mostly hits the nail on the head. It ran everything up to and sometimes including the PS2 and Gamecube era, although it really shines with PSP emulators and older. The more efficient processor also enables excellent battery life, from 10 to 12 hours in our review.\nUnfortunately, Logitech priced this at $350, which is significantly more than most Android retro gaming handhelds. If you can find it on sale, it\u2019s a solid premium pick, but at full price, it\u2019s not the best value.\nRazer Edge\nThe Razer Edge is yet another premium device, and it features a unique design that\u2019s more like an Android tablet with an attachable controller than a standalone gaming handheld. In fact, the controller is available separately as the Razer Kishi V2, and you can attach it to pretty much any smartphone for a similar experience.\nBut back to the Edge. It sports a large 6.8-inch OLED screen, putting it in the same size category as the largest Android phones, even without the controllers attached. On the inside, it\u2019s powered by a Snapdragon G3X Gen 1 SoC. This isn\u2019t the latest mobile processor, but combined with the enhanced cooling features on the Edge, it will outperform most flagship phones when it comes to sustained gaming. However, we did notice that those fans do get a bit loud.\nUnlike the Logitech G Cloud above, the Razer Edge features a fairly stock Android 12 experience. The pre-loaded Nexus app was more trouble than it was worth in our experience, but with full access to the Google Play Store, you can download as many emulators as you could possibly need.\nThere are two models of the Razer Edge, one with 5G and one without. The former will run you $600, while the latter is $400. To use as a retro gaming device, the non-5G model will be more than enough, but again, I\u2019d only recommend snagging it on sale, and there are often great deals to be found on this device.\nAnbernic RG353P\nGetting back into affordable territory, the Anbernic RG353P is great for true retro gaming. It won\u2019t play anything from the PS2 era or newer, but it can still play most Dreamcast games reasonably well with its RK3566 Quad-Core SoC.\nIt\u2019s clear from the get-go that the RG353P is a budget device, with a much smaller 3.5-inch IPS display. It still has a touch display, though, and the device comes with the ability to boot in either Linux or Android 11. It\u2019s probably more comfortable to use in Linux, and it comes with emulators pre-installed, but it\u2019s nice to have the option to switch to Android if you want to.\nFor anyone looking to play older retro games, the Anbernic RG353P is a great pick that won\u2019t break the bank. For roughly $100, you can enjoy games from the NES, SNES, N64, or even PSP eras for upwards of five hours on a single charge.\nAYANEO Pocket Evo\nOur last pick for the best Android retro gaming handheld is one of the most powerful but also the most expensive. The AYANEO Pocket Evo is right there at the top of premium retro gaming handhelds, but it has a lot going for it.\nThe Snapdragon GX3 Gen2 chipset was specifically designed for gaming handhelds, with performance that can\u2019t be matched by any other device. Or at least, that\u2019s the theory. I\u2019ve found that the biggest weakness of this chipset is a lack of support. AYANEO is one of the only companies using it, so many demanding Android games don\u2019t take full advantage of all that power.\nThe 7-inch OLED screen is a true thing of beauty. It\u2019s very similar to the Odin2 Portal, but it tops off at 165hz rather than 120hz. I didn\u2019t notice a difference, and you probably won\u2019t either, but suffice it to say that it\u2019s the most beautiful screen I\u2019ve ever used on a handheld device.\nWhile this is a great Android device for retro gaming, I actually think it\u2019s overkill. Unless you plan on doing Switch or Windows emulation, you won\u2019t need this premium of a device. That said, the screen is wonderful for game streaming, and the build, sticks, and buttons are superb.\nNow for the bad news, and that\u2019s price. This is one of the most expensive handhelds on the market. It\u2019s also huge, so despite the name, don\u2019t expect to slip it into your jeans pockets.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI can't believe how good the Retroid Pocket Classic is at this price\nMay 18, 2025\nRetroid Pocket Classic\nMSRP: $119.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nRetroid Pocket Classic\nThe Retroid Pocket Classic feels like it took second string to the Pocket Flip 2 when they were both announced earlier this year. The Game Boy-esque handheld was tucked away in the back of the promotion image, and details didn\u2019t emerge until weeks later.\nSure, some of that was due to the new chipset, which was still unannounced at the time. However, the Pocket Flip 2 felt like it was getting the lion\u2019s share of attention, with the Classic being a kind of experimental device for the company. After all, it\u2019s the company\u2019s first vertical handheld since its first device in 2020.\nAfter testing both devices, the Classic is easily my favorite. I cannot believe how good this DMG-style handheld is, and it\u2019s made me incredibly excited about the future of Android gaming handhelds in a way I had not expected.\nA Game Boy for the modern (retro) gamer\nWhen I first opened the box, I was surprised by just how large the Retroid Pocket Classic is. It\u2019s significantly larger than my previous everyday carry vertical handheld, the TrimUI Brick, and roughly the same size as the Pocket Flip 2 when closed.\nIt\u2019s also incredibly light. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like a Game Boy with the batteries removed. It\u2019s comfortable to hold, to be sure, but it has a strangely hollow feeling, especially toward the bottom.\nAt this point, it\u2019s worth pointing out that there are several design options. Most have a standard Game Boy-like layout, with a D-pad and four face buttons. However, the Classic 6 variant features six buttons, taking inspiration from Sega consoles.\nThat\u2019s the variant that I grabbed for this review, despite falling on the Nintendo side of the aisle when I was younger. I was a late convert to Sega consoles, but I figured the extra buttons would always come in handy as hotkeys when playing consoles with standard layouts. They can also serve as the C buttons for N64, although emulating that console on the Pocket Classic isn\u2019t ideal without a stick.\nThere are four- and six-button variants of the Pocket Classic.\nThe Classic 6\u2019s buttons are also different in design, with three concave A B C buttons and three smaller X Y Z buttons. These buttons were my least favorite part of the device. They have very little resistance and a loud clacky sound when pressed. I would feel very self-conscious playing this in a quiet place in public, let alone in bed next to my spouse while she\u2019s trying to sleep.\nThey\u2019re also fairly small. As mentioned above, the Pocket Classic is fairly large, so there\u2019s plenty of real estate for larger buttons. The volume and power buttons on the side, while not overly important, also feel downright cheap compared to the rest of the device.\nThe triggers and D-pad, on the other hand, are great. I almost wish Retroid had gone with a shield design similar to those used by Sega in the 90s for the Classic 6 model, but I suspect it\u2019s hard to find a matching off-the-shelf component nowadays. In any case, it\u2019s great for everything from platformers to fighting games.\nThe mono speaker is more than serviceable, and it gets nice and loud considering the size. There\u2019s a handy headphone jack on the top of the device for better sound, plus Bluetooth 5.1 support for wireless audio.\nBut the real star of the show here is the massive 3.92-inch AMOLED screen. This is the same screen found on the premium AYANEO Pocket DMG, and it\u2019s by far the best screen available on any vertical handheld available today. The colors are incredible, the blacks are perfect, and the aspect ratio is great for most consoles you\u2019d want to emulate on this thing. It\u2019s also very bright, and I had no problem playing in the bright Spanish sun while my son was napping in his stroller.\nGranted, 16:9 systems like the PSP have large black bars. The bars on 3:2 GBA games (seen above) are still manageable, but I wouldn\u2019t buy this device for PSP games.\nThe bezels also play a role here. The Classic 6 model I tested and the Retro colorway have light gray bezels, while the other models have darker bezels. I suspect the darker bezels help blend the screen into the body of the device, so you might want to pick one of those colorways if you plan on playing GBA or PSP games.\nThe chipset of the future\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect in terms of performance, since this is the first device shipping with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 processor. The Pocket Classic was actually announced a few weeks before the processor itself, leading to some cageyness from Retroid in marketing materials.\nI ran the device through our standard suite of benchmarks (except for anything related to ray tracing, which this chipset does not support), and the results aren\u2019t too surprising. On paper, it\u2019s similar to the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2, a mid-range processor from 2023 that uses the same 4nm process with two performance cores and six efficiency cores.\nHowever, the G1 Gen 2 is designed from the ground up for gaming handhelds, and it shows. It\u2019s not made for high benchmarks but for solid performance on a tight budget, with great heat management. Temperatures never climbed beyond 30 degrees Celsius in my testing, although the fan on the back of the Retroid Pocket Classic does have a slight coil whine when placed in Sport mode. As seen in the Wild Life Stress Test, the GPU is wildly underpowered, but emulation relies almost entirely on the CPU.\nThe new chipset has a few other benefits not found in cheaper retro gaming handhelds, including fast charging. In my testing, the massive 5,000mAh battery charged from 10% to 90% in just 45 minutes. Once charged, the device sipped power, lasting well over 12 hours for older systems like SNES and Game Boy Color, and roughly five or six hours on more demanding consoles. I\u2019d love to see capacity-limiting battery health features from Android 15 added to this device, but until then, you\u2019ll want to be careful not to overcharge the device.\nResults on paper are one thing, but after testing emulation performance, I have to say this chipset blew me away. As expected, I got great results when emulating everything up to Dreamcast and Nintendo 64, as well as handhelds like the PSP and Nintendo DS. However, I was surprised that it could easily handle many PS2 and GameCube games. Demanding games will run slow, but the JRPGs and strategy games that I enjoy run at a consistent 60fps. I\u2019m really looking forward to replaying Wild Arms 3 on this device.\nEmulation performance is way better than I expected at this price.\nIn fact, performance was only slightly worse than the Snapdragon 865 found in the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 for relevant games at this aspect ratio. That\u2019s impressive considering the Classic is just over half the price of the Flip 2. Benchmark comparisons are heavily skewed toward the Flip 2, but the most significant difference in practice is that it can\u2019t handle demanding shaders due to the weak GPU. Lightweight shaders work fine, but you might have to do some experimenting to get the best mix of aesthetics and performance.\nThe other asterisk here is Sega Saturn emulation, but that\u2019s not necessarily the fault of the chipset itself. Games like Batsugun and Sakura Wars loaded and ran ok, but there were graphical glitches and occasional crashes. I\u2019m sure there are ways to make it work, but despite the Classic 6\u2019s design, I wouldn\u2019t position this as the ideal device for Sega Saturn emulation.\nThere are issues with a few other consoles as well, but they mostly come down to the lack of sticks. For me, this isn\u2019t really a bug, but rather a feature. Sticks would make this device far less pocketable and detract from the Game Boy-like design. The small sticks found on these kinds of devices are also generally uncomfortable to use. You can make it work by swapping the D-pad for the left stick and adding an overlay on the screen for the other stick, but that\u2019s not a great experience, either. Just stick to D-Pad-focused games.\nThe lack of sticks is a feature, not a bug.\nInterestingly, while the chipset nailed emulation performance, it suffered from occasional stutters when navigating menus in Android 14. It also lacks compatibility for some Play Store games and apps, both in terms of software and controls. Some apps turned the screen on its side, with no option to rotate it back to its proper position.\nI suspect many of these quirks will be fixed over time, but one thing that can\u2019t be fixed is the lack of video out support. I confirmed with Qualcomm that the chipset simply doesn\u2019t support it, so you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere to play on a big screen.\nRegardless, it\u2019s extremely impressive how well this chipset performs, and it\u2019s made me very excited to see the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, which is confirmed for the next flagship Retroid Pocket handheld.\nRetroid Pocket Classic review verdict: The best value in Android gaming handhelds\nWith all that said, the most surprising thing about this handheld is the price: it starts at just $119 for the 4+64GB version. I\u2019d recommend bumping that up to the 6+128GB for $10 more, but that\u2019s an incredible value for what you\u2019re getting here.\nSure, you can spend half that on something like the TrimUI Brick ($84.99 at Amazon) seen above, but the Linux-based handheld is smaller, far less powerful, and you lose compatibility with Android games. For more power, you\u2019ll have to pay hundreds more for the AYANEO Pocket DMG ($419 at Manufacturer site), which is frankly overkill for a device like this unless you really want a luxury Game Boy clone.\nThe Retroid Pocket Classic is unbeatable in its price bracket.\nI wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend the Retroid Pocket Classic, and I suspect it will replace every other vertical handheld in my collection. You\u2019ll still have to jump through some hoops to install emulators and a decent front-end like ES DE, but for $120-130, it\u2019s worth the trouble. Just think about whether or not you really need those two extra buttons from the Classic 6 edition.\nThis is an incredible first showing for Qualcomm\u2019s cheapest gaming-focused chipset and an absolute home run for Retroid. I love this device, and I can\u2019t wait to see more handhelds utilize these chips.\n- Bright AMOLED display\n- Exceptional performance\n- Six-button option\n- Great battery life\n- Incredible value\n- No video out\n- Middling buttons\n- Some compatibility issues\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThere's another dual-screen Android gaming handheld on the way, and it's shockingly affordable\nAugust 21, 2025\n- AYN\u2019s upcoming dual-screen Thor handheld will start at just $249.\n- That\u2019s $100 cheaper than the AYANEO Pocket DS, although it\u2019s smaller and less powerful.\n- It will be available for pre-order on the official AYN website starting next week.\nAYANEO rocked the handheld gaming world when it announced the dual-screened Pocket DS, which is set to finally replace the Nintendo 3DS years after it was discontinued. A few days later, AYN swooped in to steal the show with a new, smaller dual-screen handheld called the Thor, and now that pricing has been revealed, it might be the best deal in gaming handhelds.\nEarly-bird pricing for the AYN Thor will start at just $249 for the 8+128GB version packing a Snapdragon 865 processor. That\u2019s more than enough power for Nintendo DS and 3DS emulation, at a cheaper price than most second-hand New Nintendo 3DS XL consoles.\nPricing for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 version with 8+128GB will start at $299 during the early bird period, with the maxed-out 16GB+1TB edition costing $429. These are incredible deals for a device with two OLED screens and this level of performance, although pricing will increase by $10 to $30 once the early-bird period has ended.\nThis might be the best deal in gaming handhelds, two screens or no.\nPre-orders will start early next week on the official website, although there isn\u2019t a product page on the website as of writing. We still don\u2019t know a shipping date, but it likely won\u2019t ship for at least a few months.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nThis pricing puts major pressure on AYANEO, which just launched a crowdfunding campaign for the Pocket DS, which starts at $399. That device has a larger screen (7-inches vs 6-inches), and opts for the gaming-focused Snapdragon G3 Gen 2 SoC. In our testing, the G3 Gen 2 just edged out the 8 Gen 2, although driver support is better on the mainline chipset.\nAdditionally, one of the main selling points of the Pocket DS, and the reason it took so long to develop, is software support. Android hasn\u2019t historically played well with dual-screen devices, and AYANEO has put a lot of effort into building out software to help bridge that gap. So far, we haven\u2019t seen the Thor in use, and AYN typically uses a lighter hand when it comes to custom software.\nRegardless, it\u2019s a fantastic time to be a fan of dual-screen handhelds and 3DS emulation. With used 3DS prices through the roof, these new devices provide a solid emulation alternative.\nAYN also announced the Odin 3 for a more traditional handheld experience, although details won\u2019t be revealed until after the Thor goes up for pre-order next week.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThis overkill Android Game Boy is better than my memories of the real thing\nMarch 22, 2025\nAYANEO Pocket DMG\nMSRP: $419.00\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nAYANEO Pocket DMG\nThe first gaming system I poured hours into that I could really call my own (our Amiga 500 was more of a family system) was, like so many of my millennial generation, the original Game Boy. That means I\u2019m old enough to have gone through multiple Nintendo handheld generations, with a few fleeting but notable detours along the way (loved the PS Vita, love my Steam Deck even more).\nI\u2019m also at a point in my increasingly busy middle-aged life where handhelds are increasingly becoming the simplest and quickest way I can play games solo. And yes, the reason I\u2019m so taken with the Steam Deck (particularly the gorgeous OLED upgrade model I picked up recently) is that it fills that gap with very little friction. But I\u2019m also a sucker for exciting new hardware, not immune to the clawing pull of nostalgia, and willing to spend a little extra on a gaming system if I think I\u2019ll get enough enjoyment out of it.\nAll this to say that the AYANEO Pocket DMG feels laser-targeted at me. I\u2019ve spent the past two months testing the most powerful, Android-based Game Boy clone ever made, and while I can\u2019t ignore the fact it is absolutely a ludicrous luxury item at the current asking price for reasons I\u2019ll get into, I can\u2019t help but want to tell anyone with similar weaknesses as me to buy it with no regrets.\nThe Game Boy that Nintendo would never make\nTechnically, the Game Boy of my childhood was the second iteration, the \u201cPlay It Loud!\u201d model with the transparent clear casing, which I guess explains why I like Nothing\u2019s design work today, as well as any other retro-styled see-through gadgets I can peek into. The Retro Color limited edition AYANEO Pocket DMG version I was kindly sent to test isn\u2019t a perfect nostalgia trip for me as it\u2019s aping the very first model with the off-gray body and magenta buttons, but it still tickles an itch having seen so many of them brought to school and linked to mine via a cable in real-life back at the turn of the 1990s.\nThe AYANEO Pocket DMG feels laser-targeted at original Game Boy fans like me.\nBefore I go any further I should state upfront that if you want to pick up a Pocket DMG, I don\u2019t recommend you try to track down the $699 special edition model (and you can\u2019t from AYANEO\u2019s store anyway). The 1TB storage you get is handy, and the 16GB of RAM helps with tougher-to-emulate titles, but the former can be rectified with a microSD card, and the latter is available on a regular $609 variant if you really want it. I think the sweet spot is the 12GB/256GB at $529 (or $499 at the time of this writing), rather than going for the 8GB/128GB entry-tier.\nThere are two caveats, however. First, if you absolutely need it to have that original Game Boy look to enjoy it, I respect it, I\u2019m not going to admonish you for something I\u2019d probably do if AYANEO hadn\u2019t sent it over. But perhaps more important to know is that the Retro Color model I have has a matte plastic finish, while the Black and White models are glossy due to a protective coating, meaning you\u2019ll encounter fingerprints and have to live with a feel that\u2019s overall a little less premium. I personally prefer the neutral, slick look of the Black model, but the matte finish would also be something I\u2019d pay a little more for. Unfortunately, AYANEO is making all versions glossy in the near future, so this point may be moot if you can\u2019t get your hands on a first-edition batch.\nBut enough about color; the rest of the Pocket DMG is the same no matter which model you go for. It\u2019s hardly on the small side, but the thinness (22.3mm) makes it easy to slide into your own pocket, and it\u2019s light without feeling lightweight and flimsy. The smoothly curved rear edges help with longer play sessions, though I wish the front edges were a little less sharp as they can start to dig into the fleshy bit at the ball of your thumb.\nThe button layout is far more flexible than any vertical handheld bearing the Nintendo name, let alone any Game Boy. The Start and Select pills and the AYANEO menu button are horrible mush, but the really important buttons and D-pad have okay travel and are clicky without being annoyingly loud or too resistant.\nThe shoulder bumpers are even better, though if you\u2019ve got larger hands like me, it can be a stretch to arch your index fingers to hit L2/R2 (there are also optional metallic versions you can swap in). The joystick is also decent (in theory, more on that later) and the Hall Effect tech inside means you shouldn\u2019t encounter stick drift in the future. The clickable trackpad is solidly made and responsive, though much like the joystick it has some fundamental issues I\u2019ll get back to shortly.\nOtherwise, the sides are stacked out with a tactile volume scroll wheel, a toggle that switches power modes on the fly, two customizable buttons (one on either side), LC and RC for navigating the UI, and a fingerprint sensor, which actually works pretty well. There are also two large vents on either side that house stereo speakers, and they do a fantastic job of pumping out everything from retro chiptunes to modern orchestral scores.\nWith Android as the baseline, you get access to classic retro games via emulators and Android favorites on the Google Play Store.\nRounding things out are the USB-C port on the bottom, a microSD card slot on the right, and a large circular fan vent on the rear. The latter can get pretty loud under load, but there are plenty of options to tweak the performance modes (and remap buttons) via the AYANEO button and AYAHOME software skin. I won\u2019t dwell too long on the latter because it\u2019s fairly mundane, though that\u2019s preferable to me than the really in-your-face UIs that you find on some handhelds.\nPlus, with Android as the baseline, you\u2019re getting broad access to a bunch of games via Android emulators and native Android games through the Google Play Store, as well as robust touch controls and menus that will be familiar to anyone who has ever rocked an Android phone. It also means you can grab the excellent Android version of the hyper-customizable EmulationStation DE frontend for a nice upgrade over AYANEO\u2019s own AYASPACE game collection space.\nGreat power that you should play with responsibly\nThe AYANEO is powered by Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, which is kitted out with an Adreno A32 GPU. This was the top dedicated gaming chip from Qualcomm at the time of launch, and while it\u2019s since been surpassed by the G3 Gen 3, the Pocket DMG is nothing less than a powerhouse that benefits from support for Wi-Fi 7 and a 5G modem for smooth online play and speedy downloads. It also supports ray tracing, though at this display size, and with such limited support on Android, it\u2019s not really something you\u2019ll notice.\nI put my top-end model Pocket DMG through the usual benchmarks we run here at Android Authority and you can see how it compares to the phones we test on a regular basis (we\u2019ll be adding more Android handhelds to our testing database over time!). As you\u2019d expect, it\u2019s blown away by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but it outperforms Google\u2019s Tensor G4 in 3DMark\u2019s Wild Life Extreme Stress Test. The real kicker here is stability, as despite comfortably outperforming the very capable Pixel 9 series SoC, it does so without sacrificing stability over repeat runs. It also avoids overheating thanks to the chip\u2019s efficiency and the DMG\u2019s dedicated fan cooling. Plus, benchmarks don\u2019t tell the full story for emulation, since the G3x Gen 2 has worse custom driver support from the community.\nWhat this means in real-world use is that the AYANEO Pocket DMG is perfectly capable of emulating sixth-gen consoles like the Dreamcast, GameCube, and PS2 \u2014 albeit with some occasional frame drops on Sony\u2019s system on more demanding games that will require backend tweaks in NetherSX2, or bumping up the Pocket DMG\u2019s cooling profile. Doing so will take a hit to battery life via the 6,000mAh cell, but I generally never felt like I was burning through the battery too quickly even when under heavy load. You can also funnel all that extra power into shaders, which adds extra processing demands the Pocket DMG can easily handle while providing a more authentic feel for those older-generation platforms.\nBut the sixth-gen is still where things stop, not because the Pocket DMG isn\u2019t capable of flexing beyond that to later-generation systems like the Wii U, PS Vita, and performance-friendly Switch titles, but because the console isn\u2019t really built for them for two main reasons.\nFirst, let\u2019s address the display. The Pocket DMG\u2019s 1080p OLED panel is 3.92 inches of contrast-y gorgeousness, with a super-crisp 419ppi pixel density and a maximum brightness of 450 nits that really makes the highlights pop. As an OLED-enjoyer who willingly splashed out on a second Switch and Steam Deck simply for their respective OLED upgrades, I feel fairly confident in telling you that the Pocket DMG\u2019s panel is a stunner.\nThe Pocket DMG is powerful enough to play beyond the PS2 era, but unavoidable design limitations mean you shouldn't.\nHowever, it also has a squared-off 8:7 aspect ratio (31:27 if we\u2019re being pedantic), which restricts what you can actually play on it and not have to suffer from beefy black bars smothering the screen real estate. Your tolerance may vary, but to me, anything in 16:9 or close to it is simply not viable on the Pocket DMG, not because it can\u2019t run, but because it\u2019s not what a display of this shape was ever intended for.\nSadly, that means a lot of great Android games aren\u2019t much fun to play on the Pocket DMG, though anything that has particularly central avatar action, such as Stardew Valley or Vampire Survivors, aren\u2019t as impacted. Nintendo DS/3DS emulation is a little more debatable; you can hot-swap between a top and bottom screen with some tweaking, or alternatively put one on top of the other. Neither solution is perfect but no non-dual or horizontal display handheld ever will be.\nThen there are the controls. That joystick I mentioned? I sure hope you like arching your thumb to use it. There\u2019s no better place for it on a vertical handheld, but having it so far down in the corner means any games that adopt a one-stick playstyle \u2014 I played a good chunk of Silent Hill 2 on this and suffered the pain for science \u2014 will quickly lead to discomfort over extended sessions.\nThe other side of that coin is the trackpad, which I adore, but not for the reason I imagine a lot of folks would want. The trackpad\u2019s primary function is to act as a pseudo-second stick for camera controls in twin-stick 3D games, but it\u2019s an absolute chore to use for that purpose. At no point does it ever feel as accurate as a second stick would. First-person shooters are an absolute no-go, and even when I was being very careful in slower-paced 3D platformers, I almost always overshot the camera.\nBut I also don\u2019t think having a second stick would be better \u2014 the Pocket DMG and Game Boy-styled vertical handhelds like this just aren\u2019t designed for them. All that discomfort of using one stick would be doubled with an additional one (looking at you, ANBERNIC RG353V). That\u2019s why horizontal, twin-stick handhelds are a thing.\nSo why do I personally love the trackpad? Well, I\u2019m a point-and-click adventure nerd, and emulating LucasArts classics via ScummVM on the Pocket DMG has been a delight after tweaking the trackpad to act as mouse controls (tip: half the pointer speed). Ask me about Loom!\nAYANEO Pocket DMG review verdict: You don\u2019t need it, but you might want it\nMuch of the appeal of the emulation and retro handheld scene is about indulging in classic games on modern hardware while maximizing overall bang for your buck. I get that, and if the budget part of that equation is paramount to you, you should pretend the AYANEO Pocket DMG doesn\u2019t exist and check out any of the far more affordable retro handhelds out there.\nEven if I assume that what you\u2019re looking for is specifically a vertical handheld, there are options that will do the basics for less than $50 if you shop around for a good deal, such as the TrimUI Brick ($84.99 at Amazon), ANBERNIC RG35XX Plus ($67.99 at Amazon), and Miyoo Mini Plus ($79.99 at Amazon). If you want something a bit more premium, the recently announced Retroid Pocket Classic ($129.99 at Manufacturer site) brings all the functionality of Android plus an AMOLED screen for a fraction of the cost.\nLooking to relive the halcyon days of the Game Boy? There\u2019s currently no finer way to do it than the AYANEO Pocket DMG.\nMeanwhile, FPGA devices like the ModRetro Chromatic ($199.99 at Manufacturer site) and, more famously, the Analogue Pocket ($219.99 at Manufacturer site), offer cartridge support to more closely mimic an actual Game Boy. And if you don\u2019t actually care about the form factor, well\u2026 we\u2019re not far off Steam Deck OLED ($549 at Manufacturer site) territory, which is an emulation behemoth that you can also play all your favorite PC games on.\nPut simply, the AYANEO Pocket DMG is a luxury, a frivolity, an overkill throwback to a classic design that pulls on every nostalgia cord to make you want it, even if you absolutely don\u2019t need it. But life is boring without a little luxury every now and again, and if you\u2019re looking to relive the halcyon days of the Game Boy era and beyond in the most extravagant way possible, there\u2019s currently no finer way to do it.\n- Gorgeous OLED display\n- Rich emulation options\n- Classy retro design\n- Overkill performance\n- Solid battery life\n- Trackpad no good for 3D cameras\n- Awkward joystick placement\n- 8:7 screen not a great fit for late gen emulation\n- Very expensive\nThank you for being part of our community.

  "argos_summary": "AYANEO has announced that its upcoming Odin\u202f3 will feature a custom 6\u2011inch 120\u202fHz AMOLED panel, a first for handhelds, improving on the Odin\u202f2's 60\u202fHz LCD. The company also unveiled a budget sub\u2011brand, KONKR, with the Pocket\u202fFIT and the dual\u2011screen Thor, offering lower\u2011priced options that could pressure competitors like Retroid and ANBERNIC. These moves signal a shift toward higher\u2011refresh, OLED displays in mid\u2011range handhelds, with pricing and release windows expected in the coming weeks.",
