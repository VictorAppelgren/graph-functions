      "summary": "Trump’s 2025 executive orders aim to accelerate fossil fuel infrastructure, giving a boost to midstream oil and gas companies that transport and store energy. The orders streamline environmental reviews, declare a national energy emergency, and prioritize pipeline and storage projects, especially in Alaska and offshore drilling areas. As a result, 22 midstream firms—including Chevron, Kinder Morgan, Williams, and Cheniere—are positioned to benefit from increased production and LNG export demand. The article also highlights AirIQ Inc., a Canadian IoT asset‑management firm, noting its modest financials and recent earnings decline.",
