The fund aims to deliver returns that mirror the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust (SPY) up to the capped level while offering a buffer against SPY losses, though units purchased after the first day may have different return potential. Portfolio managers Karan Sood and Trevor Lack oversee the strategy, and First Trust Canada serves as trustee, manager, and promoter of the ETF.",
