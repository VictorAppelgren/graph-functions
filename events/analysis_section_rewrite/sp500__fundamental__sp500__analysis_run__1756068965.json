      "feedback": "The draft credibly sketches a multi‑year decoupling/reshoring regime and uses Ford as a practical test case, but to reach world‑class quality it must tighten the causal logic, embed explicit first‑principles anchors, quantify the transmission, and reconcile source conflicts; concretely, replace the generic “IntelOrbis Graph” framing with a defined multi‑year regime anchored to invariant drivers (real rate differentials/policy reaction functions, terms of trade from tariff shocks, productivity upgrades from domestic AI/chip investments, and BoP implications of re‑shoring), then spell out four regimes (base, inflation‑driven escalation, ally realignment, and a constructive thaw) with clear transition triggers (e.g., sustained CPI above a threshold, tariff baseline persisting or ratcheting, or a pivot by key allies) and how each shapes market pricing via discount rates, capex ROI, and risk premia; integrate first‑principles channels (tariffs alter relative prices, incentivize domestic investment, and reallocate capital toward semis/AI data‑center buildouts, with spillovers to cyclicals like autos) and then quantify: e.g., Ford’s EV losses (~$1.3B in Q2 per the Fool piece), its 5%+ dividend yield and ~8–10x forward P/E, and the implied capex/ROIC dynamics of a 10–15% ROIC regime versus a cost of capital that could rise with policy risk; lay out a base‑case forecast with a plausible 3–5 year range for industrial capex, EV profitability timing, and equity multiples, plus upside/downside sensitivities to tariff levels (baseline 10%, China‑tariff spikes to 125–145% or higher) and to allied supply‑chain realignment; broaden the evidence base by weighing the CEO‑pay/board‑alignment angle (O4ZEED2EB) as a governance signal under regime consistency, and balance with Ford‑centric data (22PL3Q360, 65UUBU0OR, W2622L6WW) to avoid overreliance on a single source; add a dedicated invalidation rule (e.g., a credible policy U‑turn by allies or a sustained inflation shock that derails capex timing) and a watch list of indicators (tariff announcements, chip‑fabrication progress, EV unit economics, and Ford’s margin trajectory) to sharpen credibility; ensure all claims pair with citations to the exact IDs and reconcile conflicts by presenting a neutral, cross‑source synthesis rather than a single‑narrative frame.",
