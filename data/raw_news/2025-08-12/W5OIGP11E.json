  "content": "Agricultural and construction machinery company Deere (NYSE:DE) will be reporting earnings this Thursday before the bell. Here\u2019s what to expect.\n\nDeere missed analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 9.7% last quarter, reporting revenues of $11.17 billion, down 17.9% year on year. It was a very strong quarter for the company, with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 adjusted operating income estimates.\n\nIs Deere a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Deere\u2019s revenue to grow 3.2% year on year to $11.75 billion, a reversal from the 20.3% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $4.55 per share.\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings.\n\nLooking at Deere\u2019s peers in the heavy machinery segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. AGCO\u2019s revenues decreased 18.8% year on year, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 5.9%, and Alamo reported flat revenue, topping estimates by 2.4%. AGCO traded up 6.5% following the results while Alamo was down 1.4%.\n\nRead our full analysis of AGCO\u2019s results here and Alamo\u2019s results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the heavy machinery segment, with share prices up 3.2% on average over the last month. Deere\u2019s stock price was unchanged during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $543.65 (compared to the current share price of $506.10).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

      "text": "AGCO (AGCO)\nAGCO is up against the odds. Its weak sales growth and declining returns on capital show its demand and profits are shrinking.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think AGCO Will Underperform\nWith a history that features both organic growth and acquisitions, AGCO (NYSE:AGCO) designs, manufactures, and sells agricultural machinery and related technology.\n- Products and services are facing significant end-market challenges during this cycle as sales have declined by 15.3% annually over the last two years\n- Earnings per share decreased by more than its revenue over the last two years, showing each sale was less profitable\n- Demand will likely be weak over the next 12 months as Wall Street expects flat revenue\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than AGCO\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than AGCO\nAt $110.69 per share, AGCO trades at 21.9x forward P/E. This multiple is high given its weaker fundamentals.\nWe\u2019d rather pay up for companies with elite fundamentals than get a decent price on a poor one. High-quality businesses often have more durable earnings power, helping us sleep well at night.\n3. AGCO (AGCO) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nAgricultural and farm machinery company AGCO (NYSE:AGCO) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, but sales fell by 18.8% year on year to $2.64 billion. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $9.8 billion at the midpoint came in 1.7% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its GAAP profit of $4.22 per share was significantly above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAGCO (AGCO) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $2.64 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.49 billion (18.8% year-on-year decline, 5.9% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): $4.22 vs analyst estimates of $0.94 (significant beat)\n- The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $9.8 billion at the midpoint from $9.6 billion, a 2.1% increase\n- EPS (GAAP) guidance for the full year is $4.88 at the midpoint, beating analyst estimates by 26.4%\n- Operating Margin: 6.2%, up from -7.4% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 12.3%, up from 4.2% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $7.96 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith a history that features both organic growth and acquisitions, AGCO (NYSE:AGCO) designs, manufactures, and sells agricultural machinery and related technology.\nThe company's portfolio encompasses a wide range of agricultural equipment, including tractors, combines, self-propelled sprayers, hay tools, and equipment for foraging, seeding, and tilling. AGCO goes to market with a number of recognizable brands in the agriculture world such as Fendt, Grain & Protein, Massey Ferguson, and Precision Planting. Given trends in digitization, AGCO is investing in adding technology such as sensors and automation to its equipment to help customers such as farmers increase yields, minimize waste, and reduce manual labor.\nAGCO's customer base spans smaller, independent farmers to larger-scale commercial agricultural enterprises and agribusinesses. The company distributes its products through a network of thousands of dealers, distributors, and service providers globally.\nAs mentioned, acquisitions have been an important part of the company's history. Major ones include the 1993 purchase of the North American distribution rights to Massey Ferguson (a global agricultural equipment company) and the 2001 purchase of Ag-Chem Equipment (application equipment).\n4. Agricultural Machinery\nAgricultural machinery companies are investing to develop and produce more precise machinery, automated systems, and connected equipment that collects analyzable data to help farmers and other customers improve yields and increase efficiency. On the other hand, agriculture is seasonal and natural disasters or bad weather can impact the entire industry. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as commodity prices or changes in interest rates\u2013which dictate the willingness of these companies or their customers to invest\u2013can impact demand for agricultural machinery.\nAGCO\u2019s peers and competitors include Deere (NYSE:DE) and CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNH).\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Regrettably, AGCO\u2019s sales grew at a sluggish 3.5% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This was below our standard for the industrials sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. AGCO\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 15.3% annually. AGCO isn\u2019t alone in its struggles as the Agricultural Machinery industry experienced a cyclical downturn, with many similar businesses observing lower sales at this time.\nThis quarter, AGCO\u2019s revenue fell by 18.8% year on year to $2.64 billion but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 5.9%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 3.4% over the next 12 months. While this projection is better than its two-year trend, it\u2019s hard to get excited about a company that is struggling with demand.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nAGCO has bad unit economics for an industrials company, giving it less room to reinvest and develop new offerings. As you can see below, it averaged a 24.4% gross margin over the last five years. Said differently, AGCO had to pay a chunky $75.56 to its suppliers for every $100 in revenue.\nIn Q2, AGCO produced a 25% gross profit margin, in line with the same quarter last year. Zooming out, AGCO\u2019s full-year margin has been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 1.9 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses).\n7. Operating Margin\nAGCO was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 7.5% was weak for an industrials business. This result isn\u2019t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, AGCO\u2019s operating margin decreased by 7.9 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. AGCO\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nThis quarter, AGCO generated an operating margin profit margin of 6.2%, up 13.7 percentage points year on year. The increase was solid, and because its operating margin rose more than its gross margin, we can infer it was more efficient with expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAGCO\u2019s EPS grew at a remarkable 12.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 3.5% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\nFor AGCO, its two-year annual EPS declines of 70% mark a reversal from its (seemingly) healthy five-year trend. We hope AGCO can return to earnings growth in the future.\nIn Q2, AGCO reported EPS at $4.22, up from negative $4.91 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects AGCO\u2019s full-year EPS of $1.33 to grow 276%.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nAGCO has shown weak cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 4.6%, subpar for an industrials business.\nAGCO\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $323.5 million in Q2, equivalent to a 12.3% margin. This result was good as its margin was 8 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends carry greater meaning.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough AGCO hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately because of its poor top-line performance, it historically found a few growth initiatives that worked out well. Its five-year average ROIC was 14.1%, impressive for an industrials business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, AGCO\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased significantly. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nAGCO reported $783.9 million of cash and $2.96 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $1.04 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view AGCO\u2019s 2.1\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $97.5 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from AGCO\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly AGCO blew past analysts\u2019 revenue and EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited it raised its full-year guidance for both metrics. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 7.9% to $115 immediately after reporting.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy AGCO?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 11:20 PM EDT\nWhen considering an investment in AGCO, investors should account for its valuation and business qualities as well as what\u2019s happened in the latest quarter.\nAGCO doesn\u2019t pass our quality test. First off, its revenue growth was weak over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out. On top of that, its declining operating margin shows the business has become less efficient.\nAGCO\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 22x. At this valuation, there\u2019s a lot of good news priced in - we think there are better opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $123.92 on the company (compared to the current share price of $111.30)."

      "text": "Alamo (ALG)\nAlamo doesn\u2019t excite us. Its underwhelming revenue growth and failure to generate meaningful free cash flow is a concerning trend.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Alamo Will Underperform\nExpanding its markets through acquisitions since its founding, Alamo (NSYE:ALG) designs, manufactures, and services vegetation management and infrastructure maintenance equipment for governmental, industrial, and agricultural use.\n- Estimated sales growth of 5.1% for the next 12 months is soft and implies weaker demand\n- High input costs result in an inferior gross margin of 25.6% that must be offset through higher volumes\n- A positive is that its incremental sales over the last five years have been more profitable as its earnings per share increased by 13.9% annually, topping its revenue gains\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Alamo\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Alamo\nAt $221.65 per share, Alamo trades at 19x forward P/E. Alamo\u2019s valuation may seem like a bargain, especially when stacked up against other industrials companies. We remind you that you often get what you pay for, though.\nCheap stocks can look like great bargains at first glance, but you often get what you pay for. These mediocre businesses often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Alamo (ALG) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nSpecialized equipment manufacturer for infrastructure and vegetation management Alamo Group (NYSE:ALG) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, but sales were flat year on year at $419.1 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.57 per share was 5.2% below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAlamo (ALG) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $419.1 million vs analyst estimates of $409.5 million (flat year on year, 2.4% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $2.57 vs analyst expectations of $2.71 (5.2% miss)\n- Operating Margin: 11.2%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Backlog: $687.2 million at quarter end\n- Market Capitalization: $2.72 billion\nCompany Overview\nExpanding its markets through acquisitions since its founding, Alamo (NSYE:ALG) designs, manufactures, and services vegetation management and infrastructure maintenance equipment for governmental, industrial, and agricultural use.\nFounded in 1969, the company has operations across North America, Europe, and Australia. Alamo Group's product portfolio includes equipment such as mowers, excavators, vacuum trucks, street sweepers, snow removal equipment, and forestry and tree care machinery.\nAlamo operates through two primary segments: the Vegetation Management Division and the Industrial Equipment Division. The Vegetation Management Division includes products for agricultural, governmental, and commercial markets, while the Industrial Equipment Division concentrates on specialized trucks and heavy equipment for infrastructure maintenance and construction applications.\nThe company sells its products through a network of independent dealers, distributors, and directly to end-users in some cases. A significant portion of Alamo's sales comes from governmental agencies and related contractors, particularly for infrastructure maintenance equipment.\nAlamo has historically grown via M&A, and one notable acquisition in recent years includes Royal Truck & Equipment, a manufacturer of truck-mounted highway attenuator trucks and other specialty vehicles for traffic control and highway safety. This acquisition expanded its presence in the highway safety equipment market. The company also acquired Morbark, which significantly strengthened its position in the forestry and tree care equipment markets.\n4. Agricultural Machinery\nAgricultural machinery companies are investing to develop and produce more precise machinery, automated systems, and connected equipment that collects analyzable data to help farmers and other customers improve yields and increase efficiency. On the other hand, agriculture is seasonal and natural disasters or bad weather can impact the entire industry. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as commodity prices or changes in interest rates\u2013which dictate the willingness of these companies or their customers to invest\u2013can impact demand for agricultural machinery.\nAlamo\u2019s peers and competitors include Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) and AGCO (NYSE:AGCO)\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Alamo grew its sales at a mediocre 6.7% compounded annual growth rate. This fell short of our benchmark for the industrials sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Alamo\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years. We also note many other Agricultural Machinery businesses have faced declining sales because of cyclical headwinds. While Alamo\u2019s growth wasn\u2019t the best, it did do better than its peers.\nThis quarter, Alamo\u2019s $419.1 million of revenue was flat year on year but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.4%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5.1% over the next 12 months. While this projection indicates its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nAlamo has bad unit economics for an industrials company, giving it less room to reinvest and develop new offerings. As you can see below, it averaged a 25.6% gross margin over the last five years. Said differently, Alamo had to pay a chunky $74.36 to its suppliers for every $100 in revenue.\nIn Q2, Alamo produced a 25.8% gross profit margin, in line with the same quarter last year. Zooming out, Alamo\u2019s full-year margin has been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 1.1 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest a more competitive environment with some pressure to lower prices and higher input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses).\n7. Operating Margin\nAlamo has managed its cost base well over the last five years. It demonstrated solid profitability for an industrials business, producing an average operating margin of 10.2%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it\u2019s a show of well-managed operations if they\u2019re high when gross margins are low.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Alamo\u2019s operating margin rose by 1.6 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage.\nThis quarter, Alamo generated an operating margin profit margin of 11.2%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s cost structure has recently been stable.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAlamo\u2019s EPS grew at a remarkable 13.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 6.7% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nWe can take a deeper look into Alamo\u2019s earnings quality to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Alamo\u2019s operating margin was flat this quarter but expanded by 1.6 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its higher earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.\nFor Alamo, its two-year annual EPS declines of 2.1% mark a reversal from its (seemingly) healthy five-year trend. We hope Alamo can return to earnings growth in the future.\nIn Q2, Alamo reported adjusted EPS at $2.57, up from $2.35 in the same quarter last year. Despite growing year on year, this print missed analysts\u2019 estimates, but we care more about long-term adjusted EPS growth than short-term movements. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Alamo\u2019s full-year EPS of $9.98 to grow 16.7%.\n9. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nAlamo has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 5.8%, subpar for an industrials business.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that Alamo\u2019s margin expanded by 2.3 percentage points during that time. We have no doubt shareholders would like to continue seeing its cash conversion rise as it gives the company more optionality.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlamo\u2019s management team makes decent investment decisions and generates value for shareholders. Its five-year average ROIC was 11.7%, slightly better than typical industrials business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. On average, Alamo\u2019s ROIC increased by 2.7 percentage points annually over the last few years. This is a good sign, and we hope the company can keep improving.\n11. Key Takeaways from Alamo\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Alamo beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed. Overall, this was a mixed quarter. The stock remained flat at $224.77 immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Alamo?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 10:57 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Alamo.\nAlamo isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. First off, its revenue growth was mediocre over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while Alamo\u2019s projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, its gross margins are lower than its industrials peers.\nAlamo\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 19.5x. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $244.25 on the company (compared to the current share price of $227.01)."

      "text": "Deere (DE)\nWe\u2019re wary of Deere. Its revenue growth has been weak and its profitability has caved, showing it\u2019s struggling to adapt.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Deere Will Underperform\nRevolutionizing agriculture with the first self-polishing cast-steel plow in the 1800s, Deere (NYSE:DE) manufactures and distributes advanced agricultural, construction, forestry, and turf care equipment.\n- Scale is a double-edged sword because it limits the company\u2019s growth potential compared to its smaller competitors, as reflected in its below-average annual revenue increases of 3.6% for the last five years\n- 6\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio shows it\u2019s overleveraged and increases the probability of shareholder dilution if things turn unexpectedly\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Deere\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Deere\nDeere is trading at $507.37 per share, or 25.9x forward P/E. Not only does Deere trade at a premium to companies in the industrials space, but this multiple is also high for its top-line growth.\nWe prefer to invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with superior earnings growth.\n3. Deere (DE) Research Report: Q1 CY2025 Update\nAgricultural and construction machinery company Deere (NYSE:DE) announced better-than-expected revenue in Q1 CY2025, but sales fell by 6.2% year on year to $12.76 billion. Its GAAP profit of $6.64 per share was 17.8% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nDeere (DE) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $12.76 billion vs analyst estimates of $12.37 billion (6.2% year-on-year decline, 3.2% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): $6.64 vs analyst estimates of $5.64 (17.8% beat)\n- 2025 guidance: Production & Precision, Construction & Forestry, Financial Services unchanged, Small Ag & Turf now down 10-15% vs down 10% previously\n- Operating Margin: 26.7%, up from 22.8% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 11.7%, up from 10% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $135 billion\nCompany Overview\nRevolutionizing agriculture with the first self-polishing cast-steel plow in the 1800s, Deere (NYSE:DE) manufactures and distributes advanced agricultural, construction, forestry, and turf care equipment.\nIt may have been started by a blacksmith who focused on simple tools, but the company has come a long way since its humble beginnings. Deere\u2019s product portfolio now includes tractors, combines, planters, loaders, excavators, and precision agriculture technologies. More recently, Deere has invested in autonomous machinery to capitalize on digitization trends.\nDeere serves all types of farmers and field workers, including construction contractors, government entities, and individual landowners. The company also provides comprehensive aftermarket support services like machinery upgrades and components that increase customer retention.\nDeere's revenue largely stems from sales of its heavy equipment. There may be list prices, but longtime customers who purchase in higher volumes can receive discounts. The company also makes money from aftermarket parts and support services that smooth out its topline because while an economic cycle may dampen demand for excavators, for example, the existing Deere excavators out there will still need to be maintained and repaired.\n4. Agricultural Machinery\nAgricultural machinery companies are investing to develop and produce more precise machinery, automated systems, and connected equipment that collects analyzable data to help farmers and other customers improve yields and increase efficiency. On the other hand, agriculture is seasonal and natural disasters or bad weather can impact the entire industry. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as commodity prices or changes in interest rates\u2013which dictate the willingness of these companies or their customers to invest\u2013can impact demand for agricultural machinery.\nDeere\u2019s peers and competitors include Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Eaton (NYSE:ETN), and AGCO (NYSE:AGCO).\n5. Sales Growth\nExamining a company\u2019s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Regrettably, Deere\u2019s sales grew at a tepid 4.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the industrials sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Deere\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 10.6% annually.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Production & Precision Agriculture , Construction & Forestry , and Small Agriculture & Turf, which are 41%, 23.1%, and 23.5% of revenue. Over the last two years, Deere\u2019s revenues in all three segments declined. Its Production & Precision Agriculture revenue (tractors, harvesters, tillage) averaged year-on-year decreases of 36.7% while its Construction & Forestry (loaders, excavators, dump trucks) and Small Agriculture & Turf (mowers and other small vehicles) revenues averaged drops of 10.6% and 16.2%.\nThis quarter, Deere\u2019s revenue fell by 6.2% year on year to $12.76 billion but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 3.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.5% over the next 12 months. While this projection indicates its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\n6. Operating Margin\nDeere has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for an industrials business, boasting an average operating margin of 20.4%. This result was particularly impressive because of its low gross margin, which is mostly a factor of what it sells and takes huge shifts to move meaningfully. Companies have more control over their operating margins, and it\u2019s a show of well-managed operations if they\u2019re high when gross margins are low.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Deere\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last five years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\nIn Q1, Deere generated an operating profit margin of 26.7%, up 3.9 percentage points year on year. Since its gross margin expanded more than its operating margin, we can infer that leverage on its cost of sales was the primary driver behind the recently higher efficiency.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nDeere\u2019s EPS grew at an astounding 18.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 4.8% annualized revenue growth. However, this alone doesn\u2019t tell us much about its business quality because its operating margin didn\u2019t expand.\nDiving into the nuances of Deere\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. A five-year view shows that Deere has repurchased its stock, shrinking its share count by 14%. This tells us its EPS outperformed its revenue not because of increased operational efficiency but financial engineering, as buybacks boost per share earnings.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business.\nFor Deere, its two-year annual EPS declines of 16.7% mark a reversal from its (seemingly) healthy five-year trend. We hope Deere can return to earnings growth in the future.\nIn Q1, Deere reported EPS at $6.64, down from $8.53 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Deere\u2019s full-year EPS of $20.67 to shrink by 5.2%.\n8. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nDeere has shown terrific cash profitability, putting it in an advantageous position to invest in new products, return capital to investors, and consolidate the market during industry downturns. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the industrials sector, averaging 13.4% over the last five years.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Deere\u2019s margin dropped by 5.7 percentage points during that time. If its declines continue, it could signal increasing investment needs and capital intensity.\nDeere\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $1.50 billion in Q1, equivalent to a 11.7% margin. This result was good as its margin was 1.8 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to temporary swings. Long-term trends are more important.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough Deere hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately, it found a few growth initiatives in the past that worked out wonderfully. Its five-year average ROIC was 31.3%, splendid for an industrials business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Deere\u2019s ROIC averaged 2.7 percentage point decreases over the last few years. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n10. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nDeere\u2019s $66.32 billion of debt exceeds the $9.26 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 6\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $9.03 billion over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged.\nAt this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company\u2019s rating if profitability falls. Deere could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly \u2013 a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies.\nWe hope Deere can improve its balance sheet and remain cautious until it increases its profitability or pays down its debt.\n11. Key Takeaways from Deere\u2019s Q1 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Deere beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. The company's 2025 guidance largely remained unchanged, although Small Ag & Turf is expected to be a little worse than previously thought. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock traded up 1.2% to $503.10 immediately following the results.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Deere?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 11:26 PM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Deere or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nDeere\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. To kick things off, its revenue growth was weak over the last five years. And while its impressive operating margins show it has a highly efficient business model, the downside is its projected EPS for the next year is lacking. On top of that, its cash profitability fell over the last five years.\nDeere\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 25.8x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think there are better opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $543.65 on the company (compared to the current share price of $506.10)."
