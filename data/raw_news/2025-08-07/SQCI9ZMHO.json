  "title": "Chris Cuomo mocked for response after falling for deepfake AOC video",
  "description": "Cuomo also used the moment to attack Ocasio-Cortez over Hamas and defend himself in a NewsNation segment",
  "content": "The US television host Chris Cuomo has been pilloried for falling for a clearly marked parody AI video of the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nOn Wednesday Cuomo, a host on NewsNation and formerly of CNN, took to Instagram to share a video that was prominently watermarked as a \u201cdeepfake\u201d video, made using AI technology. It depicted a fake Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arguing on the floor of Congress that a recent Sydney Sweeney ad, which advertised her \u201cgreat jeans\u201d, was racist.\n\nCuomo retorted under the video: \u201cNothing about hamas or people burning jews cars. But sweeney jeans ad? Deserved time on floor of congress? What happd to this party? Fight for small business \u2026 not for small culture wars.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez responded to the post, stating: \u201cthis is a deepfake dude. Please use your critical thinking skills. At this point you\u2019re just reposting Facebook memes and calling it journalism.\u201d\n\nCuomo then deleted the post, but in response to Ocasio-Cortez on social media he doubled down on his criticism of her, writing: \u201cyou are correct...that was a deepfake (but it really does sound like you). Thank you for correcting. But now to the central claim: show me you calling on hamas to surrender or addressing the bombing of a car in st louis belonging to the idf american soldier?...dude?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to assume you were trying to reply to me and burped this tweet into the ether instead,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez responded. \u201cYou seem to struggle with knowing how to write an apology. Do you need help? Maybe you should call someone.\u201d\n\nCuomo took his non-apology tour to NewsNation, stating in a post: \u201cI was wrong...but what is right?\u201d\n\nLater, on air, he protested: \u201cShe ignored the part of the tweet that mattered.\u201d\n\nAnd followed up yet again by complaining about Ocasio-Cortez: \u201cCorrecting a mistake is simple...explaining why you dont call on terrorists to surrender is as well.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s blunder and unapologetic follow-up was roundly mocked online. His fellow television personality Piers Morgan posted: \u201coh dear Chris Cuomo \u2013 perhaps spend less time bitching about me and more time trying to spot obvious fakes.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez endorsed and has continued to publicly back Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. Mamdani defeated Cuomo\u2019s brother, Andrew Cuomo, in the Democratic primary, and will face him again in November, with Cuomo now on the ballot as an independent.\n\nChris Cuomo was fired by CNN in 2021 after CNN discovered new information about his involvement in aiding his brother\u2019s defense to sexual harassment allegations.",

      "text": "CNN said Saturday that anchor Chris Cuomo has been \u201cterminated\u201d by the network, \u201ceffective immediately.\u201d\nThe announcement came after an outside law firm was retained to review information about exactly how Cuomo aided his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, when the then-governor was accused of sexual harassment.\nCNN suspended Cuomo \u201cindefinitely\u201d on Tuesday. The law firm retained by the network submitted its findings on Friday, according to a source with knowledge of the matter, and CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker fired Cuomo on Saturday.\nThe producers and other staffers who work on \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d will remain in place. Michael Smerconish, Cuomo\u2019s regular substitute, will host the 9 p.m. Eastern hour next week.\nCNN said in a statement: \u201cChris Cuomo was suspended earlier this week pending further evaluation of new information that came to light about his involvement with his brother\u2019s defense. We retained a respected law firm to conduct the review, and have terminated him, effective immediately.\u201d\n\u201cWhile in the process of that review, additional information has come to light,\u201d CNN\u2019s statement added. \u201cDespite the termination, we will investigate as appropriate.\u201d\nIn a statement of his own Saturday, Chris Cuomo said, \u201cThis is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother. So let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did as CNN\u2019s #1 show in the most competitive time slot. I owe them all and will miss that group of special people who did really important work.\u201d\nA few hours after CNN\u2019s announcement, the New York Times reported that a lawyer, Debra Katz, had on Wednesday told CNN of an allegation of sexual misconduct made against Chris Cuomo by a client of hers. According to the Times, the client is \u201ca former junior colleague [of Cuomo\u2019s] at another network.\u201d\nKatz did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did a spokesperson for Cuomo, though the spokesperson did comment to the Times, saying, \u201cThese apparently anonymous allegations are not true.\u201d\nA CNN spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cBased on the report we received regarding Chris\u2019s conduct with his brother\u2019s defense, we had cause to terminate. When new allegations came to us this week, we took them seriously, and saw no reason to delay taking immediate action.\u201d\nWhile the contours of Chris Cuomo\u2019s involvement with the governor\u2019s office were reported several months ago, the specifics were detailed in a massive document dump on Monday. The documents \u2013 released by New York Attorney General Letitia James after an investigation into the governor \u2013 showed that Chris Cuomo, while working as one of CNN\u2019s top anchors, was also effectively working as an unpaid aide to the governor.\nThe cozy and improper nature of the relationship was conveyed through text messages obtained by James\u2019 office. The texts between the anchor and several aides and allies of the governor revealed that Chris Cuomo sought to use his connections in the press to help prepare Andrew Cuomo\u2019s team as accusers started to make their stories public.\nOn the day his brother resigned, back in August, Chris Cuomo told viewers that \u201cthis situation is unlike anything I could have imagined.\u201d\nHe pointed out that he never reported on the sexual harassment scandal or tried to interfere in CNN\u2019s coverage. And he acknowledged that he \u201ctried to be there for my brother\u201d when the scandal erupted.\n\u201cI\u2019m not an adviser. I\u2019m a brother. I wasn\u2019t in control of anything. I was there to listen and offer my take,\u201d he said.\nCNN management showed support for Cuomo, and \u201cCuomo Prime Time,\u201d often the network\u2019s highest-rated show, stayed on the air throughout the controversy.\nBut as \u201cReliable Sources\u201d reported at the time, some CNN staffers were angry at Cuomo and his violations of journalistic norms.\nThe dissent only intensified after James\u2019 office released the text messages, sworn testimony and other raw materials from her investigation into the ex-governor.\nWhen the documents were released on Monday, CNN management said the \u201cthousands of pages of additional transcripts and exhibits\u201d would be reviewed \u201cover the next several days.\u201d\nThen on Tuesday evening, CNN indicated that the contents were serious enough to merit a suspension.\n\u201cWhen Chris admitted to us that he had offered advice to his brother\u2019s staff, he broke our rules and we acknowledged that publicly,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cBut we also appreciated the unique position he was in and understood his need to put family first and job second.\u201d\n\u201cHowever,\u201d the network said, \u201cthese documents point to a greater level of involvement in his brother\u2019s efforts than we previously knew. As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation.\u201d\nCuomo initially declined to comment. He said on his radio show on Wednesday that the suspension was \u201cembarrassing\u201d but understandable. He also said he never wanted to \u201ccompromise any of my colleagues\u201d and said he would respect the process.\nAccording to Saturday\u2019s announcement, the process included an outside law firm, a fact that was not previously known.\nWith information in the texts and documents pointing to a serious breach of CNN standards, Cuomo was notified of his termination on Saturday."

      "text": "NewsNation host Chris Cuomo made a grudging on-air apology to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after the pair were involved in an online spat over a deepfake video.\nOn Wednesday, Cuomo was duped by a fake video which suggested the New York congresswoman was calling out the divisive Sydney Sweeney jeans ad as \u201cblatant Nazi propaganda\u201d during a speech on the floor of Congress.\nPhrases like \u201cwatching that sultry little temptress squeeze into a Canadian tuxedo\u201d and \u201cbouncy little funbags,\u201d as well as the word \u201cf---\u201d meant it was quickly identified as AI-generated by online viewers.\nBut not by Cuomo, who posted on his X account: \u201cNothing about Hamas or people burning jews cars...but Sweeney jeans ad? Deserved time on floor of congress? What happened to this party? Fight for small business...not for small culture wars.\u201d\nHe has since deleted the X post, which had the AI video embedded with it, but not before Ocasio-Cortez replied, \u201cThis is a deepfake dude. Please use your critical thinking skills. At this point you\u2019re just reposting Facebook memes and calling it journalism.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez has been a vocal critic of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, and last month received death threats after she voted against an amendment that would have cut funding for Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defense system.\nAs the back-and-forth continued on X, Cuomo doubled down despite falling for the fake video. As well as prodding AOC to make a comment on Hamas, he said, \u201cYou are correct... that was a deepfake (but it really does sound like you). Thank you for correcting.\u201d\nAOC clapped back, \u201cI\u2019m going to assume you were trying to reply to me and burped this tweet into the ether instead. You seem to struggle with knowing how to write an apology. Do you need help? Maybe you should call someone.\u201d\nThe online tit-for-tat continued when Cuomo posted on X, \u201cBurped? You can do better... you are a new yorker! I am sorry I didn\u2019t listen to the whole clip...obviously wrong. I do struggle...to understand why you won\u2019t tell hamas to surrender...you have ducked it repeatedly ... do you apologize for that? Far more worthy of reply - and offensive - than an errant tweet, no?\u201d\nTalking on NewsNation on Wednesday night, Cuomo revisited the exchange as he took his apology to TV.\n\u201cYou listening? I was wrong,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI was tweeting today and saw a clip of AOC saying that Sydney Sweeney ad was racist. And so I replied to it, and I said, \u2018Why do you care about this and ignore what matters most? Why in all the times that you\u2019ve called on Israel to stop why have you never told Hamas to stop? Told Hamas to surrender? Why would you ignore the St. Louis attack on that Jewish guy who had his car bombed?\u2019\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cAOC tweeted back and said, \u2018Dude, that\u2019s a deepfake, that Sydney Sweeney ad. You suck,\u2019 in so many words. And she was right. They got me. AI. It was really good, and it did seem like something she would say, but it wasn\u2019t her. So I thanked AOC for correcting me.\u201c\nBut he added: \u201cWhy did AOC\u2014the most popular Democrat in the country, reportedly\u2014ignore what I asked about calling on Hamas to surrender to end the war they started? She also ignored my question about saying nothing about the American IDF soldier who returned home only to have his car fire-bombed in America by antisemites. Why? Why wouldn\u2019t you say anything about that?\u201d\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office for comment.\nCuomo\u2019s comments came after AOC posted on X earlier on Wednesday that his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u201cwas backed by Trump\u2019s orbit. That\u2019s why he lost the [NYC mayoral] primary.\u201d\nShe then called on Democrat leaders to unite behind Zohran Mamdani, the progressive who beat longtime frontrunner Cuomo in the Democratic primary, saying: \u201cIf they don\u2019t now, how can they call for party unity later? We must lead by example. Let\u2019s win together.\u201d"
