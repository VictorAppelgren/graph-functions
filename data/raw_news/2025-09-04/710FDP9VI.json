  "description": "\"Are you going to get me in jail?\" the 5-year-old boy asked police officers as they led him to their patrol car.",
  "content": "Police in Jacksonville, Florida, turned up at a family's door earlier this summer to break some unexpected news: their 5-year-old had wandered off to Chick-fil-A by himself.\n\nChick-fil-A employees at a restaurant on San Jose Boulevard in Jacksonville called police after finding the boy, 5-year-old William, around 7 a.m. on June 24, according to a Sept. 3 news release from the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO).\n\n\"You get that knot in your stomach because you know somebody else who's a parent is missing their child,\" Ryan Perri, a police officer with JSO District 3 who responded to the call, said in a video shared by the department.\n\nAfter traversing nearby neighborhoods with William in their patrol car, officers found the boy's home and awoke his parents to the news.\n\n\"You could just see the look on his face. It would be for any parent, including myself, it's disbelief,\" Perri said.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Chick-fil-A for comment.\n\nWatch the video at the top of this story.\n\n'Are you going to get me in jail?' 5-year-old asks police\n\nIn body camera footage from the incident shared by JSO, 5-year-old William is seen sitting at a booth inside the restaurant donning bare feet and a red sweater.\n\n\"As we walked in, we see a little kid sitting at a table eating his breakfast with one of the managers,\" Bryan Kelly, a police officer with JSO District 3 who responded alongside Perri, said in the video. \"We asked where he came from, and he kept saying he walked to Chick-fil-A.\"\n\n\"Are you going to get me in jail?\" William asked the officers as they led the boy out to their patrol car.\n\nWhile William didn't know his address, he did tell officers that he lived on a nearby street in a home with a white fence outside. Once they found the home, Perri and Kelly climbed over the fence to bring the boy back to his parents.\n\n\"My initial thoughts were, I can't believe he came out of here,\" Perri said. \"It's the most secure house on that block in reference to having a fence all the way around, front, back, sides.\"\n\n'It's kind of scary,' parents say after son walks to Chick-fil-A alone\n\nWilliam's parents, identified by their first names Phil and Victoria, appeared surprised in body camera footage when police broke the news of their son's morning adventure.\n\n\"He was down at the Chick-fil-A,\" Perri said, to which Phil responded, \"Are you kidding me?\"\n\nVictoria, William's mother, told police she believed he unlocked the front door of the house. He knew the route to Chick-fil-A because the family has walked to the restaurant before, she said.\n\n\"He said he opened the gate and couldn't find you all and went down the street,\" Kelly told the parents.\n\n\"It's kind of scary, actually, because we didn't realize what was going on until after we came out,\" Victoria said in an interview at the restaurant after the incident.\n\nChristian Hancock, senior media relations manager for JSO, told USA TODAY that the police report from the incident indicated that the family was asleep when William left the house.\n\n\"I think it did shake him up some, so I don't think we really needed to, you know, impress too much that he shouldn't do it again, things like that,\" Phil, the boy's father, said in an interview afterwards. \"I think he understood that it was serious, but we did talk about it.\"\n\nOfficials said they are using the incident as an example for other parents.\n\n\"To be clear: William\u2019s parents are not in any trouble. They had several safety measures in place,\" JSO said in the news release. \"But this is a good reminder to teach kids their home address, parents\u2019 names, and a phone number. It could make a big difference in an emergency.\"\n\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY. She can be reached at melina.khan@usatoday.com.",

      "text": "'Chuck E.'s a little bit busy, ma'am': Bodycam footage shows arrest of mascot\n\"Would y'all put Mickey Mouse in handcuffs\"? one distraught mother at the Chuck E. Cheese asked the police officers.\nThe confusion and anger of children and their parents at a Chuck E. Cheese in Tallahassee, Florida has gone viral in newly-released bodycam footage of a mascot being escorted out of the location in handcuffs.\nIn a video released by the Tallahassee Police Department, a Chuck E. Cheese mascot is approached by two police officers who handcuff the man in his costume, inside of the restaurant-arcade and escort him out to a police car, where they begin to question him. Children in the video are heard saying, \"Oh no!,\" standing by in confusion.\nBefore exiting the location, a distraught mother told the officers they may have \"traumatized\" the children in the restaurant-arcade. \"Would y'all put Mickey Mouse in handcuffs?\" she continued.\nJermel Jarreau Jones, 41, was arrested at the Tallahassee Chuck E. Cheese on July 23 after officers responded to a call from a woman named Michelle Allen, who alleged she had video proof of Jones using a stolen credit card, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by USA TODAY. Allen said she was at the Chuck E. Cheese to confront Jones.\nBodycam footage shows Chuck E. Cheese arrest\nWhy was the Chuck E. Cheese mascot arrested?\nAllen told police, who met her in the parking lot of the Chuck E. Cheese, that the last time she used her credit card was on June 28 when she attended her child\u2019s birthday party, according to the affidavit. After the party, she noticed around $105 worth of fraudulent charges on her card from businesses she had never shopped at.\nWhen Allen obtained security footage from a local grocery store, she identified the man using her card in the business as a Chuck E. Cheese employee, according to the document. Once Allen told police she wanted to press charges against Jones, officers entered the Chuck E. Cheese and located him after another employee said, \"He was the one in the mouse suit.\"\nWhat happens in the arrest video?\nThe video released by the Tallahassee Police Department features the bodycam footage from the two officers at the scene. In the second part of the video, viewers can hear one of the officers say, \"Chuck E.'s a little busy, ma'am\" to a woman with a few kids interacting with the mascot.\nWhen officers approached Jones, one of them grabbed his right arm and told him, \"Chuck E, come with me Chuck E,\" the affidavit stated. During this interaction, Jones pulled away from the officer's grip and allegedly \"continued resisting by bracing his arms toward his chest and would not release his braced arms.\"\nThe arresting officer asked Jones \"Not to make a scene.\" At that point, he was placed in handcuffs and escorted out of the business to the officer's patrol car.\nWhile speaking with officers, Jones told them, \"The only cards I use is my own Cash App,\" the affidavit stated. He continued to deny using the woman's card, including when questioned about purchases at a meat market and a smoke shop, the arresting document continued.\n\"I don\u2019t got no card on me. I don\u2019t use nobody\u2019s card but my own,\" Jones told officers, per the affidavit. If he did find a card, Jones told the officers he would have \"turned it in to Chuck E. Cheese and not kept it.\"\nWhat was the Chuck E. Cheese employee charged with?\nJones was charged with three felonies, including theft of credit card, criminal use of personal identification information and fraudulent use of a credit card more than two times within six months, according to Leon County court records.\nHe was taken into custody and booked at Leon County Jail, but he has already been released on bond, the Tallahassee Democrat, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\nThe felonies Jones were charged with are not his only criminal charges in Leon County. Since 2004, he's been charged with petit theft (low-value theft), possession of marijuana and cocaine, trespassing and indecent exposure in public, according to court documents.\n\"I am quite frankly shocked that a man with this many theft, drug and an indecent exposure arrests was hired by (Chuck E. Cheese) and allowed to be around young children on regular basis,\" the Allen's layer, Paul Aloise, said in an email statement to USA TODAY. \"While I certainly hate what happened to my client, Ms. Allen, I am truly grateful no children were harmed by Mr. Jones.\"\nWhat did Chuck E. Cheese say?\n\"We are aware of an incident involving a part-time employee arrested at our Tallahassee location on Wednesday, July 23,\" Chuck E. Cheese representative Allison Chouinard said in an email statement to USA TODAY. \"We have taken the appropriate action concerning the subject employee.\"\nUSA TODAY was unable to reach Jones' lawyer.\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Video captures 'exciting' tussle as elks clash antlers in Yellowstone\nA pair of bull elks engaged in an antler-off at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park as mating season is underway.\nVideo footage recorded by Cindy Shaffer shows the two animals clashing with their antlers, shoving and twisting as they battle for dominance on Sept. 2.\nShaffer told USA TODAY on Sept. 3 she was taking a little nap when she \"heard the sound of a bull elk bugling very loudly right outside my window.\"\n\"I jumped up quickly to look, and he was running through the sagebrush,\" Shaffer said.\nWatch bull elks engage in an antler-off\nShaffer said she knew the area's dominant male marked as \"#24\" was down at the other end of the village, and understood where the elk bugling outside her window was headed. The resident said she immediately jumped into her car and \"got to the other end of the village just in time to catch\" the action.\n'Super cool'\n\"It is mating season here at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park and this is the type of behavior we will see almost daily for several weeks,\" Shaffer said. Elk mating season occurs during the months of September and October, according to National Park Service, with single calves born May to late June.\nShaffer described her experience of watching the two elks spar as \"very exciting\" and \"super cool.\"\nElk #24 won the round, Shaffer said, adding \"he has been the dominant male in this area for several years.\" Shaffer, who works at a local hotel, added the other elk had one of his tines broken, which was later picked up by a ranger and is now on display at the Mammoth Visitor Center.\nAntlers of a \"typical, healthy bull are 55\u201360 inches long, just under six feet wide, and weigh about 30 pounds per pair,\" NPS says, adding \"bulls usually settle disputes by wrestling with their antlers\" when antlered.\nShaffer recalled elk #24, marked by a red ear tag, earlier took Christmas lights off a tree in front of the Justice Center with his antlers and walked around with them hanging on his neck. Rangers had to step in and tranquilize the animal to remove the lights, Shaffer said.\nElks at Yellowstone\nYellowstone National Park is home to an estimated 10,000-20,000 elk, according to the National Park Service, making them the most abundant large mammal in the park. Male bulls can weigh around 700 pounds and are approximately five feet high at the shoulder, while females weigh around 500 pounds and are shorter.\nAn important part of the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, elk account for approximately 85% of winter wolf kills and are an important food source for bears, mountain lions and at least 12 scavenger species, including bald eagles and coyotes, NPS says.\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Amazon is tightening restrictions on shared Prime accounts. Here's who is impacted.\nStarting next month, Prime members who want to share shipping perks with other customers must live together at the same primary residential address, a change from the company's previous allowance.\nWith Amazon's previous Prime Invitee Program, customers could only share their shipping benefits, and those benefits could be shared with anyone, regardless of where they live. With Amazon Family, Prime customers can share shipping and digital benefits, but with household members only, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY on Wednesday, Sept. 3.\nThe change is coming at the end of the month. Once the invitee program ends, Prime members who want to share benefits and digital content with family members will have to make them part of their Amazon Family, the company shared online.\nFor those who are impacted by the switch, or those who enrolled in the invitee program between 2009 and 2015, Amazon will offer a limited-time Prime deal, the company confirmed to USA TODAY on Sept. 3. The offer includes 12 months of Prime for $14.99 and will be available until Dec. 31.\nAmazon made the announcement on its customer service website that it is ending its Prime Invitee Program.\nAmazon also sent a notice to customers announcing the change, which quickly made its rounds on social media. When asked why all shoppers didn\u2019t get the notice, an Amazon spokesperson said the notice was sent to customers who registered for the Prime Invitee Program between the program's launch in 2009 and 2015, when the program stopped accepting new members.\nThe company said on its website that with Amazon Family, Prime members can share benefits with one other adult, up to four teens added before April 7, 2025 and up to four children in their household.\n\"Prime members can instead share a broad range of Prime benefits with Amazon Family, including: fast, free delivery; access to exclusive deals and shopping events like Prime Day; movies, series, and live sports with Prime Video; Amazon Music and additional digital entertainment; access to a free Grubhub+ membership; and fuel savings at more than 7,500 bp, Amoco, and participating ampm locations,\" the company said in its statement to USA TODAY.\nThe switch to household-only sharing comes after Amazon reported 5.4 million U.S. sign-ups in the 21 days leading up to Prime Day and the company's four-day sales event in early July. The number of new customers was about 116,000 fewer than the year before, and 106,000 below the company's goal, reported Reuters.\nHere\u2019s what to know about the change.\nWhen will the Prime Invitee Program end?\nAccording to Amazon, the program will end on Oct. 1. That\u2019s when Prime invitees will lose access to Prime delivery.\nWhat are the requirements to share Prime benefits?\nAmazon Prime members who want to share benefits with others must ensure they:\n- Have linked accounts through Amazon Family\n- Share the same primary residential address (the address you consider to be your home and where you spend most of your time)\n- Agree to share payment methods for household verification\n- Have a Buy Now U.S. billing address for Prime Video sharing\nWhat can I do if I lose access to Prime?\nPrime invitees who lose access can ask a Prime member in their household to add them to their Amazon Family, or sign up for their own Prime membership, Amazon said.\nWhat do I get access to with Amazon Family?\nAmazon said on its website that Amazon Family grants customers access to:\n- Free delivery on Prime eligible items\n- Access to exclusive Prime events and deals\n- Prime Video with ads\n- Prime Reading\n- Third-party benefits such as Grubhub\n- Digital content such as audio books, eBooks and games\nPrime members can also share their Amazon Music Prime benefits with one other adult in their Amazon Family, which includes ad-free listening on shuffle mode.\nHow do I sign up for Amazon Family?\nAmazon said in order to sign up for Amazon Family, customers can:\n- Visit your Amazon Prime membership\n- Find the \"Share your Prime Benefits\" section\n- Select \"Manage Your Amazon Family\"\n- Send invitations to Amazon Family members\nAccording to Amazon, Prime members and family members must share payment methods in order to share Prime benefits. Family members can use their own payment methods to make purchases.\nAmazon added that family members can leave and re-join an Amazon Family anytime, but they have to wait 12 months before joining a different Amazon Family.\nWhy is Amazon making this change? Retail expert weighs in\nLauren Beitelspacher, a professor in the marketing division of Babson College in Massachusetts, said Sept. 3 that Amazon likely made the decision to replace the Prime Invitee Program because it's not as profitable as expected, or as it once was.\n\"The program was likely initially introduced as almost a referral program in the hopes that sharing the shipping option would encourage people to sign up for all the Prime offerings,\" she wrote in an email to USA TODAY. \"My guess is that didn\u2019t happen so now Amazon will look to other avenues to recruit new customers.\"\nBeitelspacher said she thinks that getting rid of the Prime Invitee Program likely won't hurt Amazon financially because it's probably already costing the company quite a bit of money. If anything, the company is more likely to get people to sign up for Prime themselves, she said.\nWhen asked if she thinks the added benefits of Amazon Family are enough to get customers to stick around, Beitelspacher said the quick shipping option is \"almost ubiquitous with Amazon.\"\n\"Taking that away from customers might encourage them to join...Prime, but Amazon does run the risk of potentially losing that customer to other companies who have advanced their own shipping capacities,\" she said.\nWhile the program won't impact those who already subscribe to Prime, Beitelspacher said those using the Prime Invitee Program have likely become accustomed to the perks.\n\"Getting used to that 2-day shipping is a hard habit to break,\" Beitelspacher said.\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\nContributing: Betty Lin-Fisher and James Powel, USA TODAY\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.
