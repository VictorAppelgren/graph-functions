  "content": "After Taylor Townsend and her doubles partner, Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1, knocked Venus Williams out of the women\u2019s doubles draw on Tuesday night, the American star credited Williams for getting her into the sport in the first place.\n\nThe 29-year-old told ESPN on the court at Louis Armstrong Stadium after her win over Williams and her doubles partner, Leylah Fernandez, that she had grown up watching the seven-time Grand Slam champion.\n\n\u201cThe earliest memories [of Williams] obviously watching on TV, especially here at the U.S. Open. I remember I loved her back out, Reebok dress, that\u2019s what drew me to tennis,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cIt was the cute outfits, it wasn\u2019t the tennis, it was the cute outfits. Growing up watching Venus and Serena had always been, for me and my sister, it was an inspiration and we really wanted to be like them when we grew up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be able to share the court with her today.\u201d\n\nTownsend and Siniakov\u00e1, the top-ranked team, made relatively quick work of Williams and Fernandez during their quarterfinals match, taking down the tennis legend and her 22-year-old partner, 6-1, 6-2.\n\nBoth Townsend and Siniakov\u00e1 joined the New York crowd in giving Williams a loud ovation after the match, pausing and turning toward Williams after shaking hands with the chair ump to applaud her before she walked off the court.\n\nThe loss in the doubles tournament marked the end of Williams\u2019 25th career U.S. Open, with her first coming back in 1997 when she was 17 years old.\n\nThe 45-year-old Williams\u2019 impact on tennis has stretched beyond just the court, with her outfits blending sports and fashion.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s just about what you wear is just a reflection of who you are and being able to express myself on the court,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWhile Williams has impacted pop culture over the years, sometimes, pop culture has been slow to reach the tennis icon.\n\nWilliams told reporters Tuesday that she wasn\u2019t allowed to watch \u201cThe Fresh Prince\u201d until she was 20 because her \u201cdad only let us watch educational programs growing up.\u201d\n\nFittingly enough, Will Smith, who starred in the hit TV show for six seasons in the 1990s, played Williams\u2019 father in the 2021 movie \u201cKing Richard,\u201d which chronicled Venus and Serena Williams\u2019 rise after coaching by their father.\n\n\u201cWill Smith is a legend. The fact that he did such an honor to play my dad, and he took it \u2014 you can\u2019t understand how seriously he took it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe really put his whole life into it, and he got rewarded for it, too. In turn, we all got rewarded for it. I have so much respect for him.\u201d",

      "text": "It\u2019s hard to call Venus Williams a Cinderella. But her storybook doubles run at the U.S. Open ended Tuesday.\nDid her career at the top level end with it?\nWilliams and Leylah Fernandez were beaten in the quarterfinals by the top-seeded duo of Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova 6-1, 6-2.\nBoth Townsend and Siniakova clapped in appreciation of Williams, along with the entire Louis Armstrong crowd. The 45-year-old Williams walked off to a standing ovation, waving to the fans. Was she waving goodbye to her competitive career?\nWhile this run showed she can still do damage in doubles, her preference is to be a singles player. But with her venerable age, and public distaste for long flights, where exactly does that leave her going forward?\n\u201cI think out there Leylah and I, we kept telling each other to be the best singles player we could be. So our focus will always be singles,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to suddenly become a doubles player. I never did. I never will. It\u2019s the singles for me.\u201d\nWilliams is one of the game\u2019s all-time greats, with seven Grand Slam titles in singles, 14 in doubles (with her sister Serena) and two more in mixed doubles. But at 45, she\u2019s not only the second-oldest person to ever play singles in the U.S. Open, but both open about her distaste for traveling and coy about her future.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Williams insisted. \u201cI was so focused on this tournament here. I really felt like we had a chance to really continue to play into the tournament, so I haven\u2019t given that any thought.\n\u201cI do have commitments, places I said I\u2019d be, people expecting me to be there the next few weeks. So I have to go and show up. I\u2019m very serious about my commitments. I would never want to cancel now, so I\u2019ll try to keep those. If there is [an] opportunity for me to play, then hopefully I can get back somewhere this year. I just don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\nTownsend and Siniakova \u2014 aiming for their third Grand Slam final as a duo, and first in Flushing Meadows \u2014 will face fourth-seeded Elise Mertens and Veronika Kudermetova in the semis. But the magnitude of the moment was not lost on them.\n\u201cVenus is a legend,\u201d Townsend said, adding Williams was the inspiration to get her to pick up a racket.\n\u201cThe earliest memory is obviously watching her, especially here at the U.S. Open. I loved her back-out Reebok dress. That\u2019s what drew me to tennis,\u201d Townsend said in an on-court TV interview. \u201cGrowing up watching her and Serena was an inspiration to me and my sister (Symone). It was an honor to share the court with her.\u201d"

I appreciate all the support this tournament and apologize to the fans who were looking forward to the match. I had an amazing time here in NY and can\u2019t wait to be back next year.\u201d\nVondrou\u0161ov\u00e1, 26, winced in pain after a forehand during her afternoon practice session, doubled over in pain and walked gingerly to the sideline.\nAccording to ESPN, she was in tears while her team attended to her courtside.\nSabalenka now moves on to the semifinals, where she\u2019ll face American Jessica Pegula on Thursday in a rematch of the 2024 final.\nFor Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1, it marks the end of a run that saw her take down No. 32-seeded McCartney Kessler in the second round, seventh-seeded Jasmine Paolini in the third and No. 9 Elena Rybakina in the round of 16.\nA former junior World No. 1 who was ranked as high as No. 6 back in 2023, it was a return to form for a player who has struggled with injuries throughout her career.\n\u201cSo Sorry for Marketa after all she\u2019s been through,\u201d Sabalenka posted to her Instagram Story after finding out the news. \u201cShe has been playing amazing tennis and I know how badly this must hurt for her.\n\u201cTake care of yourself and I hope you can recover quickly.\u201d"

      "text": "Czech tennis ace Karol\u00edna Muchov\u00e1 broke down in tears at the US Open last week when she spotted an ex-boyfriend she said \u201cshows up at places where he shouldn\u2019t be\u201d in the stands during her match.\nThe world\u2019s No. 13 player was serving down 1-4 against Sorana C\u00eerstea on Thursday when she suddenly froze, gestured toward the crowd and grabbed a towel to wipe her face. She apologized to the chair umpire for the delay before resuming play through tears.\n\u201cWell \u2026 it wasn\u2019t tennis-related,\u201d Muchov\u00e1 later explained in Czech at her post-match press conference.\n\u201cOpposite my bench, my ex-boyfriend sat down. He sometimes shows up at places where he shouldn\u2019t be. That startled me a bit. I told him to leave, he didn\u2019t, but later he did go. It was hard to focus in that moment,\u201d she said, according to a translation first published by The Athletic.\nDespite the disruption and being visibly shaken, the 28-year-old semifinalist regrouped to win the match.\nTournament rules allow players to block certain individuals from obtaining tickets or credentials, but Muchov\u00e1 has not made such a request.\nTwo days later, after beating fellow Czech Linda Noskov\u00e1, she tried to move on.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m alright. I didn\u2019t make any report, and everything is good,\u201d she told reporters Saturday.\nAsked if she is confident such incidents won\u2019t happen again, Muchov\u00e1 replied, \u201cI mean, who knows, right? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe unsettling scene is the latest in a pattern of women\u2019s tennis players being disrupted by unwanted faces in the crowd.\nAt Wimbledon in July, Britain\u2019s Emma Raducanu burst into tears when she recognized a man who harassed her earlier in Dubai and been issued a restraining order to stay away from her.\nHe was later banned from the All England Club\u2019s ticket ballot. In that match, Raducanu was playing Muchov\u00e1.\nRaducanu later admitted she \u201ccouldn\u2019t see the ball through tears\u201d and \u201ccould barely breathe\u201d after spotting the man mid-match.\nThe USTA said it takes these situations seriously.\n\u201cPlayer safety is a critical element of our planning and execution for the US Open,\u201d a rep said, noting that security teams work with federal and local law enforcement to ensure a safe environment and monitor both in-person and online threats.\nStill, experts say the sport is especially vulnerable.\n\u201cYou put individuality, precociousness, attractiveness and visibility together, and women\u2019s tennis is a perfect storm for fixated individuals,\u201d a former WTA executive told The Athletic.\nThe most infamous troubling moment on the court occurred in 1993, when 19-year-old Monica Seles was stabbed in the back by a deranged fan during a match in Hamburg. Afterward, she never fully returned to the dominance she once had.\nOther stars have faced persistent harassment.\nMartina Hingis, a teenage prodigy, has spoken out about men who followed her from hotel to hotel during the height of her career.\nIn 2011, a man who called himself Serena Williams\u2019 \u201chusband\u201d also was arrested after attempting to gain access to her Florida home, sparking tighter personal security measures for the 23-time Grand Slam champion.\nMuchov\u00e1, a two-time US Open semifinalist, is trying to put her own unsettling episode behind her as she heads into a fourth-round clash with No. 27 seed Marta Kostyuk on Monday."

      "text": "US Olympic legend Greg Louganis sells his medals, home to start a new life abroad: \u2018I needed the money\u2019\nHe is making his boldest leap yet.\nUS Olympic legend Greg Louganis has parted with his California home and three of his cherished Olympic medals to launch a bold new chapter of life abroad.\nThe diving icon, 65, who is widely acclaimed as possibly the greatest diver in history, revealed that he \u201cneeded the money\u201d from his house and medals to be able to start afresh overseas.\nLouganis, who won five Olympic medals between 1976 and 1988, revealed that he had bid adieu to the US and relocated to Panama.\n\u201cSo, as life moves forward, what are you prepared to leave behind?\u201d he wrote on Facebook over the weekend.\n\u201cI am 65 years old, and I am asking just that. I am no longer who I used to think I was. Not even close to \u2018What\u2019 other people or \u2018Who\u2019 other people think I am.\u201d\nThe retired athlete revealed that he sold two gold Olympic medals and one silver medal in an auction \u2014 and the combined $437,000 he made from the sale exceeded all of his expectations.\n\u201cI have auctioned three of my medals, which sold, I believe, because I went against what the \u2018experts\u2019 told me last time when I tried the first time,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI told the truth; I needed the money. While many people may have built businesses and sold them for a profit, I had my medals, which I am grateful for.\u201d\n\u201cThe other consideration is the sale of my house. I am VERY happy with whom I sold it to,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cI thanked and blessed the house to bring joy, love, peace, happiness, and a sense of safety to those who entered the house.\u201d\nIn addition to the medals and his home, Louganis revealed that he sold a lot of his personal belongings after several of his close friends lost their possessions in the deadly Woolsey and Palisades wildfires earlier this year.\n\u201cI know I am choosing to do this, but their resilience is an inspiration for me to start anew, with an open heart and an open door. Opening up to possibilities,\u201d he went on.\n\u201cI realized I often close myself off, shut myself down, and play small for the comfort of others. I don\u2019t think I have realized or given myself credit for what I might be able to accomplish.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said in an earlier post, \u2018I was an instrument of my coach\u2019s, Ron O\u2019Brien\u2019s, creation.\u2019 I was honored, proud, and blessed to have been that for him. It was all achieved with love at the core,\u201d he added.\nLouganis said his new life in Panama will force him to go on a journey of self-discovery.\n\u201cNow I get to discover who is Greg Louganis? Without the distraction and noise from outside. At least this is my goal, and hey, I may not find that.\u201d\n\u201cI think I may find it at times, in moments, my goal is to live it! Discover, allow, and nurture that human spirit through the experiences of life,\u201d he added.\nThe diving legend\u2019s career spanned across three Olympic Games: Montreal in 1976, Los Angeles in 1984 and Seoul in 1988.\nThe athlete racked up a total of five Olympic medals throughout his glittering career, including four gold medals and one silver.\nLouganis is the only man to win consecutive Olympic titles in springboard and platform diving \u2014 in 1984 and 1988.\nAfter retiring from the sport, Louganis tried his hand at acting, motivational speaking and offered up sports commentary.\nAfter his diving career ended, Louganis revealed he was gay in 1994 and announced he was HIV-positive a year later."
