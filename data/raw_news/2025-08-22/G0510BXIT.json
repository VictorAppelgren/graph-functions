  "title": "How Empathy-Driven Leadership Builds Lasting Teams",
  "description": "Investing in your employees is as important as investing in your customers\u2014and directly impacts your company's long-term success.",
  "content": "Mark is the CEO of TenantCloud and CEO/Cofounder of Rentler. He enjoys all things property management and exploring Utah with his family.\n\nIn business, obsessing over retention rates is second nature. You track numbers like net revenue retention (NRR), churn and lifetime value to make sure customer loyalty is trending upward. You want long-term customers because they increase revenue, brand trust and opportunities for feedback.\n\nBut what about internal retention\u2014the rate at which your employees stick around? What if you approached keeping your people with the same effort and discipline applied to retaining your customers?\n\nYou'd likely find that investing in your people is nearly identical to investing in your customers\u2014and it's just as important for your long-term success. Not only does employee retention help you cut down on expensive recruiting costs, but it also creates a more stable work environment. This, in turn, fosters stronger relationships, increases job satisfaction and boosts productivity.\n\nSo, how do you build a workplace people actually want to be part of? One simple word: empathy.\n\nLeaders who practice empathy (more than just the old \"put yourself in their shoes\" adage) create an environment where people feel understood. It's no surprise that when employees are emotionally supported, they\u2019re more likely to stick around.\n\nWhy Talented People Leave (It's Not What You Think)\n\nThe number one reason employees quit\u2014contrary to popular belief\u2014is not due to pay. According to the latest research, people are more likely to leave a job when they don't have a clear career path.\n\nWhen employees no longer find meaning in their work, they often feel like they're spinning their wheels. This leads to a drop in efficiency, job happiness and, eventually, participation. This type of behavior mirrors that of a dissatisfied customer. They lose interest, find a new opportunity and part ways.\n\nIf you want to keep your people engaged, ask yourself: Do they feel heard? Do they see a clear path in front of them? Do they believe their work here matters?\n\nPart of leading with empathy is letting go of control. Today's employees don\u2019t want to be micromanaged; they want autonomy. Trust that you're hiring top performers and help them get there.\n\nEmpathy-driven leadership means knowing what motivates each person and giving them the tools to do their best work. It goes without saying, but treat your employees like humans. When your people feel like partners and not cogs in a machine, they\u2019re more likely to be invested\u2014and less likely to walk away.\n\nTip: Schedule regular check-ins with your employees and let them lead the conversation. You'll never know how they feel about their role unless you ask.\n\nAll too often, companies confuse perks with culture. Ping-pong tables and summer Fridays are nice, but they don't build loyalty. Having a culture of empathy does. It all boils down to your principles and the way you infuse them into your work environment. What do you stand for? How do you reward your employees? What behaviors do you reward? What do you tolerate versus what do you expect your employees to tolerate?\n\nThese are the signals your employees pay attention to. They guide everything from your small, day-to-day interactions to how you navigate difficult situations.\n\nIn my company, we\u2019ve learned that a great culture isn\u2019t based on having the best snacks or the coolest swag (although those can be good too). We've created a communal space where everyone has a seat at the table. Our culture is one where there are no bad ideas, where people can be themselves, where they grow and the company grows with them. Nearly half of our team has been with us for five-plus years\u2014a rare level of retention in SaaS that reflects our strong culture and loyalty. Even more telling, over 10% of our team has been with us for more than a decade.\n\nMeasure Internal Retention The Way You Measure NRR\n\nSince we\u2019re tracking NRR and churn for our customers, how can we apply this to our employees?\n\nStart tracking your company's internal health with the same rigor you would for customers. Look at tenure, internal mobility, engagement, team-by-team turnover and even post-exit interviews. Who on your team is growing? Who seems to be burning out? Which departments are thriving, and which ones need attention?\n\nOnce you have that data, look for trends in when and why people are leaving. Are certain teams or managers seeing more turnover? Dig into the root causes, use those insights to spot issues early, make changes and track what\u2019s working. It\u2019s just like customer churn; fix the leaks before they grow.\n\nRetention is a valuable business metric. When you expand it to fit your internal goals, you'll get even more out of it in the long run.\n\nThe best leaders don't retain employees with money or perks alone. They do it by building trust, fostering growth, and practicing empathy. If you want your people to show up, treat them like your most valuable customer. Listen to them often. Invest time in them. The more seen and supported your people feel, the more likely they are to invest in you\u2014no matter what side of the business they're on.\n\nis the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.",

  "summary": "Mark Mark, CEO of TenantCloud and CEO/Cofounder of Rentler, has shared his insights on how Empathy-Driven Leadership can build lasting teams. He suggests that internal retention rates are similar to customer loyalty, but also crucial for long-term success. Employee retention can help reduce costly recruiting costs and create a more stable work environment, fostering stronger relationships, increased job satisfaction and increased productivity. Empathy can be applied to leadership, providing a clear career path, and allowing employees to feel heard and informed about their work. Mark recommends using the same approach to internal health as customer satisfaction and customer loyalty.",

      "text": "What if every great employee you (or your company) hired never left? Of course, that\u2019s unrealistic \u2026 or is it? Joey Coleman is one of the brightest authors and speakers on the planet. His first book, Never Lose a Customer Again, is one of the very best books I\u2019ve read on how to keep your customers coming back. He\u2019s now taken some of the same ideas that worked for customer retention and written a second book, just as brilliant, Never Lose an Employee Again.\nColeman studied and researched organizations worldwide, and he found that 50% of hourly employees quit before their 100-day anniversary. For non-hourly or salaried employees, it\u2019s 20%. I interviewed Coleman on Amazing Business Radio to learn how we can keep good employees.\n\u201cHow we onboard employees and make them feel part of our community can differentiate whether they will be long-time employees or leave almost as fast as they came,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThe first 100 days are the most important time in the entire relationship with an employee because this is where the foundation is laid.\u201d\nSo, why do employees leave? Contrary to popular belief, the No. 1 reason an employee leaves to work elsewhere is not money. In the traditional exit interview, where an employee talks to their employer face-to-face, money is the easiest and safest excuse for an exit. The true reasons for leaving are more telling\u2014and can help prevent an employee from going, even if offered more money somewhere else. Coleman cites the Work Institute employee retention study, sharing the top five reasons employees leave:\n\u00b7 No clear career path\u2014This is the top reason employees leave. Nearly one-quarter (24%) don\u2019t see future opportunities in the organization. Most employees want to advance their careers and learn new skills. Laying out a potential path for an employee from the very beginning of their employment with you can have long-term benefits.\n\u00b7 Stress or lack of resources\u2014Not providing employees with the tools they need or giving them too heavy of a workload can impact their emotional health, which could lead them to find work at another company.\n\u00b7 Health and family matters\u2014As much as an employee may love working with your organization, personal health, a sick child or an aging parent can interfere with their ability to work. Regarding the latter, Coleman says, \u201cJust as some employers provide daycare for young children, some employers in the future will also provide an eldercare program.\u201d\n\u00b7 Work/life balance\u2014The job has to fit the employee\u2019s lifestyle. Something as seemingly insignificant as a long commute can negatively impact the employee\u2019s personal life so much that they leave.\n\u00b7 Money\u2014Almost one in 10 (9%) leave because of money. That means nine out of 10 leave for other reasons, often within our control.\nAfter reading the reasons listed above, here is Coleman\u2019s top advice:\n1. Affirm the employee made the right decision to come to work at your organization\u2014The concept of affirm is one of the eight phases of the first 100 days Coleman covers in his book. There is a scientifically proven emotional reaction in which a new employee begins to doubt their decision to accept your job offer. It is called \u201cnew hire\u2019s remorse,\u201d which happens between when they accept the job offer and their first day. Reaffirm your new employee\u2019s decision to accept your job offer. Establish a personal and emotional connection even before their first day.\n2. Onboarding must be practiced at a higher level\u2014Don\u2019t just onboard the first day or two (or even a week or two). Coleman says, \u201cIf you\u2019re not painting a clear path for your people but expecting them to manage and figure out their careers on their own, then you deserve to lose them.\u201d The amount of time you spend with employees over the first 100 days directly correlates to how long they will stay.\n3. The employee\u2019s personal life is important\u2014Notice that three of the five reasons people leave the organization are personal. Coleman says, \u201cYou need to know what\u2019s going on between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. as much as you are interested in what\u2019s happening between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. What are your people doing and dealing with when they are not at work?\u201d\nI\u2019ve often said that you won\u2019t have a business without customers. Coleman makes the case that the same applies to employees. Much of what gets customers to come back is a great customer experience. You can\u2019t deliver a great CX without a great employee experience on the inside of your organization. Coleman says, \u201cPeople think that customer experience and employee experience are two different silos. The better way to look at this is that they are two sides of the same coin. We must work on both!\u201d"
