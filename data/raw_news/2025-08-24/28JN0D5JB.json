  "title": "Social media is fueling sale of human remains and grave robbery risks",
  "description": "The sale of human remains under the guise of curiosities and antiques on the internet is well-known. Some could be going to extremes to cash in on the demand.",
  "content": "Social media sites are home to all kinds of ills. Aside from the usual threat factors such as deepfakes, malware, phishing, and identity theft, it can also facilitate more sinister acts such as grooming and drug peddling. The latest risk scenario is even more macabre as it involves the online trade of human remains and risks of grave robbery.\n\n\u201cSocial media is helping drive trade in skulls, bones and skin products as UK legal void risks new era of \u2018body snatching,\u201d notes a report by The Guardian. The outlet pulled images of human skulls that were listed on Instagram and got them analyzed by forensic experts.\n\nThree of the skulls showed signs that are associated with decomposing remains inside a coffin. Some of the remains analyzed by experts had dirt and remnants of human tissues, indicating that they were a product of \u201crecent excavation.\u201d\n\nExperts note that inherent loopholes in the Human Tissue Act 2004 in the UK are allowing unregulated sourcing and sale of human remains, even though laws covering their usage for medical purposes are tightly regulated. Owing to the legal gaps, \u201ccollectors and sellers are in effect free to buy, sell and modify human remains,\u201d adds the report.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only lawmakers and activists who are concerned about the recent trend. Even folks who do legitimate business of collecting and selling curiosities and antiques are worried. \u201cThe waters are becoming too muddy with stolen pieces, pieces that are grave-robbed, so many things that just aren\u2019t right,\u201d a UK-based seller of oddities was quoted as saying.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the first time that an alarm against the online sale of human remains has been raised. In 2022, a LiveScience investigation found that \u201cFacebook and Instagram are hubs for dealing in the dead,\u201d a trade that covers everything from bones to fetuses and disfigured remains.\n\nThe outlet spotted 50 sellers of such items, some of whom listed the items publicly, while a few sold them in private groups. In 2020, the co-founder of the Alliance to Counter Crime Online told the outlet that the trade of human remains was encouraging grave robberies, adding to a report that exposed the sale of looted skulls and human body parts on Facebook.\n\nIt appears that even the medical science community is aware of the problem. Research that was published in the Mortality journal this year also detailed a case where human remains were put up for sale on Instagram. \u201dMedical specimen can only be purchased on respective Instagram pages or completely unbiased ones, which there are very few of,\u201d says the paper.\n\nOne of the most cited research papers on the illicit trafficking of human remains, which was published in the Crime, Law and Social Change journal, notes that the true depth of this dark business is yet to be analyzed properly. It further adds that sellers dependent on walk-in traffic \u201ccould easily arrange for the sale of illicit goods.\u201d\n\nAs for the reason why one would go to the extent of acquiring human remains, both untouched and modified, the paper offers a rather succinct but enlightening explanation:\n\n\u201cWhether practitioners are Western converts seeking to demonstrate their devotion to their new faith, or members of diasporas seeking to maintain practices crucial to their identity, the necessity of and \u201cauthenticity\u201d lent by use of real human remains makes acquisition by even illicit means worth it for some.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in historical items or antiquities such as those described above, it\u2019s best to enquire about the sourcing details and obtaining a provenance document. Additionally, there are local norms that govern the import or export of such items, so you should pay attention to those local license clearances, as well.",

      "text": "\u201cMy friend got addicted to Xanax after a diagnosis of clinical depression, and he now scores his fix on Instagram,\u201d says Gursaakhi Miglani, a student pursuing a master\u2019s degree in Clinical Psychiatry from India\u2019s Chandigarh University. She is not the only one to tell a story that links the social fabric of Instagram with a familiar tragedy of drug abuse. Two students from prestigious institutions, both under the age of 20, told me on conditions of anonymity that Instagram is the safest way to buy \u201cparty goods.\u201d A fellow journalist confirmed that Instagram\u2019s drugs marketplace is buzzing, but asked me not to report all such accounts because that\u2019s where she sources her \u201cpot brownies\u201d from.\nAnd it is quite worrying to see that teens appear to be a recurring theme in this dark equation. Instagram is not the healthiest social media platform, especially for teens. Even its own internal research that was recently leaked made it clear that the platform worsened mental health problems for some young users. But it also has a dark drug underbelly that is not even sparing minor users. The Tech Transparency Project (TPP) revealed some startling facts about the bustling online drug marketplace on Instagram just over a month ago. The investigation makes it abundantly clear that even with the teen-protection tools touted by Instagram, there is hardly any meaningful barrier that can protect young minds from the drug business.\nThe nonprofit created test accounts belonging to users between the ages of 13 and 17. Now, this is the group whose profiles are set to private by default, and Instagram blocks direct messages (DMs) from strangers to protect them. However, the research proved how utterly ineffective these measures are. Despite having accounts under the sensitive \u201cminor\u201d class of users, finding drugs is extremely easy for them. In fact, Instagram\u2019s own systems appear to be lending a hand here. TPP\u2019s research says it only takes a couple of clicks to find an account peddling drugs on Instagram. In contrast, the process of logging out takes five clicks.\nEnough with these underwhelming baby steps & vague \u201cdirectional\u201d alignments. What we need now is broad, bold solutions & accountability that address transparency, children\u2019s privacy, & create effective tools for parents & kids to protect themselves on these platforms.\n\u2014 Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) December 9, 2021\nProblematic drugs hashtags like #mdma are banned, but Instagram autofills alternatives such as #mollymdma and even suggests accounts peddling stuff like Xanax, Fentanyl, and Adderall. The hashtag flaw was also highlighted in 2018 by The Washington Post. Miglani tells me that gaming hashtags are one of the most common workarounds for quickly finding a drug dealer on the photo-sharing platform. As per TPP\u2019s report, Instagram\u2019s algorithms started suggesting accounts selling illegal drugs as soon as the test account belonging to a teenager followed a drug peddler. Some of the bad actors do it all so brazenly that they mention the name of drugs directly on their profile page. And as soon as a test account followed a shady drug seller\u2019s account, unsolicited calls followed.\nI\u2019ve personally never experienced any cannabis derivatives, but it took me less than five minutes to find accounts selling weed using nothing but generic words in the app\u2019s search field. Here are screenshots of what a seller\u2019s account looks like, and a potential sale conversation I initiated as a test:\nAnd further exacerbating the problem is a huge loophole. Instagram says it sets the accounts of users younger than 16 to private by default. TPP found that it only applies to accounts made using the mobile app, and not the desktop client. Even Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri confirmed it earlier this week when he testified before Congress. Allowing a busy drugs marketplace to thrive is a serious issue, especially when it ensnares teens and puts their lives at risk. But that\u2019s just one aspect of a problem that is intrinsically linked to another major issue that Instagram users grapple with \u2014 social acceptance, and the mental health pressure that comes with it.\nA billion users, a few fundamental flaws\nTo understand the problem, I reached out to Mohammad Talha Shamim, who holds a degree in psychiatry from the All India Institute of Medical Science, a group of eminent autonomous government-public medical colleges and hospitals that is considered to be the best in India. He opined that Instagram is making it easier for teens to get addicted. And that primarily has to do with its vast reach, especially among young users. The app currently has over a billion users and continues to add millions every quarter. Instagram was the third-most downloaded mobile app in 2021 (No. 4 on the App Store and No. 2 on the Google Play Store), per Sensor Tower. Shah, who was startled at TPP\u2019s findings, noted that Instagram\u2019s role as a facilitator should be brought under tight oversight before more damage is done to its most vulnerable user base.\nVentureBeat\u2019s own investigations correlated Instagram and its inherent drugs problem twice going back 2014. The Guardian reported Instagram\u2019s role in drug peddling in 2016. A 2019 study published in the International Journal of Drug Policy highlighted how platforms like Instagram act as a quick, convenient, and secure method for buying illicit drugs. VICE documented Instagram\u2019s drugs problem twice back in 2019 and 2020. American Addiction Centers\u2019 research also exposed a booming business of illicit codeine, MDMA, marijuana, painkillers, and cocaine sales on Instagram.\nTPP\u2019s research says it only takes a couple of clicks to find an account peddling drugs on Instagram.\nExplaining why teen users gravitate toward drugs in the first place, Talha pointed at \u201ccuriosity of the young mind\u201d as one of the reasons. This enthusiasm takes a horrendous turn without effective warning around how addiction destroys lives and proper education about the consumption of drugs, for both recreational and medicinal purposes. Another culprit is social pressure, and this plays a key role in embracing injurious consumption patterns. For example, a 2020 study published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics found that Instagram is widely used to promote vaping among young users.\nTeens often struggle with social acceptance among the \u201ccool people of Instagram with happening lives.\u201d A 2016 study published in the Computers in Human Behavior journal divulged this aspect of Instagram usage in detail. Fear of missing out further pushes users toward addictive usage. A 2020 study published in Psychological Reports linked this fear to addictive usage.\nReeling under the stress of finding a place among their more popular contacts on Instagram, teens have their first experience of using drugs for recreational purposes. A University of Copenhagen study published in 2019 in the Drug And Alcohol Review journal of the Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs (APSAD) highlighted how easy it was to drift in and out of selling and using drugs in Nordic countries with the advent of platforms such as Instagram. And compared to alcohol addiction, drug abuse is far worse. The impact on physical and mental health is taxing, and withdrawal is a lot more severe and prolonged.\nMore problems than just drugs\nIt is also at this stage that the bigger problem manifests \u2014 anxiety, depression, and peer pressure. The unrealistic body standards, measures of prosperity, and scales of material happiness occupying all corners of Instagram force teens to undermine what they already have. And to cope with that pressure, young users often turn to drugs to alleviate their pain and forget whatever mental trauma they are carrying.\n\u201cDrugs help dissociate the feeling of inferiority complex by making users forget the trauma they have been subjected to,\u201d Rehan Abdi, a doctor of psychiatry at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College in Aligarh, India, says, explaining that psycho-social forces play a pivotal role in pushing teens toward drug abuse.\n\u201cNot everyone becomes an addict after using drugs for the first time,\u201d Talha says. \u201cBut when you have a billion existing users, and hundreds of millions ready to onboard, even a tiny fraction of new addicts is a worryingly high number.\u201d There is also a class of users who come to Instagram seeking solace from the pain in their real lives. But at some point, psychological conflicts arise, and coping strategies shift from visual engagement to drug-infused euphoria.\nInstagram is no stranger to these mental health problems. A 2017 study by the U.K.\u2019s Royal Society for Public Health ranked Instagram as the worst platform for the mental health of young users. The U.K.\u2019s leading child protection charity, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), found that Instagram was the most widely used platform by sex offenders for grooming children in 2020 and 2021. The 2017 Annual Bullying Survey by Ditch the Label found Instagram to be the platform on which the highest share of young users experienced cyberbullying. There are many such papers out there exposing the ills of Instagram, and they connect the problematic dots in a very uncomplicated fashion.\nA moderation problem as much as a drug problem\nYes, Instagram has a serious drugs problem. And in countries like India, where it barely spends resources on moderation and content vigilance compared to what it does in the U.S., the problem exacerbates beyond control. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole universe of bad actors willing to convert young users into addicts. And I\u2019m afraid that without proper regulation and accountability, we can\u2019t save the new generation,\u201d Miglani says.\nDespite all these unsolved existing problems, the company wanted to make an \u201cInstagram For Kids.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t have fared well, and thanks to mounting pressure, Instagram put the project on ice. But Instagram needs to do a lot more than just scrapping bad ideas. It needs to act proactively and do it responsibly before it\u2019s too late.\nDigital Trends has reached out to representatives at Instagram and Meta for a response, and we will update this story when we hear back."

      "text": "Looted skulls and human remains are being sold in black markets on Facebook\nUpdated July 3 at 9 a.m. with a response from Facebook.\nIn 2013, an American collector visiting Tunisia entered the Sousse catacombs \u2014 an ancient necropolis that holds some of the oldest Christian burials in the world \u2014 and stole a skull with a \"very dark ancient patina\" (as he described it) during renovations of the catacombs. The collector put the skull up for sale in a private Facebook group for $550, telling his tale of looting in the sales listing.\nOther members of the group were excited by the looted skull, with some posting comments about how \"beautiful\" it was. What the collector may not have realized was that the group wasn't as private as it seemed. A Live Science reporter posing as a person interested in skulls had infiltrated the private Facebook group, and several other groups like it, and for 10 months kept track of human remains that were being sold.\nRelated: 30 of the world's most valuable treasures that are still missing\nThe Live Science investigation unlocked a world in which human remains are often sold with little information about their origins \u2014 raising questions about how they were acquired. While the Sousse catacomb skull was exceptional in that the collector openly admitted he looted it, Live Science documented countless other human remains with no back stories, leaving open the question: How many of these remains were looted or stolen?\nRobbing graves\nMost countries around the world (including Tunisia) have banned the looting of archaeological sites and graveyards. In the United States, \"there is no law in any state which grants permission or acknowledges that it is legal to sell human remains. On the contrary, it is expressly illegal in a number of states,\" said Tanya Marsh, an expert in cemetery and funeral law at Wake Forest School of Law in North Carolina. In the private groups, some sellers claimed that they got their bones from medical colleges; but even if those claims were true, \"there are no exceptions for human remains even if there is documentation that they are from the collection of a medical school or museum,\" Marsh told Live Science.\n\"It is doubtful that any person, even those donating their remains for science, ever wanted to be or expected to be a personal curio for an individual,\" said Ryan Seidemann and Christine Halling in a jointly written email to Live Science. Both work in the Office of Louisiana's Attorney General in the Lands & Natural Resources Section Civil Division, with Seidemann leading the division and Halling as an archaeologist.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nRelated: The 6 most gruesome grave robberies\n\"Even more clear are the human remains that derive from tombs or burials. Those people intended for their remains to stay in their burial space. Violation of this intent for the purposes of seeking to privately own or possess the remains is both a legal and an ethical violation,\" Seidemann and Halling said. \"The legal and ethical implications are clear in our opinion: There is no need or justification for any private individual to own any human remains, whether they are the remains of adults or children.\"\nGretchen Peters, co-founder of the \"Alliance to Counter Crime Online,\" an organization fighting crime and corruption, said that the trade in human remains is \"fundamentally disrespectful to the dead\" and is encouraging grave robbing around the world.\nSousse catacomb skull\nEach skull or artifact stolen from graves becomes a missing piece of history, a window no longer available for archaeologists and others into civilizations before ours. For instance, the Sousse catacombs, which extend about 3.1 miles (5 kilometers) \u2014 contain the remains of about 15,000 people including many early Christians who would have used the catacombs as a meeting place to avoid Roman persecution. At the time, some 2,000 years ago, Tunisia was ruled by the Roman Empire. By studying those remains, archaeologists have been learning about how life changed in Tunisia as more people converted to Christianity. For instance, scholars are in the process of conserving the mosaics in the catacombs and are searching for clues about how art styles changed as people adopted Christianity.\nRelated: In Photos: A journey through early Christian Rome\nThe seller of the Sousse catacomb skull is based in Washington state and sold numerous other human remains in the private Facebook groups. Live Science contacted the collector through Facebook and posed as a person interested in the skull. The collector didn't reply to the questions and the sale posting was later deleted.\nTunisia's Ministry of Culture and a few archaeologists in Tunisia also didn't respond to requests for comment about the Sousse skull.\nRemains of children, infants, for sale\nThe Sousse skull is just the tip of an iceberg of private online sales of undocumented human remains. The remains of fetuses, infants and children are particularly popular in these private Facebook groups. One buyer wrote in a post that they were \"looking for children's skeletal pieces or organs.\" They would have found many for sale. Buyers and sellers did not usually discuss why they were interested in child and fetus remains.\nOn the higher-price end a mummified child, who the seller claimed was 6 years old when he or she died in the 1700s, was posted for sale for 11,000 euros ($12,247). No provenance information was given in the sale posting, but the seller wrote in large caps that it is \"NOT A GRAVE ROBBERY.\"\nRelated: In photos: Inca child mummies\nA lower-priced example is a skull of what a seller said was probably a \"young teen female\" offered for $1,300. No provenance information was listed in the sales posting, although the seller claimed that it was legally acquired and had proper import documentation. Whether or not any of the remains came from a criminal act is not known, though this investigation didn't turn up clear evidence that modern-day crime victims are making their way into the human remains trade. Experts contacted by Live Science had a range of opinions on this question from doubtful to possible.\nAnother seller posted the skull of a \"young teenager\" for $1,000; the teenager's \"wisdom teeth not protruding yet,\" the seller wrote in the posting. The seller claimed the skull came from a \"medical school in Philadelphia.\" It's not clear how the seller got it.\nFetal remains were sold in the groups, sometimes preserved in jars of liquid. For example, a tiny fetus whose soft tissue appeared well preserved was posted for sale for $2,350. It was listed as a \"retired medical specimen,\" with no other information given.\nAn \"almost full-term\" fetus was selling for $6,495. The seller claimed in the posting that it was from an \"old teaching collection.\" The seller also claimed that the mother of the fetus \"wanted this specimen to live on via preservation and to stimulate curiosity and further education about the human body.\"\nIs this legal? That may vary by region. \"There is no affirmative law in the United States that permits the sale or possession of human fetuses,\" Marsh said. \"There is a trend of state legislatures adopting statutes that treat fetal remains as human remains \u2014 one of the impacts of those new statutes is that fetal remains, regardless of gestational age, would be required to be buried, entombed or cremated and statutes which expressly forbid the sale of human remains would also apply to fetal remains,\" Marsh said.\nSpotty enforcement\nHow well existing laws are enforced is another question. Rick St. Hilaire, a lawyer with Red Arch Cultural Heritage Law & Policy Research, said that in his experience state historic preservation officers, tribal officers and customs officials tend to be most aware of the human remains trade. \"This area is not one that would attract mainstream attention among law enforcement,\" said St. Hilaire, noting that the issue does not get as much attention as human trafficking and drug enforcement does.\nSome \"law enforcement agencies may be aware of the trade, but unaware of the legal options that exist to stop the commodification of human remains,\" Seidemann and Halling said.\nFacebook actually has a policy that bans the sale of human remains on their site, but does a poor job of enforcing it, said Katie Paul, co-director of the ATHAR project, which investigates the trafficking of cultural remains.\nBone knives, canes and 'human leather'\nSellers sometimes posted items made partly of human remains, such as knives and walking sticks that incorporated human bone. One walking cane, on sale for $300, had a handle made of a human femur, and the seller claimed that the femur came from a skeleton dating back to the 19th century. \"Don't miss out on this one of a kind piece,\" the seller said. The same seller also offered a knife with a handle made out of bone femur for $260.\nOne particularly unusual item was a 1917 edition of the book \"Diseases of the Skin\" by Dr. Richard Sutton that the seller rebound with \"human leather.\" The seller claimed that the human remains used to create the leather came from a \"retired medical specimen.\" The seller added, \"I personally acquired the material, had it turned into leather, and performed the binding myself.\" The asking price was $6,500 and was successfully sold.\nTip of the iceberg\nThese examples represent only a small fraction of the sales that went on in these private groups. There were many more human remains of interest, such as a Peruvian elongated skull selling for $10,500. No provenance information was given in the posting. This is a particularly fraught sale, as Peru has been ravaged by looting, with the Global Heritage Fund estimating that 100,000 tombs have been plundered.\nRelated: 7 Biblical sites ravaged by modern-day looters\nThe skulls of people with elongated heads, found in Peru and other parts of the world, come from the practice of head-binding. Head binding in Peru became popular around A.D. 1300 and may have been used to signify what social groups a person belonged to, researchers reported in 2018 in the journal Current Anthropology.\nMany sites have banned or restricted the sale of human remains. For instance, eBay has banned the sale, and while human remains are sold on Instagram, Live Science found that some accounts on Instagram that sell them have been shut down in recent months.\nWhy buy human remains?\nFrom images posted in the private groups, the Live Science investigation found that many members appear to be purchasing human remains for display in their homes. Human remains were often shown in cabinets and on desks. Occasionally a skeleton would be displayed sitting in a chair. In a few instances, skulls had engravings carved into them, including one with an image of the pagan goat-like deity Baphomet on it. Sometimes collectors modified skulls so that they could be used to hold flowers.\nRelated: 25 Grisly archaeological discoveries\nCollectors appear to have a variety of motivations for buying human remains, said Shawn Graham, of Carleton University in Ontario, and Damien Huffer, of Carleton University, both archaeologists who study the trade in human remains, in a jointly written email. Some collectors seem to be driven by a fascination with death, while other collectors have an interest in trying to replicate displays of human remains shown in museums. There also seems to be a sense of kinship among those in the human remains trade, the researchers said.\nCan the trade be stopped?\nA number of experts that Live Science talked to said that Facebook needs to enforce its existing policy banning the sale of human remains on their platform. Graham and Huffer said that law enforcement agencies need to get better at enforcing existing laws against the sale of human remains.\nIn addition, according to Peters, governments should pass regulations that put the onus on social media companies to remove illegal transactions from their platforms. \"Because commerce on the internet and on social media is so poorly regulated, it's literally like the Wild West with no sheriffs,\" Peters said.\nLive Science also contacted Facebook to alert the company of the human bone trade. In response, a spokesperson said that once they become aware that a group has violated their policies they take action against them. As of July 3, Live Science found that three of the private groups had been shut down, although others remain in operation.\nOriginally published on Live Science.\nOwen Jarus is a regular contributor to Live Science who writes about archaeology and humans' past.

      "text": "Abstract\nThis paper represents an exploratory study of what is known about the current global trade in human remains, and in particular, specimens from archaeological or ethnographic contexts, regardless of which source countries they derive from and where they are destined. The paper is in four parts. In Part 1, we explain how the analysis of human remains forms an important component of archaeological research, and why looting activity at burial sites prejudice this research. In Part 2 we review the existing and relevant archaeological, ethnographic and criminological literature on the subject while in Part 3 we describe our own research into the online trade in human remains, both licit and illicit. To assess the current global prevalence and distribution of public and private dealers in human remains, keyword searches on common search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing), and online sites like eBay and Amazon were conducted. In Part 4 we draw some conclusions about our research and point in particular to various policy and law reform issues which require further consideration and study.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\nThe \u2018Shesepamuntayesher\u2019 case\nIn July 2011 United States (US) federal law enforcement authorities announced that they had uncovered a sophisticated and extensive international antiquities smuggling ring which had been caught bringing numbers of Egyptian artefacts into the country, including a sarcophagus containing a mummified individual [1]. Subsequently Mousa Khouli, 38, a New York antiquities dealer pleaded guilty to smuggling Egyptian cultural property into the US and making a false statement to law enforcement authorities. Investigators from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HIS) indicated that Khouli and other conspirators had exported the antiquities to the US from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates using a variety of illegal methods to avoid detection. Hieroglyphics on the coffin indicated that the mummified female within it was named \u2018Shesepamuntayesher\u2019 and that she bore the title \u2018Lady of the House\u2019 [2].\nThe US mummy smuggling case was said by HIS not only to be the first occasion that a cultural property network of this scale and dimension had been dismantled within the country but that \u201cin addition to smuggling cultural property this case also focuses on significant money laundering activity. This is notable because the illicit sale of cultural property is the third most profitable black market industry following narcotics and weapons trafficking\u2026[Estimates] suggest it brings in $2 billion to $6 billion annually\u201d [1]. Other experts on ancient antiquities noted at the time that the black market in mummies could be traced back to the mediaeval period and that there was no doubt that people were still keen to buy them, even though there was more interest in their coffins and surrounding contents than the human remains themselves [1].\nShesepamuntayesher\u2019 s case is a contemporary and dramatic example of how human remains which form a part of a nation\u2019s cultural heritage still continue to be the subject of illicit trafficking. In this case we know the name of the human being whose remains have been excavated unlawfully from their burial place somewhere in Egypt and transhipped to alien climes. However, as we shall show and explain in more detail below, very little is known at present either about the origins or dimensions of this trade of principally nameless and faceless bodies or body parts, or the identity and background of those involved as suppliers or purchasers of such remains. Thus in this paper we present findings from an exploratory study, predominately online, of the international traffic in archaeological and ethnographic human remains which it is hoped uncovers some of its hidden features, as well as pointing to areas where further research is needed.\nThe paper is in four parts. In Part 1, we explain how the analysis of human remains forms an important component of archaeological research, and why looting activity at burial sites prejudice this research. In Part 2 we review the existing and relevant archaeological, ethnographic and criminological literature on the subject while in Part 3 we describe our own research into the trade in human remains, both licit and illicit. In Part 4 we draw some conclusions about our research and point in particular to various policy and law reform issues which require further consideration and study.\nPart 1: The destruction of context\nWithin the academic discipline of archaeology there exists a subfield generally referred to as human bioarchaeology, in which the ultimate goal is to reveal those aspects of ancient human life difficult to understand using the material cultural record alone [3, 4]. Although human remains are arguably the most \u201cinformation-dense type of deposit in the archaeological record\u201d [5], the successful interpretation of this information in a manner relevant to understanding the human condition in the past requires that it be \u201ccontextualized\u201d by being \u201cread\u201d together with data on community and individual-level variation in mortuary treatment [4, 6]. Such systematic study of the biological, social, material and ritual components of ancient life is increasing globally, using ever more advanced scientific techniques [7, 8]. In the broadest perspective, the combination of biological and mortuary data, when viewed as part of the larger archaeological record of a specific place or time, can provide the level of detail needed to metaphorically \u2018bring the dead to life.\u2019\nThe plundering of burial grounds in search of artefacts, and occasionally human remains, to fuel the global antiquities trade directly eliminates the possibility of such research by destroying the vital contextual clues needed to understand burial conditions, seasonality and sequence, as well as damaging and disarticulating the remains themselves. Such plunder is known to have occurred in many nations in the past, including Egypt where tomb robbers have operated since the time of the Pharaoh\u2019s themselves [9, 10]. More recently widespread illegal excavations of grave sites in countries like Cambodia and Thailand have decimated archeological sites and caused irreparable harm [11, 12].\nPart 2: A little-known phenomenon\nAn extensive archeological and allied literature exists regarding many ethical issues associated with human remains [13\u201315] including such contentious and still current matters as the repatriation of the skeletal remains of indigenous people taken in the past by colonial powers for study and display. Recent legal and moral arguments for repatriation (primarily from European museums) of human remains collected during the colonial-era from African, Australian Aboriginal and Oceanic peoples have become quite prevalent [16\u201319]. Though this significant issue continues to attract attention, it exists outside the scope of this paper. Case studies and legal issues surrounding the licit or illicit trade in organs and tissue from cadavers and autopsies [20, 21] are also outside its scope. Important though all this literature is we are concerned here only with that which relates in specific terms to the trade in archaeological and ethnographic human remains, and this is a very small part of this larger picture.\nOne important example of this relevant literature is an analysis by Huxley and Finnegan [22] which surveyed the popular US and international private auction site eBay over a period of several years to determine the extent to which they engaged in the sale of human remains. The express purpose of this study was to inform the forensic anthropological community that \u201chuman remains, old and new, are for sale on the eBay internet auction site,\u201d and that \u201ceBay does not use a forensic anthropologist to assess photographs of these materials\u201d [22:1]. Given that not only were prehistoric and historic remains recorded, but also cases of likely medico-legal import (but lacking professional preparation), the lack of a forensic anthropologist on hand (at least at the time) to monitor such sales is especially significant. Huxley and Finnegan found that prices sought for human remains advertised on eBay ranged from US $500-2,000, and every specimen discussed (except for a scapula and an \u201carm bone\u201d of unstated provenance or provenience, and two molars once belonging to the individual attempting to sell them) was a human skull.\nCurrent eBay policy regarding the sale of human remains or tissue [23] states that only items containing \u201chuman scalp hair (such as lockets or wigs)\u201d as well as \u201cclean, articulated (jointed), non-Native American skulls and skeletons used for medical research\u201d are allowed to be sold lawfully. The policy more generally states that \u201chumans, the human body, or any human body parts or products\u201d are not allowed to be listed, with bone (and specifically Tibetan \u201cprayer skulls\u201d) specifically prohibited. The general ban on the sale of bone, however, appears in direct contradiction of the allowance of cleaned, non-Native American specimens allegedly sold as medical research specimens.\nIn a subsequent commentary on Huxley and Finnegan\u2019s article, Kubiczek and Mellen [24] drew attention to at least three further \u201cbiological supply house\u201d internet sites selling unidentified or identified human remains specimens \u201cof Chinese origin with post-mortem intervals of 20 plus years, which had been donated, or \u201crelocated\u201d\u201d [24]. This reference has been echoed in still more recent expose reports that document the continued, large-scale black market trade in skeletal material from India (for private use, or purchase by Medical Schools for student \u201cbone boxes\u201d despite a ban in place since 1985), as well as China (despite a general ban on human tissue sales there since 2008) [25].\nHuxley and Finnegan [24] concluded their analysis with a call to regulate the sale of human remains online in the United States by drafting and enforcing a federal law on the subject. The fact that comprehensive laws banning the private trade have yet to be passed, whether in the United States or globally, has been emphasised in a recent commentary [26] in which several new examples of the attempted private sale of human remains online are described. These developments have occurred despite attempts by at least some online retail sites such as Etsy or Craigslist to update and restrict their sales policies to ban the sale of human remains or body parts. This includes skulls, bones, articulated skeletons, bodily fluids, preserved tissues and organs, although items containing hair and teeth are still legitimate on Etsy [27], and eBay still permits the sale of genuine human remains for \u201cmedical or educational use\u201d [23]. No guarantee is required by eBay from either the buyer or private seller to prove that the purchase will in fact be used as part of a teaching collection.\nIn addition to this, the historic and contemporary collection of ethnographica from cultures throughout the Indo-Pacific (encompassing South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands), Africa, Latin America and elsewhere also likely contributes to current online markets. Much of this \u201ctribal\u201d art market consists of ritual paraphernalia or items bestowed with cultural memory and a history of use and/or maintenance (e.g. masks, items of clothing and jewellery, weapons, figurines, domestic items, instruments, and \u201ctrophy\u201d or \u201cover modelled\u201d skulls). Such items were often collected during colonial-era expeditions, and therefore with motivations and practices for acquiring and displaying such items that today would be considered ethically or morally suspect [28, 29]. Downplaying the role of indigenous agency in the shaping of colonial era collections, however, is to have an incomplete understanding regarding the formation of these collections [30]. As will be suggested especially in the case of trophy skulls, the offering and selling of specimens to colonial-era collectors was not purely one made due to financial need in a newly imposed cash economy. Today, numerous dealers located around the world (all self-identified non-indigenous, with the exception of contemporary Europeans selling allegedly historic-period European specimens) continue to sell used and new ethnographic artefacts from the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere, but to what extent the current market contains human remains is poorly understood.\nPart 3: Quantifying today\u2019s market- an exploratory online study\nFrom the sparse investigative research conducted to date, it would seem that an active, if relatively infrequent, private trade in human remains from archaeological, ethnographic, and medico-legal contexts continues to exist, as indicated by several very recent examples of private confiscation of human remains in the US and Australia [31\u201333]. In an attempt to quantify and describe more adequately the current dimensions of this trade, especially regarding archaeological and ethnographic specimens, the authors decided to conduct their own analysis of the market for human remains utilizing data drawn principally from internet based sources. In this section of the paper we outline the methods used to uncover and compile relevant information, the reasons behind collecting data in this manner, and how quantification occurred. It should be emphasised again that this preliminary market analysis only addresses the online market.\nTo assess the current global prevalence and distribution of online dealers in human remains (both those with a \u201cpublic\u201d face represented by galleries and auction houses, occasionally with street addresses and traceable contact details, and those \u201cprivate,\u201d often anonymous traders who operate through such means as eBay), keyword searches on common search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing) were performed. Common online auction sites eBay and Amazon.com were also included, especially as eBay had been surveyed before (Huxley and Finnegan, 2004) and maintains a policy statement on the sale of human remains. Keywords included \u201chuman remains,\u201d \u201cnatural bone,\u201d \u201cskulls,\u201d \u201cbone,\u201d \u201ctrophy skulls,\u201d \u201coceanic art,\u201d \u201ccurios,\u201d \u201cprimitive art,\u201d \u201ckangling trumpets,\u201d etc. Searching also occurred by means of key phrases, such as \u201cWhere can I buy oceanic art in Australia?,\u201d \u201cCan I legally buy bone?,\u201d \u201cWhere can I buy Palo Mayombe supplies?,\u201d etc. Palo Mayombe here refers to one of a closely related group of denominations (known as Palo, or La Regla de Kongo) developed in Cuba by slaves of primarily Central African descent, in which human remains can play a part in specific rituals. Palo has occasionally (arguably incorrectly) been suggested to associate with West African (Yoruba)/Cuban Santeria [34, 35].\nConducting internet searches in this manner allowed us to record the greatest diversity of online dealers, as well as access social networking sites and dealer forums (e.g. Facebook, Yahoo! Ancient Artefacts, etc.) on which the trade in human remains, and antiquities in general, could be openly discussed. Facebook especially hosted numerous \u2018pages\u2019 connected to online galleries or private individual collectors, on which \u201cfriends\u201d of the gallery or collector in question could provide feedback regarding recent acquisitions and discuss desired or planned purchases. Entry of each dealer identified into a database occurred regardless of whether sale of any/all of their relevant stock was ongoing or recently completed but listed in archives. Data was collected for approximately 2 months from May to June, 2013, and from September to October 2013. Over each month-long period of searching, approximately 1\u20132 hours per day were devoted to online investigation. However, given the relatively small size of this facet of the accessible, online, antiquities market, repetition of dealer and gallery websites appearing in each search soon became frequent. Aside from the occasional change to eBay listings, no frequency differences between search periods were noted, but this could merely be an artefact of the sample size of supply and demand in the market itself. This database first recorded individual gallery or dealer websites, but in the case of, for example, auctioned trophy skulls, each was recorded separately due to distinct ownership histories, reference literature, price, etc.\nData entered for each gallery, auction house, or private dealer included name, URL, date the website was accessed, country the gallery or dealer purported to originate from, a postal address, email address, and contact name if listed. In almost all instances, human bone was being clearly advertised online, with only one dealer included that had human remains for sale, but with no corresponding advertisement on the associated gallery website. In this instance, trophy skulls from the Solomon Islands and PNG were observed in person by one of the authors [DH] via an impromptu visit to the gallery in question while on vacation in April 2013. To tabulate totals, individual specimen counts were calculated for each dealer listed, by category of artefact and/or skeletal element or body part on offer (i.e. skull, teeth, foot, hand, etc.). For more numerous categories of artefact, such as trophy skulls or alleged medical specimens, individual counts by region, ethnic group, or current country of residence were also conducted (see tables below). From there, data was recorded as to whether or not a price was offered, whether the sale was ongoing or already over, and what the estimated or realized price was.\nThe next category recorded was whether or not the artefact or specimen had a geographic or ethnographic \u2018source\u2019 clearly stated by the dealer. In cases where a dealer was offering more than one specimen at a time from different locations, source was recorded as \u201cvarious.\u201d All but two artefacts had clear geographic and/or cultural affiliations offered. The presence of any kind of legal \u201cnotice\u201d was also recorded; specifically whether or not mention was made by the dealer to prospective buyers of the legality or illegality of the import or export of these objects, locally or internationally. The next category of data recorded was whether or not any provenance (ownership history) was listed, including stated date of collection. This data was recorded together with whether or not any published literature was cited to provide further documentation of authenticity to prospective buyers. Finally, additional miscellaneous information was recorded, such as whether the specific item listed was currently for sale or already sold, and any other pertinent notes, any associated identifying information such as former medical or museum labels, display stands, etc. Recording data in this manner allowed us to extract as much information as possible from each online gallery website or notice of sale, while the individual specimen count method of tabulation provides for a more realistic, and more readily quantifiable, sample size. We now turn to the findings of our exploratory research.\nWho is trafficking and what is being trafficked?\nThe sellers of human remains recorded in our study fall into three general categories: auction houses, online galleries and private dealers (see Table 1). While the recording of a dealer, gallery or auction house in the database constructed for the purposes of this research necessarily implies that the vendor has an online presence (whether or not all of their stock is displayed at any one time), the manner in which each category of dealer markets their wares was found to differ. Auction houses, as expected, target more high end individual, gallery or museum affiliated buyers, and thus are more likely to provide prices or estimates for forthcoming sales, as well as citations of reference literature and at least a generic statement of ownership history, even if only \u201cfrom a private collection,\u201d as was encountered frequently in this survey. In fact, the \u201cold private collection\u201d label was used to explain ownership history at least 16 times by all categories of dealer, almost entirely in regards to trophy skulls, and the majority of specimens (greater than 70 %) had no proffered ownership history at all aside from perhaps a rough age estimate. Table 1 here records individual specimen counts for each specimen category by dealer category.\nOnline galleries are here defined as websites either run entirely online but devoted to selling around a theme (e.g. \u201coceanic art;\u201d \u201cantiquities,\u201d \u201cthe macabre,\u201d \u201coddities\u201d) or produced and updated by the oft-named owners of a store front dealership with an address and email account. They often contain mission statements or seller biographies/collecting histories, frequently sell items from other dealers or private individuals on commission, stress the authenticity of what they sell, highlight dealer\u2019s association memberships, and provide means for customers to keep updated on events and pay securely online. Private sellers, on the other hand, are more likely be anonymous or sell under an alias, purveying their wares through channels such as eBay, and be less likely to offer warranties, refunds, or take responsibility for arranging shipping, Customs clearance, etc.\nIn the human remains trade, as in the antiquities trade overall, the boundary between online gallery and private dealer can often blur. Given the history of relatively lax oversight of antiquities sales online and an expectation that small-scale dealers will voluntarily comply with relevant laws [36], it is perhaps to be expected that the majority of artefacts/specimens recorded were encountered as for sale or sold by online galleries or private dealers. Table 2 compares artefact category to the general location of all categories of dealers. It should be noted that not every specimen able to be categorized by artefact type or dealer category could be categorized by dealer location, given the ephemeral nature of e-commerce. The most immediate observation is that the majority of dealers serving the \u2018demand\u2019 side market in human remains, such as it is, exist in North America (primarily the United States), as well as Europe (France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium). Of the very few dealers located in the Indo-Pacific region, almost all had Australian addresses or email addresses although one Auckland, New Zealand auction house sold a trophy skull in March 2011. A dental supply company that provides full sets of real human teeth to medical schools from unstated sources has active offices in India, Canada, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Only one dealer was found to be based in a source country itself; specifically, an online gallery in the Philippines that allegedly recently sold two mounted Ifugao/Igorot trophy skulls, and refused to ship to Belgium given a \u201cbad experience with Customs\u201d) [37].\nIn regard to the question of what items are being trafficked in the global human remains trade, several categories are also provided, as detailed in Tables 1 and 2 above. Very occasionally, cases involving the \u2018primary market\u2019 surface, in which examples of archaeological artefacts with associated human remains freshly surfaced from new, illicit, excavations appear on line [38, 39]. However, one of us (DH) has observed numerous other examples of artefacts containing soil and human remains for sale in small antique/souvenir shops in both Vietnam and Cambodia as recently as 2011. We have also found at least one example of the attempted online sale of an antiquity with provenience to a specific (but unmentioned) archaeological site or museum collection; namely, the head of an Egyptian mummy offered through a Dallas, Texas, auction house [40]. As with the case of Shesepamuntayesher above, not only was important contextual information lost in the acquiring of these specimens for the illicit market, but it is likely that irreparable damage was caused to the mummies themselves. The vast majority of specimens discovered for sale online constitute a \u2018secondary market,\u2019 being primarily ethnographic or former medical specimens sold far from their country of origin, and at least occasionally derived from deaccessioned museum, university or private collections. The question remains as to how much of a given artefact or specimen\u2019s stated provenance, as presented online, is genuine and the result of performing due diligence, or fabricated.\nThe \u2018secondary market\u2019 examples identified by our study primarily fell within two broad categories. The majority (174/420; 41.4 %) were ethnographic trophy skulls from a wide variety of cultural and geographic contexts. The next most prevalent category (148/420; 35.2 %) consisted of specimens sold as former medical teaching tools, or those sold for the purported purpose of current medical research. The next most prevalent category (89/420; 21.2 %) consisted of antique and ethnographic artefacts from South Asia (Tibet, Nepal, India, Bhutan) made from modified portions of specific skeletal elements, and with intended use in Buddhist ritual practice. Nine examples (9/420; 2.1 %) of what are here termed \u201cethnographic curios,\u201d as well as specimens derived from (and sometimes advertised as deriving from) archaeological sites were also recorded. These objects comprised a necklace containing human and animal teeth sourced to the Sepik River region of Papua New Guinea (sold by a prominent German auction house); various human long bones, crania and skulls purported to derive from Haiti and allegedly prepared outside the United States, but sold at a location within US jurisdiction; two \u201ctantric\u201d carved Nepalese skulls inlaid with silver and copper [41], a cranium advertised as recovered from a Neolithic cave site in Algeria, and even portions of Egyptian mummies.\nSpecimens offered by anonymous private dealers on eBay specifically consisted solely of alleged former medical or dental study specimens. Performing searches over the entire designated investigatory time period revealed a total of six examples of genuine human remains for sale, all listed with some variation of the disclaimers that either the specimen was suitable for medical or dental research, or as \u201carticulated for medical use.\u201d Specimen locations at time of auction included Germany, Belgium, Italy, Missouri and Utah in the United States, and Quebec in Canada. Specimen category was evenly divided between disarticulated skulls and complete articulated or repaired skeletons on display stands (or suitable for hanging display). Prices ranged from US $900\u20134,599. With one exception, all specimens lacked any written mention or photographic evidence for a geographic source, so one cannot assume that the specimens originated in or near the listed location. Only one specimen (the most expensive one; a complete skeleton of a \u201cpathological,\u201d \u201chunchbacked\u201d individual allegedly deceased and/or collected c. 1950) contained a clear statement by the seller that the sale complied with local law and eBay policy. In all other instances, caveat emptor was advocated, with the buyer being advised to check local laws before buying or being held responsible for paying Customs fees and assuming all risks for Customs clearance. Only three of the specimens contained any statement of provenance, but all no more specific than \u201cfrom a doctor\u2019s estate,\u201d \u201cfrom a medical studio,\u201d or \u201cfrom a Canadian University.\u201d\nAlthough all specimens are stated by the sellers to be legal to sell, none offered warranties or liability for uninsured shipping, returns, etc. Importantly in light of what Huxley and Finnegan [24] revealed regarding specimens of possible medico-legal import being sold online, one of the current specimens (sold via the eBay store \u201cGeneticks,\u201d with the specimen allegedly located in St. Louis, Missouri) was an adult, male, Caucasian skull with purported healed blunt force trauma to the frontal bone. The fact that the specimen is listed as such suggests eBay continues to ignore the possibility that specimens with medico-legal import can still be sold under their current regulations. Significantly, using the same keywords and search parameters on Amazon.com turned up no examples of the active sale of genuine human remains, although animal specimens and resin replicas were present.\nWho is buying?\nThree categories of potential purchaser of human remains online have been suggested by this market analysis. They are a) collectors of ethnographic (\u201ctribal\u201d or \u201cprimitive\u201d) art; b) seekers of medical specimens for either legitimate research purposes or as novelty items; and c) practitioners of specific religions or religious sects around the world, primarily in North America. Overall, our data suggests that the vast majority of dealers in such artefacts (with an online presence) are based in European or North American countries, primarily the US, UK, France and Germany. This includes private dealers operating through channels such as eBay. However, this does not necessarily imply that all individuals who might bid on or purchase from said dealers are located locally, or are walk-in traffic; on-line purchases can occur from anywhere, especially in illicit markets [36]. Similar to the antiquities trade in general, the growth and relatively minimal \u201cself-policing\u201d of e-commerce makes tracking and controlling the human bone trade exceptionally difficult. Research such as that presented here can only act as a representative sample to \u201cupdate\u201d what is known about purchasers and \u201cmerchandise.\u201d\nThe global and Indo-Pacific ethnographic (\u201ctribal\u201d or \u201cprimitive\u201d) art market posits that an artefact\u2019s age, whether it was manufactured (skilfully or poorly) for the art market itself, whether it has been repaired, and the overall purpose of manufacture are crucial questions to answer when gauging inherent \u201cworth\u201d to both dealer and buyer [42, 43]. Although the mythos surrounding so-called \u2018headhunting\u2019 trophies does not necessarily reflect ethnographic reality, at least in the case of the Dayak [44], it is arguably a selling point. Regardless of whether or not a given trophy skull was purchased out of perhaps misunderstood fear or reverence for a \u201csavage\u201d tradition, or to commemorate its perceived passing, human dignity must be denied the ethnographic \u201cother\u201d before a skull can become an objectified \u201ccurio.\u201d\nFor those seeking memento mori, the skull of a 14th century saint, for example, represents a different category of \u201cethnographica\u201d [45] that includes artefacts such as prosthetic limbs, old medicine bottles, deformed animals, etc. Although the legal donation of human bones derived from autopsies could supply hospitals and medical schools with teaching specimens (upon donation of one\u2019s body to science), the use of grandiose descriptors such as \u201cextraordinary,\u201d \u201crare,\u201d \u201cvaluable,\u201d and \u201cspooky\u201d by, for example, eBay dealers in alleged medical specimens seem to emphasize the novelty factor of owning human remains above other concerns. Finally, practitioners of specific religions/religious sects such as Vajrayana Buddhism (see below) or Palo Mayombe seek human remains, or artefacts made from them, to invoke the dead to heal, harm, or bring ancestral power or guidance into one\u2019s daily life. Whether practitioners are Western converts seeking to demonstrate their devotion to their new faith, or members of diasporas seeking to maintain practices crucial to their identity, the necessity of and \u201cauthenticity\u201d lent by use of real human remains makes acquisition by even illicit means worth it for some.\nRegional case studies\nSouth Asia\nFor the purposes of this research, South Asia encompasses Tibet, Nepal, India and Bhutan. Almost the entire subsample of human remains specimens or artefacts currently or recently sold on the global market which can be sourced to these countries consist of items intended for use by practitioners of \u201cCh\u00f6d\u201d healing rituals of the Vajrayana/Mantrayana lineages of Tibetan Buddhism [46\u201348]. As the tables above indicate, several examples of \u201ckangling\u201d (human bone trumpet, usually made from femora or tibiae) and \u201ckapala\u201d (cups or bowls made from human calvaria, known as Th\u00f6pa in Tibetan) continue to be sold or offered online. Many kapala are ornately decorated with inlaid copper, silver, or real or fake precious gems and kangling routinely have animal (preferably goat) skin covering the distal end of the femur (see Fig. 1 below). Examples of skull-cap \u201cdamaru\u201d (small, two headed skin drums) were also recorded. Finally, two examples of antique artefacts made from carved segments of human bone reused as bracelets or as part of an \u2018apron\u2019 were also documented. Prices of items recorded here range from US $250 to AUD $4,599 (ritual bone \u2018apron\u2019), with most specimens towards the low end of that range. Most have stated age estimates of early-late 1900s, but at least one dealer states that all newly created kapala and kangling sold are sourced to the \u201ctribal remote Bhutanese community of Sakten, located in far Eastern Bhutan,\u201d given that Bhutan is the only nation in the region from which human bone can be legally exported [47]. A few examples of recently sold or available Naga trophy skulls (northeast Indian states of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam; tribe unspecified) were also recorded.\nSoutheast Asia\nSoutheast Asian specimens currently offered for sale consist primarily of ethnographic \u201ctrophy\u201d skulls sourced to former head-hunting cultures of Malaysian and Indonesian Borneo (e.g. Kendayan, Dayak, Melawi) (see Fig. 2 below), as well as the Ifugao and Bontoc tribes of the Philippines. Trophy skulls from these cultures represent a significant proportion of those recorded (66/174; 37.9 %), and many are intricately carved and decorated, sometimes stained or coated in a brown patina, and sometimes mounted on display boards in pairs or triplets, or accompanied by faunal remains such as boar skulls [37]. Most are offered for sale as stand-alone items, but one or two specimens consist of half-skulls (Dayak) or a mandible attached to a gong/mallet instrument in the case of the Bontoc specimen. Many of these specimens were listed as already sold or as for sale by private arrangement, but those with listed price are no more than $3,000 (or AUD $4,600, in the case of the Ifugao mounted specimen for sale at the time of writing). Some specimens allegedly derive from named collections dating to the late 1800s or 1900s (e.g. Ex Elizabeth Grunwald, Grenoble, France; Ex Francois Coppens, Brussels, Belgium). The remainder allegedly derive from private European collections or have no stated provenance (the dealers simply providing a rough age estimate of production and/or collection). Only a few examples of published literature exist that document Dayak trophy skulls within old collections [49], while other research analysed \u201ctrophy skulls\u201d taken from Japanese and Vietnamese soldiers by returning servicemen during WWII and the Vietnam War respectively, or from a private eBay sale [50\u201352].\nThe most demonstrative and important case study to involve the illicit traffic of archaeological human remains from the Indo-Pacific region into Australia has been described in detail elsewhere [39]. It involved the attempted online sale of Iron Age (c. 2,500\u20131,500 BP) bronze bangles, finger rings, earrings, and forearm and wrist guards fashioned from single sheets of decorated bronze, still frequently found for sale in public markets in rural and urban Cambodia, as well as regional transit point cities such as Bangkok and Singapore [53]. What makes this case unique in an Australian and global context is that many of the objects in question still contained soil and human bone. Although no additional archaeological specimens of this type from Southeast Asia or elsewhere were documented during the period of this study, this does not mean that off-line commerce, especially within source countries, does not occur.\nThe Pacific\nThe vast majority of individual artefacts and ethnographic specimens documented in this survey originally derive from cultures indigenous to Island Southeast Asian or Pacific Island nations, particularly Papua New Guinea, Indonesia (Irian Jaya), Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands, with the vast majority being ethnographic trophy skulls. Using the individual count method, of the 174 \u201ctrophy\u201d skulls recorded from the online records of all dealers combined, 28 (16.09 %) are sourced to the Asmat, eight (4.5 %) to the Iatmul, six (3.4 %) to Vanuatu tribes, four (2.2 %) to various Sepik river tribes and one each from unspecified \u201cSoloman Islands,\u201d \u201cIrian Jaya,\u201d \u201cWest Papua,\u201d \u201cGulf Province,\u201d or \u201cMay River\u201d tribes (see Table 3 and Fig. 3 below). A further 11 specimens (6.3 %) were documented as having a general Papua New Guinea provenience, but with region and ethnic group unspecified. While there is some evidence that certain New Guinea cultures such as the Iatmul continue to produce so-called \u201cover modelled skulls\u201d as an aspect of tangible heritage [54], scholarly analysis of colonial-era collections of, for example, Asmat material culture suggests that the inclusion of trophy skulls in collections served the competing needs of missionaries and early anthropologists at a time when headhunting traditions were ending [55], but that museum, collector, and indigenous demand continue to drive the market [56].\nMany of the Indo-Pacific region ethnographic specimens with any stated ownership history derive from colonial-era collections by European, American or Australian officials stationed in Island Southeast Asia or the Pacific [49, 57], so their dispersal and eventual sale by European or American dealers is not surprising. Satisfying the \u201ctribal\u201d art collecting community\u2019s self-imposed criteria of \u201cauthenticity,\u201d age, adhering to local aesthetics, and use by \u201ctribal\u201d people in \u201ctribal contexts\u201d [42, 43], it is likely that trophy skulls from the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere might be more actively collected if more existed on the market, given the near complete lack of legislation related to cultural property exportation from the region, or cultural property related MoU agreements between source and demand countries [58]. As it stands, successful confiscation and repatriation appears few and far between for human remains sourced to this region [59, 60].\nAfrica and the near East\nVery few specimens genuinely or allegedly sourced to African or Middle-Eastern nations were observed over the course of this research, but those that were recorded seem to derive from the same two online galleries; one in France (or possibly Belgium; no exact contact address was listed on the website), and the other by the same German auction house discussed above. As Table 3 shows, in regards to specimens categorized as trophy skulls, the French (or Franco-Belgian) dealer had, at the time of our study, recently sold 16 specimens sourced to Benin, 15 to Togo, and three to Nigeria (19.5 % of the total). The German gallery, on the other hand, sold one specimen from a Cameroonian ethnic group (Bangwa), one from Nigeria (Tiv) and one from Togo (ethnic group unnamed) (1.7 %). Aside from the Egyptian mummies or mummy fragments discussed above, the Near East is also represented in our assemblage by at least one skull (previously sold by the abovementioned French or Franco-Belgian dealer) said to derive from an Algerian Neolithic site (exact provenience unspecified). The fact that trophy skulls and other ethnographic \u201ccuriosities\u201d from West and Central Africa were able to find markets and buyers within their former colonial ruling states is not surprising, but does suggest that the proffering and purchase of such items is motivated by more than just \u201caesthetics.\u201d Indeed, the inclusion of such items as softly-lit black and white photographs of nude African women in the same on-line catalogue suggests that capitalizing on the \u201cexoticism\u201d (perhaps, perversely, the \u201ceroticism\u201d) and \u201cotherness\u201d of both the people and their ritual items might still influence the purchasing decisions of well-to-do individuals in the market, long after the era of colonial subjugation ended.\nThe on-line sales records of the auction catalogues, unsurprisingly, do not mention who the buyers were, or whether or not they were genetically indigenous to West Africa or culturally affiliated with the ethnic groups in question. If they were, then perhaps the purchase of such esoteric items was done with the intent to repatriate them. A potentially contrasting example can be seen in the case of several Hopi \u201ckatsinam\u201d masks (considered sacred objects by historic-period and contemporary Hopi Native Americans) sold at auction in Paris despite evidence that at least one had been recently stolen, and that the sale violated US law, Hopi law, and the UNESCO Convention [61]. In this case, the auction house (Neret-Minet Tessier & Sarrou) asserted that all of the masks had been acquired legally, despite protest, and that the nameless bidder had \u201cpeerless taste.\u201d In a twist, the losing attorney paid for one of the masks at auction out of his own funds so as to repatriate it to Hopi representatives [62]. However, at least four additional katsinam masks purchased were also repatriated, including items purchased by Pierre Servan-Schreiber [63], Richelle Dassin [64], and Monroe Washburn [65]. In addition, several other culturally significant artifacts were purchased in December, 2013, by the Annenburg Foundation, also in Paris, but have since been repatriated [66]. Although human remains were not involved in the Hopi auctions, if the West African specimens discussed above were bought for purposes of repatriation, it would be an unusual act for a private collector to carry out, as opposed to museums that might eventually repatriate if pressured [19].\nLatin America\nOnly one specimen, an allegedly Huari skull from Peru, was recorded during our investigation. Being already sold by the German auction house discussed above, this specimen is unique amongst the trophy skulls recorded in this study in that it appears to be mummified, still containing skin, lips, and possibly hair (although the forehead is wrapped with a woven cloth band). The eyes have been replaced by seeds (see Fig. 4). Unlike trophy skulls from the Indo-Pacific region previously sold by this auction house, this specimen is labelled as merely a \u201ccuriosity,\u201d with provenance given only as \u201cSiguas, sur de Arequipa, Peru.\u201d If accurate, this would give a rough provenience of the Santa Rita de Siguas district, Arequipa Province, in southeastern Peru [67]. The date range offered for the specimen is (\u201cpresumably\u201d) 800\u20131000 AD, which does overlap the currently accepted chronology of the Huari (\u201cWari\u201d in English) state that controlled much of the south-central Andean and coastal regions of Peru during the Middle Horizon period c. 500\u20131000 AD [68].\nWari sites, especially intact mortuary sites, are incredibly rare discoveries, with most having been looted well before archaeologists can reach them [69]. When Wari burials and trophy skulls have been recovered from secure archaeological contexts, they have provided a wealth of information about not only the expansion and eventual \u201ccollapse\u201d of the Wari Empire, but also the daily lives of both rulers and subjects [70, 71]. Due to the only very general provenience and the complete lack of ownership history proffered to the bidder at least in the catalogue itself, one might reasonably conclude that this specimen has its origins in the rampant burial looting that has afflicted archaeological sites of many prehistoric cultures throughout Peru for decades, if not centuries [72]. Despite Peru being signatory to all major international Conventions on cultural property, having MoU agreements with numerous South and Central American Countries, South Africa (pending), Turkey, and the US (notable European exceptions being France and Germany), the traffic apparently continues, and might even be increasing [73]. The generic category of \u201chuman remains\u201d is included in the ICOM Red List of Peruvian Antiquities at Risk [74], but this category does not make specific mention to Wari period remains. However, notice is given to Customs agents that \u201cany antiquity that may have originated in Peru should be subjected to detailed scrutiny and precautionary measures.\u201d The situation in other Latin American countries is much less well known, but there is at least tentative evidence for a trade (desired or actual) in other categories of human remains, such as \u201ctsantsa\u201d (so-called shrunken heads) from the Jivaro region, Ecuador [75].\nEuropean source countries?\nThe question of historic-period specimens from European market countries such as England, Italy, Germany and France also being a part of the global human remains trade is worth examining in more detail. Our preliminary investigation revealed three dealers that represent case studies warranting further discussion; one the abovementioned German auction house, the second the abovementioned French (or Franco-Belgian) online gallery, and the third a private dealer in natural history/taxidermy specimens out of northern England. Numerous other dealers (11 dealers with stand-alone websites, and 32 private eBay dealers currently or recently active) were also recorded as current or recent buyers and sellers of human remains allegedly sourced to old European ex-medical collections or Victorian-era curio collections. In fact, the majority of medical specimens recorded for sale or recently sold by on-line galleries or private dealers have either no stated source, or derive from European or North American collections, some with \u2018back stories\u2019 purporting to tie the specimen in question to famous murder cases. For example, the German auction house mentioned above having recently sold the nearly-complete skeleton of the \u201clast man hanged in Hessen, Germany,\u201d allegedly executed in the 1500s.\nPart 4: Conclusion\nThe exploratory research presented above has revealed an active global trade in human remains, including archaeological and ethnographic artefacts and former or current medical specimens. It is a trade which in the main appears to be carried out by currently licit means although as the Shesepamuntayesher case referred to above indicates there is also an illicit component of this market whose true dimensions still eludes description and analysis. While our research does suggest that the attempted open sale of human remains derived from archaeological sites is a very rare occurrence, it is impossible to know the true extent of the trade from online data alone. As the in-store or street-level observations of human remains for sale made by one of us (DH) in Southeast Asia in 2011 (Vietnam) and 2007 (Cambodia), and 2013 (United States), \u201cpublic\u201d art, antiques or antiquities dealers at least partially dependent on walk-in traffic could easily arrange for the sale of illicit goods via an in-person appointment at another location. This being said, the evidence at this stage suggests that the most prominent demand countries are located in North America and Europe, while the specimens and artefacts themselves can be sourced or stored anywhere, including from collections that derive from market countries themselves, such as Germany or Italy. Auction houses, smaller online galleries (occasionally associated with off-line dealers operating out of store fronts), and individual sellers using platforms such as eBay are all participants.\nProspective buyers were able to be categorized into three broad, and potentially overlapping categories; namely collectors of ethnographic (\u201ctribal\u201d) art/curios, collectors of medical specimens for either legitimate educational purposes or as \u201cmacabre\u201d novelty items, and practitioners of specific religious sects or practices, such as the Ch\u00f6d healing rituals in Vajrayana Buddhism or Palo Mayombe. Marketing rhetoric and the degree of transparency provided by dealers regarding ownership history and the legality of import or export varied greatly, with most dealers providing no more than the suggestion that buyers \u201ccheck local laws.\u201d Such a caution is certainly warranted since it is apparent that national and even local laws differ widely in regard to most if not all aspects of dealing in any way with human remains including not only their export and import but also their burial or cremation; transportation and storage; dissection and preservation; sale or display [14]. Take, for example, the case of Australia from where our research has been conducted. No uniform national legislation exists in Australia regarding the treatment of human remains and it is left to each of the states and territories of the Australian Federation to regulate this subject area. In regard to the specific import or export of human remains into or from the country the Australian Customs and Border Protection Agency (ACBPA) official website states that there is no need to make either an import or export declaration but:\n\u201cIf you intend to import human remains or ashes into Australia you should contact the Australian Embassy in the country from where the remains are to be exported prior to importation into Australia. The source country may have specific requirements or conditions associated with the movement or export of human remains or ashes\u201d [76].\nHaving made this statement the ACBPA asserts elsewhere, under the headings of \u2018moveable cultural heritage\u2019 and \u2018foreign cultural property, that there are restrictions which apply to certain categories of human remains. Thus the remains of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, including bark and log coffins used in ceremonial burial, cannot be exported while other human remains that have been removed from their place of discovery for 50 years or more may require a permit to be exported [77]. Further, Australian\u2019s traveling abroad who wish to import remains are reminded of their obligation to comply with local laws relating to the export of cultural property, and that if a permit is required they may be requested to produce it to ACBPA at the border. Australian citizens are also reminded that substantial penalties apply, including seizure and forfeiture of illegally obtained foreign protected objects, to those who fail to meet these requirements [77].\nEarlier research discussed elsewhere [38, 39] suggests that the seizure and forfeiture penalties referred to by ACBPA are in practice largely unenforceable and that Australian border protections against the import of all types of illegally obtained and protected cultural heritage objects of foreign origin are woefully inadequate. Not only are the legal protections defective but so too are the abilities of border officials to identify suspect imports and question dubious importers. ACBPA currently lacks the specialist investigative and prosecutorial skills displayed by ICE and the HIS in the US. Efforts to increase the overall awareness of Australian customs agents to art and antiquities crime continue, but progress is slow and incremental [78]. Given the history of active, reactive, and sometimes contradictory public and private collecting by Europeans throughout the Indo-Pacific region discussed above [30, 79], the fact that very few ethnographic items containing human remains were being sold by Australia-based dealers is somewhat surprising, especially considering the relatively weak cultural property legislation currently in place [38].\nThe extent to which the situation described briefly here in Australia applies to other countries remains unclear but the research data as a whole suggests that the human remains trade continues to be a relatively minor but overlooked (and potentially growing) aspect of the global illicit antiquities trade, functioning under the principle of caveat emptor. Given that replica bones would likely not suffice in any of the collecting communities discussed, Customs seizures and prosecutions for illicit exportation or importation cannot be expected to increase in future without better training for border control officials and unless laws are updated to close the existing loopholes that allow the sale and transport of human remains, especially in source countries. Genuine human remains are arguably more readily identifiable by international customs authorities, but statements of \u201cfor educational use\u201d might mask trade in specimens actually sourced to illicit excavations of new archaeological sites, as opposed to actual medical teaching specimens. Fundamentally, what is needed is greater dealer transparency coupled with online retail networks such as eBay requiring sellers and buyers to comply demonstrably with pre-existing policy.\nSeveral examples of the means by which the licit and illicit sale of human remains continues to occur, especially without sufficient and verifiable due diligence, have recently received media attention. In January, 2010, the World Archaeological Congress (WAC) called upon Christie\u2019s auction house to withdraw from sale one human skull and two femora once affiliated with Yale University\u2019s Skull and Bones Society [80]. Emphasizing that not enough information was at hand at the time of the sale to be certain that the remains were not Native American, nor that no federal laws or international accords would not be violated, Christie\u2019s eventually bowed to pressure, but only because \u201canother party claimed rights to the remains\u201d [81]. WAC ethics protocol includes redress to the Vermillion Accord on Human Remains and the Tamaki Makau-rau Accord on the Display of Human Remains and Sacred Objects [82], bolstering their official objection to the sale. Although these Accords are valuable in efforts to prevent illicit or questionable sale or acquisition of human remains, Christie\u2019s own explanation for withdrawing the lot suggests little heed was paid. In addition, other cases, such as the ransacking of the graves of WWI war dead for saleable relics and memorabilia (doing irreparable damage to context and the skeletons themselves in the process), suggests much more educational effort is needed [83].\nThe issue of the violation of the basic human dignity of the dead that is required for this trade to continue is reinforced by, for example, a UK based private dealer offering an item consisting of a human skull (allegedly Dayak) and an animal skull (primate) tied together with cordage and decorated. A warning is given to potential buyers that importation of this piece might be prohibited in their country without a CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna) permit. CITES permits are required in order to import or export endangered faunal specimens, especially if quarantine for possible biological hazard prevention will be needed. The lack of any kind of advice or warning against the importation of human remains given by this seller, then, suggests that less importance and legal \u2018risk\u2019 was assigned to their international shipment. Very occasionally, ethical collectors of such material will intervene and notify authorities when very suspect, or especially macabre, cases (potentially damaging to their reputation) arise [84], however the research presented above strongly suggests that expecting the online human remains trade to become fully self-regulatory is relatively futile. Unless more direct regulatory provisions are put in place and enforced in both source and demand countries, trade in the \u2018mainly nameless and faceless dead\u2019 will continue, with only the occasional arrest or sensational news story to attest to its existence, and bioarchaeologists in the field left to pick up the pieces.\nReferences\nChoi, C.

      "text": "Over the past few years, deepfakes have emerged as the internet\u2019s latest go-to for memes and parody content.\nIt\u2019s easy to see why: They enable creators to bend the rules of reality like no other technology before. Through the magic of deepfakes, you can watch Jennifer Lawrence deliver a speech through the face of Steve Buscemi, see what Ryan Reynolds would\u2019ve looked like as Willy Wonka, and even catch Hitler and Stalin singing Video Killed The Radio Star in a duet.\nFor the uninitiated, deepfake tech is a form of synthetic media that allows users to superimpose a different face on someone else\u2019s in a way that\u2019s nearly indistinguishable from the original. It does so by reading heaps of data to understand the face\u2019s contours and other characteristics to naturally blend and animate it into the scene.\nAt this point, you\u2019ve probably come across such clips on platforms like TikTok (where the hashtag \u201c#deepfake\u201d has about 200 million views), YouTube, and elsewhere. Whether it\u2019s to fulfill fan fiction and redo scenes with stars they wish the movie originally had cast or put a dead person in a modern, viral meme, deepfakes have been adopted as a creative outlet for purposes that were previously next to impossible.\nThe shift has spawned a league of new creators like Ctrl Shift Face, whose deepfake videos regularly draw millions of views and often are the main topic of discussion on late-night talk shows.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole new way of making funny internet videos, or telling stories like we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d says the Netherlands-based creator behind the hit \u201cThe Avengers of Oz\u201d deepfake clip who asked that his real name not be used. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful combination of fascination for A.I. technology and humor.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a looming risk that threatens the future of deepfake technology altogether: Its tainted reputation.\nWith great power comes great repostability\nUnfortunately, in addition to their potential as a creative tool for well-intentioned video artists, deepfakes also carry a tremendous potential to do harm.\nA recent study by the Dawes Centre for Future Crime at the UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science labeled deepfakes the most serious A.I.-enabled threat. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraskan Republican who has introduced a bill to criminalize the malicious creation of deepfakes, warned last year that the technology could \u201cdestroy human lives,\u201d \u201croil financial markets,\u201d and even \u201cspur military conflicts around the world.\u201d\nTo an extent, these concerns are fair. After all, the proliferation of deepfake technology has already enabled things like the production of fake adult content featuring celebrities, and lifelike impersonations of politicians for satire. Earlier this year, Dan Scavino, White House social media director, tweeted a poorly manipulated clip, which was also retweeted by President Donald Trump, of Trump\u2019s rival Joe Biden asking people to re-elect Trump.\nHowever, these less-than-convincing hoaxes have quickly been debunked before reaching the masses. More importantly, experts suggest deepfake videos have thus far had little to no societal impact, and that they currently don\u2019t pose any imminent threats. For example, research conducted by Sensity, a cybersecurity firm focused on visual threats, claims that the vast majority of deepfake videos are pornographic (96%) and that the technology has yet to make its way into any significant disinformation campaigns.\nSimilarly, a Georgetown University report concluded that while deepfakes are an \u201cimpressive technical feat,\u201d policymakers should not rush into the hype as the technology is not perfect at the moment and can\u2019t influence real-world events just yet.\nThe creator behind the most popular deepfake channel Ctrl Shift Face, whose videos are viewed by millions, believes the \u201chysteria\u201d circling around the deepfake topic is diverting lawmakers\u2019 attention away from the real issues, such as the poorly regulated ad networks on Facebook that are actually responsible for misleading people.\n\u201cIf there ever will be a harmful deepfake, Facebook is the place where it will spread,\u201d Ctrl Shift Face said in an interview with Digital Trends. \u201cIn that case, what\u2019s the bigger issue? The medium or the platform?\u201d\nThe owner of BabyZone, a YouTube gaming channel with over half a million subscribers that often deepfakes celebrities into video games, echoes a similar concern: \u201cI think that deepfakes are a technology like all the other existing technologies. They can be used for good and for bad purposes.\u201d\nThe movement to save deepfakes\nOver the last year or two, as governments and tech companies investigate the potential risks of this technology, deepfake advocates have scrambled to allay these concerns and fix the technology\u2019s public image. Reddit communities that seek to \u201cadjust this stigma\u201d have popped up, and some independent researchers are actively building systems that can spot deepfakes before they go viral.\nRoman Mogylnyi, CEO and co-founder of Reface, a hit app that lets you quickly swap your face into any GIF, says his startup is now developing a detection tool that can tell whether a video was made with Reface\u2019s technology. \u201cWe believe that wide access to synthesized media tools like ours will increase humanity\u2019s empathy and creativit, and will help to change the perception of the technology for better,\u201d Mogylnyi told Digital Trends.\nEran Dagan, founder and CEO of Botika, the startup behind the popular face-swapping app Jiggy, has a similar outlook toward deepfakes and believes as they become more mainstream, \u201cpeople will be much more aware of their positive use cases.\u201d\nGiven the potential dangers of deepfakes, however, it\u2019s likely that Congress will eventually step in. Major tech platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube already have updated their policies to flag or remove manipulated media that\u2019s designed to mislead. Multiple states like California and New York have passed bills that will punish makers of intentionally deceptive deepfakes, as well as ones released without consent of the person whose face is used.\nShould deepfakes be regulated?\nWhile these policies exclude parody content, experts, fearing ill-defined laws or a complete ban of the technology, still believe Congress should stay out of it and let deepfakes run the natural course that any new form of media goes through.\nDavid Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says \u201cany attempt by Congress to regulate deep fakes or really any kind of visual communication will be a regulation of speech and implicate the First Amendment.\n\u201cSociety needs to build new mechanisms for certifying what can be trusted, and how to prevent the negative impacts of synthetic content on individuals and organizations.\u201d\nThese laws, Greene adds, need to be precise and must \u2014 in well-defined and easily understood terms \u2014 address the harm they\u2019re trying to curtail. \u201cWhat we have seen so far \u2026 regulatory attempts at the state level are vague and overbroad laws that do not have the precision the First Amendment requires. They don\u2019t have required exceptions for parody and political commentary.\u201d\nGiorgio Patrini, CEO of Sensity, finds a ban on algorithms and software \u201cmeaningless in the internet era.\u201d Patrini compares this conundrum with malware protection and how it\u2019s next to impossible to put an end to all computer viruses or their authors, so it\u2019s better to simply invest in anti-malware mechanisms instead. \u201cSociety needs to build new mechanisms for certifying what can be trusted, and how to prevent the negative impacts of synthetic content on individuals and organizations,\u201d he said.\nTim Whang wrote in the Georgetown University report that with the commodification of deepfake tools, the technology to detect and filter it out automatically will consequently evolve and become more accurate \u2014 thereby neutralizing their ability to present any serious threats.\nMicrosoft\u2019s recently launched deepfake detection tool, for instance, analyzes the videos to offer you a confidence score that indicates how likely it is that the video was modified.\n\u201cDeepfakes are a new form of media manipulation, but not the first time we\u2019ve faced this type of challenge. We are exploring and investing in ways to address synthetic media,\u201d said a YouTube spokesperson.\nThe researchers behind CtrlShiftLab, an advanced deepfake creation software that many YouTubers including Ctrl Shift Face employ, are now also working toward open-source projects to raise awareness and build more comprehensive detection services.\n\u201cThe only way to prevent this [deepfake abuse] is to establish an open source deepfake-related project and attract the public\u2019s attention. So public netizens can realize that deepfakes exist,\u201d Kunlin Liu, one of the CtrlShiftLab\u2019s researchers, told Digital Trends.\nSeveral deepfake creators Digital Trends talked to remain optimistic and find countries\u2019 pushback against deepfakes premature. They agree that deepfake\u2019s growing role in memes and parody culture will be instrumental in mending this emerging tech\u2019s crummy reputation. And as long as videos have disclaimers and platforms invest in more effective detection layers, they added, deepfakes are here to stay.\n\u201cI think that the reputation of deepfakes is improving significantly. Two years ago, the word deepfake automatically meant porn,\u201d said the creator of Ctrl Shift Face. \u201cNow, most people know deepfakes because of these entertaining videos circulating around the internet.\u201d"

      "text": "Social media juggernaut Facebook is the primary online fixture for a lot of folks (1.15 billion monthly active users as of June 2013, to be exact) \u2013 this is probably why it\u2019s constantly under attack or serious scrutiny. The social network is not only plagued by lawsuits, viruses, catfishers, money lenders, and the government\u2019s watchful eye\u2026 with the amount of people freely offering all sorts of pertinent details about their personal lives on Facebook, a rise in identity fraud on the site is bound to happen.\nA report from The Japan News details many scenarios wherein Facebook users are duped into surrendering personal information through fake posts that solicit likes, votes, or link clicks. Messages have been found to lead to a page that asks users for contact details (like a phone number), and since these links are believed to be sent by a \u201cfriend,\u201d they think nothing of it and acquiesce, ending up the unwitting victims of identity theft.\nThese fraudsters and hackers are known to take advantage of the relationships people build on Facebook, banking on the fact that most users mindlessly peruse their News Feed out of habit. Sometimes, scammers even take great lengths at fooling users by venturing out of Facebook and reaching out to targets via other methods. Greg Boyle, senior global product marketing manager for antiviral software company Trend Micro, recently wrote about his experience: He had received an email notification claiming a person (who was not on his Facebook friends list) tagged him in photos. At first glace, the email looked legitimate and similar to one that\u2019s generated by Facebook when you have email notifications set up in your settings, but upon further investigation, Boyle found that the email he received was fraudulent and was actually an attempt at a Blackhole Exploit Kit (BHEK) spam run: Links in the email redirect the user to a different page, causing malware to be automatically downloaded into their system. \u201cEvidence of past BHEK runs show they generally use financial institutions, e-commerce and global events as lures that get users to click on links and secretly install malware that steals banking credentials and personal information etc.,\u201d Boyle wrote.\nIf you\u2019ve seen the movie Catch Me If You Can, then you know it\u2019s based on a true story about the person Leonardo DiCaprio portrays in it \u2013 conman turned FBI security expert Frank Abagnale. Earlier this year, Abagnale made an appearance at the Advertising Week Europe conference in London and spoke to The Guardian about the dangers of identity theft on Facebook.\n\u201cIf you tell me your date of birth and where you\u2019re born [on Facebook] I\u2019m 98 percent [of the way] to stealing your identity,\u201d Abagnale warned. \u201cNever state your date of birth and where you were born [on personal profiles], otherwise you are saying \u2018come and steal my identity\u2019.\u201d Additionally, he recommends never using a passport-style photo as your Facebook profile picture \u2013 group photos are deemed much safer \u2013 and refrain from making comments that reveal too much. \u201cWhat [people] say on a Facebook page stays with them,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time you say you \u2018like\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t like\u2019 you are telling someone [things like] your sexual orientation, ethnic background, voting record.\u201d\nAbagnale also commented about U.K. privacy laws, which he has \u201ctremendous amount of respect for\u201d and believes to be more advanced compared to the laws in place in the U.S. This may be true, but it doesn\u2019t stop the U.K. from experiencing its own troubles with identity fraud, which is still on the constant rise \u2013 82 percent of all cases happen on the Web. Similarly, out of 700 U.S. teens surveyed, 75 percent have been found to be careless with their personal information, making themselves susceptible to online crime.\nBe vigilant, keep your Facebook account safe\nShould a user be locked out of his or her Facebook account, the social network has an advisory available on what could be done to confirm identity and recover access. Additionally, under Facebook\u2019s Security settings, users have an option to add Trusted Contacts, or three \u201cfriends that can securely help you if you ever have trouble accessing your account\u201d; these contacts will receive security codes which they need to send to the user, and if all codes are accurate, the user can confirm their identity and reset their password. While this may be a suitable fail-safe for some, any experienced hacker or fraudster may be able to easily pretend to be you and make contact with your trusted friends. We\u2019ve reached out to Facebook and asked if this is possible and will update this story once we hear back.\nIn the end, the only person responsible for your information security is you. In the same way technology advances, so do the security issues that go with them. Apart from choosing a hard-to-crack password (which rules out birthdays, middle names, pet names, and the word \u201cpassword\u201d), there are other things you can do with your Facebook account settings to make it increasingly harder for identity stealers to target you.\nReview your Privacy settings. Restrict your profile to Friends Only. Where it says \u201cWho can see my stuff,\u201d choose anything EXCEPT Public. Click on \u201cLimit Past Posts\u201d to change the setting of your old posts to Friends Only. This is important if you\u2019re not sure if any of your old posts (which may contain personal information that can be used to steal your identity) were ever set to Public.\nWhile you\u2019re there, set \u201cWho can contact me\u201d and \u201cWho can look me up\u201d to Friends or Friends of Friends to limit the number of people who can find you using your email or phone number.\nCheck out your Security settings. Click on Secure Browsing and enable the option. Also enable Login Notifications so you can be told through email or text message whenever a new computer or mobile device is used to log into your Facebook account. Click on Login Approvals and check the option that requires a security code before giving account access on unknown Web browsers \u2013 this will pull up a step-by-step on how to set it up on your mobile phone (Note: For this to work, you need to have the official Facebook app installed on your phone).\nAs an added precaution, make a habit out of checking Active sessions. If you see any activity that wasn\u2019t initiated by you, click End Activity."

      "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/threads-is-already-different-from-twitter-in-these-10-ways/",
      "text": "Threads is here and already has millions of sign-ups, no doubt due to the ease of its joining process, its immediate availability for both Android and iOS users, and the fact that its user interface shares lots of familiar features with its main competitor, Twitter.\nBut what about the differences between the two microblogging platforms? How has Threads already distinguished itself from Twitter? Like many Twitter users, you might be hungry for an alternative and are wondering how Meta\u2019s app differs from Twitter and if those differences are worth signing up for and learning how to navigate yet another social media app.\nWe\u2019ve already spotted 10 glaring differences between Threads and Twitter, and our list below of these differences is by no means exhaustive. Some of them are good departures from the Twitter experience, some of them are not-so-good, and some of them may be temporary because it\u2019s still early days and Threads is still evolving. In any case, below, we\u2019ll take a closer look at each of these differences and how they seem to affect the user experience on Threads.\nThreads accounts are linked to existing social media accounts\nIf you\u2019ve signed up for Threads, one thing you will have immediately noticed is that it requires an existing Instagram account to sign up. That\u2019s right, your Threads account will be linked to your IG account. This is already a big difference from Twitter, which allows you to create an account without linking it to any other platform. This has two consequences, one obvious and one not-so-obvious. The obvious one is that if you wanted a more anonymous Threads account, that\u2019s probably not going to happen if you use your existing IG account. In fact, your Threads account profile automatically includes a link to that Instagram profile, which people can use to visit your IG profile.\n(Although you could probably just sign up for a new IG account and use that to create a more anonymous Threads account.)\nThe second, not-so-obvious consequence of linking your IG account to Threads is that, because of the way Threads is currently set up, you can\u2019t delete your Threads account without deleting the linked Instagram account. So if you decide Threads isn\u2019t really for you but you want to keep that IG account, your only option is to deactivate your Threads account.\n(It\u2019s also worth noting that head of Instagram Adam Mosseri posted a thread on Thursday, addressing the issue of account deletion on Threads and said that they were \u201clooking into a way to delete your Threads account separately.\u201d)\nFor now, it\u2019s mobile-only\nLots of people prefer to access Twitter via its desktop website instead of scrolling through tweets on a mobile app. Threads does have a website, but you can\u2019t directly access the platform that way. As of now, the Threads website just features a QR code to point users to its mobile apps. And so, at this time, if you strongly prefer to access your social media via a desktop website, Threads may not be the platform for you.\nBut it could be in the future. Mosseri did post a reply on Threads that indicated a website version of the platform is brewing. And as you may have noticed, while you can\u2019t browse or create content on Threads via a desktop website, you can view profiles and posts on desktop web if you have a link to them, like the one earlier in this paragraph.\nThere\u2019s only one main feed\nSocial media platforms are notorious for filling your feeds with (usually unwanted) recommended content from accounts you haven\u2019t followed. But Twitter (and Instagram and Facebook for that matter) offers other options for viewing your feed that allow you to narrow down the posts you scroll through to just the posts from the people you follow or have favorited or have added to specific lists. Twitter specifically has its Lists feature and Following tab, to allow its users to escape its algorithm.\nThreads \u2026 doesn\u2019t do that. With Threads, you get one main feed to browse and it\u2019s kind of a wild free-for-all. It\u2019s often filled with all sorts of accounts you don\u2019t even follow, although sometimes a few of the accounts you do follow make it to the top of the feed. The feed isn\u2019t chronological either, which adds to the chaos.\nAnd according to Instagram\u2019s blog post about Threads, the feed is intended to feature \u201crecommended content from new creators you haven\u2019t discovered yet.\u201d So don\u2019t expect those random accounts to disappear from your Threads feed anytime soon. As of now, on Threads, you won\u2019t be able to escape the recommended randos on your feed without having to individually mute or block them.\nThere are no trending topics\nOn Threads, there are no trending topics to tell you what everyone is talking about, what the day\u2019s discourse is, or who the main character is. On Twitter, the trending topics feature is often a source of gossip, terror (\u201cWhy is my favorite celebrity\u2019s name trending?!\u201d), and breaking news. Trending topics have had their annoying issues, but Threads\u2019 lack of it seems like a mistake. It\u2019s a feature that offers a quick and convenient way to see what the important news of the day is and easy access to more information on that news. Hopefully, in its quest to replace Twitter, Threads figures out a way to incorporate trending topics on its own platform.\nThreads doesn\u2019t have hashtags yet either\nHashtags make it easier to find content related to the topics you care about most. If you\u2019re obsessed with the latest season of The Bear (and who isn\u2019t?), a quick search of its official hashtag on Twitter brings up tons of tweets filled with everyone\u2019s big feelings about certain episodes or characters. Hashtags allow you to live tweet about and find community around important events, movements, or even just sports or TV shows.\nThis is why it\u2019s a shame Threads doesn\u2019t have this important feature yet. But don\u2019t fret just yet. Hashtags are among the listed features that Mosseri acknowledged are missing from this early version of Threads. So it\u2019s likely they\u2019re working on it.\nYour likes don\u2019t have their own tab on your profile\nOn Twitter, when you like a post, the platform keeps track of those likes on your profile for everyone to see. You can see what someone liked by navigating to their Twitter profile and selecting the Likes tab.\nThreads, on the other hand, does not have a dedicated tab for showing the whole world what you liked. As far as we can tell, it simply has two profile tabs: Threads (your posts) and Replies. This is not to say that none of your likes are public. People can sometimes see what you\u2019ve liked in the main feed as they scroll by. But at least on Threads, there isn\u2019t a dedicated, easy-to-access, public section of your page telling all of your business.\nNo ads \u2026 for now\nYes, at this time, Threads is blessedly ad-free. But let\u2019s be real, this is only the first full day of the app\u2019s existence and public release and it is highly likely that Threads will feature ads in the feed at some point. (In a reply posted on Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seemed to indicate that ads (or \u201cmonetization\u201d) could come to Threads after improving upon the app and reaching a goal of 1 billion users.)\nBut for now, enjoy your freedom from ads.\nNo DMs\nThreads also currently lacks direct messaging. So if you are big on chatting with your friends via DM, Threads might not be the right fit for you. It\u2019s also unclear if adding DMs to Threads in the future is really a priority. According to a thread posted by Mosseri, messaging was listed among a series of features missing from Threads, but messaging was listed with the word \u201cmaybe.\u201d As in, they might not be sure about adding it to Threads like the other missing features listed.\nNo way to bookmark posts\nAs someone who bookmarks *a lot* of posts every day, this was the most disappointing part of Threads. There is currently no way to save a post or bookmark it. Hopefully, they\u2019ll add it in a future update, make them searchable, and allow users to organize them into folders. We know you can do it Threads! Instagram already lets you save posts and organize them.\nA 500-character limit for text posts\nTwitter users who use the platform without a Twitter Blue subscription, can post tweets with a maximum of 280 characters. Twitter Blue subscribers can post tweets of up to 4,000 characters.\nThreads is currently somewhere in the middle as it offers a maximum of 500 characters per post for free. Which is a welcome change from Twitter. Four thousand characters is frankly overkill for a microblogging site, and 280 can sometimes feel a bit cramped. Five hundred characters might actually be the sweet spot that helps keep things concise and lets us write out our thoughts without having to find other ways to abbreviate them with emojis or other methods."

      "text": "In the ongoing barrage of cyberattacks, Facebook users are being targeted by a new version of the Ducktail malware that originally surfaced in July. The first implementation was specifically aimed at Facebook Business accounts, but it has recently become a more widespread danger.\nThe latest version of Ducktail collects any and all Facebook data available on an infected computer. If it happens to be a business account, payment methods could be discovered, putting your money at risk. Furthermore, Facebook Business data might include billing information and cycles, which could be used to help disguise unauthorized purchases.\nAn in-depth account of how Ducktail works was shared by Bleeping Computer. The first version relied on a LinkedIn campaign, with hackers posing as marketing and human resources professionals to deliver PHP malware under the guise of useful information. The latest Ducktail is seeded on file-sharing networks that host cracked software, games, adult videos, and anything of a forbidden nature.\nThis is likely the reason for the broader scope of the malware, which has moved beyond Facebook Business accounts to harvest browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, and any personal Facebook account data that might be of use, including names, contact emails, phone numbers, and more.\nYou can\u2019t detect the PHP malware on your disk drive, even though it\u2019s human-readable code because it\u2019s compressed and stored in Base64, then expands in memory before running. Your computer might have plenty of useful PHP scripts in place, so deleting all PHP could be a hasty decision. Instead, you should wait for the latest update to your antivirus software to detect and purge this nasty variant.\nAs usual, the best way to protect yourself from cybersecurity attacks is to avoid risky behaviors. That means using caution when downloading files from the internet. If something seems too good to be true, it might be a trick to get you to install malware on your computer. Stay alert to keep your accounts, data, and money safe."

      "text": "\u201cWhen it comes to human stuff, I\u2019ll take anything, pretty much,\u201d says Henry Scragg. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s been ethically sourced, may I add.\u201d\nSpeaking from his macabre curiosities shop in Essex in a recent YouTube interview, Scragg wears a shabby bowler hat, has tribal-style face tattoos and a ginger beard that descends into three pendulous dreadlocks.\nThe shop, Curiosities from the 5th Corner, provides a backdrop that could be plucked straight from a Victorian penny dreadful: a foetus of conjoined twins floats in a large medical jar at Scragg\u2019s elbow, shelves of human skulls and a hybrid animal skeleton loom behind. The shop\u2019s website markets a monthly human skull subscription (buyers are sent a skull of the shop\u2019s choice each month), mummified body parts, shrunken heads, and masks and wallets made from human leather.\nThere is no suggestion the sale of these items is illegal, but experts, including Dame Sue Black, one of the UK\u2019s leading forensic scientists, are calling for a crackdown on the trade in human remains.\nThey say the lack of regulation means much of the buying and selling of skulls and bones falls into a legal grey zone; and that the growing online market risks fuelling a new era of \u201cbody snatching\u201d, with reports of bones being removed from crypts and graveyards in the UK and abroad.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got people who are breaking into mausolea and who are taking remains away to sell them for people who think this is gothic, quaint [or] supernatural,\u201d said Black, the president of St John\u2019s College, Oxford. \u201cIf you can make the sale of a bird\u2019s nest illegal, surely to goodness you can make the sale of a human body illegal. Having a necklace made out of somebody\u2019s teeth isn\u2019t acceptable to people.\u201d\nOne problem, experts say, lies in how laws are applied. In the UK, desecrating a grave is an offence, but the remains are not technically property so they cannot legally be \u201cowned\u201d or \u201cstolen\u201d. This means it would not automatically be a crime to possess or sell historical human remains, even if they had been unlawfully exhumed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gruesome,\u201d said Black. \u201cIt\u2019s why we say \u2018Rest in peace.\u2019 You don\u2019t expect your body to be dug up and sold.\u201d\nDr Trish Biers, from the department of anthropology at the University of Cambridge, coordinates a taskforce at the British Association for Biological Anthropology and Osteoarchaeology (BABAO) that investigates the sale and trade of human remains. She said there had been a substantial increase in sales in the UK in recent years. In the past five years, the BABAO had blocked more than 200 sales, including from auction houses, shops and online sellers.\nWhile the market has long been dominated by ex-medical skulls and former museum exhibits, Biers suggested there had been an increase in the sale of skulls described as \u201carchaeological\u201d, the appearance of which is consistent with having been excavated from the ground or exhumed from coffins.\n\u201cSocial media has completely changed the market,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal and that\u2019s the problem.\u201d\nSimilar concerns were raised in March by Mattaeus Ball, a Reading-based trader in \u201cmacabre art and oddities\u201d who recently announced he was no longer trading in human remains.\n\u201cThe waters are becoming too muddy with stolen pieces, pieces that are grave-robbed, so many things that just aren\u2019t right,\u201d he said in an Instagram post. \u201cAnd people keep thinking I\u2019m dealing in that, when I\u2019m not.\u201d Ball declined to be interviewed.\nThe Guardian showed images of 10 skulls found on sale on Instagram and other UK online forums to three forensic experts. Several were judged to be ex-anatomical teaching skulls, but others appeared to be coated with dirt or traces of human tissue, which could indicate more recent excavation.\nOne skull, being sold for \u00a3995 on a Belfast-based website, showed signs of root damage, suggesting it had been buried in soil. One expert identified \u201cpatches of what could be darker organic matter, possible rootlets in the sutures and orbits, possible rodent gnawing\u201d. The owner of the site said roots and rodents were not the cause of damage.\nAnother skull, missing several teeth and marketed for \u00a3795 on the website of a UK-based shop, appeared to have manganese oxide staining, the Guardian was told, which is consistent with that seen in bodies excavated from old graves.\nAt least three skulls showed evidence of softening, which occurs when bones are submerged in the acidic material created by decomposition inside a coffin. One of these appeared to have recent damage around the face and a dark, thin, flaky layer \u201cwhich is what I have seen in skulls that have been taken from coffins\u201d, said Black. \u201cThe white areas tell you that it is recent damage as it exposes the non-coloured bone below.\u201d\nDr Nicholas Marquez-Grant, a forensic anthropologist at Cranfield University, said that, based on anatomical features, some of the skulls probably originated from outside the UK, including Asia and Africa, and may date as far back as the 19th century.\nPaul Boateng, who will meet the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, next month to appeal for a change in the law, has raised specific concerns about the trade in remains of ancestors from Indigenous communities. \u201cThe continual trade in human beings even after death, and their continued objectification even after death, is deeply repugnant and a source of shame to our country,\u201d he said.\nMost private trade in human remains falls beyond the remit of the Human Tissue Act 2004, created after the Alder Hey scandal in which children\u2019s organs were removed and stored at the hospital without consent. The act, which enshrines legal requirements around consent, storage and use, covers only remains that are under 100 years old. It also only applies to specific uses, including organ transplants, scientific research and \u201cpublic display\u201d, which includes museums but which experts say is not routinely interpreted as applying to images shared on social media by sellers.\nIt means that, while medical research is tightly regulated, collectors and sellers are in effect free to buy, sell and modify human remains, provided they did not acquire them illegally and are not using them for transplant.\n\u201cI have to have a licence to curate remains,\u201d Biers said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take photos of any human remains under 100 years old if you go to Barts pathology [department]. But it\u2019s OK to turn a child\u2019s spine into a handbag handle. I don\u2019t understand this.\u201d\n\u201cThe private use of these things is in a legal void,\u201d says Imogen Jones, a professor of law at the University of Leeds. She suggested recent cases, such as that of the mortuary abuser David Fuller, showed UK law did not reflect the general expectation that dead bodies and body parts should be \u201ctreated with a baseline level of dignity respect across all sectors\u201d.\nIn the podcast interview, Scragg appears to acknowledge some older skulls may have been recently excavated, either to make room for new burials or by other legal means. \u201cWhen you dig up a human skull, what are you going to do with it? You could hand it to a museum. They\u2019ve already got loads of them so they don\u2019t need any more.\u201d\nSelling a skull to \u201cpeople who will look after it, appreciate it, and put it on a shelf and love it\u201d, he adds, could be viewed as \u201cmore respectful than burying it six foot under\u201d.\nOther online sellers described coming into possession of bones found by construction or sewage contractors, although few gave the exact provenance. Scragg declined to comment.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \u201cAll human remains should be treated with respect and dignity. We expect auction houses to scrutinise their activities and for anyone trading in human remains to consider carefully the ethical implications of this activity, which many understandably find deeply disturbing.\u201d\nA DCMS source said the theft of any remains would be \u201can act of repugnant desecration\u201d and that they would expect the police to act \u201cusing the full force of the law\u201d.\nA spokesperson for the Human Tissue Authority said the actions of anyone undertaking activities using human tissue that fall within its regulatory remit should be guided by the principles of \u201cconsent, dignity, quality, and honesty and openness\u201d."

      "text": "Desecrated human skulls are being sold on social media in UK's unregulated bone trade\nThe human remains trade is thriving on Facebook and Instagram.\nHuman skulls are pierced with coffin nails and human bones are turned into Ouija board pieces; almost nothing is off-limits in the U.K.'s thriving online human remains trade, a Live Science investigation has found.\nBuying and selling human remains isn't illegal in the U.K., provided that the body parts sold aren't used for transplants, and Facebook and Instagram are hubs for dealing in the dead. The remains of adults, children, babies and fetuses are all on the market.\nLive Science documented 50 sellers across England and Wales that used Facebook and Instagram to offer human remains for sale between 2020 and 2022. While some sellers were offering a skull or bone only in private Facebook groups, many of the sellers offered multiple human remains through public Facebook and Instagram pages associated with antiques, oddities and taxidermy businesses, including physical shops.\nSellers and collectors typically posted pictures of unaltered human remains, unless the bones had been cleaned and prepared for learning or study in the past. However, Live Science also found remains that had been disfigured.\nOne Instagram seller posted a picture of a human skull with the words \"kill me\" carved into the side of it. The skull also had coffin nails in it and had been turned into a lamp. The user, named Joseph Plaskitt according to his Instagram profile, posted a picture of the altered skull on Oct. 17, 2021. He told Live Science the skull was a \"teaching piece\" from Europe and had been carved by \"a fellow collector.\"\nLive Science found more human skull lamps shared by other sellers. There were also steampunk-inspired skulls filled with cogs, gears and other mechanical parts, as well as skulls that had been made to look like vampires.\nRelated: 'Untouched' Bronze Age tomb containing human remains and a mysterious stone found in Ireland\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe human remains trade appears to be thriving on Facebook and Instagram even though Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, prohibits the sale of body parts and bodily fluids on its platforms under its terms and policies. A Meta spokesperson told Live Science: \"We\u2019ve removed the violating content brought to our attention and will continue to remove content in line with our policies.\"\nThis isn't the first story to highlight the role of social media in the human remains trade. For example, Wired reported in 2019 that Instagram had a booming human skull trade, and a 2020 Live Science investigation found U.S. sellers offering up looted skulls and other human remains in private Facebook groups. A Facebook spokesperson told Live Science in 2020 that once they become aware that a group has violated their policies they take action against them.\nMost of the human skulls and bones that Live Science documented in this investigation appeared to be medical or anatomical specimens that could be decades or centuries old. A 2019 editorial published in the BMJ estimated that there are likely thousands of human skeletons from medical education sources in private possession in the U.K., with medical students encouraged to buy bones for their studies in the 20th century. However, human remains are usually sold with little to no backstory and can circulate in the trade for many decades, changing hands multiple times, so it's difficult to know exactly where they come from.\nThe human remains trade also has links to grave robbing, both historical and modern \u2014 and disturbing a place where remains have been formally laid to rest is illegal without a license. Ultimately, whoever the deceased were, researchers say those people didn't give consent for their remains to be used in this way.\n\"Nobody consents to having their body bought and sold,\" Shawn Graham, a digital archeologist at Carleton University in Canada, told Live Science.\nGraham researches human remains trafficking online, using images posted by sellers to track the global trade. He knows human remains posted online are real, partly because collectors don't want replicas so it's in their interest to offer real human remains, but also because replicas are easy to spot. Live Science didn't verify the authenticity of any remains in person, but showed images of the remains in this story to researchers as part of the investigation; the experts thought that all of these specimens were real.\nOne popular seller offered black-stained human skulls with iron nails for teeth, human bone wind chimes and Ouija board planchettes (the triangular gameboard pieces), and wallets crafted from human and pig skin. The seller, named Henry Scragg online, promotes his merchandise on Facebook and Instagram with an online store and a physical shop/museum called \"Curiosities from the 5th Corner\" in Essex, England.\nScragg didn't respond to Live Science's questions, but on an Instagram post promoting the human skin wallets on Sept. 13, he wrote, \"To some these are awesome, to others, they ask why. But why not? Why should we not use what's available to us when no one else is using it, why should we let worms, bugs and micro organisms feast on this perfectly good flesh when it can be used to create appreciated objects.\"\nTwo forensic scientists told Live Science that some of the human skulls Live Science uncovered during its investigation appear to have come from people who suffered violent deaths. Two skulls offered for sale by Scragg appeared from photos to have gunshot wounds.\nScragg said in a March 29 social media post that one of the skulls was most likely from a suicide victim, and the other, in an earlier post on July 2, 2020, was an executed prisoner from China. Two forensic scientists noted the visible gunshot wounds in the photos but couldn't say whether the claims about the deaths were true. The alleged prisoner's skull did, however, have at least two gunshot wounds with an entry to the back of the head, which is a common location in executions, according to Nicholas Marquez-Grant, a senior lecturer in forensic anthropology at Cranfield University in England.\nA third skull \u2014 shared in a July 11, 2020, post \u2014 had injuries that were compatible with blunt force to the head around the time of death. Marquez-Grant noted that blunt-force injury can result from being hit by a blunt weapon, such as a baseball bat, or from slamming against a wide and large surface \u2014 for example, by falling from a height and hitting the ground, or when experiencing a vehicle accident. The blunt force, in this case, appears to have been against a large surface. \"Could be [an] accidental death, but certainly violent in nature,\" Marquez-Grant told Live Science in an email.\nAll three skulls appeared to have been professionally cleaned and prepared for teaching or study, with medical cuts, and are therefore most likely retired medical or anatomical specimens, according to the forensic scientists.\nIs it legal?\nThe buying and selling of human remains is largely ignored by existing U.K. legislation. Anyone can possess, buy and sell human body parts, provided they didn't acquire the remains illegally and they're not using them for transplants. But the remains themselves aren't technically property, so they can't legally be \"owned.\"\nFor example, if a museum holds human remains and a descendant of that deceased person decides to walk into the museum and take them, that might not be considered theft, according to a 2003 report by the Working Group on Human Remains for the U.K. government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport (now the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport). However, there are scenarios in which human remains can become legal property.\n\"If you take human remains and you apply work or skill, or some sort of technical process, to them to create something novel or different, you create an item of property,\" Heather Conway, a professor of property law and death studies at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland, told Live Science.\nConway pointed to legal precedent for this. In 1998, the Court of Appeal for England and Wales upheld a conviction against an artist who stole anatomical specimens from the Royal College of Surgeons in London on the grounds that the college's application of skill to create the specimens made them property and that taking them was therefore theft, according to a 1998 commentary in the Medical Law Review journal.\nConway noted that destroying human remains that have acquired property status could also be criminal damage, another offense that wouldn't apply to unaltered human remains.\nThe Human Tissue Authority (HTA), part of the U.K. government's Department of Health and Social Care, states that all human remains \"should be treated with respect and dignity,\" but the desecration or mutilation of a corpse isn't against the law in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; Scotland is the exception.\nTo put that into context, the desecration of a statue or memorial can land a person in prison for up to 10 years under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, according to the Home Office, another U.K. government department.\n\"I find it really bizarre that we have offenses relating to desecrations of monuments, but not people,\" Imogen Jones, an associate professor of law at the University of Leeds in England, told Live Science.\nThere is nothing to stop people from desecrating human remains in private, although sexual penetration of a corpse is illegal under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Jones noted that tampering with human remains in public can be an offense under outraging public decency.\nIn 1989, a jury ruled that earrings made from freeze-dried human fetuses displayed in a London art gallery were an outrage to public decency, the Associated Press reported at the time. The artist was fined \u00a3500 ($875), and the gallery curator was fined \u00a3350 ($610) \u2014 around \u00a31,180 and \u00a3826 ($1,338 and $937) in today's money.\nLive Science found several of what sellers claim are preserved human fetuses for sale online and saw them in pictures of private collections, along with the skeletons of babies and the skeletons of children. These human remains weren't modified like some adult skulls and bones were, but the 1989 case highlights a legal precedent for modified human remains outraging public decency.\nSome laws may also affect the sharing of images of desecrated remains in the digital space. For example, Jones pointed to the Obscene Publications Act 1959, for which the U.K. Crown Prosecution Service notes prosecutors may consider outraging public decency first. The U.K. also has the Communications Act 2003, which covers messages and other matters that are grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character through a public electronic communications network. However, the interpretation of what constitutes obscenity under these laws is subjective, and no law expressly forbids the desecration of a corpse.\nWhere do the human remains come from?\nMost of the human remains that Live Science saw appeared to have been processed for learning or study. Live Science found pictures of bones next to boxes with the names of medical supply companies on them, including Adam,Rouilly & Co. The company, now called Adam,Rouilly, deals in synthetic models today but is open about supplying real skeletons to medical students in the 20th century on its website. Adam,Rouilly didn't respond to a request for comment.\nHuman remains held by private collectors today may have helped medical students become doctors, or been studied to help understand or treat diseases, before they entered the collectors' trade. Some sellers claim that this history makes them \"ethically sourced,\" but experts disagree.\n\"They weren't ethically sourced in the first place,\" Trish Biers, an osteologist and paleopathologist at the University of Cambridge in England, told Live Science. Biers coordinates a task force at the British Association for Biological Anthropology and Osteoarchaeology (BABAO) that investigates the sale and trade of human remains and the objectification and commodification of the dead and does public outreach.\nIn the late 1700s, London gangs dug up newly buried bodies and sold them to teachers to supply a growing demand for teaching specimens. The teachers and students also sometimes stole bodies themselves, according to the UK Parliament website.\nThe trade came under scrutiny in the late 1820s when the public learned that two men called William Burke and William Hare \u2014 often called Burke and Hare \u2014 were killing people to supply bodies to the University of Edinburgh's anatomy department in Scotland. After Burke was caught and executed, his skin was turned into a notebook at the same university he'd been supplying, according to the University of Edinburgh.\nThe Anatomy Act 1832 sought to quell grave robbing and the outcry by establishing a new legal source of bodies; the unclaimed from workhouses, hospitals and prisons, as well as by making body donation legal. But the demand for bodies continued to increase through the 19th and 20th centuries, so the problem of finding bones was outsourced and the U.K. began getting its medical bones from abroad, especially India.\nIn 1984, at the peak of the medical supply trade in human remains, India exported about 60,000 skeletons and skulls to Britain and other European countries, America, and Australia for medical students, the Chicago Tribune reported in 1985.\nA lot of the bodies now traded originally came from deeply impoverished communities. \"This was their only way of getting someone to take away their dead because they simply couldn't afford the funeral plot; they couldn't afford the cremation ceremony,\" Biers said. \"It's really sad.\"\nThe trade in India had strong links to grave robbing, just like in the U.K. prior to the Anatomy Act 1832. \"Most of the time the graves were robbed for the skeletons,\" Veena Mushrif, a bioarchaeologist at the Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute in Pune, India, told Live Science in an email. \"It was unethical.\"\nIt was easy for Europeans to access India's skeletons because India was a British colony, Mushrif said. India was under British rule for around 200 years until it gained independence in 1947. However, India continued to be the U.K.'s main source of human remains after it became independent.\nThe Indian government banned skeleton exports in 1985 after a bone trader was arrested for exporting 1,500 skeletons belonging to children. This sparked fears that children were kidnapped and killed for their bones, investigative reporter Scott Carney reported for WIRED in 2007.\nCarney, who also wrote a book about the global market in body parts called \"The Red Market\" (William Morrow, 2011), told Live Science that the trade out of India continues today, but it's greatly diminished compared with before the ban in 1985. China was another mass exporter of human skeletons in the 20th century and didn't bring in a ban until 2008, according to the BABAO website.\nThe unethical means by which human remains were acquired also extends to universities and museums. \"A lot of collections were populated with colonized bodies, but also the poor who had no choice, the disfigured, the disenfranchised, the ethnically different,\" Biers said. \"They were all put into collections and not in an ethical way.\"\nThe Human Tissue Act 2004, which created the HTA, established clearly that body and organ donation required personal informed consent. The HTA regulates organizations using human remains for medical treatment, post-mortem examination, education and training, and display in public to ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect. Furthermore, if the remains are less than 100 years old, a license is required that must include proof of consent from the deceased \u2014 but this doesn't apply to the remains of people who died before 2006 if more than 100 years has passed since their death, according to the HTA Codes of Practice.\nIn private ownership, there are no such regulations. Furthermore, the HTA doesn't inspect shops selling human remains; a statement from the HTA is provided at the bottom of this story.\nTwo sellers told Live Science that they wouldn't disrespect human remains in their possession and claim that many private collectors likely treat ex-medical remains with more respect than they would have received in places of learning or study.\n\"I try my best to treat them with as much respect as you possibly can,\" said Chris Bull, an online seller based in Bristol. In his opinion, that means \"just not doing anything stupid with them.\"\nAnother online seller, Reading-based Mattaeus Ball, told Live Science that he too has respect for human remains and won't do anything \"grotesque\" with them, arguing that private collectors are taking care of the remains that the medical industry used and threw away.\n\"These were people that were exploited for the medical industry and once we were finished with them, drawing all over them, writing on the bones, cutting them up, treating them like an object, they've just been discarded,\" Ball said.\nThe demand for skeletons in academia still exists. BABAO tries to transfer specimens to collections that need them most. Biers also takes in unwanted privately held human skulls and bones from the public so that they can be used for educational purposes.\nIn fact, so many institutions need skeletons for teaching across different disciplines that with no mass imports from abroad, there's a shortage, even with people willingly donating their bodies to medical science.\n\"Some people buy human remains so they can use them to teach because they don't have a lab budget,\" Biers said. In other words, human skulls and bones originally acquired for learning and study can go into the oddities market and then come back out again for teaching. Biers said that if this happens, human remains won't return to private collectors or be disposed of in an unprofessional way.\nRepatriating human remains that were acquired for the medical industry is difficult and expensive; it requires DNA testing and other research to discover the person's ancestry and where they came from. While it's possible, the scale of trade means that most of these skulls and bones won't ever be formally laid to rest in their homelands.\n\"There's a movement now to actually start figuring out if there's a way to reclaim some of these bodies, but it was so prolific,\" Biers said. \"You're talking thousands and thousands and thousands of bodies over many, many, many decades.\"\nThis is part 1 of an online investigation into the U.K. human remains trade by Live Science.\nHuman Tissue Authority statement\nThe HTA provided Live Science with the following statement:\n\"The Human Tissue Authority's remit is set by the Human Tissue Act. This requires certain activities using human tissue to be licensed and subject to the HTA's regulatory oversight. The HTA regulates organisations that remove, store and use human tissue for research, patient treatment, post-mortem examination, anatomical examination, surgical training and display in public. These activities require appropriate consent to be in place for them to lawfully take place. The HTA's overarching Code of Practice A sets out the four Guiding Principles for the use of human tissue for purposes within the HTA's remit. The actions of anyone undertaking activities falling within the remit of the HTA should be guided by these four principles of consent, dignity, quality, and honesty and openness.\nPublic display of human tissue can be subject to regulation by the Human Tissue Authority in some circumstances, depending on the age of the material and the period for which it has been held.\"\nPatrick Pester is the trending news writer at Live Science. His work has appeared on other science websites, such as BBC Science Focus and Scientific American. Patrick retrained as a journalist after spending his early career working in zoos and wildlife conservation. He was awarded the Master's Excellence Scholarship to study at Cardiff University where he completed a master's degree in international journalism. He also has a second master's degree in biodiversity, evolution and conservation in action from Middlesex University London. When he isn't writing news, Patrick investigates the sale of human remains."

  "argos_summary": "Social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook are now hubs for the illicit trade of human remains, including skulls, bones and fetuses, often sourced from grave robbing or unregulated medical specimens.  Legal gaps\u2014particularly in the UK\u2019s Human Tissue Act 2004\u2014allow collectors and sellers to buy, sell and modify remains with little oversight, while experts warn that the market fuels further looting and cultural disrespect.  Investigations by The Guardian, LiveScience and academic studies have documented dozens of online sellers, the lack of provenance, and the ease with which buyers can acquire these items, raising concerns about ethics, law enforcement and the need for stricter regulation and enforcement.",
