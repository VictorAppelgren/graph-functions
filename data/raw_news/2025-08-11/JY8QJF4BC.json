  "title": "Avoid Intel Says Advisors Capital\u2019s Feeney",
  "description": "Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is set to meet with President Donald Trump after the US leader called for his resignation. Advisors Capital Management\u2019s JoAnne Feeney addresses the position Intel finds itself in and why she thinks investors should avoid the stock right now. She speaks with Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow on \u201cBloomberg Tech.\u201d  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Joanne, what is it that you would like to see Lipton manage to navigate today? Is it better that he promises more investment into the US, more manufacturing and that he has extricated himself from China? Or ultimately, does he even need to stand down in some way as CEO? Yeah, it's really I think it's really unclear, Caroline. Obviously, I think he can defend himself from the concerns that that he's conflicted, and that's his main mission today. I don't know if that means he needs to do more to separate from his prior work and investments. I don't know how much capacity he has to do that. I think Ian is right that the administration wants to be able to continue to push the narrative that they are doing something to bring more chip manufacturing back to the U.S. And so his announcements of less investment or delayed investment is a concern to the administration, but they don't have the customers yet. Maybe he can say, hey, we've got these guys on the line, we're reeling them in. Maybe that would be reassuring. But ultimately, Intel needs to keep those subsidies, but not at the cost of having to spend so much CapEx in the near term when they don't have customers. So a very fine line for more of a CEO to walk here. The stock's up 6%. So the market like something about the idea that Bhutan's going to go to D.C. and meet with the president. Present day, your fund manager looking all across tech. But you had a long career in semiconductors. Lit Bhutan also has had a very long career in semiconductors. A lot of this affiliation with China or indirect has been well known. Were you aware of it? Do you understand his history? Yeah. I mean, you know, I don't know him that well, but I think the public information about his prior work is pretty clear. He's obviously very highly respected. He was brought in by the board to take Intel in a different direction. One that is more measured was capital spending forward then Pat Gelsinger wanted to do. And and so it's it's just worrisome, right, that that he might have to be removed because of concerns that really aren't well well founded. And so he seems like he's a very good person to run Intel at this point. And Intel desperately needs the help they need to take that company in a different, more streamlined, more efficient direction while they sort out the recipe for designing and manufacturing chips, which was a huge stumbling block for them. And that's why they're in the position they are. Why? Why AMD has taken so much share from Intel over the years in server chips and elsewhere. So, you know, this is something this is a company we would avoid. We are avoiding at this point. We don't think it's a good place for investor money. There are just way too many uncertainties about the potential of Intel to make a comeback. Meanwhile, the uncertainties loom large about access to China and what you have to pay to do that from an AMD and NVIDIA, but an uncertainty you're willing to swallow if the underlying tailwinds are still so strong, make of it what you will tell us what you thought about the AMD and NVIDIA deals. Yeah, so clearly you're right. The companies need the companies are better off with access to China than without even with a 15% export tax. The, you know, the potential revenue at risk, you know $38 billion for Intel, 6 to 10 billion for AMD likely potentially grow over time. You know, so to pay 15% on that, it's going to cut into their their margins to some degree. They probably get a 50%, 60% gross margin on those sales. I think that they're going to have to swallow this. Right. They're charging what the market will bear right now for those chips selling into China and elsewhere. I don't think they'll be able to pass on this tariff or this sorry, this export tax to the Chinese customers. They're charging them as much as they can get away with already. So, you know, it's definitely going to be a hit to margins on a what is a, you know, my minority part of their businesses. But it's better to have access to non and I think the stocks are are up because maybe this resolves the uncertainty maybe people will say okay they're going to have to pay this, but hey now we can rely on the fact that they'll have these export licenses, whereas before it was this sort of vague national security concern. No, you can't sell chips to China. Now that's gone away. Right. It's clearly not a national security issue. If the government is going to let them pay a fee to gain that access. AMD put a statement out this morning saying they have an initial export license. They didn't address the 15% revenue split in Nvidia power statement saying they've not yet shipped any a220s to China for months, but they hope to. Can you and your desk analysts start modeling for some real China revenues in the near term from both those companies? Yeah I think well you know from what we know. Yes. I mean it's good that AIB has confirmed they have the licenses. So I think we can we would definitely model with that 15% hit to revenue. And it's not clear, by the way, where this goes legally. Right. It's unconstitutional to impose an export tax like this. But it's not clear who would have the legal standing to object to the tax. And clearly, NVIDIA and AMD aren't going to because they don't want to unbalance the applecart here and risk those export export licenses. But perhaps, you know, one of the business associations does it's unclear or whether this shouldn't stand. But, you know, we're seeing more and more of these kinds of pay to play arrangements by the U.S. government that could increasingly put a tax on businesses and should be known. This is an ex post tax break. This has happened after the fact of the companies having designed these chips and begun to sell them and they want to sell more. What we're worried about is that now companies are going to take this potentially into account. You know, do I want to develop the next chip or do I want to develop the next, you know, whatever medical device, if I'm going to be subject to a 15% revenue tax.",
