  "description": "As variant XFG gains ground in the U.S., here's what cases looked like nationwide in early August.",
  "content": "Some states are being hit harder than others this summer as a new COVID-19 strain (XGF) continues to spread.\n\nSome regions of the U.S. are still experiencing higher rates of positive COVID tests than others, though reporting has slowed down enough nationwide that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has begun allowing more time to pass between certain types of updates, such as those on variant prevalence.\n\nTesting, cases, hospitalizations and deaths are still being recorded on a weekly basis, however, even amid the chaos of ever-changing strains, recommendations and cuts to vaccine development funding.\n\nHere's what to know about the latest data.\n\nHow many COVID cases were reported nationwide?\n\nDuring the week ending on Aug. 2, 8.5% of the 25,731 Americans tested were positive for COVID, according to the CDC's latest data. This was 2% increase from the week prior.\n\nDuring the same period, only 0.3% of cases resulted in death and 0.9% resulted in an emergency room visit, a 0.1% decrease from the week prior for both categories.\n\nWhere are the most COVID cases being reported? See map\n\nWestern and southern states, including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, had higher percentages of positive COVID tests during the week ending Aug. 2.\n\nWhat is the most common COVID variant?\n\nThe CDC has moved to using longer data timeframes for COVID tracking due to low reporting from states. According to the latest data for the two weeks ending June 21, variant NB.1.8.1 remained the most common, accounting for 43% of cases, followed by LP.8.1 at 31% of cases and XFG at 14%.\n\nNB.1.8.1 experienced a meteoric rise to becoming the predominant variant, accounting for 0% of cases in April and only 10% in the last week of May, up to 24% at the beginning of June and 43% by the end.\n\nXFG, a combination of variants F.7 and LP.8.1.2, is on the rise as of late, having been responsible for 0% of U.S. cases through March, 11% by early June and 14% by late June.",

      "text": "New COVID variant 'Stratus' is spreading in the U.S. and worldwide: What are the symptoms?\nA new COVID-19 variant is climbing the ranks in the United States, becoming the third-most common strain of the summer.\nVariant XFG, colloquially known as \"Stratus,\" was first detected in Southeast Asia in January but accounted for less than about 0% of cases in the United States until May. By late June, it was estimated to account for up to 14%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe World Health Organization added XFG to its watchlist but evaluated the additional public health risk posed by the variant as \"low\" at the global level in a late June report, in which it also advised that currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are \"expected to remain effective to this variant against symptomatic and severe disease.\"\nHere's what we know about XFG:\nWhat is COVID variant XFG?\nXFG is a combination of COVID-19 variants F.7 and LP.8.1.2, the latter of which is the second most prominent strain in the United States.\nThe variant's mutations may enhance XFG's ability to evade immune responses, but its binding behavior shows that it is less likely to be highly contagious than other dominant variants, Subhash Verma, microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, told USA TODAY.\n\"There is currently no clear evidence that XFG causes more severe disease or significantly different symptoms than earlier Omicron variants,\" Verma said. \"Importantly, there are no immediate public health concerns associated with this variant.\"\nHow common is XFG?\nWhile XFG has been growing and spreading worldwide, it has yet to become the predominant source of infection in the United States.\nThe CDC has moved to using longer timeframes for COVID tracking due to low reporting from states. According to the latest data for the two-week period ending June 21, XFG accounted for 14% of U.S. cases, making it the third most-prevalent strain after NB.1.8.1 (43%) and LP.8.1 (31%).\nThe prominence of XFG in the United States significantly increased in the weeks leading up to the last report, accounting for 0% of cases through March before reaching 2% in April, 6% in late May, 11% in early June and 14% in late June.\nWHO tracked an uptick in XFG worldwide in June as well, with the June report including data from 38 countries showing that XFG accounted for only 7.4% of positive tests in the first week of May but 22.7% by the last.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the CDC for more information about the spread of COVID-19 variants in July and August.\nWhat are the symptoms of XFG?\nThere is no evidence that XFG causes any distinct symptoms from other variants, Verma said. However, hoarseness has been anecdotally associated with the strain, according to social media posts and news reports.\nThe CDC outlines the following as common COVID-19 symptoms:\n\u25feFever or chills\n\u25feCough\n\u25feShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n\u25feSore throat\n\u25feCongestion or a runny nose\n\u25feNew loss of taste or smell\n\u25feFatigue\n\u25feMuscle or body aches\n\u25feHeadache\n\u25feNausea or vomiting\nThe CDC advises seeking medical care if you experience any of the following symptoms:\n\u25feTrouble breathing\n\u25fePersistent pain or pressure in the chest\n\u25feNew confusion\n\u25feInability to wake or stay awake\n\u25feDepending on skin tone, lips, nail beds and skin may appear pale, gray, or blue"

      "text": "'Flesh-eating' bacteria cases are popping up along the Gulf Coast. What you need to know.\nAs temperatures continue to swelter and people flock to the Gulf Coast to enjoy its warm, salty waters, health officials are warning swimmers about a \"flesh-eating\" bacteria that has killed at least eight people this summer.\nThe bacterium, Vibrio vulnificus, is commonly associated with the \"flesh-eating\" moniker thanks to its ability to cause infections that damage or \"eat away\" at skin and tissue. This year, Louisiana is reporting an abnormally high rate of infection.\n\"Amid increasing water temperatures and extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves, flooding, and severe storms), people who are at increased risk for V. vulnificus infection (those with weakened immune systems and conditions like liver disease, diabetes and kidney failure) ... should exercise caution when engaging in coastal water activities,\" said a Louisiana Department of Health warning issued July 30.\nDespite the increase in cases, Vibrio vulnificus infections are still rare. Even so, experts have advised that people in coastal areas exercise extra caution while enjoying the waning days of summer. Here's what to know.\nWhere are flesh-eating bacteria cases in the US? How common is it?\nLouisiana has reported the highest number of Vibrio vulnificus infections in a decade, with 17 reported cases and hospitalizations, including four deaths, as of July 30. This is compared to the 10 years prior, which saw an average of only seven cases and one death a year during the same time period.\nFlorida has likewise reported four deaths caused by Vibrio vulnificus infections as of July 24. The state has counted 13 total cases, a rate that isn't necessarily abnormal at this point in the year, according to Florida health data.\nAn average of 150 to 200 cases are reported each year, with most of them in Gulf Coast states, according to CDC data.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to health departments in other coastal states regarding possible cases.\nWhat is Vibrio vulnificus?\nVibrio vulnificus is a bacterium that causes a serious infection called vibriosis. Different types of Vibrio bacteria cause different infections, with Vibrio vulnificus causing the \"most serious forms of vibriosis,\" according to the Cleveland Clinic.\nThe potentially fatal infection can quickly result in tissue damage and spreading blisters, low blood pressure, fever, organ damage, sepsis and death.\nVibrio vulnificus is often referred to as \"flesh-eating\" because it can also cause necrotizing fasciitis, a bacterial infection that destroys muscle and skin tissue, causing flesh around wounds to die, according to the CDC. Vibrio vulnificus is not considered the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis in the United States, however.\nThe bacteria and resulting infections are rare but can be life-threatening. Without treatment, patients can die in just a few days.\nHow does 'flesh-eating' bacteria enter the body?\nVibrio vulnificus requires salt water for survival and thrives in warm, brackish water where a stream or river meets seawater, according to the CDC.\nMost infections occur when contaminated water is swallowed or gets into an open wound, such as a cut or scrape. It can enter through broken skin but cannot penetrate unharmed skin. Vibrio vulnificus can also enter your body when you eat uncooked or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters. In fact, raw oysters and other seafood, along with seawater exposure, are the most common sources of Vibrio outbreaks tracked by the CDC.\nOnce inside the body, the infection can spread to the blood and organs, usually within a matter of hours.\nSymptoms of Vibrio vulnificus infection\nSymptoms of a Vibrio vulnificus infection begin suddenly and quickly, usually less than 24 hours after exposure, according to the CDC and the Cleveland Clinic.\nCommon symptoms include:\n- Fever and chills\n- A red, warm or swollen patch of skin or rash that spreads quickly and causes pain\n- Fluid-filled blisters and skin discoloration\n- Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea\n- Low blood pressure (often indicated by weakness, dizziness, fatigue and fainting)\n- Confusion or altered mental state\n- Rapid heartbeat\nHow to protect yourself against Vibrio vulnificus\nWhen consuming seafood, the CDC advises, you should:\n- Cook seafood, including oysters, before consuming.\n- Thoroughly clean surfaces that may have come in contact with raw seafood and its drippings.\n- Thoroughly wash your hands after handling raw seafood. If you are at high risk, wear gloves.\nWhen swimming, you should:\n- Avoid entering salt water or brackish water if you have any open wounds. That includes recent surgical sites, fresh tattoos and piercings, and even minor cuts or scrapes.\n- Cover any open wounds if you may come into contact with coastal waters or raw seafood, even if you don't plan to be directly exposed to either. Exposure also can occur during flooding caused by storms.\n- Immediately wash any area of open skin with soap and running water after contact with coastal water or raw seafood.\n- If you are at increased risk (people with weakened immune systems and conditions like liver disease, diabetes and kidney failure), wear protective shoes and clothes when in or near coastal waters.\nContributing: Janet Loehrke"

      "text": "Coca-Cola makes sweetener change. Is corn syrup or cane sugar healthier?\n- Coca-Cola will release a cane sugar-sweetened Coke this fall.\n- The new product will not replace high-fructose corn syrup in the original Coke formula.\n- Health experts say both cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess.\nCoca-Cola will be adding cane sugar to its ingredients list after all.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be bringing a Coke sweetened with US cane sugar into the market this fall, and I think that will be an enduring option for consumers,\u201d Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said on a second-quarter call with investors and analysts on July 22.\nThe company initially declined to comment on its intentions to use cane sugar after President Donald Trump claimed it would do so in July.\n\u201cI have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so,\u201d Trump wrote in a July 16 Truth Social post. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them \u2014 You\u2019ll see. It\u2019s just better!\u201d\nCoke didn\u2019t confirm the claim at the time, saying in a statement shared with USA TODAY that it would share details on new offerings soon and appreciated Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for its product.\nRather than replace high-fructose corn syrup as the sweetener in its flagship line, however, the sugar will be used in a drink that \u201ccomplements\u201d and \u201cexpands\u201d its product range, Quincey said in the earnings call and subsequent report.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Coca-Cola for comment.\nHigh-fructose corn syrup is one of the ingredients the Trump administration has pushed companies to remove from food and beverages as part of its \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. But is cane sugar actually \u201chealthier\u201d for you? Here\u2019s what to know.\nWhat is high-fructose corn syrup?\nHigh-fructose corn syrup is a viscous, sweet substance made from cornstarch. When broken down into individual molecules, it becomes corn syrup, virtually a 100% glucose product, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Enzymes are then added to make some of the glucose into fructose, another simple sugar that naturally occurs in fruits.\nThe resulting product is higher in fructose compared to the pure glucose in plain corn syrup, hence the \u201chigh\u201d in the name.\nHigh-fructose corn syrup is used in a large number of processed and packaged foods. Because it is cheaper to produce and more shelf-stable than regular sugar, it is widely used in the food manufacturing industry, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\nWhat is cane sugar?\nCane sugar is derived from the natural byproduct of sugarcane \u2212 a tall, perennial, tropical grass from which liquid is extracted to create sugar. Corn is in the same plant family as sugarcane, which allows for the extraction of sweetener from both.\nThe way raw sugarcane is processed and refined determines the product it ultimately yields. It can be made into a syrup, juice or crystallized and refined further into products like white sugar, brown sugar, molasses or jaggery, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and WebMD. Cane sugar consists of sucrose, which is one-half glucose and one-half fructose.\nIs cane sugar better for you than high-fructose corn syrup?\nLike all types of added sugar, both cane and high-fructose corn syrup can have negative health effects, like weight gain, diabetes and heart disease, if consumed in excess.\nThe FDA says it is \u201cnot aware of any evidence\u201d of a difference in safety between foods containing high-fructose corn syrup and \u201cfoods containing similar amounts of other nutritive sweeteners with approximately equal glucose and fructose content, such as sucrose, honey, or other traditional sweeteners.\u201d\nDr. Wesley McWhorter, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told USA TODAY that high intakes of any added sugar can cause health issues, but that our bodies break down some types differently.\n\u201cHigh fructose corn syrup and cane sugar are both forms of added sugar, and both contain glucose and fructose; cane sugar is sucrose, which is 50% fructose, while high fructose corn syrup typically contains about 55%,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYour body processes them similarly, but fructose is primarily metabolized in the liver. When consumed in excess, especially from sugary drinks and other concentrated sources, fructose can promote fat accumulation in the liver, a key contributor to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\u201d\nHe hopes the conversation around Coke\u2019s change sparks a larger conversation about reducing the amount of added sugar Americans consume in general, regardless of the type.\n\u201cLong-term health isn\u2019t about swapping one sweetener for another; it\u2019s about making meaningful changes to cut added sugar and improve the overall quality of the foods we eat,\u201d he said."

      "text": "21, including children, fall ill in Florida after consuming raw milk\nFlorida health officials are issuing a warning about the dangers of consuming raw milk after 21 people in the northeast and central parts of the state drank raw milk from the same farm and fell ill.\nThe Florida Department of Health issued the warning on Monday, Aug. 4, noting that due to sanitation practices and raw milk consumption, 21 people became sick, including six children under the age of 10. Among the patients, at least two have suffered \"severe complications,\" the announcement read.\nThe illnesses were linked to one farm.\n\"Sanitation practices in this farm are of particular concern due to the number of cases,\" the department wrote.\nIn Florida, raw milk is only sold for non-human consumption as pet or animal food, which limits regulation efforts of sanitary practices. Containers are supposed to be labeled so buyers know they contain raw milk for animal consumption only.\n\"Floridians should be aware of potential risks associated with consumption, which may vary depending on the source of milk,\" the health department wrote. \"The producer\u2019s handling of raw milk and milking procedures are vital in prevention of contamination. Many people consume raw milk safely.\"\nHere\u2019s what we know so far.\nWhat is raw milk?\nRaw milk includes milk from cows, sheep, goats, or other animals that has not been pasteurized or heat-treated to destroy bacteria, the Florida Department of Health said in the announcement.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), raw milk can be a source of foodborne illness, and while while contamination can be reduced, there is no guaranteed protection from harmful germs in raw milk.\n\"Pasteurized milk offers the same nutritional benefits without the risks of raw milk consumption,\" the CDC said on its website, adding that since the early 1900s, pasteurization has led to a drop in milk-borne illnesses.\nAccording to the Florida Department of Health, raw milk can contain disease-causing bacteria such as Campylobacter, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Listeria, Salmonella and others. The bacteria can cause gastrointestinal illness, including diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps.\nIn California, state health officials warned the public after detecting the bird flu virus in raw milk from a central California dairy farm in November of last year.\nU.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously been quoted as saying he only drinks raw milk.\nDetails on infections linked to Florida farm\nThe most recent cases involved both Campylobacter and STEC (Shiga toxin-producing E. coli) infections, and were linked to one particular farm, the department said.\nSTEC bacteria at its most severe can lead to kidney failure, the department said. Other people at high-risk for severe illness include infants and young children, pregnant women, elderly individuals and individuals with weakened immune systems.\n\"Floridians are encouraged to use this information to make informed decisions about their health and sources of raw milk should they choose to consume it,\" the department said.\nContributing: Natalie Neysa Alund, USA TODAY\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

      "text": "2 dead, 58 sickened in growing NYC Legionnaires' disease cluster\nA Legionnaires' disease cluster in New York City has grown, with two deaths and more than 50 others sickened so far, officials said.\nThe New York City Department of Health said in an update Aug. 4 that 58 people in Central Harlem have been diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease since July 25. Two people have died so far, NYC Health said.\nThe agency previously announced on July 30 that 22 illnesses and one death had been reported at the time, and the source was believed to be a cooling tower in the area.\nLegionnaires' disease is a severe pneumonia caused by a type of bacteria called Legionella, which grows in warm water, according to the CDC.\nCooling towers in Legionnaires' cluster area have been remediated, officials say\nNYC Health previously said the likely source of the bacteria causing the Legionnaires' cluster is a cooling tower in the area.\nCooling towers, which are water systems typically found on the top of buildings, spray mist that can contain the bacteria that cause Legionnaires' disease, the agency said.\nAfter testing, 11 cooling towers in the area of the cluster had positive results for the Legionella bacteria. NYC Health said Aug. 4 that remediation of the 11 towers had been completed.\nWhere is the NYC Legionnaires' cluster?\nAccording to NYC Health, the Legionnaires' disease cluster is affecting the following Central Harlem zip codes:\n- 10027\n- 10030\n- 10035\n- 10037\n- 10039\n\"Anyone in these zip codes with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible,\" Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said in a release. \"Legionnaires\u2019 disease can be effectively treated if diagnosed early, but New Yorkers at higher risk, like adults aged 50 and older and those who smoke or have chronic lung conditions, should be especially mindful of their symptoms and seek care as soon as symptoms begin.\"\nThe health department also said the cluster does not involve any building\u2019s plumbing system, meaning it is safe to drink water, bathe, shower, cook and use air conditioners.\nWhat is Legionnaires' disease?\nLegionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by consuming water contaminated with Legionella bacteria, according to the CDC. Symptoms of the disease can take up to 14 days after exposure to show up and include:\n- Cough\n- Fever\n- Headaches\n- Muscle aches\n- Shortness of breath\nLegionnaires' disease can be treated with antibiotics, and most healthy people who get infected usually get better. However, about 1 in 10 people who get Legionnaires' disease die from it, according to the CDC.\nHow to stay safe from Legionnaires' disease\nTo prevent Legionnaires' disease, which is a waterborne illness, clean pipes and devices that use water to remove germs and debris, according to the CDC.\nThe CDC recommends flushing showerheads and faucets that haven't been used recently and regularly cleaning devices that use water.\nOwners of cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs should follow manufacturer instructions for cleaning and maintenance, per the CDC.\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "CDC warns travelers about chikungunya cases in China as global infections hit 240,000\nU.S. health officials are cautioning travelers about a mosquito-borne illness being transmitted in parts of Asia, South America, Africa and the Indian Ocean.\nAcross the globe, the chikungunya virus has sparked 240,000 cases and 90 deaths in 2025, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\nThe virus, which is infecting people through bites from Aedes mosquitoes, has been spreading in China\u2019s Guangdong province this summer. Health officials reported the area has seen over 7,000 confirmed cases since June.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this month issued a travel notice for the Guangdon province in China, encouraging travelers to practice enhanced precautions. The agency issued the same notices for other countries where outbreaks have been reported, including Bolivia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, R\u00e9union, Somalia and Sri Lanka.\nThe CDC is also asking U.S. residents to exercise caution when visiting the following countries, which have not yet reported an outbreak but are at elevated risk of exposure: Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, India, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand and Nigeria.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), 5.6 billion people are at risk of arboviral diseases such as chikungunya. Other widespread arboviruses impacting humans include dengue, Zika and yellow fever.\nWhat are the symptoms of chikungunya?\nSymptoms of the disease include fever, joint pain and swelling, headache, muscle pain and rash, according to the CDC.\nHow long does infection last?\nThe illness typically lasts between two to 12 days after infection. Some patients can experience extreme symptoms and the virus can be fatal. Elderly people, newborns and individuals with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of medical intervention.\nSevere complications, including cardiovascular, neurological and multiorgan involvement, may require intensive medical care, according to the WHO.\nHowever, more than half of patients will experience symptoms commonly associated with a fever.\nWhat treatments are available?\nThere are no known antiviral treatments for the illness.\nMedications can be used to manage pain and fever. Two chikungunya vaccines have received regulatory approval but are not widely available. In May, federal officials recommended pausing a vaccine in the United States after reports of serious adverse events.\nThe illness was first discovered in Tanzania in 1952, with outbreaks being reported in Africa and Asia, according to the WHO. Since then, the virus has been transmitted to 119 countries. Last year, more than 620,000 and 213 deaths were reported globally, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\nIn what was then dubbed the largest documented outbreak of chikungunya, an estimated several hundred thousand people were affected by \"explosive\" outbreaks of the virus in the Indian Ocean islands and India, according to a 2008 study. It\u2019s estimated that about 60 percent of regional populations were exposed.\nCDC issues travel notice for Americans\nThe CDC issued a travel warning on Friday, Aug. 1, advising U.S. residents to take enhanced precautions when traveling to China. Most of the country\u2019s cases have been reported in the city of Foshan.\nLast month, Chinese officials held a national conference to discuss treatments for and prevention of the illness. Authorities agreed to continue monitoring the situation and issue early warnings through multiple channels to prevent further spreading, according to China\u2019s National Health Commission.\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "A new COVID variant is spreading in the US: What are the symptoms?\nA new COVID-19 variant that was unheard of just months ago is now projected to be the second-most common strain in the United States.\nVariant NB.1.8.1 was first detected in China in January but accounted for about 0% of cases in the United States until May. By early June, it was estimated to account for up to 37%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe World Health Organization evaluated the additional public health risk posed by the variant as \"low at the global level in a May report, in which it also advised that currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are \"expected to remain effective to this variant against symptomatic and severe disease.\"\nHere's what we know about NB.1.8.1:\nWhat is NB.1.8.1?\nNB.1.8.1 is one of the latest variants of COVID-19, a \"slightly upgraded version\" of the LP.8.1 variant that is prominent right now, Subhash Verma, microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, previously told USA TODAY in May.\nThe new variant was first detected in January in China. As of mid-May, the variant had reached 10.7% of global reported COVID-19 cases, according to the WHO.\nVerma previously stated that NB.1.8.1 may be transferred more easily than LP.8.1. Additionally, he noted that NB.1.8.1 can evade antibodies created by vaccines or past infections more easily than LP.8.1.\n\"NB.1.8.1 is likely to spread more rapidly and evade our immune defenses more easily than LP.8.1, which is why this variant requires careful monitoring,\" Verma said.\nHow common is NB.1.8.1?\nFor two weeks starting on May 25 and ending on June 7, the CDC\u2019s Nowcast estimates tracker shows projections for the different COVID-19 variants. According to the latest CDC data, the NB.1.8.1 strain is projected to be the second highest in the United States, accounting for 37% of the total cases recorded here.\nThe most common strain is LP.8.1, also known as Omicron, which accounts for 38% of cases, followed by NB.1.8.1 with 37%, XFG with 8%, XFC making up 7%, and LF.7.9 with 4%.\nThe prominence of NB.1.8.1 in the United States has significantly increased in recent weeks, accounting for 0% of cases through March before reaching 2% in April, 5% in early May and 15% by late May.\nWhat are the symptoms of NB.1.8.1?\nThe CDC has not outlined symptoms that are specific to the NB.1.8.1. variant. Verma said that NB.1.8.1 symptoms appear similar to those of earlier COVID-19 variants.\nHowever, an extremely sore throat, colloquially called \"razor blade throat,\" has been associated with the new variant.\nPeople with the variant have reported a feeling akin to their throats being covered with razor blades, according to the Los Angeles Times, Fox News, SF Gate, and other news outlets. Many people have also taken to social media to describe the \"razor blade throat.\"\nThe CDC outlines the following as common COVID-19 symptoms:\n\u25feFever or chills\n\u25feCough\n\u25feShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n\u25feSore throat\n\u25feCongestion or a runny nose\n\u25feNew loss of taste or smell\n\u25feFatigue\n\u25feMuscle or body aches\n\u25feHeadache\n\u25feNausea or vomiting\nThe CDC advises seeking medical care if you experience any of the following symptoms:\n\u25feTrouble breathing\n\u25fePersistent pain or pressure in the chest\n\u25feNew confusion\n\u25feInability to wake or stay awake\n\u25feDepending on skin tone, lips, nail beds and skin may appear pale, gray, or blue\nHow can you protect yourself from NB.1.8.1 and other variants?\nThe WHO states that currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are expected to remain effective against the NB.1.8.1 variant.\nIn a webpage dated Jan. 7, the CDC advises that everyone over the age of six months get the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, specifically the 2024-2025 Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.\nIt also suggests that people who have never received a COVID-19 vaccine, are age 65 and older, are immunocompromised, live at a long-term care facility, are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant, and/or want to avoid getting long COVID, should get the vaccine, especially.\nHowever, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on May 27 that the COVID-19 vaccine would no longer be included in the CDC's recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women, a move that broke with previous expert guidance and bypassed the normal scientific review process.\nUnder the changes, the only people who will be recommended for COVID-19 vaccines are those over 65 and people with existing health problems. This could make it harder for others who want the COVID-19 vaccine to get it, including health care workers and healthy people under 65 with a vulnerable family member or those who want to reduce their short-term risk of infection.\nThis could mean that some who still wish to receive the vaccine may have to pay out of pocket, if they can access it at all. It is not yet known how accessible the COVID-19 vaccine will be moving forward.\nHow to (still) get a COVID-19 test for free\nIncreasing Community Access to Testing, Treatment and Response (ICATT), a federal program, continues to provide free COVID-19 testing to individuals without health insurance.\nAccording to the CDC, as of May 27, more than 19,000 locations across the country offer free testing.

      "text": "What is an mRNA vaccine, and why is it controversial?\nThe federal government is cutting $500 million in research money for development of mRNA vaccines, which were widely used against the COVID-19 virus.\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement Aug. 5 that the multimillion-dollar cuts are being made because \u201cthe data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu.\u201d\nResearch that helped develop mRNA vaccines won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2023. Members of the scientific community are criticizing Kennedy for his decision.\nHow do mRNA vaccines work?\nMessenger RNA vaccines, or mRNA, differ from traditional ones. Instead of growing a virus and weakening it to allow the body to engage its natural defenses, mRNA vaccines use pieces of genetic code to manufacture a protein, a piece of the virus. That causes the body to create its own antibodies against the virus.\nPharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech created mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 during the coronavirus pandemic. This is how those vaccines worked:\nCan't see our graphics? Click here to reload the page.\nIt can take years to develop and test traditional vaccines before they can be used. However, mRNA vaccines can be manufactured in just months, according to The New York Times. They can be rapidly restructured to combat viruses as they change. An mRNA vaccine does not interact with or affect our DNA, the CDC says. The body discards the mRNA after it's used.\nHow do traditional vaccines work?\nThe HHS unit Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority helps companies develop medical supplies to address public health threats and had provided billions of dollars for development of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, Reuters reported.\nHHS said the cancellation includes a contract awarded to Moderna for the late-stage development of its bird flu vaccine for humans and the right to purchase the shots.\nThe health agency said it was also rejecting or canceling multiple pre-award solicitations, including proposals from Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur, CSL Seqirus, Gritstone and others, Reuters said.\nKennedy is a longtime vaccine skeptic. He has called COVID-19 vaccines the deadliest ever made, and in June he fired 17 members of a CDC panel that made recommendations on vaccine use.\nIt's unclear whether patients should be expecting COVID-19 vaccines this fall, USA TODAY reported\nCONTRIBUTING Adrianna Rodriguez and Ken Alltucker\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Reuters; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; sciencemediacentre.org"

  "argos_summary": "This summer, a new COVID-19 variant, XFG, is spreading in the U.S., particularly affecting western and southern states, with 8.5% of tested individuals positive for COVID as of early August. The CDC reports that XFG accounted for 14% of cases by late June, while the predominant variant remains NB.1.8.1 at 43%. Meanwhile, health officials are also addressing a rise in Vibrio vulnificus infections along the Gulf Coast, linked to warm waters, with Louisiana reporting a decade-high number of cases. Additionally, a Legionnaires' disease outbreak in New York City has resulted in two deaths and 58 illnesses, attributed to contaminated cooling towers.",
