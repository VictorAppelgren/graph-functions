      "feedback": "Strong bones exist here: you braid AI-displacement macro risk with micro wallet discipline and link to equity-market pricing via Ford and dividend-tilted views. To elevate to world-class, implement a clean, first-principles regime framework and a tightly structured scenario tree, augment quantitative anchors from the sources, and tighten citation discipline.\n\nActionable edits in one compact pass:\n- Build an explicit multi-year regime map anchored in invariant macro concepts (real rate/neural rate around neutral, productivity/TFP progress from AI, terms-of-trade/BoP posture, and a basic policy-reaction function). State clear regime definitions (e.g., Regime A: slow-displacement, productivity-led growth; Regime B: rapid displacement with calibrated policy response; Regime C: policy missteps/intense social frictions) and the transition conditions (e.g., unemployment trajectory, inflation/stability signals, policy crystallization pace). Tie each regime to a distinct causal chain that ends in market pricing signals (risk premia, consumption, or investment flows).\n- Replace generalities with a three-scenario framework (base case, faster AI adoption with modest policy support, and policy-misalignment/accelerated social distress). For each scenario, enumerate catalysts/triggers (e.g., explicit policy outlines on transition support, labor-market data shifts, EV cycle dynamics) and invalidation signals (e.g., unemployment overshoot, UBI not delivering intended labor-supply effects, productivity undershoots).\n- Quantify channels with concrete numbers from the sources after every claim: Brookings/guild-based exposure claim (NL5YYTLF2) should cite the 25% high-exposure figure; O’Leary’s mom lessons (1GVYF2V8O) should emphasize the 15% savings habit and the durable-value rule; Ford’s case (22PL3Q360/W2622L6WW) should anchor with its 5.18% dividend yield, 8–10x forward P/E, and 17% YTD rise; EV losses and cyclicality from the Ford/Fool discussions; optional ROIC perspective from the ROIC primer (source 6) if you decide to cite it, to anchor capital-allocation resilience to AI-induced shifts.\n- Clarify the transmission logic: one coherent chain from AI-driven labor risk to household saving/investment behavior (anchored by the 15% saving mental model) to asset-pricing channels (dividend yields, ROIC-driven equity valuation, and cyclicals like Ford) and back to macro growth. Make the causal arrows explicit (AI -> productivity vs displacement, policy design -> labor supply and consumption, market pricing in risk premia and dividends).\n- Reconcile conflicts across Ford-related sources: acknowledge Ford’s income-yield appeal (W2622L6WW; 22PL3Q360) while noting consensus that Ford is not a “millionaire-maker” due to limited growth and EV losses (W2622L6WW; 22PL3Q360; Fool piece in 22PL3Q360). Present a calibrated stance: income-oriented exposure may cushion volatility, but upside is capped absent a decisive EV-cycle turnaround.\n- Strengthen SECTION FOCUS adherence: explicitly deliver (i) base case, (ii) key risks, (iii) what to watch (policy outlines, displacement data, dividend-inflows versus growth stocks), and (iv) confidence with a numeric tension test (e.g., sensitivity to unemployment shocks or policy timing). Include a concise, end-state forecast with a few targeted metrics (unemployment rate range, forecast S&P/market exposure, and dividend-weighted return range) for the horizon.\n- Tighten formatting and citations: attach a source id after each factual claim or numeric benchmark, avoid stacking multiple sources on a single sentence unless necessary for corroboration, and ensure every critical data point (25% exposure, 15% savings, 5.18% yield, 17% YTD, 8x forward P/E, 4.3%/10.1% metrics) is clearly sourced to the appropriate article.\n- Expand critical-source coverage only within the given IDs: if you keep NL5YYTLF2 as your core macro, use its Brookings/UBI psychology linkage; if you call out ROIC or total-return concepts, consider weaving in the Fool ROIC/total-return explanations (source 4 and 6) to sharpen corporate-finance discipline as a channel, but keep the IDs consistent with the MATERIAL you’ve listed.\n- Prune speculative prose and sharpen language toward testable hypotheses; convert anecdotes (e.g., Chanel suits) into durable-asset/value propositions with explicit magnitudes; explicitly distinguish between “signal” (quantified channels) and “noise” (anecdotal framing).\n\nThese edits will tighten the world-class standard: a transparent, first-principles horizon with a clear regime map, a calibrated scenario tree with explicit catalysts/invalidation, rigorous quantitative anchors tied to the cited sources, and a disciplined, fully cited causal chain that reconciles conflicts across Ford-related views.",
