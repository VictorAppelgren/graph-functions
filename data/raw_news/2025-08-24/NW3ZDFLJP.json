  "content": "Fashion conglomerate PVH (NYSE:PVH) will be announcing earnings results this Tuesday afternoon. Here\u2019s what investors should know.\n\nPVH beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 2.6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $1.98 billion, up 1.6% year on year. It was a slower quarter for the company, with full-year EPS guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations significantly and a significant miss of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates.\n\nIs PVH a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting PVH\u2019s revenue to grow 2.1% year on year to $2.12 billion, a reversal from the 6% decrease it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $2.00 per share.\n\nHeading into earnings, analysts covering the company have grown increasingly bullish with revenue estimates seeing 4 upward revisions over the last 30 days (we track 11 analysts). PVH has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at PVH\u2019s peers in the apparel and accessories segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Figs delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 5.8%, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 5.5%, and Kontoor Brands reported revenues up 8.5%, topping estimates by 3.7%. Figs traded down 5.3% following the results while Kontoor Brands was up 19.1%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Figs\u2019s results here and Kontoor Brands\u2019s results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the apparel and accessories segment, with share prices up 5.3% on average over the last month.

      "text": "Kontoor Brands (KTB)\nWe\u2019re wary of Kontoor Brands. Its poor sales growth and falling returns on capital suggest its growth opportunities are shrinking.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Kontoor Brands Will Underperform\nFounded in 2019 after separating from VF Corporation, Kontoor Brands (NYSE:KTB) is a clothing company known for its high-quality denim products.\n- Constant currency growth was below our standards over the past two years, suggesting it might need to invest in product improvements to get back on track\n- Muted 4.3% annual revenue growth over the last five years shows its demand lagged behind its consumer discretionary peers\n- On the bright side, its demand for the next 12 months is expected to accelerate above its two-year trend as Wall Street forecasts robust revenue growth of 28.1%\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Kontoor Brands\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Kontoor Brands\nKontoor Brands is trading at $77.41 per share, or 14.2x forward P/E. Kontoor Brands\u2019s multiple may seem like a great deal among consumer discretionary peers, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s this cheap.\nOur advice is to pay up for elite businesses whose advantages are tailwinds to earnings growth. Don\u2019t get sucked into lower-quality businesses just because they seem like bargains. These mediocre businesses often never achieve a higher multiple as hoped, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Kontoor Brands (KTB) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nClothing company Kontoor Brands (NYSE:KTB) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 8.5% year on year to $658.3 million. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $3.11 billion at the midpoint came in 1.6% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $1.21 per share was 46.1% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nKontoor Brands (KTB) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $658.3 million vs analyst estimates of $634.9 million (8.5% year-on-year growth, 3.7% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $1.21 vs analyst estimates of $0.83 (46.1% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $107.2 million vs analyst estimates of $83.7 million (16.3% margin, 28.1% beat)\n- The company slightly lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $3.11 billion at the midpoint from $3.08 billion\n- Management reiterated its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance of $5.45 at the midpoint\n- Operating Margin: 11.9%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 3.4%, down from 15.3% in the same quarter last year\n- Constant Currency Revenue rose 8% year on year (-1% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $3.15 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 2019 after separating from VF Corporation, Kontoor Brands (NYSE:KTB) is a clothing company known for its high-quality denim products.\nThe company quickly carved out a niche with its denim-focused apparel brands, Wrangler and Lee. These brands\u2019 products include jeans, jackets, and other apparel items.\nKontoor Brands has worldwide operations to effectively tap into different markets, catering to consumers' unique tastes and preferences. This international footprint is supported by a mix of sales channels, including brick and mortar stores, department stores, and e-commerce, enabling the company to increase its reach and enhance its customer engagement.\n4. Apparel and Accessories\nThanks to social media and the internet, not only are styles changing more frequently today than in decades past but also consumers are shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some apparel and accessories companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.\nKontoor Brands competes with other major apparel companies including Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE:LEVI), VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) which owns Vans and The North Face, PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) with its Old Navy and Gap brands.\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Regrettably, Kontoor Brands\u2019s sales grew at a sluggish 4.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmark for the consumer discretionary sector and is a rough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Kontoor Brands\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s sales dynamics by analyzing its constant currency revenue, which excludes currency movements that are outside their control and not indicative of demand. Over the last two years, its constant currency sales were flat. Because this number aligns with its normal revenue growth, we can see that Kontoor Brands has properly hedged its foreign currency exposure.\nThis quarter, Kontoor Brands reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8.5%, and its $658.3 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 3.7%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 26.1% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is eye-popping and indicates its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance.\n6. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nKontoor Brands\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly over the last 12 months but has remained more or less the same, averaging 12.6% over the last two years. This profitability was higher than the broader consumer discretionary sector, showing it did a decent job managing its expenses.\nIn Q2, Kontoor Brands generated an operating margin profit margin of 11.9%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nKontoor Brands\u2019s EPS grew at a spectacular 21.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 4.3% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nIn Q2, Kontoor Brands reported adjusted EPS at $1.21, up from $0.98 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Kontoor Brands\u2019s full-year EPS of $5.16 to grow 5.8%.\n8. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nKontoor Brands has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 13% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer discretionary sector.\nKontoor Brands\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $22.35 million in Q2, equivalent to a 3.4% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 11.9 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, prompting us to pay closer attention. Short-term fluctuations typically aren\u2019t a big deal because investment needs can be seasonal, but we\u2019ll be watching to see if the trend extrapolates into future quarters.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAlthough Kontoor Brands hasn\u2019t been the highest-quality company lately because of its poor top-line performance, it found a few growth initiatives in the past that worked out wonderfully. Its five-year average ROIC was 27.6%, splendid for a consumer discretionary business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Kontoor Brands\u2019s ROIC averaged 3.4 percentage point decreases each year. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n10. Balance Sheet Assessment\nKontoor Brands reported $107.5 million of cash and $1.53 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $436.8 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Kontoor Brands\u2019s 3.3\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $32 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n11. Key Takeaways from Kontoor Brands\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Kontoor Brands blew past analysts\u2019 constant currency revenue expectations this quarter. We were also excited its EPS outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates by a wide margin. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock traded up 15.4% to $65.44 immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Kontoor Brands?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:45 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Kontoor Brands.\nKontoor Brands\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. For starters, its revenue growth was weak over the last five years. And while its stellar ROIC suggests it has been a well-run company historically, the downside is its constant currency sales performance has disappointed. On top of that, its projected EPS for the next year is lacking.\nKontoor Brands\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 14.2x. While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're pretty confident there are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $81.17 on the company (compared to the current share price of $77.41)."

      "text": "PVH (PVH)\nPVH is up against the odds. Its low returns on capital and plummeting sales suggest it struggles to generate demand and profits, a red flag.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think PVH Will Underperform\nFounded in 1881 by a husband and wife duo, PVH (NYSE:PVH) is a global fashion conglomerate with iconic brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.\n- Sales stagnated over the last five years and signal the need for new growth strategies\n- ROIC of 2.9% reflects management\u2019s challenges in identifying attractive investment opportunities\n- Weak constant currency growth over the past two years indicates challenges in maintaining its market share\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than PVH\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than PVH\nAt $79.99 per share, PVH trades at 6x forward P/E. PVH\u2019s valuation may seem like a great deal, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s so cheap.\nCheap stocks can look like a great deal at first glance, but they can be value traps. They often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. PVH (PVH) Research Report: Q1 CY2025 Update\nFashion conglomerate PVH (NYSE:PVH) beat Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q1 CY2025, with sales up 1.6% year on year to $1.98 billion. Its non-GAAP profit of $2.30 per share was 2.2% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nPVH (PVH) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $1.98 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.93 billion (1.6% year-on-year growth, 2.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $2.30 vs analyst estimates of $2.25 (2.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: -$264.5 million vs analyst estimates of $233.8 million (-13.3% margin, significant miss)\n- Management lowered its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $10.88 at the midpoint, a 13.5% decrease\n- Operating Margin: -16.7%, down from 10.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Constant Currency Revenue rose 2% year on year (-8.7% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $4.34 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 1881 by a husband and wife duo, PVH (NYSE:PVH) is a global fashion conglomerate with iconic brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.\nPVH is headquartered in New York City and has transformed into one of the largest apparel companies in the world. Its portfolio also includes Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, and Warner\u2019s; each holds a unique position in its respective market, catering to diverse consumer tastes and preferences.\nCalvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, the flagship brands under PVH's umbrella, embody the classic American style and have a significant global presence. Calvin Klein is known for its modern, sophisticated styles, while Tommy Hilfiger is popular for its stylish American designs. These brands have become cultural icons.\nThe company operates through a mix of direct-to-consumer channels, including branded retail stores and e-commerce platforms, and wholesale distribution through department stores and specialty retailers. This omnichannel approach enables PVH to reach a broad customer base.\nPVH's global presence is marked by its operations in over 40 countries, allowing it to tap into various international markets. The company\u2019s international strategy focuses on localizing products and marketing efforts to cater to regional tastes.\n4. Apparel and Accessories\nThanks to social media and the internet, not only are styles changing more frequently today than in decades past but also consumers are shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some apparel and accessories companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.\nPVH\u2019s primary competitors include LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (Euronext:MC), Kering (Euronext:KER), Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL), VF Corp (NYSE: VFC), and Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI).\n5. Sales Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, PVH struggled to consistently increase demand as its $8.68 billion of sales for the trailing 12 months was close to its revenue five years ago. This wasn\u2019t a great result and is a sign of poor business quality.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. PVH\u2019s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 2.1% annually over the last two years.\nPVH also reports sales performance excluding currency movements, which are outside the company\u2019s control and not indicative of demand. Over the last two years, its constant currency sales averaged 2.3% year-on-year declines. Because this number aligns with its normal revenue growth, we can see that PVH has properly hedged its foreign currency exposure.\nThis quarter, PVH reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 1.6% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.6%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months. Although this projection suggests its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.\n6. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It\u2019s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\nPVH\u2019s operating margin has been trending down over the last 12 months and averaged 6.6% over the last two years. The company\u2019s profitability was mediocre for a consumer discretionary business and shows it couldn\u2019t pass its higher operating expenses onto its customers.\nThis quarter, PVH generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 16.7%, down 27.3 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nPVH\u2019s EPS grew at a spectacular 23.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its flat revenue. However, this alone doesn\u2019t tell us much about its business quality because its operating margin didn\u2019t expand.\nIn Q1, PVH reported EPS at $2.30, down from $2.45 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print beat analysts\u2019 estimates by 2.2%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects PVH\u2019s full-year EPS of $11.61 to grow 13.8%.\n8. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nPVH has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last two years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 9.2%, subpar for a consumer discretionary business.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nPVH historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 2.9%, lower than the typical cost of capital (how much it costs to raise money) for consumer discretionary companies.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, PVH\u2019s ROIC averaged 2.4 percentage point increases each year. This is a good sign, and we hope the company can continue improving.\n10. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nPVH\u2019s $3.73 billion of debt exceeds the $191 million of cash on its balance sheet. Furthermore, its 7\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio (based on its EBITDA of $512.8 million over the last 12 months) shows the company is overleveraged.\nAt this level of debt, incremental borrowing becomes increasingly expensive and credit agencies could downgrade the company\u2019s rating if profitability falls. PVH could also be backed into a corner if the market turns unexpectedly \u2013 a situation we seek to avoid as investors in high-quality companies.\nWe hope PVH can improve its balance sheet and remain cautious until it increases its profitability or pays down its debt.\n11. Key Takeaways from PVH\u2019s Q1 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing PVH beat analysts\u2019 constant currency revenue and EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EBITDA missed and it lowered its full-year EPS guidance. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 5.3% to $76.50 immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy PVH?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:55 PM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy PVH or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nPVH falls short of our quality standards. For starters, its revenue growth was weak over the last five years. And while its Forecasted free cash flow margin suggests the company will have more capital to invest or return to shareholders next year, the downside is its constant currency sales performance has disappointed. On top of that, its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities.\nPVH\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 6x. While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is huge given its shaky fundamentals. There are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $91.21 on the company (compared to the current share price of $79.99)."

      "text": "High-Quality Businesses Win\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is an exciting stock because it offers exposure to the multi-decade mega-trend of automation. On top of that, its role in automating IT Service management puts it in a prime position to benefit from the introduction of generative AI.\nWe are long-term investors, not speculators, so we don\u2019t celebrate the short-term wins. Nonetheless, we are grateful and fortunate that Lead Analyst Anthony Lee chose a good time (August 17, 2023) to issue our ServiceNow buy recommendation exclusively to paying members of StockStory Edge. The stock was roughly $540 a share then.\nDespite the 85+% share price increase since then, we still have ServiceNow in our portfolio. Note that we (the StockStory team) only bought shares in ServiceNow days after recommending it to members of StockStory Edge. And if in the future we no longer consider ServiceNow compelling, StockStory Edge members will be the first to know. We never trade personally until after informing our members and giving them 5 trading days to act.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nServiceNow (NOW): StockStory Edge Stock Of The Month For August 2023\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has been a stock market winner ever since its summer 2012 IPO. It priced at $18, closed its first day of trading at $24.60, and hasn\u2019t looked back. The shares now trade at around $1,000. Since its IPO, this is not just one of the best-performing stocks in enterprise software but in the whole market.\nJust because the stock is up big, however, doesn\u2019t mean the opportunity is gone.\nIn this case? Quite the opposite.\nThat\u2019s because ServiceNow offers sticky mission-critical products across IT, HR, and customer service that reduce manual work, eliminate human error, and keep large corporations functioning. The company generates reliable subscription revenue from its happy customers and because of attractive unit economics, that revenue turns into high profits and free cash margins. The excess cash churned out by the business can be used to continually widen ServiceNow's lead over the competition competition from a brand, product, and customer service standpoint.\nThe kicker is that ServiceNow is now very much a Generative AI beneficiary due to its partnership with NVIDIA.\nWhat Does ServiceNow Do?\nServiceNow\u2019s software platform helps businesses automate workflows and gives them a birds-eye view of their operations, unifying what has become an increasingly complex technology stack for many companies.\nServiceNow was founded in 2003 when current Chairman of the Board Fred Luddy recognized the inefficiencies of traditional IT Service Management (ITSM) at a time when employees might have to jump through multiple hoops to request help and then sit on standby for hours until someone from the IT department fixed their problem.\nLuddy envisioned a world where technology could speed up these slow, cumbersome processes and launched the company\u2019s first product in 2006.\nToday, corporations of all sizes rely on ServiceNow to not only streamline IT but also manage their entire organization through a simple yet comprehensive online portal. For example, onboarding a new employee involves HR for payroll, IT for device needs, and whatever is specific to that person\u2019s department.\nServiceNow brings these disparate systems together and automates the onboarding process, which will inevitably happen over and over again.\nServiceNow\u2019s all-in-one platform gives customers numerous products to choose from, as shown in the graphic below. These software programs allow administrators to execute repetitive, labor-intensive tasks with the click of a button. On top of that, each product is wrapped in analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities, allowing customers to extract powerful insights from their data.\nThe company\u2019s ambition doesn\u2019t end there. ServiceNow has a strong track record of releasing new products to boost its customers\u2019 productivity, the latest being a low-code platform that enables non-technical employees to build custom software applications. ServiceNow constantly surprises its customers (and investors) with innovation, granting it huge upside potential.\nWhy We Love An Investment In ServiceNow\nFor starters, we love the software subscription business model. If you sell sneakers, for instance, customers who bought from you last quarter may not come back again this quarter. On the other hand, software customers often sign multi-year contracts, resulting in recurring, predictable revenues and lower customer acquisition costs.\nWithin software, we believe ServiceNow has a very strong brand. \u201cNobody ever got fired for buying IBM\u201d was a common phrase in IT circles in the 1980s and early 1990s, and we argue that NOW is heading in the same direction. 85% of Fortune 500 companies are ServiceNow customers and those controlling IT budgets view the company as trustworthy, reliable, and safe because of how many happy, loyal, and influential customers it has.\nFurthermore, ServiceNow\u2019s customers rarely cancel their subscriptions because its products are deeply intertwined with company operations. ServiceNow is capable of replacing a multitude of legacy software systems\u2013everything from technical support to managing downtime. That means switching to ServiceNow can make life easier for employees, and once it\u2019s there, switching away is very disruptive. This results in a sky-high renewal rate of around 98%.\nTurning to profit, ServiceNow stands out with its gross margin of around 85% on its subscription revenue. From there, its adjusted operating margin and free cash flow margin will both hover around 30% when 2024 is all said and done. This makes ServiceNow a money-printing machine with the capital to grow its competitive position by improving existing products, adding new products, and promoting its brand.\nWhat Does ServiceNow\u2019s Future Hold?\nWe think much of ServiceNow\u2019s future growth will stem from selling more products to existing customers. The chart below shows how its \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy has developed over time. ServiceNow has successfully upsold its customers as 82% of contracts in 2023 featured five or more products purchased, up from 54% in 2019 (note that NNACV is 'net new annual contract value', a proxy for incremental revenue). We expect this number to be around 85% when the company reports 2024 results.\nAnother underappreciated growth lever is ServiceNow\u2019s pricing power. Before 2018, the company had one pricing tier for all products. That changed in 2018 when NOW introduced a \u2018Pro\u2019 tier for IT service management, whereby customers could upgrade their packages to get more analytical and AI functionality. What\u2019s next? Pro Plus, of course. It boasts \u201cgreater AI capabilities\u201d, and we expect it to contribute to future growth.\nWe think as more of ServiceNow\u2019s growth comes from existing customers, marketing expenses will moderate as a percentage of revenue, and thus we believe ServiceNow can earn higher profit margins as it grows.\nWhy Is Now The Right Time to Buy?\nServiceNow\u2019s price-to-forward-sales (next 12 months) multiple is currently over 15x, higher than most companies and higher than when we recommended it back in August 2023.\nNonetheless, we think ServiceNow can justify its valuation due to its long-term demand tailwinds, predictable subscription model, best-in-class customer retention, and robust profit margins. We'd also add that our extensive backtest research and analysis has shown that when it comes to outperforming the market, business quality matters much more than entry price--you get what you pay for. Said differently, valuation may seem daunting in the near term, but companies showing robust growth up and down the P&L \"grow into\" their premium multiples over time.\nThe cherry on top is that the company is increasingly showing that it will be a Generative AI beneficiary for years--even decades--to come. In May 2023, ServiceNow and NVIDIA announced a partnership. The principal goal for ServiceNow was to develop custom large language models (LLMs) using NVIDIA\u2019s technology.\nThe result includes intelligent virtual assistants and AI chatbots that can better resolve user issues and support requests. The secret sauce involves two parts: the GenAI\u2019s capability to pull knowledge from unstructured data such as source code, internal documents, or videos to answer questions combined with the LLMs\u2019 ability to summarize the information, eliminate the technical jargon, and give conversational responses.\nIn February 2024, ServiceNow unveiled an industry-specific solution for the telecom sector. \u2018Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management\u2019 is for an industry where consumers are particularly frustrated with their customer service interactions (have you ever called customer service about your smartphone bill or tried to change plans??). Surely, similar solutions for other consumer-facing industries will roll out soon.\nWe really like that these GenAI and LLM-driven offerings are easy for customers to understand and provide straightforward, quantifiable benefits (the cost of a customer service agent). Combined with ServiceNow\u2019s large customer base that already trusts the company in IT, Customer Service, and Human Resources, we think the company can start reaping the needle-moving benefits of GenAI in the near term.\nWith its product portfolio that is mission-critical for most customers, the expansion of this portfolio, and the GenAI tailwind, we think ServiceNow's revenue can sustain 20+% growth for a number of years.\nWith efficiency on expenses, especially the sales and marketing leverage, that revenue growth can translate into roughly 35% adjusted operating profit growth over time. It's had a big run in a short period and could take a breather in the near term, but we\u2019re convinced the stock could approach $1,550 by the end of 2027. If that occurs, it would still generate a return that likely beats the market despite the big jump in the share price since we first pitched the stock.\nLooking beyond 2026, we love a number of things about ServiceNow: the secular tailwinds it enjoys, the company's continually strengthening brand, and its products that bring customers great value and efficiency. This combination will drive stronger-for-longer revenue growth than the market anticipates.\nThis is a stock for investors looking for a high-quality business to hold over the long term.\nWhat Are The Key Risks And How Do We Feel About Them?\nThose stocks that are \u2018\u201csure things\u201d? They don\u2019t exist. Every investment has its risks.\nFor ServiceNow, we\u2019ve boiled them down into the three most important: competition, margins, and valuation.\nServiceNow has a tight grip on the IT service management market, but future returns will need to come from selling adjacent products where it faces stiffer competition. This means squaring off against Salesforce in customer service management, Microsoft in low-code/AI applications, and younger upstarts like Rippling in HR solutions. More competition means that ServiceNow may have to spend more on product development or accept lower gross margins to maintain its growth rate.\nThat leads us to our next risk\u2013margins. Our thesis holds that ServiceNow can reduce its expenses as a percentage of revenue as it grows. There\u2019s a chance this doesn\u2019t happen. For example, new products may gain less traction than expected or cost more than anticipated to develop.\nTurning to valuation, ServiceNow isn\u2019t conventionally cheap based on current earnings. It has a lofty P/E ratio, implying the market expects many years of growth ahead. That makes it vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and sentiment around high-growth businesses.\nUltimately, we\u2019re comfortable with these risks because of ServiceNow\u2019s dominance, reputation, products, financial strength. We expect many years of healthy growth in revenue, profits, and free cash flow.\nClosing Thoughts\nWe\u2019re excited about ServiceNow at this stage in its evolution. Software is still eating the world, and within software, ServiceNow is an elite asset in terms of its products and financials. Please note that members of StockStory hold shares in ServiceNow.

      "text": "Figs (FIGS)\nWe wouldn\u2019t buy Figs. Its sales have underperformed and its low returns on capital show it has few growth opportunities.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Figs Will Underperform\nRising to fame via TikTok and founded in 2013 by Heather Hasson and Trina Spear, Figs (NYSE:FIGS) is a healthcare apparel company known for its stylish approach to medical attire and uniforms.\n- Falling earnings per share over the last three years has some investors worried as stock prices ultimately follow EPS over the long term\n- Estimated sales growth of 1.5% for the next 12 months implies demand will slow from its two-year trend\n- Lackluster 3.5% annual revenue growth over the last two years indicates the company is losing ground to competitors\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Figs\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Figs\nAt $7 per share, Figs trades at 126.4x forward P/E. We consider this valuation aggressive considering the business fundamentals.\nWe prefer to invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with superior earnings growth.\n3. Figs (FIGS) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHealthcare apparel company Figs (NYSE:FIGS) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 5.8% year on year to $152.6 million. Its GAAP profit of $0.04 per share was $0.03 above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nFigs (FIGS) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $152.6 million vs analyst estimates of $144.7 million (5.8% year-on-year growth, 5.5% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): $0.04 vs analyst estimates of $0.02 ($0.03 beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $19.73 million vs analyst estimates of $12.6 million (12.9% margin, 56.5% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 6.5%, up from 1.1% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was -$13.52 million, down from $7.55 million in the same quarter last year\n- Active customers: 2.74 million\n- Market Capitalization: $1.06 billion\nCompany Overview\nRising to fame via TikTok and founded in 2013 by Heather Hasson and Trina Spear, Figs (NYSE:FIGS) is a healthcare apparel company known for its stylish approach to medical attire and uniforms.\nBefore Figs, most medical scrubs were unisex, uncomfortable, and lacked style. Figs changed this by introducing scrubs that not only met the practical demands of healthcare professionals but also provided a modern, tailored fit and aesthetic appeal. This focus on design, comfort, and functionality quickly resonated with medical professionals.\nThe company's product line includes scrubs, lab coats, and other medical apparel accessories designed for men and women, and could expand its offerings into adjacent areas over time. Figs\u2019s products stand out due to their proprietary fabric technology, which is antimicrobial, wrinkle-resistant, moisture-wicking, and highly durable.\nFigs operates on a direct-to-consumer model, primarily selling its products online, allowing the company to maintain control over its brand experience, customer service, and pricing strategy. The direct-to-consumer model also enables Figs to build a community with its customer base bolstered by engagement through social media and other digital platforms.\n4. Apparel and Accessories\nThanks to social media and the internet, not only are styles changing more frequently today than in decades past but also consumers are shifting the way they buy their goods, favoring omnichannel and e-commerce experiences. Some apparel and accessories companies have made concerted efforts to adapt while those who are slower to move may fall behind.\nFigs's primary competitors include Dickies Medical (owned by VF Corp NYSE:VFC) and private companies Cherokee Uniforms, Barco Uniforms, Scrubs & Beyond, and Medline Industries.\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, Figs\u2019s 30.3% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth beat the average consumer discretionary company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Figs\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 3.5% over the last two years was well below its five-year trend.\nWe can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of active customers, which reached 2.74 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Figs\u2019s active customers averaged 7.8% year-on-year growth. Because this number is higher than its revenue growth during the same period, we can see the company\u2019s monetization has fallen.\nThis quarter, Figs reported year-on-year revenue growth of 5.8%, and its $152.6 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 5.5%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. Although this projection implies its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector.\n6. Operating Margin\nFigs\u2019s operating margin has shrunk over the last 12 months and averaged 3.2% over the last two years. Although this result isn\u2019t good, the company\u2019s elite historical revenue growth suggests it ramped up investments to capture market share. We\u2019ll keep a close eye to see if this strategy pays off.\nIn Q2, Figs generated an operating margin profit margin of 6.5%, up 5.4 percentage points year on year. This increase was a welcome development and shows it was more efficient.\n7. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nSadly for Figs, its EPS declined by 34.3% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 30.3%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nIn Q2, Figs reported EPS at $0.04, up from $0.01 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Figs to perform poorly. Analysts forecast its full-year EPS of $0.04 will hit $0.04.\n8. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nFigs has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 10.6% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer discretionary sector.\nFigs burned through $13.52 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 8.9% margin. The company\u2019s cash flow turned negative after being positive in the same quarter last year, prompting us to pay closer attention. Short-term fluctuations typically aren\u2019t a big deal because investment needs can be seasonal, but we\u2019ll be watching to see if the trend extrapolates into future quarters.\nOver the next year, analysts predict Figs\u2019s cash conversion will fall. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 7% for the last 12 months will decrease to 2%.\n9. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nFigs historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 11.4%, somewhat low compared to the best consumer discretionary companies that consistently pump out 25%+.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, Figs\u2019s ROIC has decreased significantly over the last few years. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n10. Balance Sheet Assessment\nCompanies with more cash than debt have lower bankruptcy risk.\nFigs is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $238.8 million of cash and $51.7 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $187.1 million net cash position is 17.6% of its market cap and gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n11. Key Takeaways from Figs\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Figs blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates by a wide margin. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock traded up 12% to $7.35 immediately after reporting.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy Figs?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:52 PM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy Figs or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nWe cheer for all companies serving everyday consumers, but in the case of Figs, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. Although its revenue growth was exceptional over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its Forecasted free cash flow margin suggests the company will ramp up its investments next year. And while the company\u2019s projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its declining EPS over the last three years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nFigs\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 126.4x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think other companies feature superior fundamentals at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $6.42 on the company (compared to the current share price of $7), implying they don\u2019t see much short-term potential in Figs."

  "argos_summary": "PVH Corp. beat revenue expectations in Q1 2025, reporting $1.98\u202fbillion in sales, but missed earnings and EBITDA guidance, leading analysts to lower full\u2011year EPS forecasts. Despite a modest 1.6% YoY revenue growth, the company\u2019s weak operating margin, low ROIC, and high debt have prompted a cautious outlook, with many analysts raising revenue estimates but still viewing PVH as a potential underperformer. Peer results from Figs and Kontoor Brands show stronger margins and revenue beats, and the broader apparel sector has seen mixed performance.
