      "feedback": "Actionable feedback to upgrade to world‑class quality in a compact paragraph:\n\nStrengthen the horizon with a formal, multi‑year regime framework anchored in first principles: state invariant anchors (e.g., oil market balance given supply elasticity, OPEC+ spare capacity, and global refinery utilization), then define regimes (A: supply‑dominant oversupply; B: demand reacceleration vs. stagnation; C: sanction/shock scenarios) and the transition conditions between them. Quantify each regime with explicit thresholds drawn from sources: IEA/JC data show 2025 supply +2.5 mbpd and 2026 +1.9 mbpd while demand grows ~0.68–0.70 mbpd in 2025–26 (J99EM2TPZ); refinery runs near all‑time highs (to 85.6 mbpd in 2025) (J99EM2TPZ); Brent/WTI price ranges around mid‑$60s in the near term (T1QE6JPIX); and OPEC+ output and non‑OPEC supply drive the balance (J99EM2TPZ, T1QE6JPIX). Build a base case with a year‑by‑year price path (e.g., Brent in the mid‑$60s in 2025–26, with upside/downside bands) and attach explicit probability weights to each regime, then attach a separate bull/bear scenario for sanction shifts or demand surprise. Deepen the causal chain from macro anchors to market pricing: real rate differential considerations and terms‑of‑trade effects on capex, BoP implications for energy import costs, and the risk premium on oil equities from the global balance, linking these to cash generation and equity valuations. Improve the SLB narrative by grounding the “cash returns to shareholders” signal in first‑principles cash flow and risk budgets, not solely Guru‑style screens: cite Validea’s Meb Faber shareholder‑yield framework (65% signal; 19.5% annualized return since 2009 for the model, vs. S&P 500 13.2% in 2009–present) and explicitly separate model performance from realized results (11); then map how SLB’s cash return policy translates into stock‑price under each regime, including sensitivities to oil price, capex intensity, and debt paydown pace. Reconcile conflicting demand signals by explicitly presenting both IEA’s subdued demand trajectory and OPEC’s higher 2026 demand view, flagging the resulting dual‑path risk in a dedicated “conflict/uncertainty” box (J99EM2TPZ). Add catalysts/triggers and invalidate factors: triggers such as a sharp sanctions shift on Russia/Iran, a regime change in U.S. shale capex, or a sustained inventory draw/down; invalidation if a sustained demand surprise materializes (as per IEA/OPEC forecasts and EIA/Reuters notes in T1QE6JPIX); tie these to observable data (inventory paths, refinery runs, sanctions news). Ensure every factual claim has a source ID suffix (e.g., J99EM2TPZ for IEA/May–Aug 2025 balance, T1QE6JPIX for near‑term price, 11 for Shareholder Yield performance) and avoid non‑essential sources (e.g., entertainment outlets) unless used for unrelated context. Clearly separate the base case, upside/downside, and a low‑probability regime to sharpen risk assessment; finally, end with a concise “what to watch” and a calibrated, multi‑year confidence interval.",
