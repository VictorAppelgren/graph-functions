  "description": "After losing the Oval Office to Trump, Harris was widely believed to be exploring a gubernatorial bid in her home state.",
  "content": "Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter received a major boost in her race to become California\u2019s next governor after former Vice President Kamala Harris declined to mount a gubernatorial campaign \u2014 and its showing in the polls.\n\nWith Harris out of the race, Porter has become the Democratic frontrunner to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) with over a year left before the 2026 gubernatorial election.\n\nAfter losing the Oval Office to President Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential election, Harris was widely believed to be exploring a gubernatorial bid in her home state. Her announcement last month telling voters she had decided against doing so opened up the field to a number of candidates, particularly Porter.\n\nOf voters who had backed a potential Harris gubernatorial campaign before she backed out of the race, 30% now plan to support Porter, according to new polling from the Politico-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab survey.\n\nPorter\u2019s \u201cgains from Harris are probably a combination of just being better known and having a clear ideological stamp,\u201d Jack Citrin, a political science professor at UC Berkeley and partner on the poll, said. \u201cShe has a particular progressive stamp \u2014 more than the other two guys \u2014 and I think that\u2019s part of her appeal.\u201dr\n\nPorter entered the race on March 11 and has led the pack of Democratic candidates vying for the primary win that includes Former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis was also a contender before suspending her campaign on Aug. 8.\n\nStill, Porter and other candidates were held back as speculation for months fomented that Harris was toying with the idea of campaigning for the governor\u2019s mansion. Porter repeatedly said Harris would have a \u201cpowerful field-clearing effect\u201d if she entered the race.\n\nWITH HARRIS OUT, WHICH DEMOCRATS ARE LEFT STANDING FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR BID?\n\nAside from the boost Porter has seen given Harris\u2019s recent announcement declining to run, Villaraigosa also experienced a bump, with 16% of Harris supporters backing him, while another 11% transferred their support to Becerra.\n\nThe survey was conducted from July 28 and Aug. 12 among 875 voters and had a margin of error of 2.6%.",

      "text": "After former Vice President Kamala Harris announced on Wednesday that she wouldn\u2019t run for California governor, the field opened up for various candidates.\nCalifornia will elect a new governor in 2026, as incumbent Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) will be termed out. In such a deep blue state, the winner of the Democratic primary is nearly certain to win the general election.\nHere are the top contenders to replace Newsom, with Harris now out of the picture.\nKatie Porter\nFormer Democratic Rep. Katie Porter entered the race on March 11 and is the front-runner. She was elected in 2018 to represent a district historically represented by Republicans. She was a vocal, anti-Trump voice during her time in Congress.\nPorter opted to run for Senate during the 2024 elections and lost in the Democratic primary to Sen. Adam Schiff, who went on to beat Steve Garvey in the general election.\nEarlier in her career, Porter was appointed by then-Attorney General Harris in 2012 as California\u2019s independent monitor of a $25 billion national mortgage settlement.\nWith Harris as the previous polling favorite, Porter was the second most popular Democrat in the polls.\nXavier Becerra\nFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra launched his campaign in April. He has over 30 years of experience representing California, serving in a district representing neighborhoods around Downtown Los Angeles from 1993 through 2017. He was also chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.\nIn 2017, then-Gov. Jerry Brown chose him to replace Kamala Harris as California\u2019s attorney general after she was elected to the Senate. He became HHS secretary in March 2021 and held the position for the rest of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.\nFollowing Harris\u2019s announcement that she wouldn\u2019t run, Becerra appeared to link himself to her, saying he was \u201cproud of our shared record.\u201d This move isn\u2019t surprising, given that Harris polled 57% among California Democrats.\nEleni Kounalakis\nLt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis was elected to her current position after a grassroots campaign that saw her visit all of California\u2019s 58 counties. As California\u2019s No. 2, Kounalakis has gone so far to prove her progressive stances that she\u2019s often gone ahead of Newsom, even going against him in asking California Secretary of State Shirley Weber to exclude Trump from the state\u2019s 2024 primary.\nKounalakis launched her bid for governor over three years before Election Day, announcing in April 2023.\nKonalakis also praised Harris after her announcement to leave the race.\nAntonio Villaraigosa\nAntonio Villaraigosa served as Los Angeles mayor from 2005 to 2013 and has since spent his time in advocacy. He experienced a blistering loss in the 2018 gubernatorial election, coming in third place, but is now hoping for another shot.\nKATIE PORTER STUCK IN WAITING GAME IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR\u2019S RACE\nVillaraigosa has catered much of his message toward affordability and economic growth.\nLike the other candidates, Villaraigosa praised Harris\u2019s decision not to run for governor."

      "text": "President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election on July 21, 2024, sending shock waves through a race already upended by the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in, only to be beaten by Trump. As Democrats try to recover, Biden, suffering from cancer, aims to protect what remains of his legacy. This Washington Examiner series \u201cDropout\u201d will look at what happened on that day, the aftermath for Biden, and how Harris\u2019s future is up in the air. Part 3 looks at Harris as she teases a return to the political arena.\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris came out of political isolation this week to commemorate the first anniversary of the start of her presidential run with a post on X. Like her campaign, it totally missed the mark.\n\u201cOne year ago today, I began my campaign for President of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the 107 days of our race, I had the opportunity and honor to travel our nation and meet with Americans who were fighting for a better future. And today, millions of Americans continue to stand up for our values, our ideals, and our democracy. Their courage and resolve inspires me. Whether you are attending a protest, calling your representatives, or building community: I want to say: Thank you. We are in this fight together.\u201d\nHarris was criticized almost immediately for her post, with people on social media reminding her that it was not the flex she thought it was.\n\u201cLol I\u2019m not so sure this is something to uh, celebrate,\u201d conservative commentator Tomi Lahren wrote.\nA lot has happened to Harris over the past year.\nShe became the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominee following the midsummer coup of former President Joe Biden, the party\u2019s own democratically elected nominee, and her campaign blew through $1.5 billion in a 15-week presidential campaign. It dished out large sums of money on advertising, social media influencers, staff, celebrity concerts, drone shows, and a town hall featuring Oprah Winfrey.\nFor all the time, money, and effort, Harris had very little to show for it. She became the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the national popular vote in two decades, falling to President Donald Trump in every battleground state.\nDROPOUT PART 2: JOE BIDEN\u2019S MIXED ATTEMPTS TO DEFEND HIS LEGACY AGAINST AUTOPEN INVESTIGATIONS\nHeading home\nHarris spent the first seven months of the year settling back into her Brentwood, California, home with husband Doug Emhoff.\n\u201cLosses are hard in politics,\u201d Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist who served as senior adviser to Harris and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), told the Washington Examiner. \u201cPeople put their lives on hold to serve and to run, and she deserves the opportunity to rest, clear her head, and decide what she thinks is best \u2014 for herself, for the people of California, for the people of this country, and for her family, for that matter.\u201d\nThose close to the former vice president said she has been quietly staging a political return. Some claim that she is considering entering California\u2019s 2026 gubernatorial contest. Others said she\u2019s laying the groundwork for a third White House run. Harris purportedly told people at a pre-Oscars party that she would make a decision on her political future by the end of summer. A bid for statewide office would almost assuredly take a 2028 presidential run off the table, but Harris\u2019s lack of definite answers has put the California contest on hold as other candidates in the race and deep-pocketed donors wait for her to make a move.\n\u201cEveryone has been trying to read the tea leaves,\u201d San Francisco-based political strategist April Zaradnik told the Washington Examiner.\nDROPOUT PART ONE: BIDEN\u2019S SEISMIC DECISION FROM ONE YEAR AGO STILL HAS UNANSWERED QUESTIONS\n\u2018Good God, get on with it already\u2019\nMonday\u2019s X post got everyone talking about Harris again, but still, no one knows for sure what her next steps will be. For now, everything is still a mystery. And for some Californians, it is getting old.\n\u201cCalifornia is not a consolation prize for losing the presidency, and a Kamala Harris run for governor isn\u2019t going to inspire an electorate that is fed up with the Democratic Party\u2019s staid-and-afraid status quo,\u201d Sacramento Bee opinion writer Robin Epley recently wrote. \u201cThat being said, if Harris is going to run for governor of California \u2014 good God, get on with it already.\u201d\nEpley added that Harris\u2019s will-she-or-won\u2019t-she games \u201cbelong to a homecoming queen race, not a gubernatorial race.\u201d\nTony Thurmond, the state superintendent of public instruction who launched his campaign in 2023, said the uncertainty with Harris \u201ccreates a little bit of a limbo situation.\u201d He told the Los Angeles Times that Democrats in the race all have the same question: \u201cIs she going to run?\u201d The only answer, Thurmond said, is an unsatisfying \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\nCalifornia candidates wait on Harris\nThe Democrats who are already running for governor lack Harris\u2019s star power and know all too well that her entry could upend the race. The election may be a year away, but the primaries are creeping up, and the candidates need to start focusing on their ground game, courting voters, and donors.\nFormer Rep. Katie Porter, who declared her candidacy in March, has repeatedly said Harris would have a \u201cpowerful field-clearing effect\u201d if she entered the race. But Porter, a liberal firebrand who harnessed the power of social media and whiteboards in Congress to gain popularity, said she is not going anywhere. She is ready for a fight.\nPorter received attention nationwide for taking CEOs of big pharmaceuticals to task, but she was no match for Schiff\u2019s Senate campaign machine. Schiff outmaneuvered her in the state\u2019s dramatic 2024 jungle primary. He made a risky gamble of securing his position by boosting a Republican contender and edging Porter, his toughest competitor, out of the race.\nOther Democratic gubernatorial contenders such as former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra have said they will stay in the race regardless of what Harris decides. But others, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Konalakis, who is close friends with Harris, are likely to step aside if the former vice president enters the race.\nOne Democratic commentator and alumnus of the Hillary for America digital team is asking Harris to stay on the West Coast.\nKaivan Shroff told the Washington Examiner that even though Harris continues to enjoy a \u201cdeep loyalty\u201d among women and progressives and commands \u201cunmatched name recognition and fundraising potential,\u201d even her \u201cstaunchest allies must acknowledge that another presidential campaign in 2028 would come too soon.\u201d\nShroff said having Harris focus on California would allow the party to reset.\n\u201cThe conditions that made 2024 such an uphill climb haven\u2019t gone away, and trying again too quickly could compound political wounds rather than heal them,\u201d Shroff said. \u201cMore than that, it would deny the Democratic Party the much-needed chance to have a fresh, competitive primary, as they struggle to redefine themselves in the wake of President Trump\u2019s victory.\u201d\nVoters want answers\nShould Harris decide to run in California, it may not be as easy of a win as she thinks or as cushy of a job.\nHarris was known as a progressive hero in her home state of California. In 2019, the watchdog site GovTrack named her \u201cthe most liberal\u201d member of the Senate and the senator least likely to sign on to bipartisan legislation. When she ran for president, she started to shy away from some of her more extreme positions, quietly erasing her record and turning herself into a centrist Democrat because she thought it would make her more electable. She very publicly changed her mind on fracking, border security, the Green New Deal, and taxes on tips.\nThe former vice president would also open herself up to questions about her 107-day sprint to the White House, what she knew about Biden\u2019s declining health, and whether someone who has run unsuccessfully for president twice really wants to be California\u2019s governor.\nShe would also inherit a difficult budget situation brought on by fiscal mismanagement and multibillion-dollar gaps due to a flurry of spending by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who is also believed to be considering a 2028 White House run. The new governor would also have to deal with California\u2019s 1.6 million illegal immigrants, costly climate policies, homelessness, inadequate disaster relief, an insurance crisis, and near-constant fighting with the Trump administration.\nDespite that, it seems that if Harris wants the job, she could get it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s telling that so many people are eager to write Vice President Harris\u2019s next chapter for her \u2014 when the reality is, she\u2019s one of the most popular and accomplished elected officials in the Democratic Party, with deep roots in California, a powerful fundraising network, and a policy bench that few can match,\u201d Adin Lenchner, founder of Carroll Street Campaigns, told the Washington Examiner.\nHarris would lead the pack in a gubernatorial race, according to a July poll from the University of California, Irvine. The survey also found that 41% of respondents would back the former vice president over an unnamed Republican candidate \u2014 highlighting both her early advantage and the potential competitiveness of the race. About 16% of those asked said they didn\u2019t know who they would vote for, while 14% said they would not vote.\nOn the national stage, a June Emerson College poll of possible 2028 Democratic presidential primary candidates found former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg surging past Harris. Sixteen percent said they would cast their ballot for Buttigieg in the primary, compared to 13% for Harris. That\u2019s a big change from the Emerson poll in November 2024, which had Harris at 37% and Buttigieg at 4%, a few weeks after Harris\u2019s bruising election defeat."
