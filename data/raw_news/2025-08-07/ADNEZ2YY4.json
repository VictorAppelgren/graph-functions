  "title": "Britain begins detaining 'small boat' migrants to send back to France",
  "description": "Migrants arriving off Britain's south coast were being taken into detention ahead of their removal back to France under a new reciprocal cross-Channel treaty.",
  "content": "Aug. 7 (UPI) -- A landmark Anglo-French \"one-in, one-out\" migrant agreement saw the first small boat arrivals on the British coast taken into custody in preparation for being returned to France, the government said Thursday.\n\nThe detentions got underway on Wednesday with migrants who had crossed the Channel \"illegally\" held in secure immigration centers pending their removal to France, which was expected to take place in a matter of weeks, according to a Home Office news release.\n\nIt pledged full transparency, saying detainees would be briefed on the process for returning them to France and kept updated on their progress through the system on an individual basis.\n\nFor each migrant sent back, Britain will take in one pre-approved to claim asylum who has not previously attempted to enter the country and who has completed a formal application and security clearance process in France that is only open to those with a passport or identity document.\n\nPre-checked individuals, or family groups, will then journey safely from France via scheduled rail, ferry or airline services.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper declined to say how many migrants had been detained but vowed to fight any challenge launched in the courts in an attempt to block them from being sent back to France.\n\n\"The transfers to immigration removal centers are underway as we speak, so we won't provide operational details at this point that criminal gangs can simply use and exploit. But no one should be in any doubt: anyone who arrives from now on is eligible for immediate detention and return,\" she said.\n\nCooper added that it was the very early stages of a pilot that would take time to scale up, but stressed, given that France was a safe country for all, including migrants, the government would \"robustly defend against any legal challenge that people try.\"\n\nHowever, Home Office sources told The Guardian that the scheme inked last month during a state visit to Britain by French President Emmanuel Macron would initially only involve about 50 asylum seekers.\n\nImmigration lawyers warned that the ambiguous terms of the treaty left it open to legal challenge by individuals trying to prevent their removal from the country.\n\nAt least one charity cautioned that the scheme shut out people fleeing war or famine in countries including Eritrea or Sudan because they were unlikely to meet the criteria for official identification.\n\n\"This week in Calais, we spoke with many people from Eritrea and almost none of them have copies of their Eritrean passports because they were never able to obtain one,\" said a spokesperson for Refugee Legal Support.\n\nThe spokesperson said the largest group making the journey across the Channel so far this year were Eritreans, 86% of whom had their refugee claims upheld once they reached Britain -- but virtually all of them would never get that chance under the scheme.\n\nThe deal, marking the first time Britain has been able to return migrants who arrive from France, came as the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats in the first seven months of 2025 topped a record 25,436.\n\nUnder the treaty, Britain is responsible for the costs of transporting migrants in both directions, and France is entitled to refuse to accept returnees it believes pose \"a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Schengen states.\"\n\nSchengen states refer to the borderless, free travel area comprising 25 of 27 member countries of the European Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.",

      "text": "First migrants detained under 'one in, one out' deal with France\nThe first migrants have been detained under the UK's new \"one in, one out\" deportation deal with France after crossing the English Channel.\nPictures showed the migrants wearing life jackets disembarking from Border Force boats in Dover on Wednesday, the first day the pilot scheme came into force.\nFresh Home Office figures reveal 155 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel on Wednesday. The government earlier said those detained will be held in immigration removal centres until they are returned to France.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper did not confirm how many migrants were being held and said she was prepared to resist any legal challenges aimed at preventing their removal to France.\nShe said: \"The transfers to immigration removal centres are under way as we speak, so we won't provide operational details at this point that criminal gangs can simply use and exploit.\n\"But no-one should be in any doubt: anyone who arrives from now on is eligible for immediate detention and return.\"\nShe said the first migrants could be sent back within weeks.\nCooper added: \"It's the beginning of the pilot and it will build as well over time, but we're also clear that France is a safe country, so we will robustly defend against any legal challenge that people try.\"\nThe pilot scheme was set up as part of a deal announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron during his state visit to the UK in July.\nSpeaking about the first detentions, Sir Keir said: \"If you break the law to enter this country, you will face being sent back. When I say I will stop at nothing to secure our borders, I mean it.\"\nThe pilot is set to last 11 months and will see the UK accepting an equal number of asylum seekers who have not tried to cross and can pass security and eligibility checks.\nUK officials aim to make referrals for returns to France within three days of a migrant's arrival by small boat, with French authorities responding within 14 days.\nThis is in exchange for an approved asylum seeker in France to be brought to the UK under a safe route.\nAdults and families in France are able to express an interest in coming to the UK through an online platform set up by the Home Office.\nThey must meet suitability criteria, go through a standard visa application process and pass security checks.\nIf accepted, they would be given three months in the UK to claim asylum or apply for a visa, and would be subject to the same rules for all asylum seekers not allowed to work, study or have access to benefits.\nThe Home Office is expected to launch a campaign in the coming days to make migrants in northern France and elsewhere aware of the new treaty.\nAs of 30 July, more than 25,000 people had crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - about 49% higher than at the same point in 2024.\nUK and international law prevents the government from sending asylum seekers back to their country of origin before their claim has been considered and turned down. However, they can be sent to safe countries prepared to consider their claim.\nThe Conservatives argue that the new scheme will not be a big enough deterrent and will not return large numbers of would-be migrants.\nThey also believe that Labour's deal with the French will be less effective than the Rwanda plan proposed by the previous Tory government.\nShadow home secretary Chris Philp told BBC Breakfast that it was a \"foolish error\" to scrap the scheme which would have seen some migrants sent to Rwanda."

      "text": "First illegal immigrants detained under landmark UK-France deal\nFirst illegal immigrants detained under the groundbreaking UK-France treaty.\nImmigrants who arrived in the UK on a small boat have been detained under the UK-France treaty, which is now operational.\nDetentions began for those who arrived in the UK on a small boat yesterday lunchtime (August 6). They will be held in immigration removal centres pending their removal. The UK will make referrals to France within 3 days, and the French authorities will be expected to respond within 14 days. Those detained will be briefed on the procedure through which their return to France will take place, and the next operational phase of preparing each individual for removal will be activated.\nToday (August 7) the reciprocal process to allow migrants to submit an expression of interest to come the UK has also begun. Applicants must satisfy the eligibility and suitability criteria, including uploading a passport or other identity documents as well as a recent photograph. For those selected, they will have to pass further stringent security checks and biometric controls, meaning that only those individuals that the UK Government has approved for entry will be allowed through the new route.\nAs the one-in, one-out pilot scheme continues into its implementation phase, the Home Office is also working to communicate information about the new treaty to any migrants in Northern France and beyond who are considering making a dangerous small boat crossing, with a hard-hitting campaign warning them not to risk their money or their life, to be promoted in the coming days across multiple channels.\nBorder Force, Immigration Enforcement and Home Office officials will continue to work round the clock over the coming weeks to identify and detain individuals under the treaty, and undertake the necessary processes to prepare them for their return to France. Both the UK and French authorities will also be keeping the operation of the scheme under constant review in these initial weeks to deal with any emerging issues, as well as seeking to ramp up the pace and scale of returns as the agreement progresses.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said:\nYesterday, under the terms of this groundbreaking new treaty, the first group of people to cross the Channel were detained after their arrival at Western Jet Foil and will now be held in detention until they can be returned to France. That sends a message to every migrant currently thinking of paying organised crime gangs to go to the UK that they will be risking their lives and throwing away their money if they get into a small boat.\nNo one should be making this illegal and dangerous journey that undermines our border security and lines the pockets of the criminal gangs.\nCriminal gangs have spent 7 years embedding themselves along our border and it will take time to unravel them, but these detentions are an important step towards undermining their business model and unravelling the false promises they make. These are the early days for this pilot scheme, and it will develop over time. But we are on track to do what no other government has done since this crisis first started \u2013 sending small boat arrivals back to France and strengthening our borders through the Plan for Change.\nReturns to other countries and immigration enforcement work will continue alongside the treaty. In its first year in office, this government returned more than 35,000 people with no right to be in the UK \u2013 a 28% increase in returns of failed asylum seekers and a 13% increase in overall returns compared to the previous year. The government also ramped up activity against illegal working, with over 9,000 raids since July 2024, resulting in 6,410 arrests \u2013 up 48% and 51% on the previous year."

Applicants must satisfy the eligibility and suitability criteria, including uploading a passport or other identity documents as well as a recent photograph.\nThose selected will have to pass further stringent security checks and biometric controls, meaning that only those individuals whom the UK government has approved for entry will be allowed through the new route.\nPeople from wartorn and drought-hit countries such as Eritrea could be excluded from the scheme by the requirement for official documents, a charity has warned.\nA Refugee Legal Support spokesperson said: \u201cThis week in Calais, we spoke with many people from Eritrea and almost none of them have copies of their Eritrean passports because they were never able to obtain one. Eritrean nationals are the top nationality crossing the Channel in 2025; 86% of Eritrean asylum seekers receive a positive decision, but almost all will be excluded from this scheme.\u201d\nAs the one-in, one-out pilot scheme continues into its implementation phase, the Home Office is also launching a campaign warning people not to risk their money or their life, to be promoted in the coming days across multiple channels.\nThe deal has been trumpeted by ministers as a \u201cgamechanging\u201d deal but Home Office sources said it would apply only to about 50 asylum seekers at first.\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, did not confirm how many people were being prepared to be returned to France and said the government would resist any legal challenges.\n\u201cThe transfers to immigration removal centres are under way as we speak, so we won\u2019t provide operational details at this point that criminal gangs can simply use and exploit.\n\u201cBut no one should be in any doubt: anyone who arrives from now on is eligible for immediate detention and return,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the pilot and it will build as well over time, but we\u2019re also clear that France is a safe country, so we will robustly defend against any legal challenge that people try.\u201d\nA copy of the agreement was released on Tuesday as the prime minister comes under increasing pressure to stop boats carrying asylum seekers from crossing the Channel.\nThe UK will pay the costs of transporting asylum seekers to and from France. The deal will have to be renewed by 11 June next year, and can be ended at a month\u2019s notice by either side.\nIf people have an outstanding claim for asylum, they cannot be removed, the deal says.\nFrance can reject a requested removal if it \u201cconsiders that an individual would be a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Schengen states\u201d.\nSo far in 2025, more than 25,000 people have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats \u2013 a record for this point in the year since data began being collected in 2018. That is up 48% on the same time last year."
