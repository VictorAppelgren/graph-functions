  "description": "Where\u2019s the beef?",
  "content": "The truth about what New Yorkers really want to eat bit Eleven Madison Park on its precious, plant-based butt this week, with the announcement that chef/owner Daniel Humm\u2019s menu would no longer be exclusively vegan.\n\nBut what took them so long to come to their snooty senses?\n\nFor 15 years, Humm ran the kitchen at EMP to global acclaim, earning three Michelin stars and a spot atop the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurant list in 2017. Then, in 2021, he abruptly switched to a vegan menu.\n\nIt laid a big, fat egg \u2014 an item forbidden on vegan menus \u2014 with Big Apple critics, who ridiculed its three-hour, nine-course prix-fixe meal starting at $350 a head.\n\nThey particularly piled on a beet that was laboriously tweaked and tortured into a stand-in for duck \u2014 \u201ccooked 18-ways [and tasting] like pretty much any other beet\u201d (Adam Platt on Eater.com) and \u201ctastes like Lemon Pledge and smells like a burning joint\u201d (Pete Wells in the New York Times.)\n\nI could have warned Humm against throwing out his beloved EMP dishes such as lacquered duck in favor of a rigidly purist, vegan menu that seemed more about striking a blow at \u201canimal exploitation\u201d than about making customers happy.\n\nI didn\u2019t go back to EMP after it swallowed the vegan Kool-Aid. Root vegetables and laboratory-tweaked seeds without meat, fish or dairy products are neither my \u2014 nor most people\u2019s \u2014 cup of tea.\n\nI order steak only occasionally, even in steakhouses. But to the chagrin of \u201csave the earth\u201d types who put animal consumption on par with war crimes, beef in many shapes and styles is the runaway favorite dish of New York\u2019s dining millions.\n\nThey want steak. More than Italian, more than Japanese, more than tacos. Just count the seats!\n\nIt\u2019s as hard to book tables at Daniel Boulud\u2019s great new American steakhouse La Tete D\u2019Or, which opened in November, as it was at EMP in its animal product-serving prime.\n\nLa Tete was preceded by a stampede of giant, successful new steakhouses: Delmonico\u2019s, Brooklyn Chophouse Times Square, Beefbar, Mastro\u2019s, Hawksmoor, Bourbon Steak and Le Relais de Venise. Then there\u2019s the just-opened Mexican-style Cuerno and Korean-inspired Gui. In recent years, we\u2019ve also gotten a second Brazilian-style Fogo de Chao at the World Trade Center, a third Capital Grille, a second Rocco\u2019s, a second Del Frisco\u2019s and a third Empire Steak. A new outpost of Cote is coming soon in Midtown.\n\nMeanwhile, vegan places such as Modern Love, Seasoned Vegan and Blossom have been folding, as my colleague Jennifer Gould reported, with owners hilariously blaming their flops on \u201ccongestion pricing.\u201d\n\nThe truth wasn\u2019t lost on real estate king David W. Levinson, who in early 2015 tapped Humm with much hoopla to run a traditional high-end restaurant at his then-rising 425 Park Avenue.\n\nWhen Humm made EMP vegan in 2021 and announced plans to do the same at 425 Park, which had just opened and was seeking office tenants, Levinson went with another chef.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want a vegan restaurant at 425 Park Avenue,\u201d Levinson told me in 2022. \u201cI want [Humm] to succeed, but it was a no-brainer not to have a vegan restaurant.\u201d\n\nJean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s Four Twenty Five opened in the high-rise in late 2023 and had been consistently full ever since.\n\nAfter the early hysterical vegan buzz subsided, EMP could no longer count on booking lucrative private parties, which are most restaurants\u2019 cash cows. Even for many regular customers, EMP was a one-time, try-anything affair. Not enough diners wanted to blow a second fortune on an interminable meal without any animal-derived products, not even cheese, butter, honey or gelatin. I had fine vegan dishes at the original Cafe Boulud and at long-gone Del Posto and Brushstroke, but as part of longer tasting menus \u2014 not as the entire menu, which EMP forced on us.\n\nStarting on Oct. 14, 2025, EMP\u2019s web site says, \u201cIn addition to our plant-based menu, we will offer select animal proteins for certain dishes \u2014 including fish, shellfish, and poultry.\u201d Wowee! But \u2014wait for it \u2014 there\u2019s pointedly no mention of beef.\n\nHumm said he didn\u2019t intend for his original menu to \u201cunintentionally keep people out.\u201d I hope his new menu options draw a wider clientele. Otherwise, EMP might soon be RIP.",

Chef Daniel Humm's exclusive vegan approach, introduced in 2021, failed to resonate with diners, leading to a decline in reservations and private events. As steakhouse openings surge in New York, the restaurant aims to attract a broader clientele with its new menu starting October 2025, although it notably lacks beef options.",
