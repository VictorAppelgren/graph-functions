      "text": "According to the U.S. Justice Department, two Chinese nationals in California were recently arrested and charged with illegally shipping tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of AI chips to China.\nThe Justice department cited an affidavit filed with the complaint, claiming that the Chinese nationals exported the advanced Nvidia chips and similar technology to China during the period of October 2022 through July 2025. They did so without obtaining the required licenses from the U.S. Commerce Department.\nThe arrested have been identified as Chuan Geng, 28, of Pasadena, and Shiwei Yang, 28, of El Monte. The two founded an El Monte-based company, ALX Solutions, in 2022. This was shortly after the U.S. imposed export controls on technology to China and began to require licenses for chips exports.\nReports claim that ALX Solutions bought over 200 Nvidia H100 chips from Super Micro Computer, stating that the customers were in Singapore and Japan. However, a U.S. export control officer in Singapore could not verify that the chips arrived in the country. The company named did not exist at the listed location either.\nAppearing in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles late on Monday, Geng, was released on $250,000 bond. Yang has a detention hearing on August 12.\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q1 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n10. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Gaining Attention on Wall Street. On August 5, the company announced a native integration between CrowdStrike Falcon\u00ae Shield SaaS security and the OpenAI ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance API to provide visibility and governance for AI agents.\nThe integration will expand support to more than 175 SaaS applications. Crowdstrike announced that its Falcon Shield now discovers GPTs and Codex agents created in OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Enterprise, thereby helping organizations enhance the governance of AI agent identities and also the human identities behind them.\nThe security agent tool can map each agent to its human creator in order to identify risky behavior and enforce policy when needed. Coupled with Falcon\u00ae Identity Protection, CrowdStrike is offering unified visibility and protection across every human and non-human identity so that organizations can better oversee AI agents.\n\u201cAI agents are emerging as superhuman identities, with the ability to access systems, trigger workflows, and operate at machine speed. As these agents multiply across SaaS environments, they\u2019re reshaping the enterprise attack surface, and are only as secure as the human identities behind them. Falcon Shield and Falcon Identity Protection help secure this new layer of identity to prevent exploitation.\u201d\n-Elia Zaitsev, chief technology officer, CrowdStrike.\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in AI-driven endpoint and cloud workload protection.\n9. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 77\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) is one of the 10 AI Stocks Gaining Attention on Wall Street. On August 5, the company announced the launch of Cortex Cloud Application Security Posture Management (ASPM), a prevention-first application security module intended to block security issues before applications reach production environments.\nThe security module will allow security leaders and developers to fix security risks before cloud and AI applications have been deployed. This will be 10 times faster, more efficient, and also cost effective.\nMoreover, Cortex Cloud ASPM includes an open AppSec partner ecosystem which will allow organizations to integrate data from their preferred third-party code scanners into a centralized platform for extensive visibility. The system will help identify security risks during the development phase rather than after.\nThe security module will integrate with Palo Alto\u2019s existing Cortex Cloud platform, which combines cloud native application protection platform capabilities with cloud detection and response capabilities for real-time cloud security.\n\u201cAs AI-generated code compresses application development from months to hours, security must evolve to protect the speed of innovation. Equipped with an industry-leading CNAPP, best-in-class CDR and now prevention-first ASPM, Cortex Cloud delivers the most comprehensive approach to cloud security and automatically stops risks before they reach production with end-to-end visibility across the entire application lifecycle.\u201d\n-Sarit Tager, VP of Product Management, Palo Alto Networks\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc.

      "text": "OpenAI has just released two open-weight language models for the first time since it rolled out GPT-2 in 2019. The move marks a significant step in transitioning toward greater transparency and community collaboration.\nAccording to OpenAI, the text-only models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, are apt at advanced reasoning and can run on laptops with performance levels similar to its smaller proprietary reasoning models. These models serve as lower-cost options that can be easily run and customized.\nArtificial intelligence models are deemed as overweight if their trained parameters or weights are publicly accessible. While they offer transparency and control, they differ from open source models whose full-source code is available to use or modify.\n\u201cOne of the things that is unique about open models is that people can run them locally.

SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 18\nSoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) is one of the Top 15 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. On August 5, the company announced that its Gen-AI enabled advanced voice assistant, SoundHound Chat AI Automotive, has been deployed to vehicles from three major global automotive brands across North America.\nThe integration will enable major brands from a prominent global automotive group to be able to enjoy state-of-the-art conversational AI capabilities. According to Soundhound, the SoundHound Chat AI Automotive is capable of recognizing natural human speech and leveraging generative AI to carry out highly intelligent, and conversationally fluid responses.\nThis will enable customers to move from traditional voice assistant controls like navigation to more versatile conversational experiences. Drivers can enjoy conversations related to trip planning, storytelling, fun quizzes, and even tips from the vehicle manual. They can even ask follow-up questions and receive contextually relevant responses.\nAccording to recent research, in-car voice commerce has the potential to unlock up to $35 billion annually for automakers.\nSoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a voice artificial intelligence company offering voice AI solutions to businesses.\n14. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 40\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is one of the Top 15 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm. On August 6, Barclays analyst George Wang raised the price target on the stock to $45.00 (from $29.00) while maintaining an Equalweight rating.\nAnalysts at Barclays noted that revenue challenges at SMCI stemming from capital constraints have been resolved, with large customer orders slated for recognition in the September and December quarters. Bottlenecks, however, remain.\n\u201cHowever, bottlenecks in growth remain with implied FY revenue cadence more back-end loaded (given FQ1 top-line guidance of only ~$6.5Bn at the midpoint with FY26 revenue guidance of at least $33Bn). Chip and resource availability, as well as customers waiting for GB300s are driving the bottleneck.\u201d\nSMCI did introduce its DCBBS (Data Center Building Block Solutions) in the previous quarter, anticipating increasing customer adoption throughout fiscal 2026. The solution is not only attractive to customers but is also likely to be margin accretive over time.\nThe firm also discussed SMCI\u2019s gross margins miss.\n\u201cGM missed in the Q and FQ1 margin guidance was weaker than expected, due to product customer mix and production ramp learning curves, respectively. Two main drivers to improve GM, according to management, are both DCBBS and having fast time-to-market capabilities. We model sequential growth throughout FY26 to account for Blackwell ramp and forecast 11.3% GM, roughly flat (10bps improvement) from FY25, given competitive environment and manufacturing challenges and complexities cited for the flat Q/Q FQ1 GM (despite almost ~$1Bn incremental revenue).\u201d\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc.

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends.
