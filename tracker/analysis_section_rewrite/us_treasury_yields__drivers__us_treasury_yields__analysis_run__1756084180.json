      "feedback": "Overall, the draft correctly anchors the view in a Fed/Inflation baseline and rings in crypto price anchors, but it falls short on a crisp causal chain, explicit scenario structure, quantified sensitivities, and a tight, decision-ready watch-list. It should move from a high-level, regime label to a fully specified, first-principles framework that connects policy, rate paths, risk premia, and crypto pricing through a transparent mechanism, then map that mechanism across three concrete scenarios with price paths, triggers, and invalidation points. Actionable edit instructions: (1) articulate a clean causal spine: Fed policy/2% target and flexible average inflation targeting drive discount rates and risk premia; couple this to dollar dynamics and to crypto-specific valuation channels (cash-flow-less valuation via discounting/risk premia, store-of-value narrative, and flows from institutions/derivatives). Explicitly show how a 25–50bp shift in real rates or in the term premium translates into ETH and BTC price moves. (2) replace the single-base narrative with a three-regime scenario structure (A: disinflation with conditional easing; B: persistent inflation requiring tighter policy; C: growth slowdown that favors defensives), with clearly defined transition triggers (wage-growth momentum, inflation persistence measures like PCE core, Jackson Hole commentary, semiconductor capex cadence), and a concrete probabilistic view and transition logic between regimes. (3) add quantified price paths by regime: for base-case (Regime A), ETH 4,000–5,000 and BTC near prior highs (~110k–125k) with a 65–75% probability; for Regime B, provide a plausible downside path (ETH 2,500–3,500; BTC 70k–90k) under higher discount rates; for Regime C, a defensives tilt with potential volatility shocks but selective resilience (ETH 1,800–3,000; BTC 60k–90k). Attach these with explicit sensitivities to rate moves (e.g., +25bp real rate shifts shift BTC by X% and ETH by Y%), and show upside if policy surprises are dovish. (4) strengthen cross-topic integration: tie macro-path to flows/positioning (institutional demand, ETF/derivative activity), and to valuation/technicals (NVT/MVRV or appropriate crypto-market metrics) with explicit links to the price paths. (5) populate a decisive watch-list of signals with thresholds: e.g., wage-growth prints and PCE core holding above/below target for two consecutive prints; Jackson Hole dovish/hawkish shifts in the dot plot; semiconductor capex cadence milestones; shifts in open interest/derivatives skew; BTC/ETH price breaches of defined bands; volatility regime changes via implied vol or funding rates. (6) tighten the citations: after every factual claim, attach inline IDs from SOURCE MATERIAL (e.g., (ID)) and include a Citations section listing all IDs used; where sources conflict, present a transparent reconciliation: state the dominant view with a brief note on alternate readings and how you weighed them. (7) present the output in a compact, sectioned format aligned to the SECTION FOCUS: begin with a one-sentence thesis, then map macro/policy/flows/valuation cross-currents, then the three scenarios with price paths and catalysts, followed by the watch-list and a short invalidation note; keep to a tight page length and avoid generic statements by substituting concrete numbers and explicit thresholds. (8) if IDs are not available, supply placeholders and request the IDs upfront to hard‑attach inline citations, then deliver a revised version with full citation integrity.",
