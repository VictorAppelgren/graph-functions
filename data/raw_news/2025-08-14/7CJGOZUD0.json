  "content": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) \u2014 VERSES AI Inc. (CBOE: VERS) (OTCQB: VRSSF) (\u201cVERSES\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a cognitive computing company pioneering next-generation agentic software systems today announced that it has filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (\u201cQuarterly Report\u201d) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to report our results for the three months ending June 30, 2025 in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. I believe these results demonstrate disciplined cost management, even as Verses begins to scale and commercialize, market and sell its flagship product Genius. The results also highlight the first revenue generated by Genius after only two months following its launch. I believe that these results underscore our prudent approach to managing cash as well as the strong customer interest we\u2019ve anticipated from the outset. We are all energized by this momentum as we head into the remainder of the year,\u201d said James Christodoulou, CFO of VERSES.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nVERSES\u00ae is a cognitive computing company building next-generation agentic software systems modeled after the wisdom and genius of Nature. Designed around first principles found in science, physics and biology, our flagship product, ,\u2122 is an agentic enterprise intelligence platform designed to generate reliable domain-specific predictions and decisions under uncertainty. Imagine a Smarter World that elevates human potential through technology inspired by Nature. Learn more at , and .\n\nThis news release contains statements which constitute \u201cforward-looking information\u201d or \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding the plans, intentions, beliefs and current expectations of the Company with respect to future business activities and plans of the Company. Forward-looking information and forward-looking statements are often identified by the words \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d or similar expressions. More particularly and without limitation, this news release contains forward\u2013looking statements and information including, but not limited to that the Company\u2019s robotics models have the potential to transform how robots operate across industries, and that the Company\u2019s robotics models could unlock a new era of truly adaptive, reliable automation.\n\nThe forward\u2013looking statements and information are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by the management of the Company. As a result, there can be no assurance that such plans will be completed as proposed or at all. Such forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions of management. Although management of the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements and information are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward\u2013looking statements and information since no assurance can be given that they will prove to be correct.",

Genius didn\u2019t just prove it could handle complexity\u2014it showed us it could anticipate and creatively respond to real-world challenges. By embedding Genius Enterprise as a component of our solutions, we\u2019re crafting the nervous system of tomorrow\u2019s cities: intelligent, intuitive, and human-centric.\nOur Fortune 500 clients want AI that speaks their language, respects their rules, and delivers results they can trust. Off-the-shelf platforms rarely meet those standards. We believe that Genius lets us generate reliable, domain-specific predictions in weeks instead of months, and our team provides the know-how to take those models live. Becoming the first Certified Genius Reseller allows us to bring VERSES\u2019 next-generation capability to enterprises worldwide.\nWe're excited to join VERSES in building trustworthy, explainable intelligence designed to enhance rather than replace human capabilities. Together, we will help organizations transition from unreliable, generic AI to domain-specific intelligence that adapts and grows alongside the businesses it serves. We feel that we are breaking significant new ground with our Enterprise program with VERSES while enabling our clients to be at the forefront of using cognitive AI as a catalyst for reinvention.\nBeing able to explicitly model the cause-effect relationships of complex systems and quantify uncertainty means we can generate something not possible with traditional ML tools \u2013 results that are reliable, explainable, and assurance ready.\nUse Cases\nGenius enables agents to generate predictions that are highly reliable, explainable and sustainable.\nReliable\nPredictions have confidence score qualifiers\nExplainable\nTransparency into how predictions and decisions are made\nSustainable\nLess compute and less retraining means less energy\nGenius Model Editor\nGenius Customer Portal\nGenius Hosted Services\nStreamline Your Pipeline\nSimplify and automate from planning to production.\nGenius provides familiar ways to ingest, validate, and preprocess data in preparation for creating machine learning models.\nGenius provides tools to build, analyze, and validate probabilistic causal models of complex dynamic systems that can quantify uncertainty.\nDeploy agents with your preferred tools and see your agent use active inference to reason, plan, and learn and act. They will continuously evolve with new observations and become specialized domain experts with ever-improving prediction accuracy and reliability.\n| Starter | Professional | Enterprise | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Monthly Price |\nGet Started Free $99 After Limited Time Trial |\nFor Individuals $99 $199 After Limited Time Offer |\nFor Organizations Contact for demo |\n| Capabilities | |||\n| Model Editor | |||\n| SDK | |||\n| API | |||\n| Users | 1 |\n1 |\nFlexible |\n| Inference Agents | 1 |\n3 |\nFlexible |\n| Support | Community |\nEmail |\nPriority |\n| Hosting | Cloud |\nCloud |\nSelf/On-Prem |\n| Signup | Signup | Signup |\nMastermind multi-step reasoning was built using Genius while other videogame benchmarks employ methods and techniques that underwrite the technology behind Genius.\n*Gartner article from February 2025\nFAQ\nOur objective is to democratize Active Inference agents and Bayesian methods starting with supporting machine learning engineers who struggle with a model creation and deployment pipeline. As Genius evolves its features and capabilities will expand to include other personas. If you are looking for the following features and capabilities today then Genius was made for you.\nGenius is ideal for tackling complex problems that require quantifying uncertainty and making inferences on the likelihood of causes given observed effects. Some examples:\nWhat is the probability that it rained or that the sprinkler was on, given grass is wet?\n\u2192 P (rain | wet grass)\nGiven that someone has a cough, determine the probability that it is due to a cold or a flu or both.\n\u2192 P (cold | cough)\nGiven a high fever, determine the probability that it is due to infection or viral illness?\n\u2192 P (infection | cough)\nGiven that the production has halted, determine the probability that it's due to a defective machine, power fluctuation or both.\n\u2192 P (defective machine | production hault)"
