  "content": "Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) is one of the 14 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy Under $10.\n\nThe company\u2019s dividend yield stands strong despite mixed earnings results for the second quarter of 2025.\n\nBased in Pennsylvania, Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) is a publicly traded REIT that owns, develops, leases, and manages a portfolio of office and mixed-use properties. Founded in 1986, the company\u2019s properties are mostly located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; and Austin, Texas.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2025, Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) reported a strong quarterly retention rate of 82% alongside a leasing activity elevation of 35% quarter-over-quarter. It also signed a significant 100,000 square foot lease with a tech company at their One Uptown development, which is now 40% leased.\n\nThe company\u2019s Q2 earnings call also noted issuance of $150 million in unsecured bonds at a lower effective yield of just over 7%. The proceeds were used to pay off a construction loan, and the company currently has no outstanding balance on its $600 million unsecured line of credit. This improved its unsecured borrowing costs by 20% compared to a previous offering. However, the company lowered its FFO guidance for 2025 to a range of $0.60 to $0.66 per share due to the removal of anticipated gains from land sales.\n\nWith mixed results in its last quarter, Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE:BDN) offers a dividend yield of 14.25% for a closing share price of $4.22.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of BDN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 11 Best Energy Dividend Stocks to Invest in and 11 Best Annual Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds",

      "text": "In this article, we will be looking at the 14 best cheap dividend stocks to buy under $10.\nPolitical headlines and central decisions are influencing the investor sentiment in the current market. This week, for instance, President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook sent shockwaves through global markets. It raised new questions about the Fed\u2019s independence as well as the future path of interest rates. According to CNBC, the equities initially rallied, but the U.S. dollar weakened, and gold prices climbed as investors looked for safer alternatives. The phenomenon highlights the market\u2019s sensitivity to both monetary policy and political risk.\nAmid such uncertainty, the dividend-paying stocks under $10 become an ideal option for investors seeking steady returns with the exposures inherent to high-priced securities. Rate cuts now appear increasingly likely, with futures markets pricing in an 89% probability of a Fed reduction at the September meeting. The move would immensely benefit income-based strategies. Growth stocks may continue to attract attention, but history shows that when interest rates trend downward, dividend stocks shine among investors.\nWith that context, we have hand-picked for you 14 of the best cheap dividend stocks to buy under $10. The top 5 might just be what your portfolio needs.\nOur Methodology\nWhen putting together our list of 14 best cheap dividend stocks to buy under $10, we followed a few criteria. Primarily, we sorted only those stocks with a dividend yield of 5% or more that are available for $10 or less. It is to ensure a notable income for the investors at the lowest price. Additionally, we also filtered our list with an anticipated EPS growth rate of 10% or more in the next year, to include those stocks with strong, stable earnings. We have ranked the entries in our list based on the dividend yield. All the data used in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of August 28, 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock.

      "text": "In this article, we will be looking at the 11 best energy dividend stocks to invest in.\nThe policy environment in the U.S. is shifting constantly, and the dividend-paying energy stocks are gaining fresher significance. On August 22, 2025, a report on CNN indicated an increase in the probability of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which could intensify the search for dependable yield. At Jackson Hole, Jerome Powell made the following statement:\n\u201cdownside risks to employment are rising\u201d\nAlong with this statement, the Fed Chair hinted that the central bank could soon lower rates to support the economy. The renewed uncertainty stands in favour of the dividend-seeking income-focused investors, particularly in energy, which stands as an attractive hedge.\nAdding another layer to this investment story is the political climate. The Trump administration continues to pressure the Fed and reshape its leadership, leading to questions concerning long-term monetary stability. In such an environment, assets that offer consistent payout gains the most attention, as they protect the investors from a speculative future. Energy dividend stocks fit into this category with an income potential that matches the exposure to a sector that plays a critical role in global markets.\nSo stay with us as we unveil the 11 best energy dividend stocks that could add stability to your portfolio. The top 5 might make it into your investment collection.\nOur Methodology\nWhen putting together our list of 11 best energy dividend stocks to invest in, we followed a few criteria. Primarily, we sorted only those stocks with a dividend yield of 3.50% or more in the energy sector. It is to ensure a sizeable income for the investors.
