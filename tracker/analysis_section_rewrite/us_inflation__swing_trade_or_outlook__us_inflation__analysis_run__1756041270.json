      "feedback": "The draft shows solid fundamentals and a coherent, multi‑pillar narrative, but it fails the SECTION FOCUS in format and precision: the Movers & Scenarios block does not strictly deliver exactly four lines split 2 Up/2 Down, it muddles horizons (0–60 vs 120–180 days) and includes extraneous content that should live in watchlists or the Outlook rather than as standalone lines; probabilities are presented as 45/35/25/20% without a transparent mapping to signal strength or source evidence, and many assertions lack explicit sourcing or rely on conflicting internal figures (e.g., debt paths at 4T vs 2.4T) that need reconciliation; the Trade/Outlook Plan is embedded as an MSFT note rather than a standalone Swing Trade/Outlook line and may exceed or contradict the 1–2 line limit. To upgrade to world‑class, reform as: (1) four movers exactly—two Up and two Down—with time windows anchored in the material (e.g., 0–60 days for near‑term policy/debt channels; 60–180 days for AI adoption/HeartSciences progress) and crisp Driver/Mechanism lines; (2) replace arbitrary probabilities with evidence‑based weights derived from signal strength (e.g., use thresholds tied to policy votes, AI milestones, or tariff pass/rollback cues; cite EPJYXB7DX, IGP1Q4ZEJ, TN66GHPAT, 0G3A676BP, ILYC1M41F as applicable); (3) tighten the What to watch to 1–2 concrete triggers with explicit invalidation points (e.g., “invalid if offsets fail or debt path breaches a defined threshold”); (4) fix the conflicting debt figures by selecting a base assumption with a clear sensitivity band and annotate the band with sources; (5) compress the Trade/Outlook Plan into 1 line if tradable (e.g., Direction Up | Horizon 0–21 days | Entry/Stop/Target/ROI/Trigger anchored to MSFT AI monetization) or 2 lines max, ensuring fields (Entry, Stop, Target, R/R, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability, Confidence) are present and sourced; (6) prune the autos/tariff micro‑narrative from duplicating movers and keep it as a short, sourced support point or remove it to avoid format drift; (7) enforce a single, clean causal chain: Pillar → regime signals → risk premia → valuation discipline → triggers for lines; (8) ensure every factual claim in the movers lines is tied to a source ID and avoid non‑source statements; (9) remove the extra “Near‑term 0–3 week” paragraph or relegate it to a short, sourced watchline; (10) verify the four lines cover all critical sources (IGP1Q4ZEJ, TN66GHPAT, YVQU6QCY4, 0G3A676BP, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, FOM34PUWA, J99EM2TPZ, GX057ADL7, 48JXC9VDP, etc.) and reconcile any conflicts in a brief note within the plan. Implementing these changes will yield a clean 4-line movers block, a 1–2 line tradable Outlook/ swing plan, strict first‑principles grounding, precise quantitative anchors, and fully compliant sourcing.",
