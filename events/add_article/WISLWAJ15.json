Abbott’s diversified medical device and diagnostics business, along with its 53‑year dividend streak, makes it a reliable income play, while AbbVie’s robust pipeline and high free cash flow support future dividend growth. Pfizer’s 16‑year dividend history and low P/E ratio, despite upcoming patent expirations, suggest a sustainable high yield, positioning all three as appealing options for income‑focused investors.",
