      "summary": "Kansas City police officer 26‑year‑old Hunter Simoncic was fatally struck by a truck driven by 31‑year‑old Dennis Mitchell III while Simoncic was deploying stop sticks to end a pursuit. Mitchell, who abandoned a stolen truck and fled after an earlier shooting incident, was arrested and charged with capital murder, fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, criminal possession of a weapon and two counts of theft. Simoncic, a 2023 academy graduate with a sociology bachelor's and forensic science master's, had also worked as a juvenile detention center supervisor and volunteered reading to children. The department mourned his loss and announced a funeral for September 3. The incident underscores the dangers officers face during routine traffic stops and pursuit terminations.",
