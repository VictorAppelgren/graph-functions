      "feedback": "This draft has a solid baseline but the logic stops short of a world‑class, testable thesis; to upgrade, formalize a crisp regime ladder with explicit A→B and B→C triggers anchored in the sources (A→B: automation exposure crosses a credible threshold and labor slack deteriorates for multiple quarters; NL5YYTLF2), and complete Regime C with a concrete trigger and clear invalidation criteria, so the cascade from AI/TFP productivity to capex, earnings power, and asset prices is traceable; tightly weave the macro‑to‑market chain by mapping AI capex into durable earnings and lower risk premia, via policy conditions and FX/yields as described in GX057ADL7, and consistently anchor the transmission with the Intel governance signal (≈10% stake; implied value around $11B) as a strategic‑allocation cue; quantify the horizon mechanics using Ford’s Q2 EV losses ≈ $1.3B, adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%, ROIC ≈ 10.1%, and a 2014–2024 revenue CAGR of ≈2.5% (22PL3Q360), plus ACMR’s 2025 revenue midpoint ≈ $900m with gross margin ≈ 4% (22PL3Q360); integrate the EURUSD framework with the four‑regime spine and map sign/magnitude to AI uptake, governance frictions, and consumer‑goods pricing pressure using 5S9GJV2O3, UVEQ2SJ0W, and HWGNUP2XG, while reconciling any conflicts across these sources; substantially increase citation density by attaching IDs after each factual claim and explicitly address potential conflicts; add a concise watch‑list of decisive signals (automation‑exposure progression per NL5YYTLF2; next Fed tilt/CPI path per GX057ADL7; Ford/ACMR signals; EURUSD regime shifts per 5S9GJV2O3/UVEQ2SJ0W/HWGNUP2XG) with timing horizons and precise invalidation conditions (e.g., automation threshold not met, labor slack improves, inflation surprises tighten policy, governance frictions widen risk premia); tighten the prose to remove truncations and ensure every assertion is sourced (NL5YYTLF2, GX057ADL7, 22PL3Q360, 5S9GJV2O3, UVEQ2SJ0W, HWGNUP2XG, 22PL3Q360) and present the whole framework as one coherent, cross‑topic synthesis rather than disjoint parts.",
