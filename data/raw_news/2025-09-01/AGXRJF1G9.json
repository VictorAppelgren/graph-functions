  "content": "5 Of The Best Power Tool Starter Kits You Can Buy\n\nEveryone has to start somewhere. When it comes to engaging in DIY upgrades around the house or getting into woodworking as a hobby to keep your mind and hands nimble, this means buying a few key tools. Tools are great, cool, and exciting, but they can also be difficult for new users to evaluate. There's the question of what brand to buy (these hand tool brands are some of the best on the market, as a good place to start), and then considerations for the specific use case you'll be focusing on. DIY mechanics target certain tool brands and equipment, while woodworkers or building-focused renovators demand other solutions. No matter your focus, a starter kit is the perfect option to get your repair, renovation, or maintenance journey underway with little hassle or holdup. Power tools come in corded and cordless options, but most users these days want the mobility that comes from battery-powered solutions. This means you'll need to select a tool platform to invest in. Buying batteries and chargers for a range of different brands can quickly balloon the price of your purchasing needs, unless you're willing to shop around for discount offers to get into a few different brands' systems. These five kits each bring their own unique flair to the table, and all come from different brands. This makes them a quality cross-section of functionality that a wide variety of users looking for specific outcomes can gain something from. The following list was crafted by the writer using a carefully-assembled set of metrics and personal-use experience. See the final section of this article (Methodology) to learn more.\n\nCraftsman features as a consistently strong asset for DIY enthusiasts. Craftsman began life as a hand tool brand almost a century ago and rose to prominence as a mainstay in Sears locations. The iconic toolmaker is well known for its lifetime warranty offers, and warranty coverage remains a crucial element across Craftsman's catalog today. Users report a drop off in overall quality compared to vintage equipment, perhaps starting in the 1990s or early 2000s, when the brand increasingly outsourced its production. However, this doesn't mean the Craftsman has become a brand to avoid. The tool manufacturer still makes competent tools at a seriously budget-friendly price point. Home improvers and maintainers who want the most bang for their buck without sacrificing their ability to actually get the job done can find plenty of value in Craftsman equipment. Perhaps the best example of this blending of functional value and favorable pricing can be found in Craftsman's 20V Max 6-Tool Combo Kit. This bundle can be purchased at Lowe's for $299. In this bundle, you'll find a reciprocating saw that's ideal for demolition and rough cutout requirements, a circular saw, an impact driver and drill, an oscillating multitool that's ideal for finish carpentry work during renovations, and a handheld work light. To finish off the package, this bundle comes with two batteries and a charger as well as a soft case. This purchase delivers some of the best value for money you'll find anywhere in the tool market. For new users looking to establish a power tool collection, it's hard to go wrong with this option.\n\nDeWalt is an iconic toolmaker. The brand makes some of the best impact drivers on the market, and it features as a competitive solution across many other power tool varieties as well. DeWalt is often found as a staple in professional tool users' collections because the brand meshes power and speed alongside feature-rich tool design and a track record of solid performance. Tool users who have the basics in their garage or workshop already might be looking for specialized upgrade opportunities. The DeWalt 20V Max 3-Tool Woodworking Combo Kit is a potential solution for a number of reasons, and it functions as a good augmentation option for those who already have a few important pieces of equipment in their possession. The circular saw is something that most beginner tool users will prioritize as they launch a toolbox, but jigsaws can easily be overlooked until a definitive need arises. The jigsaw doesn't cut straight lines nearly as well as many other power tools. But this solution plays an important role in renovating and woodworking circles. In addition to a jigsaw, this toolkit comes with a handheld router and an orbital sander. Sanding tools aren't typically something that users put on the back burner, but because of the dusty demands, replacing a sander will often happen more frequently than your other powered equipment. This kit, therefore, can offer an important replacement opportunity, the addition of a jigsaw to your generalist toolkit, and access to a router that is critical to treating board edges and performing nuanced woodworking tasks. To complete the picture, you'll get two batteries, a charger, and a soft case.\n\nA two-tool bundle might not sound very impressive, but the Metabo HPT 18V 2-Piece Combo Kit isn't the standard tool bundle. This collection of equipment features an impact driver and an 18-gauge brad nailer. The kit also includes two batteries, a charger, and a soft case to store your equipment. Most small tool bundles focus on genuine beginner requirements. This bundle is geared toward renovators who already have the basics under control and need to add intermediate coverage options to their collection. A brad nailer is ideal for all kinds of finish carpentry tasks. Nailers more broadly feature as an important tool when building stud walls, installing door frames, and performing many other tasks. They're also great for plenty of outdoor projects and temporary workpiece holding requirements. This tool can replace the mechanical action of hammering in nails slowly and methodically in many situations. The impact driver operates as a highly potent screw fastening solution. Therefore, this combo kit essentially works as an upgrade for your drill when it comes to driving fasteners and a handheld hammer for speeding through nailing operations.\n\nMilwaukee is a name that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone reading this list. Milwaukee makes great equipment and offers a variety of subcategories within its overall power tool offerings. There's much to be learned about the difference between the standard M18 range and Milwaukee M18 Fuel ranges, but what the Fuel moniker really comes down to is an improved, brushless motor that extends performance and helps deliver a greater user experience on the whole. The fuel range isn't just contained to the full-sized M18 segment of Milwaukee's catalog, however. Listed for an astronomically valuable price at Walmart of $170, the Milwaukee M12 Fuel Combo Kit offers a great starter bundle at an amazing price. The kit comes with both Milwaukee's hammer drill and impact driver in the scaled-down yet still powerful M12 Fuel range, and it's rounded out by two batteries, a charger, and a soft carrying case. These tools are designed for individuals who require more than enough power to complete tasks without needing to lug around heavy, full-sized equipment. These tools can be useful for mobile toolkits kept in the trunk of a car or as a primary means of tackling jobs around the house when that house doesn't include ample storage space (in an apartment or condo, for instance).\n\nThe final toolkit on this list is the most expensive, but that price buys a different kind of experience. The Makita 40V Max XGT 4-Piece Combo Kit is available at Acme Tools with a $100 discount code applied at checkout. This brings the total price of the kit down to $639. In addition, when buying with the current deal, you'll get a free promotional 40V XGT Work Light (listed at $239), added into the bundle. This effectively makes the purchase a five-piece kit that's rounded out with the typical charger, two batteries, and a soft carrying case. Unlike the typical 18- or 20-volt power systems that underpin most consumer tool lineups, Makita's included, this 40V platform is designed with high-intensity workplace demands in mind. XGT tools are Makita's most powerful solution and stand ready to tackle the most demanding requirements you have for the equipment. The brushless motors found within these power tools are built specifically to work at increasing power levels with the help of specially engineered rare earth magnets and an overwound copper wire design. Microchips built into both the tools and batteries, alongside other battery-specific enhancements, make for a highly responsive power tool solution that goes above and beyond. Makita is well-known as an innovator in the tool production space, and the XGT platform is more of what users have come to expect from the Japanese toolmaker. The kit itself is an ideal starting place for those looking to upgrade what they already have or begin with tools at the very pinnacle of their game. It features a hammer driver-drill, an impact driver, a circular saw, and a handheld LED flashlight.",

      "text": "What's The Difference Between Milwaukee's M18 & M18 Fuel Tool Lines?\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nMilwaukee is known for manufacturing and selling high-quality tools that are powerful enough for professionals but affordable enough for DIYers who just want to use the best gear available. The brand's M18 Fuel line takes the power and utility of its equipment to another level. However, it's not clear to a lot of people what exactly makes the M18 Fuel system different from Milwaukee's vanilla M18 line, especially since the batteries for both are interchangeable and the tools in each, such as impact drivers, can look extremely similar on the outside. Unless you know everything about Milwaukee's M18 system, the distinction between the two can be downright confusing.\nFor starters, the M18 Fuel line is not a completely different system from the M18 line \u2014 unlike the M12 tool line, for example, which is totally separate from both. Rather, the M18 Fuel line is part of the overall M18 system, which includes over 250 different cordless tools that are powered by interchangeable 18-volt batteries. The designation is for products that are the best of the best within the line, and part of the reason M18 Fuel tools are superior is because they all are powered by brushless motors.\nMany power tool motors \u2014 especially older ones \u2014 contain carbon brushes, which are crucial components that conduct electricity between the stationary and rotating parts of a motor. One drawback to brushed motors is that the carbon brushes eventually wear out and the tool it powers becomes less efficient as it ages. The brushless motors of Milwaukee's M18 Fuel tools use sophisticated electronics instead of brushes, so they last a lot longer. They also allow for more powerful tools and can have longer runtimes on a battery. Because of this, brushless tools greatly outperform brushed ones and can be used for more demanding applications.\nM18 Fuel tools are also smarter\nJust to be clear, Milwaukee does have M18 power tools with brushless motors that aren't in the M18 Fuel line. In other words, all M18 Fuel products are brushless, but not all brushless Milwaukee 18V tools are M18 Fuel. What separates M18 Fuel a step further is that they are equipped with Redlink Plus Intelligence, which allows for more advanced communication between the tool and its battery. This is possible because of the Powerstate brushless motors used by M18 Fuel products, which are more compact, powerful, and longer-lasting than many other brushless motors. Because electronics are installed in place of carbon brushes, those electronics can also be used to perform other functions.\nBy combining sophisticated software with advanced hardware, Milwaukee's Redlink Plus can equip a tool with various useful features, including increased productivity, better vibration control, on-board fuel gauges, additional speeds and assist modes, as well as thermal protection. Thermal protection is especially important because, by keeping the motor and battery from getting too hot, it not only keeps the tool running smoothly and efficiently, but makes it safer to use. Another similar benefit is that tools with Redlink Plus can use Milwaukee's Autostop failsafe.\nWhen the Redlink Plus Intelligence onboard an M18 Fuel tool communicates with Milwaukee's advanced Redlithium batteries, the tool benefits even further because the communication is two-way. You can use Redlithium batteries on less-sophisticated, brushed tools in the M18 line \u2014 and may see some improvement in performance \u2014 but when you power an M18 Fuel tool's Powerstate motor with a Redlithium battery, it allows you to get the fullest potential out of Redlink Plus Intelligence and gives you a tool that is often one of the best-performing in its class.\nSome Milwaukee 18V tools only come in the M18 Fuel line\nOne other difference between Milwaukee's M18 and M18 Fuel lines is that they don't have the exact same roster of cordless tools. While both can use any M18 batteries or chargers and work as part of the same power system, there are some tools you can only find in the M18 Fuel lineup. While there are several kinds of Milwaukee chainsaws and accessories available, if you want a larger cordless 20-inch model, the only option is the M18 Fuel 20-inch Dual Battery Chainsaw.\nSimilarly, while there are different kinds of grinders made by the tool company, the only braking grinders you can find are in the M18 Fuel line, such as the 5-inch Flathead Braking Grinder with Paddle Switch No-Lock. It might not be surprising that the only portable 18V table saw Milwaukee makes is also exclusive to the more powerful M18 Fuel ecosystem.\nThere aren't many Milwaukee 18V cordless tools that you won't find in the M18 Fuel line, but a few exist. There is an M18 Fuel Blower, for instance, but its compact-sized counterpart only comes in a brushed-motor model. However, you can find plenty of other compact tools in the M18 Fuel line, such as a Compact Vacuum and a Compact Router, which is one of Milwaukee's best-rated M18 tools you can buy. There are also several products in Milwaukee's Force Logic series, including M18 Cable Cutters and M18 Knockout Tools. While these aren't part of the M18 Fuel line, though, they still run on brushless motors and are equipped with Redlink technology, which makes them closer to M18 Fuel tools in design and performance than the brushed tools of Milwaukee's vanilla M18 system."

      "text": "Every Major Impact Driver Brand Ranked Worst To Best\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThe impact driver is a fundamental component of many toolboxes these days, but anecdotal evidence suggests that the power tool only started making a real \"impact\" on the job site in the last decade or two. Compared to drills, Impact drivers have a gigantic difference in torquing power when driving fasteners. An impact driver can overcome even the most stubborn fastening applications. Instead of only providing rotational force, impact drivers use a motorized anvil system to add a hammer action that slams the chuck forward into the screw. Impact drivers are a little slower at driving screws, but they can finish off a job the drill starts with ease.\nSelecting a great impact driver takes patience and research, as with any power tool purchase. Many buyers looking to add an impact driver to their toolbox opt for brand cohesion. Because impact drivers are a somewhat recent addition to the powered fastening space, nearly any you might find will be cordless. Sticking with the same brand you already use will forgo the need to purchase new batteries alongside the driver. But buyers just starting their journey into power tool ownership are starting fresh and need to think about the brand they'll pick. The market for impact drivers is quite busy \u2014 there's no end to the mountain of reviews, and Consumer Reports offers a definitive score sheet on every model. Here's how we think the brands stack up against each other.\n11. Metabo\nMetabo finds itself at the bottom of the list when it comes to impact drivers, despite the brand's lengthy history of excellence in the power tool marketplace. Metabo was founded in 1923 when its innovative leader, Albrecht Schnizler built the first handheld drill. The company remains grounded in N\u00fcrtingen, Germany to this day.\nConsumer Reports gives Metabo's WH18DFX model a score of 62, noting a sizeable drop off in power and run time compared to others in the category. Similarly, the 18-volt driver doesn't follow the same form factor as many other brands, leading to a long drive head that may be difficult to position in tight spaces. The 1,328 in-lbs of max torque fall well below figures produced by other impacts, as are the 2,400 RPM limit and 3,200 impacts per minute ratings for the Metabo driver. The tool is just 2.2 pounds without its battery attached, though, making for a lightweight driver that isn't likely to slow you down while performing overhead tasks or other fastening at height.\n10. Bauer\nThe Bauer brand is part of the Harbor Freight range and offers a truly dirt-cheap impact driver for anyone in search of a quick fix to their project needs. The tool itself isn't particularly exciting, but for $60 at Harbor Freight you'll get the compact, 20V driver, a 1.5Ah battery, and a charger. Consumer Reports levies a score of 66 against the Bauer driver, giving it poor scores for run time, charging time, and handling. However, for the price, the power rating isn't really something to scoff at. While a 1,300 in-lb max torque output won't blow anyone away, it's likely more than enough for routine fastening tasks around the house. This makes it a decent option for a homeowner looking to add a bit of extra oomph to their toolbox for simple DIY fixes. For more demanding jobs, and of course, in a professional setting, Bauer's 1781C-B1 impact driver will rarely act as the right solution.\nHarbor Freight's Bauer brand impact driver weighs in at 3.3 pounds, too, making it slightly heavier than the typical compact driver. Overall, it's a handy option in a pinch, but might not be the best choice for more demanding work requirements. As a starter tool or a cheap and cheerful temporary replacement, it's a perfect gap filler, but not much more.\n9. Craftsman\nConsumer Reports highlights two Craftsman impact drivers in particular, giving the CMCF813C2 model a score of 70, and offering a 66 to the CMCF810C1. The higher-rated driver of the pair offers a max torque of 1,500 in-lbs, placing it roughly in league with many high performers. Consumer Reports notes a lackluster charging time and decent run time while scoring it a 4/5 on power performance. Handling takes top marks, however, due to the driver's compact size and minuscule 2.05-pound bare tool weight. It's a 20V ordeal, with the natural compatibility with Craftsman's other 20-volt power tools coming as a standard. The package set comes with a charger and 1.5 Ah battery, so buyers may want to invest in added power packs for extended tool performance.\nCraftsman's other driver featured by the review site offers virtually the same performance with a marginally higher bare tool weight. The only substantive difference appears to be the \"Brushless RP\" badge included on the higher-rated variant, alongside a slight price bump. The CMCF810C1 model also claims a brushless motor, so the performance should be similar. Even so, Consumer Reports notes a slight dip in both run time and charging.\n8. Kobalt\nLowe's is the company that makes Kobalt power tools. The brand was founded in partnership between the store and the J.H. Williams Tool Group in 1998 to compete directly with Sears and Home Depot. Kobalt's impact driver boosts the voltage to a 24-volt model and backs up its stake in the market with a whopping 2,000 in-lbs of torque. This places the tool on par with the most impressive bolt and screw turners available, and selling at Lowe's for just $100 with a bag, charger, and 2.0 Ah battery included. The bare tool weighs 2.4 pounds, leaving it on the slightly heavier side of the compact range but keeping it notably under the measured weights of many impact drivers on the market.\nConsumer Reports gives the compact driver a score of 74, hailing its power but knocking handling, charge time, and run time. It would appear that all the extra heft Kobalt brought into the fold to create a potent torquing device left a few other areas wanting. Even so, as a basic impact driver that can get the job done around the house, it stacks up admirably against other budget-friendly tools while offering the turning power of a premium fastener. It also includes three speed settings and a finishing mode for delicate work.\n7. Skil\nSkil is a consistent performer in the power tool marketplace. The brand name is almost synonymous with circular saws \u2014 seriously, many contractors and grandfathers across the country call their circular saw a Skilsaw, whether it's a Skil-branded cutter or not. Skil naturally makes a variety of other corded and cordless power tools, including a superbly reliable impact driver. Consumer Reports brandishes a score of 74 for its PWR Core 20 model, a \u00bc-inch hex, 20V, brushless impact driver. The 20V PWR Core platform offers rapid charging for a jump in any project you may be working through. The PWRJUMP feature gives a 25% charge from zero in just five minutes, and a full charge can be achieved in 45. For DIYers looking for a tool that can keep them going at the end of a job (potentially with a single battery on hand), this Skil option makes for a valuable partner when you just need that extra bit of juice. The battery even offers charging compatibility with your phone or tablet for added versatility.\nThe driver itself features two speed settings and a control mode to reduce the incidence of overpowering screws and breaking or cross-threading them. The bare tool weighs just 2.47 pounds, for a lightweight choice that's also relatively slim for improved access, and its max torque value comes in at a highly respectable 1,800 in-lbs. Consumer Reports dings the driver slightly for its handling, and notes average results for the tool's run time, even with its impressive power output.\n6. Bosch\nFounded in 1886, Bosch Tools began life in Stuttgart, Germany as the \"Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering.\" The company has played an integral part in the development of diesel engines and pioneered the first hammer drill. In terms of its modern impact drivers, the brand competes right alongside the industry's finest.\nBosch's GDX 18V-1800 Professional model (styled as \"the Bosch Freak\") combines the functionality of an impact driver and impact wrench together in one tool. This gives it a unique versatility, topped off by its capacity to run both \u00bc-inch hex and \u00bd-inch square accessories (both bits and sockets). The driver introduces a variable speed trigger, keeping pace with the premier brands in this category, and offers 1,860 in-lbs of max torque and even more breakaway power. Its brushless motor and 4,100 IPM rating make it a solid performer for any type of fastening or releasing tasks you may have on the docket. Where the impact driver falls a bit flat is in added considerations beyond the pure torque. It's fitted with a just single light at the base of the driver, and Consumer Reports notes a relatively poor run time (giving it a 2 out of 5 in the category) which drops its overall score down to 75. This is still a quality tool, there's no doubt about its performance, but there remain a few lackluster characteristics.\n5. Hercules\nHercules is a power tool brand from Harbor Freight. It's a relatively low-cost option for all manner of power tool varieties including heavy-duty gear, like its demolition hammer or 66-pound jackhammer. That low-price reputation also extends to the brand's impact driver, and the tool's metrics perform on par with some of the most competitive brands out there. Consumer Reports gives it a score of 76, noting a severe drop in run time when compared with other drivers. However, in terms of raw power and even premium feature inclusions, the Hercules impact driver is right in the running for some of the most useful tools in the segment.\nMultiple reviewers including Torque Test Channel tout the extreme power of the tool. However, VCG Construction notes that performance may be intermittent at times. Max output places the Hercules driver near the top of the heap, with 2,200 in-lbs of torque at its peak. The unit also features an incredibly compact motor, at 80% the size of Hercules' brushed impact driver. A three-speed controller places it in the same league as the big names, and the unit's three LED lights \u2014 spread out across the face of the driver \u2014 make it easy to work in low-light conditions. Hercules products often leave certain upgraded functions by the wayside in pursuit of a favorable price point. However, the brand's impact driver seems to strike a fantastic balance.\n4. Makita\nMakita tools are consistently innovative and always powerful. New Makita power tool options are always something to get excited about, and the brand's impact drivers are a great choice for anyone looking for a stable brand to get behind or a single cordless tool to fill a certain fastening void in the toolbox. The Makita brand launched in Nagoya, Japan in 1915, specializing in motors, transformers, and lighting solutions. In 1958, the company introduced its first power tool, an electric planer. The release changed Makita's trajectory and by 1962 the company had rounded out its power tool stable with a circular saw and drill solutions.\nMakita's current 18V impact driver (XDT19R) picks up where its predecessor's legacy ends. The 16R model was rated by Consumer Reports at an 82 grade, making it one of the pinnacle tool options in the impact driver category. The current tool in Makita's stable includes four speed and power modes with a quick shift feature to get the job done without any fussing about. Max torque on the impact driver is rated at 1,590 in-lbs, placing it slightly behind its competitors at the top end of the field but still within striking distance of the pack leaders. Similarly, Makita's 19R build is just 4.5 inches long and weighs just 2.75 pounds, a little heavier than some others, but similar in size to other preeminent drivers.\n3. Dewalt\nOne of the primary choices among professionals in the trades, Dewalt tools are consistently favored for their precision construction, potent function, and reliable longevity even under the most intense of job site pressures. Dewalt sits as the third-best impact driver manufacturer, and its range is truly marvelous. There are a few key reasons why Dewalt takes runner-up billing, but by no means are its tools (or the brand's impact driver, for that matter) an afterthought. On the contrary, Dewalt's iconic yellow has been a mainstay in home improvement and professional building and repair work for many years. Founded in 1924, Dewalt was the progenitor of the radial arm saw, a mythical jobsite tool that still finds use in workshops today.\nDewalt's DCF887D2 model \u2014 the 20V Max XR impact driver \u2014 utilizes a three-speed motor and offers a tightly compact body (2mm shorter than its already sleek predecessor) and a minuscule 2-pound bare unit weight. Rounding out the impact driver's performance, the tool offers up a maximum torque rated at 1,825 in-lbs, surpassing Milwaukee's standard M18 driver but falling just shy of its elite, Fuel range. Consumer Reports gives it a rating of 83, placing Dewalt's offering among the elite of competitive cordless impact drivers. You can't go wrong opting for Dewalt tools. They are often slightly cheaper than their Milwaukee counterparts and provide a very similar user experience, making them ideal for just about any task you may face.\n2. Milwaukee\nMilwaukee is a titanic name in the world of power tools. Hailing originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the brand was founded in 1924. Today, Milwaukee's cordless power tools run on either its M12 or M18 battery systems (The M18 and M18 Fuel lineups also have performance differences). Milwaukee and Dewalt are extremely close competitors in terms of performance and use among pros, especially. But Milwaukee stakes its claim as the \"better\" performer in many regards as a result of its dual offerings. M12 tools provide a near-carbon copy of the experience that tool users get from the larger power tool range, yet their size is dramatically reduced. The M12 Fuel impact driver produces 1,500 in-lbs of torque from a tool weight of just 2 pounds. Its larger cousin, the M18 Fuel offers a boost in power, offering 2,000 in-lbs of torque with a weight that rises by just a quarter of a pound (2.24 lbs).\nMilwaukee's cordless tool lineup is vast and immensely impressive. The Fuel range takes fastening to the next level, but its regular M18 driver is perhaps the most surprising. Consumer Reports offers up a grade of 85 for the 1.7-pound bare unit that produces 1,700 in-lbs of torque (splitting the difference between the Fuel model and the ultra-compact M12 variant with a lighter overall footprint, sans battery).\n1. Flex\nFlex is a brand over a century in the making. The German tool manufacturer pioneered the angle grinder in 1954 and has been at the forefront of job site innovation since its formation in 1922. Flex power tools include all the staples a DIYer or professional in the trades might be looking for, including impact drivers.\nFlex's impact driver ranks among the best in torque and overall power output. As is standard, The FX1371A-1H features a \u00bc-inch hex bit chuck and utilizes a quick eject function that requires just a pull on the outer ring to release. The driver maxes out at 2,500 in-lbs of torque at 4,000 RPM. This places it among the highest performers in the category and virtually guarantees that users will be able to drive whatever fasteners they're working with. The impact driver is just 4.7 inches long and offers an impact rate of up to 4,450 IPM for both a supremely compact frame and a truly impressive work rate. Two of Flex's impact drivers take some of Consumer Reports' top ratings, this and its FX1351-2A model (which received a 90 grade, the highest among impact drivers, from CR). While many great brands make high-quality impact drivers, the Flex brand stands as the best option on the market for its weight, size, torque, and run time."

      "text": "Brad Nailer Vs. Finish Nailer: How To Pick The Right Tool For The Job\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nA hammer is essential for any home tool kit but can only get you so far. Some projects can be completed significantly faster and with cleaner results if you invest in a good nail gun. But what kind of nailer do you need? There are a lot of different options out there, and it can be hard to figure out which one is best suited to which tasks.\nThere are actually nine different kinds of nail guns for buyers to choose from: staple nailers, palm nailers, roofing nailers, pin nailers, brad nailers, flooring nailers, siding nailers, framing nailers, and finishing nailers. These are used for all kinds of different jobs, ranging from pinning down carpets to full-blown furniture making and cabinetry, but brad nailers and finish nailers are the two that most people will be considering in the power tool section of their local hardware store. This is because they are the most versatile varieties, making them the most frequently obtained for commercial and non-commercial use. Both varieties have electric options powered by batteries and pneumatic options requiring an air compressor. Both are also sold by numerous brands at a wide variety of price points. Here is a quick breakdown of what each of these nailers do and what kinds of jobs they're best suited for.\nWhat is a brad nailer used for?\nBrad nailers are significantly smaller than finish nailers and have a wide variety of applications. According to Home Depot, most brad nailers use thin, 18-gauge brads that range in size from \u00bd-inch to 2-inches long. \"They are small in diameter and have a small head. Brad nails provide a clean finish in various woodworking projects. They work best on thinner cuts of lumber such as fiberboard and plywood.\" This makes brad nailers ideal for more detail-oriented jobs like molding and trim.\nWant to pry off old, scuffed-up baseboards and lay in some new ones? If so, a brad nailer will become your best friend. The nails' thinner diameter means they are much less likely to split wood, and the holes they make are significantly easier to conceal without the need for wood filler. This discrete installation makes them incredibly useful in various other woodworking tasks as well. They're great for assembling window frames and attaching door jams and transition pieces. Many carpenters also use them to hold together pieces that are being glued when it's difficult to apply adequate clamping pressure, like with the mitered corners of picture frames. That said, they're not ideal for bonds that need to penetrate studs or joints that have to bear heavy stress.\nWhat is a finish nailer used for?\nA finish nailer is a more heavy-duty tool than a brad nailer, primarily because it uses much wider nails. Finish nailers typically use 15- or 16-gauge nails that range between 1-inch and 3 \u00bd-inches in length. This means that they will be more likely to split wood and leave larger holes that need to be filled, but they are also stronger and provide the option to use much longer nails. Finish nailers, as a whole, are also better suited to outdoor projects, provided that they are paired with galvanized or otherwise adequately weather-treated nails.\nAccording to This Old House, \"[15-gauge] nailers are a great option for large interior and exterior casing when nailing into studs (not the jamb), installing pre-hung doors, stair treads or risers, baseboard, and crown\u2014things that require good holding power in the material that can be filled and painted or stained.\" The added width and larger nail head give them a much stronger hold.\nMeanwhile, 16-gauge nails are slightly smaller and, therefore, more versatile. They're sort of the jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none nail-size. A 16-gauge nail is wider than a brad but not as thick and sturdy as the 15-gauge nails. This makes them good for tasks like installing stair risers and nailing down tongue and groove flooring, but overall, it's sort of an in-between size, which means it can do just about anything. This versatility is why the Milwaukee 16-gauge straight finish nailer is considered one of the best power tools for woodworking. That said, while they can do almost anything, there's almost always a slightly better nail for the job."

      "text": "Craftsman's Tool Warranty Explained: Is It As Good As It Used To Be?\n\"Did you know that the first Craftsman hand tool we sold back in 1927 is still under warranty today?\" reads the copy explaining the lifetime warranty behind Craftsman hand tools on its official website in 2002, when it was a Sears house brand. \"So are all the hand tools we've sold since. That's what is known as having confidence in our quality. As the Craftsman Unlimited Hand Tool Warranty clearly states... If any Craftsman guaranteed forever hand tool fails to provide complete satisfaction, return it for free repair or replacement. Period.\"\nThat same Sears.com page brags that Craftsman was deemed the top brand in America for overall quality in an EquiTrend survey. If anything, Sears was being modest because Craftsman actually won that honor two years in a row, 1998 and 1999, beating out the likes of Crayola, Kodak, and the Discovery Channel. It was well-understood that the Craftsman brand name ensured high-quality, American-made hand tools backed by a pain-free lifetime warranty that allowed you to exchange defective tools without a receipt at any Sears location.\nA lot has changed in the past two decades-plus, though. In early 2010, much of Craftsman's manufacturing was gradually moved to China, and the quality dipped. Then, in 2017, Sears sold the brand to Stanley Black & Decker, which is behind most of the Craftsman tools you see today, though Sears maintained the rights to the brand for use in its stores. But in light of those changes, who handles the warranties on pre-Stanley era Craftsman hand tools? And how?\nWho honors what warranty?\nThough the Craftsman warranty had some limitations added to it under Sears in 2009 (no rusted tools, three-piece limit per day) and 2014 (the tool must be returned to the store it was purchased), it was still a pretty robust lifetime warranty at the time of the sale to Stanley. Shortly after the sale, Yahoo! Finance requested comment on the matter from Stanley. Though the spokesperson was bullish because his company had some similar warranties, he was somewhat non-committal. \"It is too early to speculate on the specifics,\" Stanley VP of communication Tim Perra said in the company's response. \"But we would expect that to continue, and we are always committed to doing the right thing to support the brand and our end-users.\"\nToday, Stanley's Craftsman does offer a \"limited lifetime warranty.\" Still, it's not clear whether or not older Sears Craftsman products can be exchanged via Stanley's resellers: It says that you can \"[r]eturn damaged product to a stocking Retail Partner,\" but what qualifies as \"a stocking retail partner\" for the older Sears tools? Especially since this is complicated by the current version of the Sears warranty for its version of Craftsman retaining the 2014 rule change about having to go to the point of purchase and there being just 10 Sears stores left in the mainland U.S.\nLowe's to the rescue! Sort of...\nThankfully, Lowe's told Scripps Media in 2019 that it would honor the warranty on all Craftsman tools and \"replace it if we have the product.\" However, how \"the product\" is defined is unclear since the Sears versions are technically different models, so Scripps' John Matarese concluded that it was best to call Craftsman customer support.\nIn other words? Yes, there's still a lifetime warranty, and on the newer, Stanley-backed tools, it's about as painless as it was under Sears. You just take them to any Lowe's store like you would have taken them to Sears back in the day. If it's a 2014-forward Sears tool, then you need to bring it back to the specific store where you bought it. But what if it's a legacy Sears tool under the original, unlimited, no-questions-asked warranty? You can try to go to Lowe's, but you're better off calling Craftsman support first.\nIt's complicated, but if you have a busted Craftsman hand tool, you can get a free warranty replacement for it somewhere."

      "text": "11 Reliable Tool Brands For DIY Auto Mechanics\nThe auto mechanic is a special breed of fixer. These individuals combine gritty workmanship with a deep bench of knowledge and problem-solving resolve. Every situation in the garage is unique, and every problem that must be solved under the hood has its own challenges and trouble spots. For many mechanics, this means collecting a range of tools and exploring what the vehicle offers with each new job, regardless of how simple the problem spot appears to be.\nEvery new job is a learning opportunity for a mechanic to root around and perform a bit of discovery and self-improvement. Whenever possible, working on a new car offers not just a way to restore something that's broken to working order but also an invigorating opportunity. Those who work on their own project cars know this love of labor firsthand. For DIYers in the auto mechanic space, not all (or maybe not any, for some) of the work is aimed at earning a paycheck, so the task can be performed as slowly and meticulously as desired. Removing additional components to explore the vehicle's inner workings is always an option..\nEither way, DIY auto mechanics need some of the same foundational tools that professionals in the industry use. With so many brands to choose from, it can be challenging to make informed and intelligent picks. Not all tool brands are alike, and these eleven are some of the best options on the market.\nPittsburgh\nPittsburgh is a great place to begin. This lineup is part of the Harbor Freight universe of tool brands and, therefore, is easily accessible to shoppers nationwide. The online platform is robust, and the company maintains over 1,500 stores nationwide. Pittsburgh is one of the company's low cost brands, but that doesn't mean that the tools are worthy of passing on as a rule. Some tools in your garage are going to be specialty solutions and are perhaps expensive or hold an important esteem for you. Others excel in a kind of \"beater'\" role. You'll need a set of wrenches, for instance, that you don't mind dropping, covering in oil or grease, or perhaps even breaking.\nHarbor Freight's low-cost solutions in the hand tool and garage accessory realm are a perfect remedy for this need. Users also frequently talk about how much better Pittsburgh gear holds up to wear than expected (as well as how it looks and feels). However, the hand tools also ship with a lifetime warranty. Home mechanics, therefore, get a tool brand they can trust to tackle all manner of jobs alongside warranty coverage that will see their tool replaced if it breaks or becomes damaged.\nYou may even be able to get a few key pieces for even cheaper with the store's Inside Track Club promotions.\nWright Tool\nA brand that's made in the USA is frequently one that mechanics will be eager to get their hands on. The sometimes lacking quality of Chinese-made steel tools is a concern that weighs heavily over the tool-buying experience. With so many pieces of gear coming from the manufacturing juggernaut, it's hard to avoid equipment built in its industrial centers. In many instances, an American-made tool is frequently far more expensive than an imported counterpart, but Wright tools are one option that resets the expectation in an impactful way.\nWright Tool is a company committed to quality and providing for the people in its community. The brand has helped shape American tool solutions for nearly 100 years and notes that \"every Wright tool is engineered, built and tested in the United States\" in an effort to \"serve every industry\" in the American workforce. A mechanic looking for beautifully crafted gear with a USA-made heritage and listed at reasonable price for the privilege will want to seriously consider Wright. Screwdrivers, ratchets, wrenches, and everything in between can be found within the Wright catalog. It's not as extensive as a mass-produced alternative, but what Wright delivers it exceedingly well.\nWera\nThe German brand Wera is an electrician's close friend. Wera pliers and screwdrivers are among some of the most sought-after on the market for those needing well-priced, insulated gear. But electrician's equipment is far from the only goods available from the perennial favorite. The entire catalog features ergonomic designs that are comfortable to hold and genuinely nice to use throughout a day of work in the garage. Precise finishes are also part of the expectation here. Screwdriver blades, ratchet turning radii, and combination wrench teeth are all impeccably presented for solid durability and are tools that look as great as they perform.\nThe screwdrivers from Wera are some of the brand's standout performers, though. The interchangeable head design features robust connection points and lengthy blades rather than tiny bits that you'll have to keep track of. Most Wera gear also comes in substantial tool pouches and other carrying cases that help you organize and manage your collection more intuitively. Adding a set of Wera screwdrivers to your kit is a great way to treat yourself to a reliable tool at a relatively reasonable price.\nBlue-Point and J.H. Williams\nBlue-Point is the little cousin to Snap-On's venerated status among mechanics and a natural inclusion here. J.H. Williams (also known as just Williams) is a little more obscure, but it's frequently a firm favorite among mechanics in the know. Snap-On owns both brands and J.H. Williams acts as a foundry for some Snap-On gear. The result (that some users swear by) is a Snap-On product without the logo and price tag attached. It's thought that just about any J.H. Williams tool stamped \"Made in USA\" is the exact same thing as a Snap-On alternative, or at least very nearly identical. This might not be true, but users do note that many of the USA-stamped Williams tools share essentially interchangeable internal components with their Snap-On counterparts.\nBoth Blue-Point and Williams offer far cheaper gear with similar stylistic flair to the Snap-On range. The tools are well made and provide solid durability, making them both a genuinely valuable addition to a home mechanic's garage. There's absolutely something to be said about the way a tool makes a user feel. Expensive, heirloom tool brands like Snap-On evoke significant emotional responses, whether the tool in question is new or a vintage model. These two brands offer similar, if not nearly the same, performance and background forging processes as their ownership company's pinnacle examples. This knowledge can give mechanics a much-needed boost in confidence and style.\nCraftsman\nCraftsman is a brand that's frequently highlighted by DIYers. Craftsman tools are available at a range of outlets today but began life as a Sears brand. The early timeline of Craftsman hand tools featured three distinct quality options, with Craftsman Industrial at the top of the pecking order. Today, Craftsman has shifted significantly (with Sears going under and its brands being sold off or spun out to operate independently), but it retains one important attribute that keeps the name shining.\nOf course, Craftsman tools are still rated for their durability and performance. Users will note that modern examples aren't always as robust or swoon-worthy as their predecessors, but today's Craftsman tools still perform admirably under even the most intense workplace stressors. The real gem in the Craftsman toolbox is the fact that virtually all of the brand's hand tools come with a lifetime warranty attached. Plenty of other Craftsman gear features lifetime or limited warranties, too, but the hand tools provide a near-blanket coverage. This means that you'll be getting a solid workhorse of a screwdriver set or ratchet, and you can rest assured that if you break your gear, you can get a replacement without issue or delay.\nProto\nProto is an industrial brand found right at the center of any truly tough job. Proto notes that its combination wrenches were front and center when Americans were building some of the country's most illustrious objects: The Apollo 11, Golden Gate Bridge, and some of the original 1930s Fords. Today, Proto is owned by Stanley, Black & Decker, a huge name in tool manufacturing. Most of its tools are manufactured in the United States, giving mechanics a great tool born in their backyard.\nMechanics using Proto gear can typically rely on their equipment to continue performing long into the twilight of their automotive careers (or hobby). Proto makes its power and hand tools to some of the highest standards around, resulting in a range of industrial tools that can take on almost any job. This makes them even more capable of tackling the demands of a DIYer's garage. A few targeted additions to your setup from the Proto range can immediately amplify your workspace, especially if you're a DIYer who uses or plans to add pneumatic tools and a new air compressor to your space.\nKlutch Tools\nAnother brand that makes most of its tools in the United States, Klutch is a Minnesota-based manufacturer (owned by Northern Tool) that develops and forges many of its tools in-house. Klutch tools include woodworking and metal forging staples like bandsaws and shop presses, but the company also manufactures crucial mechanic shop gear like ratchets and socket sets. Klutch has been offering users professional-grade gear for more than 25 years. As a new face amongst the crowd of high-end tool builders, Klutch has a lot to prove, but users frequently rave about the output the Minneapolis brand puts out into the marketplace.\nThe Klutch brand also comes along with warranty coverage that spans up to three years. The brand's hand tools also feature a lifetime warranty, meaning you'll get a big vote of confidence in any power or hand tool that you opt to buy from the brand. The Klutch mechanic's tool set is among standout mechanic's kits on the market today (and for $246 it will get you going with fabulous American-made gear right from jump).\nTekton\nThere's a theme among American brands at the higher end of the spectrum that should be apparent by now. Tekton is another superb performer that manufactures a notable volume of its tools in the U.S. (roughly 17% by its own calculations). Users note that Tekton makes quality tools without the price tag that you might expect for a high-end brand with a notable volume of U.S.-made selections. The brand's customer service is also praised by those with collections that include Tekton gear. Rather than having to send in a broken tool, users report that Tekton only asks for a picture of the damaged equipment so they can establish the necessary replacement (and it seems that the company often over-delivers on this replacement with a full set or multiple tools in the category to replace one work out item).\nAll sorts of gear is available from Tekton, so rounding out your collection with some targeted additions is possible across much of the mechanic's varied needs. The brand carries sockets and ratchet tools, wrenches (combination and others), screwdrivers, and pliers, among others. You'll also find toolboxes and cabinet solutions from Tekton that can help add some organization to your workspace.\nMAC Tools\nOne of the preeminent tool makers in the American marketplace, MAC Tools is a tool truck brand that pros frequently rely on as a go-to solution for their most pressing needs. MAC Tools feature all the standard fare, from pliers and wrenches to socket sets and screwdrivers. MAC gear can run up the bill quite quickly for an eager buyer, but this is a premium brand that's likely to last you a very long time \u2014 especially as a DIY enthusiast who may not be inflicting daily carnage on the equipment you own.\nUsers note that MAC Tools offers student and other discount programs that can make getting the gear you need to work on your projects more cost-effective, too. This is great news for buyers hoping to get high-quality gear but may be operating on a tighter budget. MAC is consistently compared to Snap-On in quality, likely due to its DNA as a tool truck brand that positioned itself as a professional's old trusty.\nKnipex\nKnipex makes one thing: Pliers. However, don't sell the brand short because of that. Knipex has been producing pliers for over 140 years, and the German manufacturer maintains direct control and ownership of virtually the entire manufacturing process. This allows the company to produce some of the finest pliers available on the market, hands down. It's worth noting that my own tool collection features a few important Knipex pliers, and the brand's combination \"pliers for electrical installation\" is one of the most important and useful tools in it.\nThe tools from Knipex are almost impossibly smooth when in operation, and they feature a variety of satin, blacked-out, and massively shiny chrome vanadium finishes for any user's personal preference. They're excellent for electrical work and any task you may face beyond it. Auto mechanics frequently need a pair of pliers to grab a workpiece or to perform crossover tasks within the world of fluids or electrical components. Knipex gear is well suited to essentially any task you may face, and it's truly a brand that can outlast its operator with a bit of care given to the equipment.\nSnap-On\nSnap-On is a delicacy of the highest order among hand tool manufacturers. The brand delivers only premium products and was born as a tool truck brand with the stuff of legends on board. Today, you can buy directly from these roaming salespeople or order online to get the goods. It's also a great idea to scour your local secondhand marketplace for preowned Snap-On equipment that still has plenty of life in it. Two reasons bubble up to the surface for buying used: Firstly, as an ultra-premium tool brand, Snap-On stuff can be exorbitantly expensive. A standard 32-ounce dead blow hammer from Snap-On will run you $102.50, for instance. Another 32-ounce Pittsburgh alternative sells for nearly twelve times less at $9. A striking tool like this may not be a great comparison since there's not a whole lot of nuance to be seen, even within a specialist hammer.\nSnap-On's real claim to glory within the automotive mechanic world is its ratchets, socket sets, and the like. These tools are polished to absolute perfection and machined to exacting standards that won't fail their operators unless subjected to truly ludicrous extremes. In the event of a Snap-On tool failure, the brand backs its gear a bevy of warranty coverages, including lifetime warranties for many tools. It's worth noting that users have expressed dissatisfaction in recent years over Snap-On's move to limit warranty coverage to the original customer rather than the tool itself."

      "text": "13 Of The Best Hand Tool Brands\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThe humble hand tool is often overlooked in favor of a powered alternative. Why reach for a ratchet and socket when you can rip a fastener off its screw in seconds with an impact wrench, right? The same question comes up in just about every scenario in the automotive garage, at the woodworking bench, and beyond. No matter the project, there's often a power tool to get the job done.\nBut while power tools provide fast, effort-reducing efficiency (often at tremendous cost), they aren't always the right solution to problems you'll face under the hood or beyond. An impact wrench will quickly loosen a fastener, but it can also shear bolts with ease, giving you a totally new problem to work around. There is such a thing as too much power at times.\nThere's something incredibly intuitive about hand power, and it can't be replicated in even the smartest power tools. Knowing exactly where to cut to on your workpiece or tightening a fastener to just the right point is entirely human, and hand tools make this possible. However, not all hand tools are built with the same love and care. Some just sparkle in ways that a run of the mill ratchet, pocketknife, or coping saw can't. These are some of the special brands that users can't stop talking about, ranked in no particular order.\nSnap-On\nKicking things off, Snap-On is a consummate contender in conversations surrounding the pinnacle of hand tools. Snap-On has been around since 1920 and is legendary in the world of professional mechanic work. The brand remains under company ownership rather than conglomerate control and even owns a few other toolmakers. For many years, Snap-On was only sold via its roving tool trucks. Those outside the sphere of professional automotive work therefore would have had a much harder time getting their hands on this gear.\nAs a result of its specialized target buyer, Snap-On tools naturally became some of the highest quality options anywhere in the market. The brand is backed by a lifetime warranty, so you can always bring a tool back for a replacement (although the company has recently revised this policy to officially cover tools only for their \"original owner\"). Snap-On tools are some of the most durable around. They were built to handle intense demands of all-day work in challenging environments. Over the years Snap-On gear has also evolved to support a huge range of use cases, so you'll find small head ratchets, extended reach options, and all kinds of other specialized equipment within the Snap-On catalog. Snap-On equipment is frequently amazingly expensive, representing perhaps the only drawback. Although looking for used Snap-On tools at garage sales and in online marketplaces can get you excellent gear at a critical discount.\nProto\nProto is another brand that cut its teeth in the world of industrial manufacturing work. Just as legendary a brand as Snap-On and others (like Matco and MAC Tools, for instance), the company claims its equipment is used every day in \"the toughest industries.\" Proto gear is found in mining, aerospace, rail, and beyond. Its air tools are some of the most sought after anywhere in the market, and it naturally also delivers a variety of hand tools that serious users will want to bring into their toolbox to tackle intense demands.\nA number of Proto's ratchet wrenches are particularly useful, because they feature a digital torque readout. This allows you to dial in the precise turning power necessary to clamp down a fastener. Screwdrivers, clamps, cutting tools, vises, and pliers are also part of the Proto catalog. Proto equipment isn't cheap, but it's typically more cost-effective than a Snap-On example. A typical \u00bd-inch drive Snap-On ratchet will run you $207 from the company's web store while a similar Proto example can be found at Grainger for $135. Born from needs in different industries, both Proto and Snap-On excel in high intensity working demands, but each one delivers that durability and immaculate style for a steep cost.\nStanley\nStanley is a name that tool users everywhere will surely know and probably love. Modern Stanley gear can be found in wide range of use cases. You'll find Stanley essentials like screwdrivers and ratchet sets, but that's not what the brand is best known for by woodworking tool collectors in particular.\nIn the modern day tool market, Stanley is part of the Stanley Black and Decker conglomerate, having merged in 2010. The company is one of the major corporate owners across the world of tool brands, but in its earlier days, Stanley grew into a hugely prominent tool maker off the success of its hand planes.\nBrought to the market for the first time in the 1867, Stanley's hand planes changed the very nature of woodworking and carpentry. The Stanley series of hand planes delivered a body made entirely out of steel. These planes were built on essentially a single pattern and delivered to the market in varying sizes. They proved vastly durable, and buyers scouring the market for vintage tools at garage sales will frequently come across examples made in the early 1900s or even prior to the turn of the century.\nToday, people exploring the Stanley catalog frequently look for vintage hand planes, most notably the No. 4 or No. 5 models. And on the subject of modern tools, Stanley makes all manner of accessory gear \u2014 from punches, to measuring and marking gauges, to cutting implements \u2014 and just about all of it offers great quality.\nKnipex\nKnipex makes a lot of tools, but they're virtually all either pliers and cutting implements. It might seem odd to get all that excited about a pair of pliers, but Knipex gear is just plain different from anything else you'll find on the market: A Pro Tool Reviews survey labeled it the best hand tool brand in business.\nThis German manufacturer has been delivering hand tools to users since 1882. It's a family run business from a small German village that has grown alongside its ownership, now in hands of the family's third generation. Knipex pliers are uniquely smooth in their operation and the jaws are magnificently hard. Whether you're holding a pair of electrical installation pliers or a locking jaw option like Knipex's Cobra pliers, which feature an adjustable mouth (and a self-locking function), the tool is perfectly engineered to get the job you're tackling done.\nKnipex has seemingly perfected the balance between heft and comfort. The pliers feel heavier in your hand than they look, but just enough to add a bit of a helpful weight to the task. They don't actually weigh you down. Users frequently suggest that Knipex pliers are the kinds of tools a conscientious owner could one day hand down to their children. With a catalog that features virtually any kind of grabbing implement you can ask for, a tool chest including Knipex gear is one that's well prepared to take on any job that may come your way.\nDeWalt\nDeWalt equipment is enormously popular in the world of power tools, offering impact drivers among the best on the market, and much more. It also makes a wide range of hand tools to round out its catalog. Indeed, both DIY and professional fixers could conceivably tackle an entire renovation or repair project from start to finish using only DeWalt branded equipment.\nPerhaps the most important part of the DeWalt moniker is its staying power. DeWalt gear is characterized perhaps most prominently by its durability. Whether it's a competent, budget-friendly mechanics tool set or a dead blow hammer, you can expect a DeWalt tool to handle any job you throw at it with grace and tremendous performance. The work gear is frequently built with a wide set of utilitarian functions in mind, too.\nThe brand's side strike chisels are some of my personal favorite DeWalt hand tools for this reason. They feature a striking cap on the back of the handle so that you can use them relentlessly with a hammer, and the blade features a sharp edge that wraps around the corner and ends with a sort of serration. DeWalt also added a touch of extra thickness to the opposite side, so you can press firmly against the squared back edge or even strike it to dig the blade into a workpiece.\nBenchmade\nBenchmade is frequently touted as the best option in pocket knives the market has to offer. The iconic butterfly logo adorns some of the most durable blades you'll find anywhere. Touted enthusiastically as one of the most important tools on the market by those who stick a knife in their backpack or pocket as an everyday carry tool, the brand's knives feature a buttery smooth opening action, no matter what model you might be considering (from spring action to automatic openers). They are durable and feature rich, with plenty of care given to their design and materials.\nA Benchmade knife is almost certain to last you for many years, even if you put it through plenty of abuse in your daily usage. The Benchmade 940 is the most recognizable (and potentially the most talked about) tool in the company's arsenal. However, Benchmade tools run the gamut and include solutions for cooking, hunting and camping, and even tactical options with fixed blade configurations.\nVictorinox\nVictorinox is a clear choice for inclusion among the best hand tool options out there. This is the maker of the original Swiss army knife, a brand that's been making precision hand tools since 1884. Its name is a combination of the term Inox (stainless steel) and founder Karl Elsener's mother's name: Victoria. The Swiss Army Knife became a staple of post-war American souvenirs for soldiers returning from Europe (having been ordered for the military's PX stores in 1945).\nHowever, Victorinox's knives aren't just a neat gadget. They have become a staple of modern multi-functional equipment. Beyond the original knife, Victorinox makes a range of kitchen knives and other pocketknives. Its Master Craftsman knives were even purchased by NASA and taken into space. Victorinox also makes precision Swiss watches and travel gear, which may lead some to be surprised by its inclusion here. Even with those other business segments making up a notable portion of the Victorinox brand today, the company's heart still lies in its most important invention, a hand tool that brings tremendous range to its user's pockets.\nCraftsman\nCraftsman might be a surprising inclusion on this list. Originally founded under the Sears umbrella, the brand's hand tools have always carried a lifetime guarantee, making them tremendously valuable to users across the spectrum of needs. This warranty policy remains in effect today, but it's worth noting the Craftsman's modern tools are notably less exciting than those from its \"vintage catalog.\" The brand has certainly seen its reputation fall from grace in recent years. Less than two decades ago, essentially every hand tool made by Craftsman was crafted in the United States. Now that's no longer the case.\nHowever, even with this in mind, modern Craftsman gear remains at a generally good level of quality. That, plus the lifetime warranty attached to its hand tools and the brand's relatively low pricing, makes even contemporary equipment worth a look. And if you're in the market for some of the best gear available, seeking out vintage examples and particularly keeping your eyes peeled for Craftsman equipment branded as either \"Craftsman Industrial\" or \"Craftsman Professional\" will yield the best results. In its early days, Craftsman utilized a three-tiered model for its tool options. The best Craftsman equipment available was labeled in this way, so finding and early Craftsman Industrial socket set, for instance, should be cause for serious celebration.\nLeatherman\nPlenty of brands make multitools, but few do it as well as Leatherman. The brand's gear is simply a cut above the competition. Leatherman multitools come in a variety of specialized options, and the brand likely has something to suit your specific needs perfectly. Whether you work with your hands on a frequent basis and need a pocket tool that can tackle plenty of jobs, or you're a camper looking for something lightweight to handle everything from tent set up to basic fire starting, Leatherman multitools are a great choice.\nThese are yet another target of vintage bargain hunters. Leatherman multitools don't exactly suffer from obsolescence or the march of new technology in any other sense. Old Leatherman Wave (among other models) multitools are essentially just as valuable to the typical users as a brand new example. This means that you can find new or old gear at a range of prices to get any job done you may have on your plate.\nKlein Tools\nRanked third among hand tool brands by the Pro Tool Reviews' survey we mentioned earlier, Klein Tools features prominently in the electrical installation niche. Screwdrivers and sockets are just some of the hand tools produced at a premium level by Klein. The company also makes testing equipment that is flat out essential when it comes to safely working on the electrical systems you may face in your home or work environment. Multimeters and voltage gauges like the brand's pen test tools are staples in the tool bag for electricians.\nThose working on electrical systems aren't the only people who prefer Klein, however. The brand is known for making excellent gear across its entire range, and options like its telescoping screwdriver/nut driver will appeal to DIYers tackling all manner of projects beyond circuitry and wiring, too. Klein is a name that bridges the gap between high quality and low price, making it a solid option for someone looking to build a starter toolkit or round out a professional packout alike.\nStiletto\nStiletto hammers are simply the best striking tools on the market. Stiletto makes a seemingly dizzying variety of hammers, as well. This means that no matter your job parameters or physical requirements, there's likely a Stiletto hammer that will get the job done for you. Some of its most impressive tools feature a titanium build with one piece designs that seek to create a durable tool that will last a lifetime. Stiletto also makes hammer heads fitted directly to hickory handles for vibration dampening and a classic hammering feel.\nTitanium hammers are particularly head turning not for any visual aspect but rather because they deliver the same nail driving force as a steel tool in a lighter overall package. A 10-ounce hammer head can therefore replace something heavier like a 14- or 16-ounce steel hammer (or a 16-ounce titanium option can deliver even greater driving force). The weight difference might seem negligible, but when swinging the hammer hundreds of times over the course of the day working to frame a new structure, for instance, this weight saving feature is felt tremendously.\nIrwin\nThe final inclusion here is one that many will already be familiar with. The Irwin brand is a trusted name in the hand tool arena, with gear running the gamut of utility from screwdrivers and hammers to clamps and saws. Irwin's ProTouch Coping Saw is a unique find that adds tremendous value when purchased on Amazon. The tool is just $10 and ships fast and free with Prime membership. On top of that, purchasing with Discover rewards can drop the price down even farther with a 30% discount.\nIrwin hand tools are found in professional hands as well as those of a DIYer. They're frequently some of the most inexpensive options available in whatever category you're searching through, and yet Irwin equipment never feels cheap or fragile. Pro Tool Reviews named Irwin its 11th best hand tool brand (based on user feedback), and for good reason. The company isn't looking to compete with the superstars of the tool world like Proto or Stiletto, but the gear it makes is still extremely durable, offers quality features, and importantly, won't break the bank.\nMethodology\nMost of these tool brands I have personal experience using. For example, I can confidently say that Knipex is the preeminent pliers maker the world over. While others like Channellock make great tools in the same category, the Knipex brand is just a cut above. Beyond personal experience, however, professional review outlets such as Tend Industrial Supplies and Pro Tool Reviews helped make sense of both brands known personally and others, such as Proto. User feedback through online forums also played a role in highlighting some brands.\nAs these hand tool brands range across many categories and niches, we opted not to rank them against each other."

      "text": "6 Technologies You'll Only Find On Makita Tools\nMakita is a Japanese-owned tool company that has existed since 1915. Not only has it survived over a century of business, but Makita is often counted as one of the best power tool brands on the market. The company has managed to hold its place in the public eye in a few ways. Consistent quality and reasonable prices are chief among them, but the company has always made a point of being at the forefront of innovation.\nMakita's R&D department has produced several unique technologies. Makita then patented these, ensuring its tools would be the only ones to have them. There are dozens of these specialized technologies ingrained in the company's tools. Many of them were designed to improve the efficiency of Makita's cordless battery systems, but other technologies cover everything from anti-vibration tech to the filtration systems in Makita's shop-vacs. Some of them are relatively minor features, but others have grown to become major selling points for the brand since they are present in all of Makita's most popular power tools. Here are six of the most impressive technologies you can only find on Makita brand tools.\nLXT Lithium-Ion\nJust about every power tool company has its proprietary battery system. In fact, this is one of the biggest defining factors for many tool buyers when choosing which brand will populate a majority of their garage. Power tool batteries often cost nearly as much as the tools themselves, but they usually work on tools across the brand so long as they require the same voltage. This means choosing a brand with a good battery system is a must.\nMakita was the first brand to introduce 18V lithium-ion tools in 2005, and the company's current line of cordless tools uses its LXT Lithium-Ion batteries\u2013the world's largest 18V slide-style battery system. According to Makita's website, the \"purpose-built motors, battery technology, and enhanced communications work together to deliver unmatched power, speed, and run time.\"\nThese batteries come in a variety of amperages. Makita offers 2.0Ah, 3.0Ah, 4.0Ah, 5.0Ah, and 6.0Ah varieties, but one of the more unique things about them is that you can actually combine any two 18V LXT batteries to power a 36V tool. This expands their versatility since it means that Makita tool owners won't need separate batteries for low and mid-voltage power tools. This is one of the main reasons Makita can offer over 325 cordless tools powered by a single-voltage battery system.\nXGT\nThe LXT system is an extremely well-regarded solution for most hand tools, and it's probably the only system most Makita tool users will need for basic weekend repairs and home maintenance. That said, Makita also offers another battery system for some of its pro-grade tools that need a little more juice. \"The LXT System handles most applications, but for high-demand applications that use corded, gas, or air, the XGT System delivers higher-powered solutions,\" says Makita. \"With 40V max and 80V max XGT Products, pros can fully experience a battery-powered job site.\"\nThe new XGT battery system is based on a 40V max battery, which isn't much stronger than the 36V solution offered by the LXT system. Still, Makita has made it so that these batteries can be doubled up to create a combined 80V power source for the most demanding cordless equipment. This goes beyond hand tools and can even power things like demolition hammers and miter saws. These batteries are available in 2.5Ah, 4.0Ah, and 5.0Ah amperages. They also have the added perk of working on the same charging system as the LXT batteries, so you don't need to have a ton of chargers cluttering up your garage. Only about a third of Makita's products use the XGT system, but it might be a worthwhile investment for pros who are heavily invested in Makita brand tools and don't want to be confined to corded tools.\nSTAR Protection Computer Controls\nAs impressive as Makita's battery systems are on their own, a couple of other patented technologies are embedded in them that add new and exciting functionalities. Some of the best can even affect how the batteries communicate with the tools they're designed to work with. The most heavily marketed of these features is Makita's STAR Protection Computer Controls.\nSTAR is a communications technology that's designed to monitor the flow of power from the battery to the tool during use. It has a built-in shut-off switch that protects tools when the flow of power leads to effects that might negatively impact the tool's safety and performance. Makita states that STAR Protection allows \"the tool and battery to exchange data to protect against overloading, overdischarging and overheating. If STAR detects conditions that threaten to overload, overdischarge or overheat the tool or battery, the tool will automatically stop.\" So, if a tool reaches dangerous levels in any of these categories, it will automatically shut off before any damage can be done to the tool or the user. When this happens, all you need to do is either wait for the tool to cool off and restart it, charge the battery, or swap it out for a fresh one. This can save your tools from burning out and it can protect you from any potential injury if there's something wrong with your tool's power flow.\nActive 3 Controls\nNext, we have Active 3 Controls. This is another technology that monitors the transfer of power. Only instead of monitoring the flow from the battery to the tool, this system is designed to monitor the flow of electricity from the charger to the battery. It does this so that Makita's chargers can power up its batteries more efficiently, maximizing the flow of power while simultaneously ensuring the battery's integrity.\n\"The battery and charger communicate through the built-in chip inside the battery and exchange information to monitor and control current, voltage and temperature,\" says Makita. \"The efficient management of these three conditions is engineered to help optimize the charging process, so your battery spends more time working and less time sitting on the charger.\" By monitoring these three variables via the Active 3 Controls, Makita's smart chargers are able to allocate as much current as possible to charge its batteries quickly without suffering any potential damage to the battery. This might not matter for those who plan on having tons of batteries in reserve, but it's a nice touch for those who only have one or two batteries and want a quick turnaround on their charging times.\nXPT\nOf course, not all of Makita's technologies are focused on the batteries. Some of them are more concerned with the tool's design\u2013particularly when it comes to preventing breakage. Power tools often have to endure some pretty harsh conditions. They get beaten, battered, and knocked around a lot more than most electronics, so they have to have some pretty durable casing. They also tend to get wet and dirty since you aren't usually using them in anything, even close to resembling a sterile environment. Since water and mud aren't usually great for complicated pieces of machinery, it's important to protect the inside of your tools. That's where XPT comes in.\nXPT stands for Extreme Protection Technology. The name might sound a little vague, but it actually refers to a series of seals that were specially developed by Makita for use in its power tools. These seals are integrated into the spaces between the plastic shells and the metal components that make up the power tools' outer housing. Makita claims that these seals are specially engineered to channel dust and water away. This means that even if the outside of your tools gets covered in muck, the delicate insides remain clean, dry, and functional.\nAdvanced AVT\nFinally, we have Advanced AVT. It's no secret that power tools tend to vibrate. Most of them involve components that rotate, oscillate, or reciprocate at incredible speeds. This can make them uncomfortable to hold onto for extended periods of time. It's particularly noticeable in tools like random orbital sanders, where users may be using them for hours at a time on larger projects. Many a woodworker has had to stop halfway through sanding a project because their hand has locked up from the continuous vibration. Most power tool manufacturers make some kind of rubberized grip in order to help mitigate this effect, but Makita took it a step further.\nAVT stands for Anti-Vibration Technology, and it's a lot more intricate than a rubber grip sleeve. According to Makita, Advanced AVT is a system that reduces vibration on three separate fronts. \"The Air Actuated Counterbalance moves counterweight pistons in the opposite direction of the drive piston to actively reduce vibration. The Vibration Absorbing Housing isolates the rear and side handle, reducing vibration for the user. And the Integrated Damper Spring is engineered to absorb impact vibrations from the drill bit.\" This might not seem like a big deal for the casual craftsperson, but it's a major boon to pros who have to spend long hours with tools in hand."
