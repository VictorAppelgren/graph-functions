  "description": "I\u2019ll Cut U! is one of 23 new businesses that have opened since March 29 throughout Waukegan.",
  "content": "A post-COVID trend of business growth \u2014 a net of 1,744 business licenses were issued or renewed by the city of Waukegan since the start of 2022 \u2014 continues in the city with the addition of 20 new enterprises in the second quarter of this year.\n\nThe new businesses include a gourmet restaurant with a Mexican flair whose owners seek a Michelin star, a smaller eatery where an individual pork taco costs $3.50 and a downtown barber shop where appointments are taken but not required.\n\nKenneth Crump, the owner of I\u2019ll Cut U! barber shop on Genesee Street in downtown Waukegan and a city native, cut the ribbon for his new location on July 1. On a recent afternoon, he finished styling a head with intricate braids before giving a traditional military haircut.\n\nWith several people visiting while waiting for their turn, Crump said he wants a shop where the community can gather, whether they have an appointment or not. He has 15 years in the business with extensive schooling.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be an old-school barber shop where people don\u2019t need an appointment,\u201d Crump said. \u201cThey can come in, wait their turn and get a haircut \u2014 same day service.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll Cut U! is one of 23 new businesses that have opened since March 29 throughout Waukegan, continuing a substantial business growth rate that rapidly accelerated in the past two years.\n\nThough the city does not track each business that opens and closes during the year, every business owner must renew their license and pay the applicable fee each Jan. 1 allowing a count of all companies doing business in Waukegan.\n\nAt the start of 2022 before the impact COVID was making it harder for businesses to survive, and there were 1,616 business licenses issued in Waukegan, according to city records. At the start of 2023, the number dropped to 1,408.\n\nAs more businesses opened in 2023, the number of licenses climbed to 2,768 at the start of 2024 and 3,360 to begin 2025, doubling the 2022 total. Mayor Sam Cunningham said in an email that the city is supporting business owners as much as it can, helping new ones to grow further this year.\n\n\u201cAlready this year, we\u2019ve seen a surge in business license applicants, and we want that momentum to keep going,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cTo make it happen, we\u2019re committed to making our services more efficient and responsive to everyone\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nWaukegan Chamber of Commerce board Chair Dr. Michael J. Reed said Waukegan is a \u201cgood place to live, shop and play,\u201d making it ripe for business growth,\n\n\u201cThe city is a hidden gem and its resources are showing,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThere are more opportunities to come here as we rebuild the downtown.\u201d\n\nLa Chuparosa, the gourmet restaurant with a Mexican flair, formally opened with a ribbon-cutting on June 5. Indra Garcia, one of the owners, said it is also a place where women are comfortable dining with friends or having a cocktail at the bar.\n\nPainted on the walls are large portraits of Frieda Kahlo, a Mexican artist, and Maria Felix, an actor from Mexico, who were friends. Garcia said both were trendsetters and independent women ahead of their time.\n\n\u201cWe want to cater to women who can be comfortable having a cocktail or dining with friends, their husband, a boyfriend or a date and not feel harassed,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe want them to know this is a safe place.\u201d\n\nWith a menu featuring a Mexican Wheel Shrimp Pasta for $33, Chili Crusted Salmon for $30, and a 36-ounce prime Tomahawk steak for $120, Garcia said their two Mexican-trained chefs are seeking a Michelin star. There are also happy-hour tacos for $8.\n\nGarcia has a three-word answer for opening a restaurant which would fit comfortably in the Oak Street neighborhood of Chicago in her hometown of Waukegan where she has lived since she was 11.\n\nA few miles from La Chuparosa, Adalberto Fuentes and a partner opened Chicken Miche on June 13 on Belvidere Road, just south of the city\u2019s downtown, named for the best dish his partner cooks and the drink he crafts.\n\n\u201cHe makes the best chicken in Milwaukee,\u201d Fuentes said, referring to the partners\u2019 initial eatery. \u201cI make the best michelada. It\u2019s like a bloody mary with spices mixed with beer.\u201d\n\nOther new businesses opened in Waukegan since June 5 include Antojitos El Alegre food truck on June 7, Adore Boutique on June 25, Liguez Brunch on June 27, Alani Banquets on July 9, and Premier Barber.\n\n Academy on July 21, Al Jarrito Caf\u00e9 on July 22 and Tacos El Vale on June 25.",
