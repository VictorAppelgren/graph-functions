The hole collared into an alternating andesite and dacitic volcanic package with swarms of meter-scale weak to moderately sheared, sericite-silica-chlorite altered diorite and porphyritic diorite. Stronger sheared sections of diorite were mineralized with the presence of pyrite and chalcopyrite returning a modest intercept of 12m of 0.90 g/t Au from 157m, including 10m of 1.00 g/t Au from 157m up dip and along strike of existing mineralized marginal shears.\n\nHole MMD-25-173 was drilled from Snodgrass Lake, approximately100m north of MMD-25-172. The hole collared into alternating dacitic and andesitic volcanics before intersecting the Main Zone sericite-hematite and epidote-chlorite altered diorite complex at 90m. Local areas of more intense shearing contained higher-grade mineralization of pyrite and chalcopyrite with intercepts of 8.2m of 0.88 g/t Au from 90.8m, including 2.2m of 2.84 g/t Au from 90.8m, and 14.0m of 0.35 g/t Au from 160m. The hole was stopped short of the core shear network as the volume had been previously drilled.\n\nHoles MMD-25-184, MMD-25-186, and MMD-25-187 were drilled from the same setup on the western shore of Snodgrass Lake, targeting the gap between the Main and Southwest Zones to test the continuity of mineralized shears between the two zones. The holes were drilled at an oblique angle to the primary foliation due to restricted drill sites. This provided the added benefit of testing a possible NS-structure that offsets the Southwest Zone from the main Moss structure corridor.\n\nAll holes collared in a porphyritic diorite and quickly transitioned into dacite volcanics with swarms of weak to moderately sheared, sericite-silica-hematite altered diorite and granodiorite dykes increasing in frequency and alteration and mineralization intensity with depth. At approximately 100m the hole intersected roughly one hundred meters of sheared, sericite-silica-hematite altered diorite package with pyrite mineralization returning intercepts including 8.3m of 0.63 g/t Au from 105.7m and 2.75m of 3.08 g/t Au from 119.25m in MMD-25-184; 20m of 0.92 g/t Au from 154m, including 4m of 3.01 g/t Au from 159m in MMD-25-186; and 26.35m of 0.59 g/t Au from 279.85m in MMD-25-187. The overall lithological and alteration package appear more similar to the Southwest Zone than the Main Zone with the location of the intercepts suggesting the two zones are not directly connected. Holes MMD-25-184 and -186, which were drilled at the same declination but 20\u00b0 different azimuths, intersected a wide volcanic section characterized by strong late brecciation and local faulting after which the frequency of diorite intrusions are greatly reduced. MMD-25-187, which was drilled more steeply beneath MMD-25-186, intersected the zone of late brittle deformation notably deeper than the up-dip holes after intersecting a second one hundred and fifty meter wide sericite-chlorite altered diorite complex, returning an intercept of 25.3m of 0.92 g/t Au from 390m, including 3.15m of 5.15 g/t Au from 391.85m, suggesting a modest western dip to the structure.\n\nHole MMD-25-195 was drilled 135m northwest along the shore of Snodgrass Lake at a similar oblique angle. The hole collared into a dacite volcanic dominated sequence with swarms of weakly sheared, sericite-silica-hematite altered diorite, porphyritic diorite, and granodiorite dykes. The dykes are weakly mineralized with pyrite and narrow low-grade intercepts, such as 5.55m of 0.52 g/t Au from 213.45 and 6.45m of 0.51 g/t Au from 328m. The hole intersected a similar a wide volcanic section with strong late brecciation and local faulting after which the diorite intrusions become notably less frequent.\n\nFigure 3: Hole MMD-25-187: Brecciated and faulted contact of sheared altered diorite and intermediate volcanics with intercept of 25.3m of 0.92 g/t Au from 390m, including 3.15m of 5.15 g/t Au from 391.85m.\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8051/261723_4ef06999d4e57989_004full.jpg\n\nThe HQ diameter drill core (NQ-diameter for holes MMD-25-172 and -173) has been oriented using ACTIII or equivalent tools and validated in the core shack. All core has been sawed in half cut just off the core orientation line (bottom of hole) with the right half (looking down hole) of the core bagged and sent a third-party analytical laboratory. The left half of the core was returned to core boxes and is stored at Goldshore's Kashabowie core yard facility.\n\nAll samples were sent to ALS Geochemistry in Thunder Bay for preparation and analysis was performed in the ALS Vancouver analytical facility. ALS is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) for the Accreditation of Mineral Analysis Testing Laboratories and CAN-P-4E ISO/IEC 17025. Samples were analysed for gold via fire assay with an AA finish (\"Au-AA23\") and 48 pathfinder elements via ICP-MS after four-acid digestion (\"ME-MS61\"). Samples that assayed over 10 ppm Au were re-run via fire assay with a gravimetric finish (\"Au-GRA21\").\n\nIn addition to ALS quality assurance / quality control (\"QA/QC\") protocols, Goldshore has implemented a quality control program for all samples collected through the drilling program. The quality control program was designed by a qualified and independent third party, with a focus on the quality of analytical results for gold. Analytical results are received, imported to our secure on-line database and evaluated to meet our established guidelines to ensure that all sample batches pass industry best practice for analytical quality control. Certified reference materials are considered acceptable if values returned are within three standard deviations of the certified value reported by the manufacture of the material. In addition to the certified reference material, certified blank material is included in the sample stream to monitor contamination during sample preparation. Blank material results are assessed based on the returned gold result being less than ten times the quoted lower detection limit of the analytical method. The results of the on-going analytical quality control program are evaluated and reported to Goldshore by Orix Geoscience Inc.\n\nPeter Flindell, PGeo, MAusIMM, MAIG, Vice-President, Exploration, of the Company, and a qualified person under National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\n\nMr. Flindell has verified the data disclosed. To verify the information related to the winter drill program at the Moss Gold Project, Mr. Flindell has visited the property several times; discussed and reviewed logging, sampling, bulk density, core cutting and sample shipping processes with responsible site staff; discussed and reviewed assay and QA/QC results with responsible personnel; and reviewed supporting documentation, including drill hole location and orientation and significant assay interval calculations. He has also overseen the Company's health and safety policies in the field to ensure full compliance, and consulted with the Project's host indigenous communities on the planning and implementation of the drill program, particularly with respect to its impact on the environment and the Company's remediation protocols.\n\nThe Company also announces that it has entered into an amending agreement to the net profit interest (\"NPI\") purchase agreement dated May 1, 2025 (the \"Agreement\"), previously disclosed in the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025. Pursuant to the amendment, the Company has set a limit on the number of shares issuable to the NPI vendor as part of the final consideration payable under the Agreement.

This provided the added benefit of testing a possible NS-structure that offsets the Southwest Zone from the main Moss structure corridor.\nAll holes collared in a porphyritic diorite and quickly transitioned into dacite volcanics with swarms of weak to moderately sheared, sericite-silica-hematite altered diorite and granodiorite dykes increasing in frequency and alteration and mineralization intensity with depth. At approximately 100m the hole intersected roughly one hundred meters of sheared, sericite-silica-hematite altered diorite package with pyrite mineralization returning intercepts including 8.3m of 0.63 g/t Au from 105.7m and 2.75m of 3.08 g/t Au from 119.25m in MMD-25-184; 20m of 0.92 g/t Au from 154m, including 4m of 3.01 g/t Au from 159m in MMD-25-186; and 26.35m of 0.59 g/t Au from 279.85m in MMD-25-187. The overall lithological and alteration package appear more similar to the Southwest Zone than the Main Zone with the location of the intercepts suggesting the two zones are not directly connected. Holes MMD-25-184 and -186, which were drilled at the same declination but 20\u00b0 different azimuths, intersected a wide volcanic section characterized by strong late brecciation and local faulting after which the frequency of diorite intrusions are greatly reduced. MMD-25-187, which was drilled more steeply beneath MMD-25-186, intersected the zone of late brittle deformation notably deeper than the up-dip holes after intersecting a second one hundred and fifty meter wide sericite-chlorite altered diorite complex, returning an intercept of 25.3m of 0.92 g/t Au from 390m, including 3.15m of 5.15 g/t Au from 391.85m, suggesting a modest western dip to the structure.\nHole MMD-25-195 was drilled 135m northwest along the shore of Snodgrass Lake at a similar oblique angle. The hole collared into a dacite volcanic dominated sequence with swarms of weakly sheared, sericite-silica-hematite altered diorite, porphyritic diorite, and granodiorite dykes. The dykes are weakly mineralized with pyrite and narrow low-grade intercepts, such as 5.55m of 0.52 g/t Au from 213.45 and 6.45m of 0.51 g/t Au from 328m. The hole intersected a similar a wide volcanic section with strong late brecciation and local faulting after which the diorite intrusions become notably less frequent.\nFigure 3: Hole MMD-25-187: Brecciated and faulted contact of sheared altered diorite and intermediate volcanics with intercept of 25.3m of 0.92 g/t Au from 390m, including 3.15m of 5.15 g/t Au from 391.85m.\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8051/261723_4ef06999d4e57989_004full.jpg\nTable 1: Significant intercepts\n| HOLE ID | FROM | TO | LENGTH (m) | TRUE WIDTH (m) | CUT GRADE (g/t Au) | UNCUT GRADE (g/t Au) |\n| MMD-25-172 | 19.00 | 21.00 | 2.00 | 0.8 | 0.43 | 0.43 |\n| 143.00 | 147.00 | 4.00 | 1.8 | 0.51 | 0.51 | |\n| 157.00 | 169.00 | 12.00 | 5.6 | 0.90 | 0.90 | |\n| incl | 157.00 | 167.00 | 10.00 | 4.6 | 1.00 | 1.00 |\n| 198.00 | 200.80 | 2.80 | 1.3 | 0.42 | 0.42 | |\n| MMD-25-173 | 90.80 | 99.00 | 8.20 | 4.2 | 0.88 | 0.88 |\n| incl | 90.80 | 93.00 | 2.20 | 1.1 | 2.84 | 2.84 |\n| 124.00 | 130.00 | 6.00 | 3.2 | 0.57 | 0.57 | |\n| 160.00 | 174.00 | 14.00 | 7.6 | 0.35 | 0.35 | |\n| 191.00 | 197.00 | 6.00 | 3.3 | 0.57 | 0.57 | |\n| 203.00 | 206.00 | 3.00 | 1.7 | 0.53 | 0.53 | |\n| MMD-25-184 | 105.70 | 114.00 | 8.30 | 3.0 | 0.63 | 0.63 |\n| 119.25 | 122.00 | 2.75 | 1.0 | 3.08 | 3.08 | |\n| 166.00 | 170.00 | 4.00 | 1.5 | 1.00 | 1.00 | |\n| 176.50 | 180.90 | 4.40 | 1.6 | 0.70 | 0.70 | |\n| 189.00 | 198.95 | 9.95 | 3.7 | 0.53 | 0.53 | |\n| MMD-25-186 | 77.35 | 83.00 | 5.65 | 4.1 | 0.50 | 0.50 |\n| incl | 81.00 | 83.00 | 2.00 | 1.4 | 1.03 | 1.03 |\n| 125.00 | 130.50 | 5.50 | 4.0 | 0.38 | 0.38 | |\n| 139.00 | 142.00 | 3.00 | 2.2 | 0.46 | 0.46 | |\n| 154.00 | 174.00 | 20.00 | 14.6 | 0.92 | 0.92 | |\n| incl | 159.00 | 163.00 | 4.00 | 2.9 | 3.01 | 3.01 |\n| 246.00 | 248.00 | 2.00 | 1.5 | 0.35 | 0.35 | |\n| MMD-25-187 | 20.00 | 22.00 | 2.00 | 0.8 | 0.42 | 0.42 |\n| 168.00 | 171.00 | 3.00 | 1.4 | 0.75 | 0.75 | |\n| 208.00 | 211.40 | 3.40 | 1.6 | 0.42 | 0.42 | |\n| 227.00 | 234.00 | 7.00 | 3.3 | 0.90 | 0.90 | |\n| incl | 229.00 | 231.00 | 2.00 | 0.9 | 1.98 | 1.98 |\n| 279.85 | 306.20 | 26.35 | 12.8 | 0.59 | 0.59 | |\n| incl | 296.00 | 298.55 | 2.55 | 1.2 | 1.18 | 1.18 |\n| 316.00 | 322.30 | 6.30 | 3.1 | 0.43 | 0.43 | |\n| 329.90 | 332.00 | 2.10 | 1.0 | 0.95 | 0.95 | |\n| 342.00 | 348.00 | 6.00 | 3.0 | 0.63 | 0.63 | |\n| 390.00 | 415.30 | 25.30 | 12.7 | 0.92 | 0.92 | |\n| incl | 391.85 | 395.00 | 3.15 | 1.6 | 5.15 | 5.15 |\n| 423.00 | 429.00 | 6.00 | 3.0 | 0.38 | 0.38 | |\n| MMD-25-195 | 213.45 | 219.00 | 5.55 | 2.2 | 0.52 | 0.52 |\n| 302.40 | 314.90 | 12.50 | 5.2 | 0.31 | 0.31 | |\n| 328.00 | 334.45 | 6.45 | 2.7 | 0.51 | 0.51 | |\n| 392.00 | 399.00 | 7.00 | 2.9 | 0.31 | 0.31 | |\n| Intersections calculated above a 0.3 g/t Au cut off with a top cut of 30 g/t Au and a maximum internal waste interval of 5 metres.

All core has been sawed in half cut just off the core orientation line (bottom of hole) with the right half (looking down hole) of the core bagged and sent a third-party analytical laboratory. The left half of the core was returned to core boxes and is stored at Goldshore's Kashabowie core yard facility.\nAll samples were sent to ALS Geochemistry in Thunder Bay for preparation and analysis was performed in the ALS Vancouver analytical facility. ALS is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) for the Accreditation of Mineral Analysis Testing Laboratories and CAN-P-4E ISO/IEC 17025. Samples were analysed for gold via fire assay with an AA finish (\"Au-AA23\") and 48 pathfinder elements via ICP-MS after four-acid digestion (\"ME-MS61\"). Samples that assayed over 10 ppm Au were re-run via fire assay with a gravimetric finish (\"Au-GRA21\").\nIn addition to ALS quality assurance / quality control (\"QA/QC\") protocols, Goldshore has implemented a quality control program for all samples collected through the drilling program. The quality control program was designed by a qualified and independent third party, with a focus on the quality of analytical results for gold. Analytical results are received, imported to our secure on-line database and evaluated to meet our established guidelines to ensure that all sample batches pass industry best practice for analytical quality control. Certified reference materials are considered acceptable if values returned are within three standard deviations of the certified value reported by the manufacture of the material. In addition to the certified reference material, certified blank material is included in the sample stream to monitor contamination during sample preparation. Blank material results are assessed based on the returned gold result being less than ten times the quoted lower detection limit of the analytical method. The results of the on-going analytical quality control program are evaluated and reported to Goldshore by Orix Geoscience Inc.\nQualified Person\nPeter Flindell, PGeo, MAusIMM, MAIG, Vice-President, Exploration, of the Company, and a qualified person under National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\nMr. Flindell has verified the data disclosed. To verify the information related to the winter drill program at the Moss Gold Project, Mr. Flindell has visited the property several times; discussed and reviewed logging, sampling, bulk density, core cutting and sample shipping processes with responsible site staff; discussed and reviewed assay and QA/QC results with responsible personnel; and reviewed supporting documentation, including drill hole location and orientation and significant assay interval calculations. He has also overseen the Company's health and safety policies in the field to ensure full compliance, and consulted with the Project's host indigenous communities on the planning and implementation of the drill program, particularly with respect to its impact on the environment and the Company's remediation protocols.\nAmendment to NPI Agreement\nThe Company also announces that it has entered into an amending agreement to the net profit interest (\"NPI\") purchase agreement dated May 1, 2025 (the \"Agreement\"), previously disclosed in the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025. Pursuant to the amendment, the Company has set a limit on the number of shares issuable to the NPI vendor as part of the final consideration payable under the Agreement. Specifically, the total number of shares issuable on the fourth anniversary of the NPI Agreement will not exceed 1,176,470 common shares. All other terms and conditions of the Agreement remain unchanged.\nAbout Goldshore\nGoldshore is a growth-oriented gold company focused on delivering long-term shareholder and stakeholder value through the acquisition and advancement of primary gold assets in tier-one jurisdictions. It is led by the ex-global head of structural geology for the world's largest gold company and backed by one of Canada's pre-eminent private equity firms. The Company's current focus is the advanced stage 100% owned Moss Gold Project which is positioned in Ontario, Canada, with direct access from the Trans-Canada Highway, hydroelectric power near site, supportive local communities and skilled workforce. The Company has invested over $75 million of new capital and completed approximately 100,000 meters of drilling on the Moss Gold Project, which, in aggregate, has had over 255,000 meters of drilling. The 2024 updated NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate (\"MRE\") has expanded to 1.54 million ounces of Indicated gold resources at 1.23 g/t Au and 5.20 million ounces of Inferred gold resources at 1.11 g/t Au. The MRE only encompasses 3.6 kilometers of the 35+ kilometer mineralized trend, remains open at depth and along strike and is one of the few remaining major Canadian gold deposits positioned for development in this cycle.

  "argos_summary": "Goldshore Resources Inc. has announced significant assay results from its recent 20,000-meter winter drill program at the Moss Gold Project in Ontario, confirming the continuity of mineralized shear zones between the Main and Southwest Zones. Notable intercepts include 25.3 meters of 0.92 g/t Au and 3.15 meters of 5.15 g/t Au, indicating potential resource expansion. The drilling results suggest that previously untested areas may convert waste into mineralized resources, allowing for the integration of the two zones into a single proposed pit.",
