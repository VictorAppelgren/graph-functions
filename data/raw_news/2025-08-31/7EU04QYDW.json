  "content": "It comes after WhatsApp users were urged not to ignore a new alert that is designed to help them avoid scams earlier this month\n\nWHAT'S THAT! All iPhone users must update WhatsApp NOW after \u2018extremely sophisticated attack\u2019 is found\n\nIPHONE users are being warned to update WhatsApp immediately following a cyber attack.\n\nWhatsApp confirmed it had fixed the security glitch in its iOS and Mac apps on Friday.\n\nThe attack targeted dozens of Whatsapp users and was labelled an \u201cadvanced spyware campaign\u201d over a three-month duration, according to Donncha \u00d3 Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International\u2019s Security Lab, confirmed.\n\n\u00d3 Cearbhaill added that the bug was a \u201czero-click\u201d, meaning the victim could do nothing to avoid the indiscriminate targeting of their device.\n\nThe attacker would then \u201ccompromise your device and the data it contains, including messages.\u201d\n\nThe culprit is yet to be identified.\n\nGlobal cyber crime is on the rise with 73 per cent of adults in the US recently reporting they had experienced an online attack.\n\nEarlier this month, Whatsapp users were urged not to ignore a new alert that is designed to help them avoid scams.\n\nThe app will be adding an additional feature designed to protect users from group chat scams that could empty their bank accounts.\n\nThe new feature will affect anyone using the service who is invited to a group chat.\n\n\"When someone you might not know invites you to a group chat, the app will display a new 'safety overview' that appears before you can even see the messages,\" reported The Verge,\n\n\"The overview will include information about the group, including when it was created, who invited you, and how many members it has.\n\n\"It will also include a warning to watch out for scams, as well as information on how to limit who can invite you to group chats on WhatsApp.\n\n\"Once you\u2019ve viewed this page, you can choose to exit the group without even looking at the chat or view the chat for more information.\"\n\nThe feature builds upon the \u201ccontext card\u201d that WhatsApp rolled out last year, which shows key information about a group.\n\nWhile context cards will appear for all the groups you\u2019re invited to, WhatsApp\u2019s new safety overviews will appear as an \u201cinterstitial\u201d page when someone you might not recognise sends you an invite.\n\nThese overviews tie into WhatsApp\u2019s broader initiative to combat scams, which have become increasingly prevalent.\n\nA recent survey from the Pew Research Center stated 73 per cent of adults in the US say they\u2019ve experienced a scam or attack.\n\nIn June, WhatsApp worked with Meta and OpenAI to take down a criminal scam center in Cambodia, which used ChatGPT to create text messages promising work to people who joined a WhatsApp chat group.",
