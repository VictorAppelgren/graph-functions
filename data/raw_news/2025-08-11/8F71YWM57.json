  "content": "A Hawaii real estate investor and broker are suing Shohei Ohtani, claiming the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his agent got them fired from a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island\u2019s coveted Hapuna Coast that they brought him in to endorse.\n\n\u201cBalelo and Otani, who were brought into the venture solely for Otani\u2019s promotional and branding value, exploited their celebrity leverage to destabilize and ultimately dismantle Plaintiffs\u2019 role in the project \u2014 for no reason other than their own financial self-interest,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nThe suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment. Hayes, a developer with 40 years of experience, and Matsumoto, who was to be the listing agent for the houses averaging $17.3 million each, say that Ohtani and Balelo also tried to undermine their interests in a second, neighboring venture.\n\n\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cDefendants used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip Plaintiffs of the very project they conceived and built.\n\n\u201cDefendants must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity. Plaintiffs bring this suit to expose Defendants\u2019 misconduct and to ensure that the rules of contract, fair dealing, and accountability apply equally to all \u2014 celebrity or not.\u201d\n\nOhtani, 31, arrived from Japan in 2018 as perhaps the most heralded international star in baseball history, with an ability to both pitch and hit that made him doubly valuable to his team. A five-time All-Star and three-time Most Valuable Player, he signed a record 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers before last season and helped the team win the 2024 World Series.\n\nInvestment materials for The Vista at Mauna Kea Resort, which remained online on Monday night, listed Hayes and Matsumoto as part of the management team, along with Kingsbarn. It called Ohtani \u201cJapan\u2019s Babe Ruth\u201d and the \u201c1st Resident,\u201d giving him top billing ahead of the iconic Mauna Kea Resort, \u201cone of the most celebrated hotels in Hawaii,\u201d Hapuna Beach, \u201crated the #1 beach in America by Conde Nast Traveler\u201d and two golf courses \u2014 one designed by Arnold Palmer, the other by Robert Trent Jones Sr.\n\n\u201cOhtani will act as the celebrity spokesperson for the project and has committed to purchasing one of the 14 residences within the project,\u201d the brochure says. \u201cHe also intends to spend significant time at The Vista in the off-season and will construct a small hitting and pitching facility for preseason training.\u201d",
