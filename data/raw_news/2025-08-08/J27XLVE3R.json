      "text": "A lone gunman walked into a midtown Manhattan office building Monday afternoon and opened fire, killing four people\u2013including an NYPD officer\u2013before turning the gun on himself.\nSpeaking at a press conference later Monday, NYC Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch identified the shooter as Shane Tamura, a 27-year-old Las Vegas resident with a history of mental health issues.\nTisch said the gunman drove across state lines, with his vehicle having been seen as recently as 4:24 p.m. Monday in Columbia, New Jersey, not long before he unleashed a barrage of gunfire.\nTamura was armed with a rifle and first opened fire in the lobby of the building on 52nd Street and Park Avenue. He went to another floor and shot people there, sources told Fox News, before going up to the 33rd floor and shooting himself.\nACTIVE SHOOTER REPORT PROMPTS MASSIVE POLICE RESPONSE IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN BUSINESS DISTRICT\nTamura, who worked an overnight security job at the Horseshoe Las Vegas, did not show up for his last shift, Tisch said.\nThe building Tamura entered and opened fire, 345 Park Avenue, is a commercial building where tenants include the NFL, Rudin Management, KPMG and Blackstone.\nA suicide note found in Tamura's possession claimed he was suffering from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), possibly from playing high school football, according to Tisch.\nEarlier records show Tamura played football at Granada Hills Charter in Granada Hills, California, which is about 25 miles northwest of Los Angeles.\nSHOOTING AT NEVADA CASINO RESORT LEAVES MULTIPLE PEOPLE INJURED; SUSPECT IN CUSTODY\nTisch said the letter spoke to a possible motive, noting he blamed the NFL for his potential diagnosis and mentioned a 2013 Frontline documentary on CTE.\nTamura also asked authorities to \"study [his] brain\" in the final message.\nOfficers found a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack, and medication prescribed to Tamura in a car left at the scene. The vehicle was searched by the NYPD\u2019s bomb squad but found to be clear of any explosives.\nDocuments obtained by Fox News Digital indicate Tamura had a concealed carry permit that was issued on June 14, 2022, and was valid for five years. Tamura also carried a private investigator license and had a misdemeanor for trespassing not amounting to burglary in 2023.\nThe weapon used, an AR-15 style rifle, was assembled by Tamara using a lower receiver purchased by an associate, according to Tisch.\nAuthorities will be questioning the associate about the purchase.\n\"This is part of a larger effort to trace Mr. Tamara's steps from Las Vegas to New York City,\" Tisch said. \"Two groups of detectives are currently on route to Las Vegas to conduct interviews and execute a search warrant at Mr. Tamara's home. They'll also visit the gun store where he legally purchased a revolver on June 12th, using a Nevada concealed carry permit. At the same time, here in New York, we're executing search warrants on his car, and the two phones that he left at the scene. This information will give us a detailed picture of how and why this happened.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPolice said Tamura is believed to have acted alone and there is no longer a threat to the community."

      "text": "The NFL is recommending implementation of \"enhanced security measures\" at all team and league facilities, according to a memo obtained by ESPN on Friday, following the shooting last week at the midtown Manhattan building that houses NFL headquarters.\nThe memo, which was sent by the NFL's chief security officer and general counsel to all team owners and presidents following a meeting of the league's security and conduct committee, recommended three protocols: updated threat assessments to correctly mitigate and identify risks; armed law enforcement or security officers at team and league facilities whenever players or staff are present; and weapons screening in order to enter team and league facilities -- similar to what one would go through on a game day.\n\"The Committee recognizes that these changes will affect day-to-day operations and require an investment of time, coordination, and resources,\" the memo read. \"However, there is no higher priority than the safety and the sense of security of our players, coaches, staff, and everyone who works in and around our facilities.\"\nThis comes a little over a week after Shane Tamura killed four people and then himself at 345 Park Ave., a 44-story commercial office building that houses a number of high-profile tenants, including finance companies Blackstone and KPMG, along with the NFL league offices. An NFL employee was shot and is recovering.\nNFL offices have been closed since the July 28 shooting. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a memo last week that the league offices would remain closed at least through Aug. 8, with staff working remotely.\nInvestigators have said Tamura was attempting to reach NFL headquarters, but instead arrived on the 33rd floor, where he shot a woman before shooting himself in the chest with a rifle.\nThe memo said the league has already informed team and stadium security about the recommended changes. There will be a fuller review of the new protocols during the next league meeting, scheduled for Aug. 26.\n\"In moments like these, we are reminded that safety is not a background function,\" the memo read. \"It is foundational.\""

      "text": "In the United States, Mass shootings are widely classified as incidents in which a shooter kills at least four or more victims. The rise of mass shootings has been closely associated with calls for more regulations on firearms through the state and federal governments. In general, mass shootings are now classified in news media as events where a shooter kills a large group of individuals.\nSome mass shootings may involve gang violence, domestic violence, or terrorist acts. Several data centers and media outlets label the United States as the country with the most mass shootings annually in the world. However, mass shootings account for a small portion of the annual homicides, crimes, and deaths in the country. According to Mother Jones, between 1982 and 2022, the United States had on record 133 mass shootings, with most of those shootings occurring during the early 2000s and the present.\nThe deadliest mass shooting occurred on October 1, 2017, when 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd from his hotel room on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, killing 59 individuals and injuring 867 others. In the aftermath of the shooting, the US Justice Department under former President Donald Trump banned bump stocks; however, the action is still under review by the Supreme Court."
