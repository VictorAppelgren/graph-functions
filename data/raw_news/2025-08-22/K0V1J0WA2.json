  "description": "A mosaic reading \u201cPeace be with the elders\u201d highlighted the Christian society\u2019s intentional care of the oldest in their community.",
  "content": "Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn when you read this story:\n\u2022 Israeli archaeologists unearthed written evidence of what could be the world\u2019s oldest nursing home from the Byzantine Empire\u2019s Hippos.\n\u2022 The discovery came during an annual excavation at Hippos National Park at a site overlooking the Sea of Galilee.\n\u2022 A University of Haifa researcher calls the find proof that care of the elderly is not a modern construct.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire was taking special care of its elderly some 1,600 years ago, including operating what is possibly the world\u2019s oldest nursing home in the process. A team of researchers discovered possible evidence of the ancient precursor to assisted living thanks to excavations and Greek mosaic translations at Hippos National Park.\n\nSince 2000, researchers have excavated the hilltop overlooking the Sea of Galilee, and translating the mosaics located there has been part of the regular process. The latest translation sheds light on the way the community cared for the elderly in the late fourth or early fifth century A.D. According to an announcement from the University of Haifa, as reported by the Times of Israel, researchers discovered an ornate mosaic medallion with a Greek inscription translated as \u201cPeace be with the elders.\u201d The inscription was nearby what the team called one of the most impressive and colorful mosaic displays at the entire excavation site.\n\n\u201cThis is living proof that care and concern for the elderly are not just a modern idea but were part of social institutions and concepts as far back as about 1,600 years ago,\u201d said Michael Eisenberg, co-director of the excavation project for the University of Haifa\u2019s Zinman Institute of Archaeology.\n\nA team\u2014consisting of Eisenberg, Arleta Kowalewska of the Zinman Institute, and Gregot Staab of the University of Cologne\u2014 published a study in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik highlighting the discovery, noting that the text of the inscription and its location among the city\u2019s residential section show the probability that the mosaic offered the first physical proof of systematic care of the elderly.\n\n\u201cIt may provide one of the earliest material testimonies in the Holy Land, showing how the Christian community began assuming responsibilities for care that had previously been handled by family networks alone,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThis development likely reflects new Christian ways of life outside traditional family structures, such as monasticism.\u201d\n\nHippos served as a key religious, social, and economic hub during the Byzantine period, and the mosaic was located close to the intersection of two major residential streets and about 325 feet from the town\u2019s central plaza. Past excavations in the area had already revealed that Hippos was likely a largely Christian city with seven churches, a temple, a basilica, and theaters.\n\nThe mosaic was first discovered in 2023 and fully revealed by 2024. After that, it took the team time to analyze the inscription alongside the iconography that surrounded it. According to Israel National News, the researchers analyzed the inscription linguistically, stylistically, and contextually, while comparing it to historical texts from roughly the same time that alluded to caring for the elderly. The iconography surrounding the inscription\u2014Egyptian geese, cypress trees, fruits, and pots\u2014were also considered indicators the site was a home for the elderly.\n\nThe team deduced the medallion was placed at a prominent entry to an important institution. \u201cThis was a communal and spiritual institution integrated into the fabric of city life and reflecting the social values of the period,\u201d the study authors wrote. \u201cThe inscription addresses a specific public directly, which is a rare glimpse into the daily lives of older people in antiquity.\u201d",

      "text": "- Excavation in Pergamon, Turkey unearthed a \u201cMosaic House\u201d from the Roman period.\n- Archaeologists also discovered an intact, sealed roof tile, indicating that a king once owned the building.\n- Several burial sites were found around the excavation site, including a gravestone that read \u201cthe sweetest child of them all\u201d and a Byzantine period graveyard.\nPergamon (a city that is now part of modern day Turkey) is a cultural sponge that has been ruled by many different entities throughout its history. The city was first founded in the 3rd century B.C. as the capital of the Attalid dynasty. Then, it was passed to the Romans in 133 B.C., eventually becoming a thriving metropolis and the capital of the Roman Province of Asia. Later, during the Byzantine period, Pergamon devolved from a major Hellenistic and Roman center into just a mid-sized town, and eventually underwent one final (major) cultural adjustment when the Ottomans urbanized the region.\nA recent excavation in Pergamon unearthed a massive Roman period complex called the \u201cMosaic House\u201d that is a testament to the city\u2019s diverse history.\n\u201cOne of the most striking features of the Mosaic House is that it has mosaic floors,\u201d excavation director Yusuf Sezgin said in a translated statement. \u201cThis shows that the structure was a special and important place. We assess that the structure was built in the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D. It may have been abandoned by a great fire during the Arab raids in the 7th century.\u201d\nThe floors of the house were intricately decorated with colorful mosaics featuring floral and geometric patterns. Experts suggest that the structure was what is called a \u201cperistyle house,\u201d and was likely inhabited by important people of the time. According to Sezgin, the central courtyard and pool were especially striking.\nArchaeologists also found something else that suggests the building was important: a sealed roof tile from the Hellenistic period. The tile was inscribed with the word \u201cBasilique,\u201d indicating that the Mosaic House was owned by a king. The finding was especially notable because this is the first time a sealed tile was found completely intact.\nThe excavation also uncovered a gravestone in the pool of the courtyard. The stone depicts a child hunting rabbits with his dog and reads \u201cthe sweetest child of them all.\u201d Researchers believe the stone was made by the boy\u2019s mother, which sheds light on social practices of the time.\nThis wasn\u2019t the only burial site archaeologists discovered, however. They also found a graveyard from the Byzantine period. Further examination revealed more than one burial in each grave, which could suggest that living conditions were difficult at the time. Other Roman and Byzantine period artifacts were also found at the site, including kitchenware, war tools, jewelry, and coins.\nSo far, archaeologists have only excavated a fraction of the site. Appropriate artifacts found at the site will reportedly be displayed at the Pergamon museum. The project is just one part of the \u201cHeritage for the Future\u201d initiative in Turkey, which seeks to invest in archaeological exploration and contribute to the cultural heritage of the region.\nEmma Frederickson is a Pace University student by day, journalist by night.

      "text": "- While aging is often seen as a steady progression, a new study from Stanford University has found that there are, on average, spikes in the process around the ages of 44 and the early 60s due to molecular changes.\n- The study examined 108 participants who donated blood and other biological material over the course of years.\n- Scientists aren\u2019t sure if these moments of rapid aging are biological, behavioral, or a mixture of the two.\nWhile most people conceptualize aging as a steady decline, like a strong wind slowly weathering a stone, a new study from Stanford University\u2014inspired by the observation that risks for things like Alzheimer\u2019s diseases raise sharply with old age\u2014claims that humans actually age in a much less linear fashion than we believed.\nPublished this week in the journal Nature Aging, scientists examined thousands of different molecules\u2014specifically, the micro-universe of bacteria, fungi, and viruses that live within us and on our skin\u2014in subjects between the ages of 25 and 75. The team found that the numbers of these various molecules changed drastically around two specific ages on average.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just changing gradually over time; there are some really dramatic changes,\u201d Stanford University\u2019s Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics and the study\u2019s senior author, said in a press statement. \u201cIt turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s. And that\u2019s true no matter what class of molecules you look at.\u201d\nThe data set used in the study was derived from 108 individuals who donated blood and other biological material over the course of years. This allowed the researchers to track certain molecules\u2014such as RNA, proteins, and metabolites\u2014while also keep tabs on the make-up of each participant\u2019s microbiome. With 135,000 molecules being tracked for 108 participants several times over the course of years, the scientists ended up with around 250 billion distinct data points.\nBy pouring over this data, Snyder and his team concluded that 81 percent of molecules showed non-linear aging characteristics, meaning that they changed more rapidly at certain ages rather than steadily changing as the years pass by. By finding the largest clusters of changes averaged across the population, they found that people tend to undergo more rapid aging around the ages of 44 and the early 60s. However, the age periods weren\u2019t exactly the same. For example, an increase in molecules related to cardiovascular disease were found in both age ranges, but those impacting immune function were largely seen in the early 60s population.\nWhile the researchers admit that a shift in the early 60s trends with other data that shows how disease risk increases around this age, the data point related to the mid-40s came as a bit of surprise. While their first instinct was to consider whether this was caused by women experiencing perimenopause and menopause, the data shows no discernible difference between males and females in this age range.\n\u201cThis suggests that while menopause or perimenopause may contribute to the changes observed in women in their mid-40s, there are likely other, more significant factors influencing these changes in both men and women,\u201d Xiaotao Shen, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement. \u201cIdentifying and studying these factors should be a priority for future research.\u201d\nThe team hasn\u2019t discerned if these changes are purely biological, behavioral, or a mixture of both, but evidence points to at least some of these changes being influenced by external factors outside the body. For example, in the mid-40 cohort, the study notes changes in the number of molecules related to alcohol, caffeine, and lipid metabolism. Snyder hypothesizes that this could be driven in large part by the fact that the mid-40s is often viewed as a very stressful period of life, when many are raising families.\nWhatever the factors, this study highlights the importance of both focusing on health around these two age groups and putting healthy practices in place before you reach them. After all, nothing delays the reaper quite like diet, exercise, and good night\u2019s sleep.\nDarren lives in Portland, has a cat, and writes/edits about sci-fi and how our world works.

      "text": "- An elderly couple briefly escaped from a secure memory care unit at an assisted living facility in Tennessee.\n- The man, upon the couple returning safely to the facility, said he used his military experience with Morse code to memorize the code to an electronic keypad that locked the door to the unit.\n- Security experts categorize the couple\u2019s clever stunt as a \u201cside channel attack.\u201d\nIn a scene straight out of a spy movie, an elderly couple reportedly escaped from an assisted living facility using some cunning military expertise\u2014and an antiquated telecommunications method.\n\u27a1 Join Pop Mech Pro for exclusive access to the most unbelievable science, tech, and military stories.\nOn March 2, 2020, a resident of a secure memory care unit in Elmcroft of Lebanon, a Tennessee nursing facility, \u201celoped\u201d with his wife from the premises, according to a state report on the incident. (The Tennessean first reported the incident last month.) The man was admitted to Elmcroft with a diagnosis of dementia, while the woman was admitted with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nA stranger spotted the residents, who were safe, walking two blocks from Elmcroft about 30 minutes after they left and picked them up.\nAfter the couple returned to Elmcroft, the staff asked them how they pulled off their stunt, since employees must type a numeric code on a keypad to exit the locked memory care unit. The man said he had previously worked with Morse code in the military, and his ear was trained enough to figure out the code on the pad from the noise it made. He reportedly duplicated the numbers to unlock the door.\nThe staff has since revised the residents\u2019 care plans with more outdoors time to decrease the \u201cexit-seeking behaviors,\u201d the state report says. (Elmcroft didn\u2019t respond to an email from Popular Mechanics seeking comment.)\nThough the publicly available information doesn\u2019t indicate how the man used his specific knowledge of Morse code to break out of the facility, security experts say the hack fits more broadly into the category of \u201cside channel attacks,\u201d in which bad actors commit security breaches by gleaning information they observe from information transfers.\nIn a side channel attack, the person committing the breach may not see the \u201cmain channel\u201d\u2014the actual information being transferred\u2014but by using other side channels, they can figure out what that information is.\nTrained observers can deduce what people are typing on a computer keyboard just by listening to the keystrokes\u2014specifically, how closely the strokes follow each other, says Vyas Sekar, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, home to the CyLab Security and Privacy Institute. It\u2019s even possible to pick up what two people are saying in a conversation if they\u2019re talking near a bag of potato chips, based on the bag\u2019s vibrations, he says.\nThe man at Elmcroft likely listened to the sounds the facility\u2019s keypad made when the staff struck certain keys\u2014a major security risk on outmoded technology.\nKeypads that still make noise are a throwback to the era of dual-tone, multi-frequency (DTMF) technology. This tech, which made touch-tone phones possible, was once cutting-edge, but now it\u2019s mostly around for the sake of the tradition more than anything else, says Swarun Kumar, head of the Emerging Wireless Technology Lab at Carnegie Mellon.\nThink of an old phone as its own coding machine. You enter numbers, which the phone encodes and transfers to reach someone else, who is then alerted to the transfer and picks up the phone, establishing a connection. It\u2019s called in-band signaling, because the same line is used for the encoded communication and regular communication.\nRotary phones encoded their numbers through pulses. The number 1 was one pulse, 2 was two pulses, and so on, all the way up to 9, which had nine pulses. But that could be time-consuming, and in the 1960s, the tech was supplanted by DTMF, which gave each number on the keypad\u2014including the now-omnipresent star (*) and pound (#) keys \u2014its own unique tone. (Remember trying to play \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d on the phone keypad?)\nBut DTMF also brought its own security concerns. Proto-hackers called \u201cphreakers\u201d used devices called \u201cblue boxes\u201d to mess with the in-band signaling, making prank calls and routing phone calls around the world. (A pair of Steves from the Bay Area, Jobs and Wozniak, famously assembled such blue boxes from common electronic parts.\nAn early blue box of theirs sold at auction for more than $31,000.)\nWhile DTMF eventually faded out due to these concerns, there are still instances when touchpad sounds are necessary. Vision-impaired people need them, for example, and automated systems (\u201cPress 1 for\u2026\u201d) use the technology as well.\nThus, the sounds of the touchpad remain, becoming a standard for security systems because they\u2019re convenient. Keypad codes can be short and easy to remember, as well as easy to change, which is what Elmcroft was forced to do after the escape.\nAnd there\u2019s another advantage to keypads: they\u2019re decidedly low-tech. Unlike more secure biometric measures like facial recognition, keypads don\u2019t need a database of available information, and you can run them in settings without a wireless network.\nBut mostly, Kumar says, we\u2019ve used keypads for long enough that they endure because people are simply comfortable with them.\n\u201cDialing a phone today mostly doesn\u2019t use DTMF, but the mapping has remained,\u201d says Kumar. \u201cThere\u2019s sort of a legacy connection. Human beings intuitively remember this and sort of expect it.\u201d\nThe tech is so ingrained that even memory loss can\u2019t take it away.\n\ud83c\udfa5 Now Watch This:\nVince Guerrieri is a writer based in the Cleveland area.

      "text": "Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn when you read this story:\n- A famed Roman villa offers a surprising find of a flip-flop-like sandal shown in ancient mosaics.\n- Archaeologists continue to excavate what was once a luxurious residence in Sicily, Italy.\n- The discovery comes alongside one of the most famous mosaic-filled Roman villas in the world.\nDiscovering a fourth century A.D. mosaic of what appears to be modern-day flip-flops wasn\u2019t what anyone expected during the excavation of a famed Roman villa in Sicily, Italy. But then again, this is the same site that gave us the Bikini Girls mosaic.\nAs archaeologists working with the International Summer School ArchLabs, directed by Isabella Baldini, continued to excavate the Villa Romana del Casale in Piazza Armerina in Sicily, they uncovered a new mosaic with two sandals, distinctly reminiscent of modern-day flip-flops, something not seen before from that time.\n\u201cThese are not simple decorations, but a refined work created by a fourth century A.D. mosaic artisan, part of a larger mosaic scheme that decorated the southern thermal baths of the villa,\u201d according to a translated statement from the architectural office of the Sicilian Region.\nThe flip-flops find is more than just a quirky discovery; it reshapes our understanding of the footwear of the region. Modern-day flip-flops are often attributed to Japanese and Brazilian cultures\u2014Havaianas are the most well-known of the early brands in Brazil\u2014so having a flip-flop-looking depiction from the fourth century A.D. was a surprise.\nOf course, this is the same villa that offered up the Bikini Girls mosaic, a vivid artistic rendering of two young females engaged in what could be an Olympic-style athletic event wearing what equates to modern-day athletic shorts and tube tops. Maybe the folks in Sicily were simply centuries ahead of the western world\u2019s fashion trends.\nThe newly discovered flip-flop find was part of a larger mosaic in the southern section of the villa. The location, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is considered one of the most luxurious villas of the Roman Empire. UNESCO said it\u2019s especially noteworthy for the \u201crichness and quality of the mosaics which decorate almost every room,\u201d adding they are the \u201cfinest mosaics in situ anywhere in the Roman world.\u201d It all adds up to making the villa-turned-museum into a popular tourist attraction. Plans are underway to create a three-dimensional system to document the new finds while looking to create a more accessible avenue for both researchers and tourists.\nAlong with the flip-flop history, archaeologists discovered mosaic inscriptions and three columns, further cementing the artistic and architectural quality of a villa that has turned into a field laboratory. Part of what makes the location so unique is an ancient flood deposited a layer of mud across the villa, helping to preserve the site.\nEach archaeological campaign reinforces the idea that the villa was one of the most luxurious residential complexes in all the Roman Empire. While the original owner of the site is uncertain, experts believe it could be an imperial residence or the home of a Roman aristocrat, likely a governor of Rome.\nThe site features warehouses, public and private baths, reception halls, and intricately decorated dining rooms. With mosaics abounding, the artistry shows off everything from the expected bounty of agricultural scenes and unique animal imagery to a more erotic scene of lovers in an embrace, gods fishing, and, of course, the Bikini Girls. Now, we can add flip-flops to the list.\nTim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

      "text": "Haifa, Israel (August 18, 2025) - During archaeological excavations in Hippos (Sussita) National Park near the Sea of Galilee, University of Haifa researchers uncovered a Greek mosaic inscription bearing the unusual blessing, \u201cPeace be with the elders.\u201d\nThe inscription likely points to the existence of the oldest known nursing home discovered in an archaeological excavation to date.\nDated to the late fourth or, at the latest, early fifth century CE, the inscription was found within an ornate medallion adorned with colorful motifs, adjacent to one of the most impressive mosaics uncovered at the site. The research findings were recently published in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, a leading scientific journal in the field.\n\u201cThis is living proof that care and concern for the elderly are not just a modern idea, but were part of social institutions and concepts as far back as about 1,600 years ago,\u201d says Dr. Michael Eisenberg of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology and the Department of Archaeology at University of Haifa, and co-director of the excavation project.\nHippos was the central Christian city in the Sea of Galilee region during the Byzantine period, serving as a bishop\u2019s seat and hosting at least seven churches. Located on a hill overlooking the Sea of Galilee, the city has been the focus of systematic excavations, including extensive conservation efforts, since 2000. During the Byzantine period, Hippos functioned as a religious, social, and economic hub, with its main streets \u2014 the decumanus maximus (east-west) and a network of cardines (north-south) \u2014 serving as primary thoroughfares.\nThe mosaic was uncovered near the intersection of two major streets, approximately 100 meters from the central plaza, within one of the surrounding residential blocks. In the current study, Dr. Eisenberg, Dr. Arleta Kowalewska of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, and epigrapher Professor Gregor Staab of the University of Cologne examined whether the inscription indicates that the building served as a dedicated institute for the elderly, providing the earliest archaeological evidence for a nursing home dated no later than the early fifth century CE.\nDuring the 2023-2024 excavation seasons, the mosaic section was fully uncovered and underwent initial conservation by the expedition\u2019s conservator, Yana Qedem. The research team analyzed the Greek inscription linguistically, stylistically, and contextually, comparing it to historical sources from the Byzantine period that mention institutions for the elderly. They also examined iconographic depictions around the inscription, including Egyptian geese, cypress trees, fruits, and vessels. According to the researchers, the mosaic was installed near the building\u2019s entrance, positioned centrally and visibly to those entering.\nThe study\u2019s results indicate that the mosaic from Hippos is likely the first archaeological evidence of an institution designed specifically to serve the elderly during the Byzantine period. While such institutions are known from fifth- and sixth-century written sources, this is the first time physical evidence has been found directly linking to this type of activity.\nThe inscription\u2019s direct address to a specific age group \u2014 \u201cPeace be with the elders\u201d \u2014 combined with other features of the building and its urban context, suggests an organized social infrastructure designed to provide care and dignity to the Christian elderly.\n\u201cThis was a communal and spiritual institution integrated into the fabric of city life and reflecting the social values of the period. The inscription addresses a specific public directly, which is a rare glimpse into the daily lives of older people in antiquity. It may provide one of the earliest material testimonies in the Holy Land, showing how the Christian community began assuming responsibilities for care that had previously been handled by family networks alone. This development likely reflects new Christian ways of life outside traditional family structures, such as monasticism,\u201d the researchers conclude.\nThe mosaic from Hippos provides unique insight into social and religious life during the Byzantine period, particularly regarding the care of the elderly. Whereas most evidence of elderly care in antiquity comes from written sources, this mosaic offers clear, dated, and tangible proof of an institution serving seniors within the community. The finding sheds new light on the role of the elderly in Byzantine Christian society and highlights that this society established not only churches and religious buildings, but also institutions with daily social functions."

      "text": "Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn when you read this story:\n- Excavation work in Turkey\u2019s ancient Olympus revealed intricate mosaic patterns and inscriptions at a church entrance.\n- Known as Church No. 1, the mosaics contained within are dated to the fifth century.\n- Details from the inscriptions show who supported the church\u2019s construction.\nA mosaic adorning the entrance to a fifth-century church in Turkey\u2019s ancient city of Olympus is both just the tip of the iceberg. The mosaic itself extends from the entrance to inside the church, and it\u2019s just one of many ruins from the time period that archeologists have recently discovered, even after years of excavating the city.\nAs crews continued to excavate Olympus\u2019 ancient Kumluca district, they discovered the mosaic outside the early Christian church, known as Church No. 1. The entrance bears an inscription which translates to: \u201cOnly those on the right path may enter here,\u201d according to Turkey\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, as reported by T\u00fcrkiye Today.\n\u201cThis mosaic inscription is strategically placed at the very entrance of the church,\u201d Gokcen Kutulus Oztaskin, associate professor at Pamukkale University and excavation director on the project, said according to Anadolu Agency.\nThe mosaics throughout the church contain both geometric patterns and botanical motifs, stretching from the main entrance into multiple areas of the building. Additional inscriptions reveal the names of churchgoers who financially backed the construction of the church. \u201cThese finds confirm Olympus as one of the richest ancient cities in the Lycia region in terms of mosaic flooring,\u201d said Oztaskin, according to T\u00fcrkiye Today. \u201cOlympus continues to surprise us with its rich mosaic heritage.\u201d\nBeyond Church No. 1, the team discovered a residential structure atop a Roman-era burial ground. Experts believe that the site was repurposed during the Byzantine period to help house the region\u2019s growing populations, highlighting a change in urban planning. The residential building\u2014complete with a stone floor and also originally constructed in the fifth century\u2014appeared to have been reconstructed (in accordance with the original design) in the sixth century following a fire. It came complete with additional artifacts, including a large clay storage vessel known as a pithos, which are now housed in the Antalya Archaeology Museum.\nWhile crews have been on site since 2006 sifting through the city\u2019s Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine remains, plans still call for continued exploration of the city (including what could be a temple in the city center). Already, teams have discovered examples of the masonry technique known as bossage, which features protruding blocks in finely cut stone walls, which they took to mean that the structure was likely a key religious building.\nSoon, the team will excavate a bishop\u2019s palace and Church No. 3. Already known as one of the most mosaic-rich ancient regions in Turkish history, crews hope to find even more patterns and inscriptions that help tell the story of ancient Olympus.\nTim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

      "text": "Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn when you read this story:\n- Researchers recently found one of the many lost Holy Land cities in Jordan.\n- The team used maps and field surveys to identify the site.\n- Experts believe the lost city Tharais wasn\u2019t just an agricultural village\u2014it may have also been a spiritual hub.\nThe Madaba Mosaic Map is perhaps the most famous geographical masterpiece of the ancient Near East. Believed to have been built during Emperor Justinian\u2019s reign (527-565 A.D.), the tile art piece is the oldest surviving map of Jordan\u2019s Holy Lands. The map is located in Madaba, Jordan, and depicts a total of 157 sites\u2014many of which have yet to be found. One of the many lost cities is a place called Tharais, which dates all the way back to the Byzantine Empire. And researchers might have just found it.\nStarting in 2021, a research team led by Musallam R. al-Rawahneh\u2014an associate professor of archeology and ancient Near East studies at Mutah University\u2014began looking for Tharais. The field project lasted until 2024, and the team recently published their findings in the journal Gephyra.\nFinding a lost city is no easy task, and researchers had to use several different methods to track down Tharais. Maps, including both the Madaba Mosaic and more contemporary maps, gave researchers a starting baseline. They then conducted a field survey near a modern city near the southeastern edge of the Dead Sea called El-\u2019Iraq. There, researchers found remnants of mosaic floors, glassware, and various tools\u2014all compelling evidence that that was where Tharais once thrived.\nMost notably, the team uncovered features resembling a Byzantine basilica\u2014an oblong building with an open-air central room. Collaborative efforts with other institutions from Spain and France added further evidence to the scene when researchers discovered Greek and Latin funerary inscriptions. These inscriptions suggest the existence of a Christian community in the area, supporting the theologic identity of the site. A doorway consistent with architecture in Byzantine churches was also found, further affirming the site\u2019s supposed history. In short: all signs point toward religion.\n\u201cThe prominence of Tharais on the Madaba Map and the discovery of a basilica church structure suggest that it served not only as an agricultural village but also as a sacred site and commercial rest stop,\u201d al-Rawahneh said in a T\u00fcrkiye Today report.\nAnd according to the team, the presence of religion didn\u2019t weaken the city\u2019s economy. The presence of olive oil presses, windmills, and grape crushing equipment suggests that Tharais was economically self-sustaining.\nPerhaps the most convincing indications of the site\u2019s true identity are the parallels between the structures found by the researchers and the Madaba Mosaic Map. The arrangement of gates, ruins, and even towers closely match the map\u2019s depiction of the lost city. As for the future of Tharais, the team says that they wish to preserve the area from El-\u2019Iraq\u2019s rapid urbanization.\n\u201cOur aim is not just to uncover Tharais,\u201d Al-Rawahneh explained in the report, \u201cbut also to advocate for the protection of Jordan\u2019s rich cultural heritage.\u201d\nEmma Frederickson is a Pace University student by day, journalist by night.
