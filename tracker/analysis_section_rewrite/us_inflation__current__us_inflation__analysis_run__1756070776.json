      "feedback": "The draft captures the broad 0–3 week drivers but it understates the causal chain’s testability and underpins too much of the view on “tariffs” without clearly tying them to immediate price, spending, and policy paths; it also mixes macro, micro, and policy signals without explicit thresholds or invalidation points. Actionable edits: restructure into a crisp, testable causal map anchored in 0J41Q7KTX (tariff surge and Fed rate-cut signaling) and S15934PBQ (tariff pass-through in autos), augmented by U6HXAJR4J (central-bank independence) and 6OOEK8TUR (Vegas discretionary-spend stress) plus CDBMWIUTB (negative equity risk) where relevant; quantify exact levels and thresholds such as tariff share of imports (>10% per 0J41Q7KTX), the June trade deficit ($692.15 billion) and year-to-date export share (about 23.8% of trade per 0J41Q7KTX/S15934PBQ), and auto-price pass-through signals (Toyota-North America loss in NA earnings and U.S. pricing response cited in S15934PBQ); implement a clean 0–3 week scenario with a base case (near-term rate cut expectations intact, tariff shock contained) and defined catalysts (e.g., confirmation of tariff trajectory, CPI prints showing pass-through, and Fed signals) plus explicit invalidation triggers (tariffs rolled back or inflation surprises; Fed or ECB/Lagarde communications implying policy credibility erosion); replace broad conclusions with precise, source-backed statements like: tariffs rose to >10% of imports in three months; U.S. trade deficit hit a record through June; auto-brand depreciation/pass-through is pressuring new-car pricing; Lagarde emphasizes central-bank independence as credibility amid policy pressures; Vegas reflects discretionary-spend fatigue from higher costs; and the near-term policy path hinges on Powell’s signaling of a first cut next month (0J41Q7KTX, S15934PBQ, U6HXAJR4J, 6OOEK8TUR, CDBMWIUTB). Finally, tighten the monitoring checklist to four concrete items with numerical anchors: (1) tariff pass-through rate to consumer prices by next CPI release; (2) trajectory of the trade deficit and the 23–40% export-share range; (3) Fed/ECB communications and timing of any easing; (4) auto-finance health (negative equity incidence, loan-payoff dynamics). Ensure every claim is tied to an ID from SOURCE MATERIAL and explicitly note conflicts (e.g., officials denying tariff–price causation vs. data suggesting pass-through) with a clearly stated probability range.",
