  "title": "Miami files to dismiss Wisconsin lawsuit that alleges player tampering",
  "description": "The suit adds to the power struggle among schools, conferences and athletes about how binding new revenue sharing contracts are.",
  "content": "Nearly two months after the University of Wisconsin and its NIL collective filed a lawsuit alleging another Power 4 program had tampered with one of its former players, the University of Miami responded Friday by filing a motion to dismiss the case.\n\nWisconsin alleged Miami committed tortious interference regarding a binding revenue-sharing deal involving defensive back Xavier Lucas, who left Madison to return home to South Florida to play for the Hurricanes in January.\n\nWisconsin refused to put Lucas\u2019 name in the transfer portal after he told coaches shortly after returning home on winter break that he no longer wanted to attend the school. Instead of waiting for Wisconsin to comply, Lucas unenrolled from Wisconsin with the NCAA\u2019s blessing and began classes at Miami this past spring. Lucas has been taking part in preseason camp at Miami.\n\nMiami on Friday largely made its case that Wisconsin does not have jurisdiction to sue it in Wisconsin state circuit court. Part of Miami\u2019s motion to dismiss included unsworn testimony from Lucas denying contact with anyone from Miami before he attempted to leave Wisconsin.\n\nThe suit adds a layer to the power struggle among schools, conferences and athletes, as athletes sign NIL and revenue-sharing deals but then decide to enter the transfer portal. Miami, in its response, scoffed at the notion that Wisconsin\u2019s lawsuit was a \u201cwatershed\u201d moment in college sports.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs would have this Court believe that the very fate of college football hangs in the balance unless this Court acts. \u2026 The Court, it seems, is being asked not merely to resolve a dispute but to save the soul of college sports.\u201d\n\nIn its lawsuit, Wisconsin alleged that a Miami coach and alumnus visited Lucas at his South Florida home in December 2024, which Lucas has denied.\n\nLucas told The Athletic last month that he met with Miami coaches at his home in December 2023 \u2014 when he was still a high school senior at Plantation American Heritage School. Of his decision to transfer after one season at Wisconsin, he said:\n\n\u201cOnce I returned home (for Christmas break in 2024), I made the decision to enter the Transfer Portal and to transfer out of Wisconsin. I made that decision with input from family members and for personal reasons. I had no contact with anyone from or representing University of Miami regarding that decision, and no representative of University of Miami influenced that decision in any way.\n\n\u201cOnce I decided to attempt to transfer to the University of Miami, I initiated contact with University of Miami. No one from the University of Miami initiated contact with me. I am unaware of any coach or alumnus of University of Miami visiting the home of any of my relatives in December 2024 and do not believe that such an event ever occurred.\u201d\n\nWisconsin never named Lucas in its lawsuit and is seeking unspecified damages, as well as \u201ca declaration that Miami\u2019s conduct directed towards (Lucas) constituted tampering.\u201d",

      "text": "The University of Wisconsin and its name, image and likeness collective sued the University of Miami on Friday, alleging it interfered with what it said were binding NIL revenue-sharing contracts with former cornerback Xavier Lucas.\nThe lawsuit, filed Friday in Dane County (Wis.) Circuit Court, alleges Miami made \u201cimpermissible contacts with (Lucas) and his representatives this past December and January, leading to Lucas\u2019 withdrawal from Wisconsin and enrollment at Miami.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAs a result of Miami\u2019s actions, (Lucas) abruptly left UW-Madison\u2019s football program and enrolled at Miami, causing plaintiffs to suffer substantial pecuniary and reputational harm,\u201d the lawsuit states. The lawsuit, which Yahoo Sports first reported on, does not name Lucas but refers to him as \u201cStudent-Athlete A.\u201d\nThe suit adds another layer to the power struggle between schools, conferences and athletes, as athletes sign NIL deals but abandon those contracts to enter the transfer portal.\nThe House v. NCAA settlement, which will allow schools to directly compensate athletes through revenue sharing for the first time, was approved June 6. For months, schools have signed players to revenue-sharing deals contingent on the settlement\u2019s approval, with the intention it would eliminate tampering and slow player movement. The two-year revenue-share agreement Lucas signed shortly after the end of his freshman season in Madison was set to begin July 1, the first day schools can begin directly compensating athletes.\nIn January, Wisconsin released a statement accusing Miami of tampering, citing \u201ccredible information\u201d and threatening to pursue legal action. The Big Ten backed Wisconsin in a statement Friday.\n\u201cAs alleged, the University of Miami knowingly ignored contractual obligations and disregarded the principle of competitive equity that is fundamental to collegiate athletics,\u201d the Big Ten said. \u201cThe Big Ten Conference believes that the University of Miami\u2019s actions are irreconcilable with a sustainable college sports framework and is supportive of UW-Madison\u2019s efforts to preserve it.\u201d\nA Miami representative declined to comment on the report of Friday\u2019s lawsuit because the school had not been served papers yet.\nWisconsin is seeking unspecified damages in the lawsuit, as well as \u201ca declaration that Miami\u2019s conduct directed towards (Lucas) constituted tampering.\u201d\nLucas unenrolled from Wisconsin after school officials denied multiple requests from him and his attorney, Darren Heitner, to place his name in the transfer portal during the 20-day winter window (Dec. 9-28). Wisconsin maintains it told Lucas and his mother it would not put his name into the portal because of the two-year NIL contract he signed in December.\nAdvertisement\nIn the lawsuit filed Friday, Wisconsin alleges Miami\u2019s \u201cwrongful conduct\u201d led to Lucas\u2019 reaching out to a Wisconsin assistant coach on the evening of Dec. 17 \u2014 two days after returning home to South Florida for winter break \u2014 and asking to be placed in the transfer portal.\nA day later, Lucas \u201coffered a personal, family-related reason for wanting to enter the transfer portal\u201d in a text message. Three days later, however, a relative of Lucas\u2019 contacted a Wisconsin coach and provided information \u201cinconsistent with his family-related rationale for seeking to transfer,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nThe lawsuit alleges Lucas told his position coach before heading home for winter break that he had been contacted by other schools to enter the portal but \u201creaffirmed that he was committed to UW-Madison.\u201d\nWisconsin said it obtained information indicating that Miami had impermissible contact with Lucas and his representatives on multiple occasions in December and January, including sending a coach and \u201cprominent Miami alumnus\u201d to Lucas\u2019 South Florida home; and offering him a \u201cmore lucrative\u201d compensation package than the one Wisconsin was paying him.\nLucas enrolled in classes at Miami in January and participated in the Hurricanes\u2019 spring football practice in March and April. The sophomore, who had 18 tackles as a freshman, is expected to be one of Miami\u2019s best defensive players this fall.\nThe NCAA said in January that its rules \u201ccould not prevent a student-athlete from unenrolling from an institution, enrolling at a new institution and competing immediately.\u201d Wisconsin, though, was not punished for keeping Lucas\u2019 name out of the portal.\n\u201cEnforcement is shaky \u2014 schools can block portal entry, even if it is against NCAA rules, as seen with Lucas,\u201d Heitner told The Athletic earlier this month. \u201cWisconsin appears to have escaped punishment, at least for the time being, despite the clear rules violation.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWisconsin\u2019s lawsuit also alleges Miami\u2019s conduct toward Lucas was not an isolated event but part of a broader pattern of Miami\u2019s tampering with student-athletes.\n\u201cNow more than ever, it is imperative to protect the integrity and fundamental fairness of the game, including in connection with NIL contracts,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIndeed, student-athletes\u2019 newfound NIL rights will be rendered meaningless if third parties are allowed to induce student-athletes to abandon their contractual commitments.\u201d\n\u2014 The Athletic\u2019s Chris Vannini contributed to this report.\n(Photo: John Fisher / Getty Images)"
