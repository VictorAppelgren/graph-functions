  "title": "Trump Praises Texas For New Voting Maps: \u2018Huge Victory\u2019",
  "description": "Texas Republicans passed the map early on Saturday morning after a failed filibuster attempt from Democrats.",
  "content": "The Texas Senate voted 18-11 along party lines to approve the bill around 12:30 a.m. on Saturday morning, just days after the Texas House of Representatives approved the map on a similar 88-52 party line vote. The bill will now go to Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s desk to sign into law, and the governor has previously expressed support for the redistricting effort. \u201cThe One Big Beautiful Map has passed the Senate,\u201d Abbott said in a statement posted on social media, decrying the Democrats\u2019 \u201cpetty stunts\u201d and stating he would sign it into law. The redrawn districts could help Republicans pick up as many as five more House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. State Sen. Phil King, a Republican who sponsored the bill, has repeatedly defended the new map as a means to improve \u201cpolitical performance\u201d for his party, and claimed they had \u201cno reason to look at racial data.\u201d Democrats are promising to further challenge the new map, with Rep. Gene Wu, the chair of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, insisting they are \u201cnot done fighting\u201d and that the \u201cnext step is the courts.\u201d The quick passage comes only days after California\u2019s legislature passed a bill that would seek approval for a new congressional map from voters in November, the first state leading the Democrats\u2019 efforts to combat the Republicans\u2019 redistricting.\n\nTrump praised Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick for role in passing the legislation, calling him \u201ca terrific and powerful Lieutenant Governor for the Great State of Texas, a place I truly love\u201d and crediting him with helping him win the state in past presidential primaries and elections. \u201cDan\u2019s leadership was pivotal in the passage of the new, fair, and much improved, Congressional Map, that will give the wonderful people of Texas the tremendous opportunity to elect 5 new MAGA Republicans in the 2026 Midterm Elections \u2014 A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\n\nState Sen. Carol Alvarado, a Democrat representing a district in Houston, planned to filibuster the bill and speak for hours to delay its passage. Republicans used a procedural maneuver, however, to block the filibuster. State Sen. Charles Perry accused Alvarado of violating rules by sending a fundraising email before the filibuster, the Washington Post reported. Republicans then quickly called for a vote, passing the bill around 12:30 a.m. \u201cThey created an excuse to shut it down,\u201d Alvarado said in a video posted on social media. \u201cWhat we have seen in this redistricting process has been maneuvers and mechanisms to shut down people\u2019s voices,\u201d she continued.\n\nStates typically redraw their congressional districts every 10 years after the census. However, Texas Republicans, who control majorities in the state legislature and the governorship, made the rare choice to pursue mid-decade redistricting after pressure from President Donald Trump in an effort to help Republicans maintain their razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives. In response, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans quorum in the legislature, effectively freezing the redistricting efforts for weeks. The Democrats accrued fines and faced legal pressure from Republicans before returning last week.",

      "text": "Topline\nTexas Democratic lawmakers who have left the state to deny the Texas House a quorum face fines and potential charges for leaving and accepting money from outside groups to fund their out-of-state stays, but legal experts suggest those consequences may be on shaky legal ground.\nKey Facts\nMore than 50 Democratic lawmakers left Texas on Sunday in order to keep the state House from having enough votes to redraw the state\u2019s congressional map to more heavily favor Republicans, with GOP officials giving Democrats until Friday to return to the state or else face consequences.\nLawmakers are already facing a $500 per day fine for each day they stay away from the legislature, based on rules the Texas House passed after the last time Democrats denied the chamber a quorum, and Republican leaders have suggested they could try to charge Democrats with bribery for accepting donations from outside political groups to fund their fines and travel out of state.\nBut it\u2019s unclear if those consequences will stick: Texas law sets a high bar for proving bribery, stating an official can be prosecuted for bribery if they accepted a benefit \u201cpursuant to an express agreement to take or withhold a specific exercise\u201d of their office, but there has to be \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of the bribery agreement, and it has to be clear that the official\u2019s action would not have been taken if they didn\u2019t get the benefit from it.\nTexas-based political attorney Andrew Cates told Forbes that based on what\u2019s publicly available about the funding Democrats are receiving, there does not appear to be any wrongdoing: \u201cThe overall idea of a group supporting the Texas Democrats as a whole or individually, just supporting them with funds, is inherently not illegal.\u201d\nDemocrats could also have legal grounds to challenge the $500 daily fines, Cates said, arguing the House rule setting the fines is in \u201cdirect conflict\u201d with Texas\u2019 campaign finance law, because while the House says the fine can\u2019t be paid using lawmakers\u2019 campaign funds, Texas law allows fines and other penalties to be paid with campaign funds \u201cif it relates to your work as an elected official.\u201d\nSince the $500 daily fines are only a House rule and aren\u2019t enshrined in state law, Cates also speculated Republicans could have limited ability to punish Democrats if they refuse to pay, and would likely only be able to sanction them or remove money from their office budgets\u2014though he noted the issue has never been tested, so \u201cnobody really knows for sure.\u201d\nBig Number\nNearly $400,000. That\u2019s how much Texas Democrats could rack up in fines if they stay out of state until the Texas House\u2019s special session ends on August 19, Politico calculated, based on the $500 daily fines and necessity for at least 51 Democrats to be absent from the legislature in order to prevent a quorum. If Democrats stay out of state for even longer\u2014since even if the special session ends, Abbott could just call a new one when they return\u2014the fines could climb much higher. Staying out of state until December could cost Democrats more than $3.2 million, Politico reports. That\u2019s when the filing deadline is for candidates to register for the 2026 midterms, meaning congressional maps would have to be set by that point and no further redistricting could take place.\nWhat To Watch For\nWhether enough Democrats will stay away from the Texas House when it reconvenes on Friday to deny the chamber a quorum, meaning it will not be able to vote on redistricting. If that happens, Attorney General Ken Paxton has said he will move forward with lawsuits asking courts to expel Democratic lawmakers from the chamber, after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott separately filed litigation earlier this week asking the Texas Supreme Court to remove Democratic leader Gene Wu. Those lawsuits are similarly considered longshots to punish Democrats, given the Texas Supreme Court previously ruled in 2021 that lawmakers taking \u201cquorum breaks\u201d to stop votes is allowed in the Texas Constitution. House Republicans have also already issued warrants for Democrats\u2019 arrest for refusing to show up to vote, though the warrants are likely to have little impact as long as lawmakers stay in states controlled by Democratic governors who will not extradite them to Texas. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Thursday the FBI has agreed to help state law enforcement track down Democrats remaining out of state, though it is unclear on what legal grounds the agency has to do so as lawmakers do not face any federal charges.\nWho\u2019s Funding The Texas Democrats?\nPowered by People, a left-leaning political group led by former Texas congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, reportedly covered many of Democrats\u2019 initial costs of leaving the state, including air travel and lodging, though ABC News reports the organization is donating to the Texas House Democratic Caucus, rather than to any individual members or paying for individual expenses. Other groups reportedly include the Texas Justice Fund, which is affiliated with the Lone Star Project, and Texas Majority PAC, which is backed by billionaire megadonor George Soros.Paxton has announced investigations into Powered by People and Texas Majority PAC over whether they broke any laws by funding Democrats\u2019 out-of-state stays, though there\u2019s so far no sign of any wrongdoing by either group. Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin also confirmed to Forbes the national group is aiding Texas lawmakers through its organizing and data teams.\nSurprising Fact\nPaxton was himself tried for impeachment in 2023 on charges including bribery, after being accused of accepting bribes from donor and friend Nate Paul. The Republican-controlled Texas Senate ultimately acquitted him of the charges. Paxton also separately settled state criminal charges for alleged securities fraud.\nKey Background\nTexas Democrats left the state in order to block plans by their GOP colleagues to add an additional five congressional seats that would favor Republicans. Their decision to leave Texas repeats a tactic that the Texas Democrats have used multiple times in order to stymie the GOP-controlled legislature, most recently in 2021. Republicans have started eyeing redistricting\u2014which typically only takes place every 10 years\u2014ahead of the 2026 midterms, given historical patterns suggesting Democrats, as the minority party, are likely to pick up seats if the map stays the same. In addition to Texas, officials in GOP-controlled states including Indiana, Florida and Missouri have also floated redrawing their congressional maps. That\u2019s prompted some Democratic-led states to consider redistricting in order to balance out any gains Republicans make with House seats, with New York, Illinois and California among those where officials have suggested they could update their maps.\nFurther Reading"

      "text": "Topline\nAn unusual plan to re-draw congressional lines in Texas that could earn Republicans five more House seats in next year's midterms was unveiled Wednesday, and the state\u2019s Democrats are reportedly considering a stonewalling move that could cost them up to $1 million per month in fines.\nKey Facts\nTexas GOP legislators are working to try to help Republicans cling to the narrow majority they currently have in the U.S. House by re-drawing lines in the state years before they would normally redistrict at the end of the decade.\nLawmakers have been working on the plan for months\u2014since President Donald Trump\u2019s team called on them to take action and flip Democratic seats through redrawing district lines\u2014but the draft map unveiled Wednesday is the first time the plan has been publicly revealed.\nThe map aims to flip seats currently held by Democrats near the Austin, Dallas and Houston metro areas, but the maps are likely to change before a final draft is approved.\nThe current proposal targets the seats of Democratic Reps. Greg Casar, Lloyd Doggett, Julie Johnson, Marc Veasey and Al Green are the most directly, and the changes would also bleed over into the districts of other congress members, like outspoken Trump critic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, but not dramatically change their constituency.\nUnder the proposed new lines, Trump would have won 30 of Texas' 38 House seats in the 2024 election, according to the Texas Tribune (he did win 27\u2014all 25 of the seats currently held by Republicans and two won by Democratic Reps. Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez).\nTo block the proposed redistricting, Texas Democrats have considered fleeing the state and forcing a quorum break that would see them each incur a fine of $500 per day, or a combined $1 million per month\u2014a cost the Tribune says deep-pocketed donors have expressed willingness to pay if needed.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here: joinsubtext.com/forbes.\nKey Background\nThe current House of Representatives has 219 Republican members and 212 Democratic members (there are four vacancies\u2014three Democrats have died this year and one Republican resigned). Traditionally, parties in power lose seats in midterm elections and it's possible Democrats could win the majority next fall, which has led the White House to push Texas Republicans to redistrict and secure more seats. The current plan for the new lines would give some Democrats in urban centers even bigger margins than they currently have, and disperse Republican voters into several districts currently represented by Democrats, making them more competitive. The maps don't significantly change the political make up of any Republican incumbents\u2019 districts, according to the Tribune, but they do change demographics. The changes would create two more majority white districts (there are currently 22), add one majority Hispanic district (currently seven) and create two majority Black districts, where there currently are none.\nChief Critic\nDemocrats in the Texas legislature are willing to take drastic measures to stop the redistricting, which Doggett has called a \u201ccrooked scheme\u201d by Trump. Democrats told the Tribune they're considering fleeing the state so Republicans don't have the quorum they need to vote on the new maps, but it comes at a hefty price and at the risk of arrest. Crockett has said she doesn't think the monetary penalties are enforceable, but even if they are, unnamed sources said they'd likely be covered by fundraisers. If they do manage to force a quorum break, Crockett said the time would be used to educate the public about the new maps and allow legal challenges to proceed.\nTangent\nIn California, where 43 of the 52 House seats are held by Democrats, Gov. Gavin Newsom has threatened to respond in kind. He has proposed re-drawing districts in his state in a way that could give Democrats a boost between five and seven seats, but his plan would be more complicated. In Texas, the legislature controls redistricting, full stop. But in California, it\u2019s an independent commission that draws the state\u2019s political maps and they do so once per decade, following the census. For Newsom's plan to go forward, voters would have to vote on a ballot measure in an upcoming election to either approve new maps or to permanently change the way the state does redistricting. Even if that happened, it\u2019s unlikely to be done before the midterms next year. Ohio and Missouri, which could render four more Republican seats, combined, are also looking at redistricting. Florida and New Hampshire have Republican governors who could possibly be swayed to re-draw congressional lines.\nFurther Reading\nTexas House Republicans unveil new congressional map that looks to pick up five GOP seats (Texas Tribune)\nTexas Democrats are fundraising to potentially leave the state to block GOP-backed redistricting (Texas Tribune)\nHow Republicans are trying to redistrict their way to a majority (Vox)\nWhite House Pushes Texas to Redistrict, Hoping to Blunt Democratic Gains (New York Times)"

The Texas House passed the map Wednesday evening, following delays after a cohort of state House Democrats fled Texas to block the chamber from having a quorum, effectively keeping it from voting on the map. The Texas Democrats returned earlier this week after California Democrats indicated they would approve a map to offset the GOP\u2019s gains.\nWhat To Watch For\nWhether additional states join in the mid-decade redistricting push. Lawmakers in red states like Ohio, Florida and Missouri have indicated they\u2019re interested in reviewing maps, while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore have said they are looking at options in those blue states.
