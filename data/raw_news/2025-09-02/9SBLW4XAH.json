Listen to this report in the market open podcast (available on Apple and Spotify)\n\u2022 US stocks declined on Tuesday as participants returned from the long Labor Day weekend and were hit by the broader risk aversion amid numerous factors including the US appeals court ruling on Trump tariffs as illegal, geopolitical uncertainty, and the US Commerce Department revoking waivers for Intel/Samsung/SK Hynix/TSMC. Meanwhile, Treasuries saw broad-based selling alongside global fixed income as the US curve bear steepened on trade rulings, global fiscal/political woes, and supply.\n\u2022 SPX -0.69% at 6,416, NDX -0.79% at 23,231, DJI -0.55% at 45,296, RUT -0.60% at 2,352.\n\u2022 US President Trump said on the tariff ruling that they're going to the Supreme Court Wednesday and need an early decision.\n\u2022 US Ambassador to NATO said US President Trump has not put tariffs on China because those negotiations are ongoing and the war in Ukraine is certainly part of that discussion, while he added that Trump \u201ccertainly knows that he has those cards to play\u201d and may impose tariffs if he deems them necessary. He also stated that while tariffs on India \u201chave changed their calculation\u201d about purchases of Russian energy, the US \u201cprobably not going to foster a closer relationship in trade with India\".\n\u2022 Japanese Trade Minister Akazawa is to visit the US this week, according to TV Tokyo.\n\u2022 US President Trump said they need a very serious rate cut, while it was also reported that the ruling on Trump's Fed firing is not expected until after September 4th.\n\u2022 US Treasury Secretary Bessent is planning to start a blitz of interviews on Friday in search of a candidate to be the next Fed Chair, according to WSJ.\n\u2022 US President Trump said they're going to send the National Guard to Chicago.\n\u2022 APAC stocks were predominantly lower following the weak handover from Wall St, where the major indices declined on return from the extended weekend as sentiment was dampened by global debt concerns amid a higher yield environment.\n\u2022 ASX 200 retreated with the declines led by underperformance in tech, utilities and financials, while slightly stronger-than-expected Australian GDP data failed to inspire.\n\u2022 Nikkei 225 was pressured amid a higher global yield environment but with the downside initially cushioned by recent currency weakness.\n\u2022 Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp gradually fell despite the better-than-expected RatingDog Services PMI data from China and with the attention in Beijing on the military parade, which was attended by Russian President Putin and North Korean Leader Kim, while US President Trump reacted in a post and accused them of conspiring against the US.\n\u2022 US equity futures (ES +0.1%, NQ +0.2%) traded mixed after recent losses on Wall St and with Alphabet shares supported after-hours following a federal judge ruling that the Co. would not be required to sell its Chrome browser but must share data with competitors.\n\u2022 European equity futures indicate a higher cash market open with Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.3% after the cash market closed with losses of 1.4% on Tuesday.\n\u2022 DXY is holding onto yesterday's gains, which were seen amid a risk-off tone that was fuelled by a global rise in bond yields amid concerns over increased debt issuances, and which outweighed the data releases. Nonetheless, participants look ahead to incoming releases including JOLTS data scheduled later, which kicks off a flurry of employment metrics culminating with Friday's NFP report, while it was also reported that Treasury Secretary Bessent is planning to start a blitz of interviews on Friday for the Fed Chair role.\n\u2022 EUR/USD languished firmly beneath the 1.1700 handle after it recently gave up ground to the buck, while the mostly hotter-than-expected EU inflation data and somewhat mixed comments from ECB officials did little to inspire the single currency.\n\u2022 GBP/USD remained subdued at a sub-1.3400 territory following yesterday's underperformance as debt concerns were triggered alongside a rise in the UK 30yr yield to a 27-year high.\n\u2022 USD/JPY continued its upward momentum and edged closer to the 149.00 level before running into some resistance.\n\u2022 Antipodeans were contained with only brief support seen following the slightly better-than-expected Australian GDP data.\n\u2022 10yr UST futures lacked direction after bear steepening yesterday following trade rulings, global fiscal woes and supply.\n\u2022 Bund futures languished beneath the 129.00 level after retreating alongside a sell-off in global bond markets as yields climbed and with a EUR 5bln Bund issuance scheduled for today.\n\u2022 10yr JGB futures tracked recent downside in global peers with demand not helped by a lack of tier-1 data from Japan.\n\u2022 Crude futures lacked conviction after whipsawing yesterday amid a stronger dollar and with the US imposing sanctions targeting Iranian oil, while participants will have to wait an additional day for this week's inventory data owing to the recent Labor Day holiday.\n\u2022 Israeli PM Netanyahu ordered not to proceed with the huge gas agreement between Leviathan and Egypt without his consent, according to Al Jazeera citing Israel's Hayom.\n\u2022 Spot gold was rangebound but printed fresh record highs above the USD 3,500/oz level despite recent dollar strength.\n\u2022 World Gold Council said to launch a digital form of gold, according to FT.\n\u2022 Copper futures pulled back from a 1-month high amid the mostly subdued overnight risk appetite including in its largest buyer, China.\n\u2022 Bitcoin traded indecisively with price action oscillating around the USD 111k level.\n\u2022 BoJ Governor Ueda said he exchanged views with PM Ishiba on the economy and financial markets, while they had discussions on various topics about the economy and talked about forex. Ueda said it was a regular meeting to exchange views on the economy and financial markets and there is no change to their stance of raising interest rates if the economy and prices move in line with the forecast.\n\u2022 Japanese ruling party LDP's Aso is set to call for an early party election, according to Mainichi.\n\u2022 Israeli PM Netanyahu said they have destroyed the Iranian axis in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, while he said in a message to Israeli soldiers that the war in Gaza has reached a decisive stage, according to Al Arabiya and Sky News Arabia.\n\u2022 US President Trump commented about Russian President Putin, in which he stated that he is \"very disappointed in him\" and will be doing something to help people live regarding the war in Ukraine, according to the Scott Jennings Radio Show.\n\u2022 Ukrainian President Zelensky said Russia is engaged in a new troop buildup in certain sectors and continues to launch strikes on Ukraine.\n\u2022 Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is a part of Ukraine and it will never agree to legalise its Russian occupation, while it added the only way to guarantee safety at the plant is the full and immediate withdrawal of Russian troops.\n\u2022 Ukraine's military said Russia launched an air attack on Kyiv and it was also reported that all of Ukraine was under air raid alerts following Ukrainian air force warnings of Russian missile and drone attacks, while Poland scrambled aircraft to ensure airspace security after Russia launched strikes on Ukraine.\n\u2022 Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said Moscow expects Russia-Ukraine talks to continue and he stated that the heads of delegations are in direct contact. Lavrov said Russia expects statements from its partners in support of dialogue with the US on Ukraine, while he added that for a lasting peace in Ukraine, territorial realities must be recognised. Lavrov also said that India did not bow to US demands to stop purchasing resources from Russia, which Moscow appreciates, as well as noted the US is making active diplomatic efforts on Ukraine and that Putin\u2013Trump contacts are substantive. Furthermore, he said a new system of security guarantees for Russia and Ukraine must be formed and that Moscow calls for ensuring a neutral, non-bloc and non-nuclear status of Ukraine, according to RIA and TASS.\n\u2022 Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Kyiv and its allies reject the possibility of compromises on settlement of conflicts, according to RIA.\n\u2022 Russia and the US are in the process of coordinating on dates and the venue of the next round of talks, according to RIA.\n\u2022 Russia and India discussed the possibility of expanding S-400 supplies, according to TASS.\n\u2022 Chinese President Xi said at the military parade in Beijing that China is a great nation that fears no violence and is self-reliant and strong, while he added the Chinese people stand on the right side of history and are committed to peace. Xi also said the world is facing a choice of peace or war now and he called on nations to prevent historical tragedies from recurring.\n\u2022 US President Trump posted on Truth Social \"The big question to be answered is whether or not President Xi of China will mention the massive amount of support and \u201cblood\u201d that The United States of America gave to China in order to help it to secure its FREEDOM from a very unfriendly foreign invader. Many Americans died in China\u2019s quest for Victory and Glory. I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice! May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP\"\n\u2022 US President Trump said he is not concerned about the axis forming against the US, including among China and Russia. Furthermore, Trump said regarding Chinese President Xi hosting Russian President Putin and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim, in which he stated that this is not a challenge and \"China needs us more than we need them\", as well as stated that he may take a different stance on Putin if nothing comes.\n\u2022 UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pencilled in November 26 for the date of the Budget, according to Huffington Post.\n\u2022 UK is in advanced talks to build warships for Denmark and Sweden, according to FT.\n\u2022 French Finance Minister Lombard urged for a compromise on the 2026 Budget and said the deficit reduction plan will inevitably be less ambitious if the government falls, while he is confident France will accomplish its GDP growth forecast of 0.6% this year and said they are on track to reduce the deficit from 5.8% in 2024 to 5.4% in 2025, according to FT.\n\u2022 ECB's Muller said it makes sense to keep rates on hold for a while and watch the economy, while he added that looking at recent data, \u201cwe could still assume that we are more or less on the path that was already there during the last round of projections for the ECB\". Furthermore, Muller said \u201cIn light of all of this turmoil that we have seen in the recent past, starting with the trade policy in the US, also the impact of war in Ukraine that we have now for a number of years, the economy has held up quite well in Europe\u201d.",

Click here for the full report.\nMARKET WRAP\nUS indices were in the red on Tuesday, as participants returned from the long Labor Day weekend, but were hit by the broader risk aversion amid numerous factors. In particular, but not limited to, the US appeals court ruling on Trump tariffs as illegal, geopolitical uncertainty, and the US Commerce Department revoking waivers for Intel/Samsung/SK Hynix/TSMC. Meanwhile, Treasuries saw broad-based selling alongside global fixed income as the US curve bear steepened on trade rulings, global fiscal/political woes, and supply. The Dollar saw strength amid the aforementioned risk-off, while the EUR, JPY, and GBP lagged. The latter was hit as focus resides on the UK's fiscal outlook, which saw the UK 30yr yield hit a 27-year high, while the Yen was hit on yield differentials. Gold hit an all-time high. In the energy space, benchmarks were choppy but ultimately gained due to the wider geopolitical footing and the US imposing sanctions targeting Iranian oil, as opposed to the firmer Dollar and risk-off sentiment. There were no Fed speakers, while ISM Manufacturing largely supported the notion of rate cuts, but did little to move the dial amid the previously mentioned themes. Recapping the data, the headline and employment rose, but by less than expected, while prices paid unexpectedly declined. Construction spending declined 0.1%, as expected.\nUS\nISM MFG: ISM Manufacturing PMI for August rose to 48.7 from 48.0, but shy of the expected 49.0, and the same was seen with the Employment index as it printed 43.8, against the expected 44.5 and prior 43.4. Prices paid fell to 63.7 from 64.8, and below the bottom end of the forecast range. New orders lifted back into expansionary territory at 51.4 from 47.1. Within the release, it notes that the past relationship between the Manufacturing PMI and the overall economy indicates that the August reading corresponds to a change of plus 1.8% in real GDP on an annualised basis. Within the survey respondents, one noted that \u201ctariffs continue to wreak havoc on planning/scheduling activities\u2026 due to unexpected tariff announcements (such as 50% duties on imports from India), materials/supplies are now rising in price\u2026 Plans to bring production back into the US are impacted by higher material costs, making it more difficult to justify the return.\u201d Oxford Economics write that tariffs are still putting upward pressure on input costs, and will likely intensify over the next couple of months. Therefore, OxEco say it won\u2019t be surprising if the dip in prices paid is temporary, and it won\u2019t have any bearing on whether or not the Fed opts to cut interest rates in September \u2013 that burden falls on the August employment and consumer price reports, Oxford adds.\nCONSTRUCTION SPENDING: US Construction spending fell 0.1% as expected in July, modestly extending the 0.4% decline seen in June. The July reading brings the YTD value to 1.232tln, +2.2% Y/Y. Private construction spending fell 0.2%, private residential construction rose 0.1%, with the private non-residential component 0.5% lower M/M. Concerning public construction spending, that was 0.3% higher M/M, with educational construction and highway construction both down 0.1% M/M. The data has led Oxford Economics to downwardly revise its near-term forecast for business investment in structures lower. \"Fiscal policy won't provide meaningful relief to this GDP component until next year\".\nFIXED INCOME\nT-NOTE FUTURES (Z5) SETTLED 11+ TICKS LOWER AT 112-04+\nT-Notes bear steepen on trade rulings, global fiscal/political woes and supply. At settlement, 2-year +3.7bps at 3.660%, 3-year +4.5bps at 3.629%, 5-year +4.7bps at 3.746%, 7-year +5.3bps at 3.982%, 10-year +5.7bps at 4.283%, 20-year +6.0bps at 4.927%, 30-year +5.9bps at 4.977%.\nINFLATION BREAKEVENS: 1-year BEI +1.3bps at 3.316%, 3-year BEI +0.0bps at 2.818%, 5-year BEI -0.4bps at 2.519%, 10-year BEI +0.5bps at 2.399%, 30-year BEI +1.5bps at 2.298%.\nTHE DAY: T-Notes bear steepened tracking global fixed income moves with UK yields rallying on ongoing debt concerns, and French yields rising on political instability. Also driving the global move was a plethora of supply. Bloomberg reported that Bond sales in Europe hit a record EUR 49.6bln (USD 57.7bln) in a single day, thanks to issuance from the UK and Italy, in what it described as kickstarting a September rush for funding after a summer lull. Elsewhere, in the US, Merck and Cigna were in the market with corporate issuance, with Merck noting some of the proceeds may be used in relation to the Verona Pharma acquisition in July, worth USD 10bln. Even before the supply, Treasuries were weighed on amid the return of players from the Labor Day holiday in response to the US Appeals court deeming that US President Trump's tariffs are illegal, albeit Trump is appealing the ruling to the US Supreme Court, and the tariffs will remain in place for now. Raymond James, in a note, suggested that if this ruling is upheld, refunds of existing tariffs are on the table, which could cause a surge in Treasury issuance and yields due to the loss of revenue. Meanwhile, the US ISM Manufacturing PMI report remained in contractionary territory and slightly missed expectations, while prices paid fell beneath all analyst forecasts, and employment saw little change but still missed forecasts. Construction spending declined 0.1%, in line with forecasts. In wake of the data, the Atlanta Fed Q3 25 GDPNow estimate was lowered to 3.0% from 3.5%. Attention now turns to the August NFP report on Friday to further shape Fed rate cut expectations, where a hot report might derail some September rate cut bets, but another slowdown would likely see markets fully cement a 25bps cut. Fed speak will also be key given Friday is the last day before the FOMC blackout period, so any commentary from officials post-NFP will be closely watched, albeit no speeches are scheduled yet. There is also the ongoing Trump v Fed dispute, with an update still awaited on Fed Governor Cook's future. Note, the US Senate will hold a hearing on September 4th (Thursday) to consider CEA Chair Miran for the Fed Board of Governors, replacing Governor Kugler as Trump looks to kit out the Fed with dovish Republicans.\nSUPPLY\nBills:\n- US sold USD 82bln of 3-month bills at a high rate of 4.045%, B/C 2.96x\n- US sold USD 73bln of 6-month bills at a high rate of 3.880%, B/C 2.70x\n- US sold USD 85bln of 6-wk bills at a high rate of 4.190%, B/C 2.64x\n- US sold USD 50bln of 52-wk bills at a high rate of 3.660%, B/C 3.82x\n- US to sell USD 65bln in 17-week bills on September 3rd\n- US to sell USD 85bln of 8-week bills and USD 100bln of 4-week bills on September 4th\nSTIRS/OPERATIONS\n- Market Implied Fed Rate Cut Pricing: September 23bps (prev. 22bps), Oct 36bps (prev. 35bps), Dec 55bps (prev. 55bps).\n- NY Fed RRP op demand at USD 21bln (prev. 78bln) across 17 counterparties (prev. 26).\n- EFFR at 4.33% (prev. 4.33%), volumes at USD 115bln (prev. 115bln) on August 29th\n- SOFR at 4.34% (prev. 4.36%), volumes at USD 2.870tln (prev. 2.889tln) on August 29th\nCRUDE\nWTI (V5) SETTLED USD 1.58 HIGHER AT 65.59/BBL; BRENT (X5) SETTLED USD 0.99 HIGHER AT USD 69.14/BBL\nThe crude complex was choppy, but saw gains amid the wider geopolitical footing and US imposing sanctions targeting Iranian oil, as opposed to the firmer Dollar and broader risk-off sentiment. Regarding price action on Tuesday, WTI and Brent hit peaks of USD 66.03/bbl and 69.53 in the European morning, likely on the wider geopolitical picture. On that, concerns about supply disruptions rose amid an escalation of the conflict between Russia/Ukraine, whereby Reuters reported Ukraine's attacks force Russia to shut 17% of oil-processing capacity. On top of this, there is speculation that OPEC+ will not raise output at a meeting on Sunday. After hitting the peaks, benchmarks sold off and trimmed a large chunk of the gains and eventually succumbed to the wider risk sentiment, as opposed to something headline-driven. However, and highlighting the two-way day in the energy space, WTI and Brent rose back higher to ~USD 0.50/bbl off the earlier peaks with many citing the US Treasury issuing new Iran-related sanctions; US imposed sanctions on an Iraqi tycoon accused of helping Iran evade restrictions on its oil exports, the latest in a series of moves targeting Tehran\u2019s energy trade. Note, private inventory data is delayed a day due to Labor Day on Monday, and there is a disparity between WTI and Brent settlement due to no WTI settlement on Monday due to the aforementioned US holiday.\nEQUITIES\nCLOSES: SPX -0.69% at 6,416, NDX -0.79% at 23,231, DJI -0.55%, RUT -0.60%.\nSECTORS: Real Estate -1.74%, Industrials -1.06%, Technology -0.97%, Consumer Discretionary -0.95%, Financials -0.71%, Materials -0.59%, Communication Services -0.42%, Utilities -0.37%, Consumer Staples +0.07%, Health +0.07%, Energy +0.24%.\nEUROPEAN CLOSES: Euro Stoxx 50 -1.41% at 5,291, Dax 40 -2.21% at 23,505, FTSE 100 -0.87% at 9,117, CAC 40 -0.70% at 7,654, FTSE MIB -1.61% at 41,728, IBEX 35 -1.49% at 14,717, PSI -1.71% at 7,678, SMI -0.64% at 12,099, AEX -1.38% at 884\nSTOCK SPECIFICS:\n-\nPepsiCo (PEP): Activist Investor Elliott Management TOOK a USD 4bln stake in the Co. -\nConstellation Brands (STZ): Cut FY profit guidance. -\nTSMC (TSM): Plans to raise foundry prices; the US has reportedly pulled TSMC's waiver for China shipments of chip supplies. -\nTesla (TSLA): Cut price of its Model 3 long-range RWD in China by 3.7%. -\nApple (AAPL): Accelerating automation across its manufacturing supply chain. -\nMeta (META): Exploring partnerships with Google (GOOG) & OpenAI to enhance AI features in its apps. -\nAmazon (AMZN): US prime signups fall short of last year's total & target. -\nLyft (LYFT): Announced A private offering of USD 450mln of convertible senior notes. -\nZscaler (ZS): Upgraded at MS to 'Overweight' from 'Equal Weight'. -\nFortinet (FTNT): Downgraded to 'Underweight' from 'Equal Weight' at Morgan Stanley. - US revokes Samsung's & SK Hynix's long-standing waivers to use American equipment in their Chinese chip plants.\n-\nMerck (MRK): Filed for a five-part note offering and one-part FRN offering, size not disclosed.

Said factors were more than enough to outweigh the ISM Manufacturing PMI survey, which indicated smaller-than-expected jumps in the headline and employment gauges, while prices paid unexpectedly declined. Meanwhile, construction spending fell as expected, resulting in the latest Atlanta Fed GDPnow (Q3) being revised down to 3.0% (prev. 3.5%). DXY gains were helped by notable weakness in EUR, and particularly the GBP and JPY (more details below), rising to highs of 98.597 before retreating to ~98.35. Aside from the concerns in the Treasury space, which led yields higher, and also tracked UK and French yields higher, drivers for FX moves were on the light side. However, that is likely to end on Wednesday, which will see JOLTS kick off the job data due this week in the US. Expectations are for job openings to fall to 7.378mln in July from 7.437mln.\nEUR, JPY, and GBP were the worst performers in the G10 space, while CAD saw relative outperformance. At the ECB, many members hit the wires. Schnabel does not see a reason for a further rate cut, adding that global rate hikes may come earlier than people think. Meanwhile, Kocher advocates for caution ahead of the next rate decision, while Muller believes it makes sense to keep rates on hold for a while and watch the economy. Latest EU data concerned EZ HICP metrics, which were generally hotter-than-expected in August. After having a muted reaction to the EZ data, EUR/USD trades lower at ~1.1640 from earlier highs of 1.1718.\nJPY was pressured by higher US yields, geopolitical concerns arising from China's President Xi hosting Russia's President Putin and the North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. There were a couple of domestic developments also at play. Concerning politics, uncertainty has increased after four officials in the LDP ruling party are reported to resign, which would be seen as the LDP taking responsibility for its historic July upper house election defeat. Meanwhile, the BoJ Deputy Governor advocated for a lower level of BoJ JGB buying to restore sound functioning in the JGB market. Himino's baseline scenario is for Japan\u2019s corporate profits to come under pressure from the global slowdown and the impact of trade policy. USD/JPY now trades at ~148.40 from earlier lows of 147.06.\nGBP was hit by growing concerns over a weak UK fiscal position amid rising borrowing costs, with FX options highlighting bearish sentiment through dealers reporting elevated premiums for GBP puts over calls. The gilt market was also pressured, resulting in new decade highs in the 30-year yield. Uncertainty in UK assets is likely to remain for some time, with Chancellor Reeves reportedly pencilling in a budget announcement date for November 26th. GBP/USD trades at ~1.3380 from earlier highs of 1.3549 and earlier lows of 1.3341.\nEMFX: In China, the PBoC returned to a bias for a stronger CNY, setting the USD/CNY midpoint at 7.1089, lower than the expected 7.1325 (prev. 7.1072). Elsewhere, Turkish assets were pressured by political developments, whereby the Turkish Court removed the main opposition CHP's Istanbul Chief, diminishing the chances of a threat towards Erdogan's Presidency. Later, the CHP Leader announced they had removed the VP from the party. USD/TRY was modestly higher.\n02 Sep 2025 - 21:20- Fixed IncomeGeopolitical- Source: Newsquawk\nSubscribe Now to Newsquawk\nClick here for a 1 week free trial\nNewsquawk provides audio news and commentary for over 15,000professional traders and brokers worldwide.
