      "summary": "The article explores sustainability in the Australian Outback, highlighting Earth Sanctuary Star Tour’s carbon‑neutral geodesic domes and the region’s growing eco‑initiatives. It emphasizes the role of Indigenous culture and art—through experiences like the Karrke Aboriginal Cultural Experience and the Araluen Arts Centre—in balancing traditional stewardship with modern tourism. The piece also discusses how attractions such as Uluru, Kings Canyon, and light‑tower installations use storytelling and technology to educate visitors about environmental and cultural preservation. Overall, it portrays the Outback as a place where sustainable tourism, renewable energy, and respect for First Nations heritage intersect to create a resilient, visitor‑friendly destination.",
