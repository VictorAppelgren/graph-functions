  "description": "Jane Street's India Scandal: Is The World's Biggest Market Rigged?",
  "content": "At Whale Hunting, we investigate the hidden engines of global finance. Our latest story goes far beyond the headlines to reveal how one of the world's most powerful and secretive trading firms is at the center of a mounting scandal in India. Yes, we're talking about Jane Street \u2013 the same firm that trained disgraced crypto kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried and, by some estimates, accounts for over 10% of all North American equity market activity. Now, as Indian regulators probe allegations of market manipulation and privileged access to trading data, the firm\u2019s extraordinary profits are under the microscope. This is a battle for the soul of a nation's fast-growing financial system, pitting the technological might of foreign firms against the millions of local investors who are consistently losing out. Can India protect its markets from a new kind of \"predatory\" capital, or is this a global game of whack-a-mole that regulators are destined to lose?\n\nIndian regulators are widening a probe into secretive U.S. trading firm Jane Street, launching an investigation into allegations the firm and other foreign high-frequency traders (HFTs) gained an unfair advantage through privileged access to proprietary trading data, according to two sources with knowledge of the action.\n\nThis latest front adds to a mounting pile of allegations, including a sophisticated market manipulation scheme and a tax probe. The focus of the investigations is a handful of foreign firms that have made billions of dollars in profit from a distance, with a minimal local presence. The victims, regulators argue, are the millions of regular Indian retail investors who are overwhelmingly losing money in the very market the foreign firms are allegedly gaming.\n\nAt its core, this is a story of a new kind of economic hegemony, where a handful of global firms, operating from hubs in New York, Hong Kong, and Singapore, are allegedly extracting immense wealth from India's markets. The sheer scale of the operation is staggering: while a recent Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) study found that 9 out of 10 individual traders lost money in the options market last year, the regulator's own filings revealed Jane Street alone amassed $4.3 billion in profits from January 2023 to March 2025.\n\nThis raises a critical question: can India protect its fast-growing financial markets and the small-time investors who fuel them from what SEBI has referred to as \"predatory\" capital? The firm's profit from India, with a single day allegedly yielding over $81 million, is a vivid illustration of the lopsided nature of the market. This is a far cry from helping India's financial development, as the bulk of these profits are moved offshore through a web of entities designed to take advantage of tax treaties.\n\nWhy India Became an HFT Magnet\n\nForeign HFT firms were particularly drawn to India's burgeoning financial landscape for several key reasons. India's economy has been a story of remarkable growth, with real GDP expanding at a brisk pace and capital markets deepening significantly. This robust performance, despite some recent stock market weakness, has made India a prime destination for global capital.\n\nFurthermore, profits for HFT firms (featured in Michael Lewis' Flash Boys) have been under pressure in more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe, where regulatory scrutiny is tight and competition is fierce. India, with the world's biggest derivatives market by contracts traded, presented a lucrative new frontier. The National Stock Exchange of India, or NSE, in its aggressive push to become a global powerhouse, first allowed algorithmic trading in 2010. This paved the way for foreign HFT firms to enter the market and leverage their technological superiority to capitalize on the country's rising fortunes. Jane Street officially entered the Indian market in 2020, with other firms following suit, choosing to operate from overseas hubs with only a skeleton staff on the ground, allowing them to extract massive profits without building a substantial local presence.\n\nThis drive to attract big players was particularly intense as the NSE prepared for a long-awaited and highly anticipated public stock listing, where higher trading volumes would translate directly into a higher valuation. This pursuit of global dominance, however, may have inadvertently \u2013 or intentionally \u2013 created a system with built-in advantages for a select few. The alleged data access being probed is reminiscent of the \"co-location scam,\" a separate historical scandal from the 2010s where local brokers were given preferential access to the exchange's servers, highlighting a broader, persistent concern about market fairness and a systemic vulnerability at the exchange itself.\n\nThe Allegations and the Defense\n\nThe Jane Street saga offers a powerful case study of this dynamic. The firm, known for its brilliant math whizzes who are trained to be market gamblers, gained notoriety as the training ground for Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, the disgraced crypto kingpins whose careers began at the firm. (Jane Street features prominently in Brazen's Crypto Kingpins podcast, available here.)\n\nJane Street is accused by SEBI of using a \"banging the close\" strategy to manipulate the Bank Nifty index. This scheme, which allegedly made billions of dollars in profit, involves placing a large number of orders at the end of the trading day to artificially move prices and make the firm's other bets in options markets more profitable. In July, the regulator temporarily banned Jane Street from trading in Indian equities and put a freeze on $567 million of its funds.\n\nIn response, Jane Street has pushed back hard, calling the allegations \"erroneous.\u201d Legal experts note that proving market manipulation is a high bar for regulators, who must not only show that a firm benefited from market movements but also prove intent to manipulate. The firm's likely rebuttal is that its trades are simply exploiting market inefficiencies \u2013 a standard, and legal, practice in markets globally \u2013 and that profiting from market misalignment is not the same as illegal manipulation.\n\nIn a parallel tax probe, the firm is also being investigated for allegedly using a web of offshore units to move profits out of India, with tax authorities reporting a lack of cooperation. This investigation addresses the concern that while HFT firms extract immense wealth from India's markets, they are not contributing their fair share of taxes locally. The tax probe and the public disclosure of high profits were key factors that led to wider scrutiny of the firm's operations.\n\nThe ruthless competition among foreign firms became public in a New York court case where Jane Street sued rival Millennium Management over allegations that a profitable, India-focused trading algorithm was stolen by former employees, further highlighting the immense value these firms place on their Indian strategies. This court case, where Jane Street proudly disclosed that its India options market strategy had made $1 billion in profits in 2023 \u2013 around 9% of its estimated global profits of $10.6 billion for that year \u2013 is what first put the firm on SEBI's radar.\n\nThe new probe into data access adds another layer of complexity. According to two people with knowledge of SEBI's actions, regulators are examining whether Jane Street, along with rival firms Citadel, Millennium, Susquehanna and others had an unfair advantage from enriched data sets sold by an NSE subsidiary. The regulator is looking into the use of this data, which included confidential details on client-type identification, hidden order quantities, and even the specific price levels of stop-loss orders. This level of detail could allow a firm to not only predict market movements with extreme accuracy but also to execute manipulative strategies, such as triggering a cascade of stop-loss orders to drive down prices.\n\nIf the NSE made the data available for sale, it's not immediately clear that there was any wrongdoing on the part of the firms who legally purchased and used it. Such granular data sets are not available in the U.S. due to a stringent regulatory framework that protects trader anonymity and market fairness. U.S. exchanges and the SEC have strict rules preventing the dissemination of confidential information like client identities, hidden order quantities, or stop-loss levels. Providing this data would be considered a severe violation, enabling market manipulation and leading to swift enforcement action.\n\nThe outcome of this probe will not only determine Jane Street's future in India but will set a precedent for how global high-frequency trading firms are regulated in emerging markets for years to come. SEBI's actions signal a clear intent to level the playing field, with the regulator\u2019s chairman stating they \"have PhDs from our side\" and are not intimidated by the firms\u2019 technological prowess.\n\nYet, the broader question looms: will sophisticated traders simply find the next poorly regulated market to exploit? This dynamic is not new; it was a central theme in Michael Lewis's Flash Boys, which chronicled the early days of HFT in the U.S. While many of the most egregious strategies, like those tied to latency arbitrage, have been largely mitigated in mature markets, the core of HFT \u2013 leveraging speed and informational advantages to exploit market structure \u2013 remains a powerful and profitable engine.\n\nAs regulators in one country close loopholes, these firms have a proven history of moving their operations to the next frontier, raising the possibility that this is a global game of whack-a-mole with local regulators constantly playing catch-up.",

      "text": "A new study by Sebi shows that between FY22 and FY24, a staggering 93 out of 100 retail traders in the futures & options (F&O) segment lost money while only one out of 100 gained more than Rs 1 lakh annually.\nAn earlier study had shown that between FY19 and FY22, 89% of retail traders in the segment had lost money. On the other hand, proprietary traders and foreign funds made huge profits.\nF&O roulette: Over 9 of 10 retail traders lose moneyA staggering 93 of 100 retail traders in the futures & options segment lost money, while only one out of the 100 gained over Rs 1 lakh annually between FY22-24, a new study by Sebi showed. An earlier study had shown that between FY19-22, 89% of retail traders in the segment had lost money.\nOn the other side, proprietary traders and foreign funds made huge profits. And within the profit makers, 'algo traders' - those who trade in the derivatives segment using software-based automated systems - took home most of the profits, the study showed.\n\"More than one crore loss-making traders (92.8% of individual traders) lost, on an average, about Rs 2 lakh per person in F&Os\" during the study period, the report noted. \"Top 3.5% of loss-makers, approximately 4 lakh traders, faced an average loss of Rs 28 lakh per person over the same period, inclusive of transaction costs.\" The study also found that only 7.2% of retail F&O traders made a profit over the three-year period and of the profit makers, a mere 1% managed to earn profits exceeding Rs 1 lakh, after adjusting for transaction costs. Additionally, the 1.1 crore retail derivatives traders together lost Rs 1.8 lakh crore during these three years.\nThe study also showed that between FY23 and FY24, the proportion of young F&O traders (below 30 years) increased significantly from 31% to 43%. \"Nearly 93% of these young traders incurred losses in F&O in FY24, higher than the average loss makers of 91.1% in FY24,\" the study noted.\nWhile (retail traders) made losses in the segment, FPIs and proprietary traders earned profits in FY24. Proprietary traders earned about Rs 33,000 crore of gross profits (that is trading profits before accounting for transaction costs) in the F&O segment, followed by FPIs who earned about Rs 28,000 crore in gross profits. Against this, retail traders and others incurred a loss of over Rs 61,000 crore in FY24 (before accounting for transaction costs), the study noted. A majority of profits for FPIs and proprietary traders were made by algo entities. \"97% profits of FPIs and 96% profits of proprietary traders came from algo entities in FY24,\" according to the report.\nThese numbers came in despite warnings and words of caution from the finance minister, the finance secretary, the CEA and the Sebi chief. The new study is expected to strengthen Sebi's move to rein in F&O trading as the regulator works to bring in major changes to the margin system, the contract value etc, in the F&O segment."

      "text": "Flash Boys\nAbove all, Lewis has a gift for narrative. He is not the first to write about Spread Networks, a start-up that secretly laid an 827-mile, $300m fibre optic cable from Chicago to New Jersey to enable trades to make a round trip in 13 milliseconds. But he turns it into a great story. \u2014 Read the complete FT review\nSynopsis\nIf you thought Wall Street was about alpha males standing in trading pits hollering at each other, think again. That world is dead.\nNow, the world\u2019s money is traded by computer code, inside black boxes in heavily guarded buildings. Even the experts entrusted with your cash don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to it. And the very few who do aren\u2019t about to tell - because they\u2019re making a killing.\nThis is a market that\u2019s rigged, out of control and out of sight; a market in which the chief need is for speed; and in which traders would sell their grandmothers for a microsecond. Blink, and you\u2019ll miss it.\nIn Flash Boys, Michael Lewis tells the explosive story of how one group of ingenious oddballs and misfits set out to expose what was going on. It\u2019s the story of what it\u2019s like to declare war on some of the richest and most powerful people in the world. It\u2019s about taking on an entire system. And it\u2019s about the madness that has taken hold of the financial markets today.\nYou won\u2019t believe it until you\u2019ve read it."

      "text": "India has temporarily barred Jane Street Group LLC from accessing the local securities market for alleged index manipulation, dealing a severe hit to the U.S. firm that made $4.3 billion in trading gains there in more than two years.\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India said it would seize 48.4 billion rupees ($570 million) from Jane Street, which it claimed is the total amount of \u201cunlawful gains\u201d made by the firm, according to a 105-page interim order by Ananth Narayan, a board member at the regulator, on its website. Jane Street said it disputes the findings.\nJane Street is one of the most active foreign players in India, the world\u2019s largest derivatives market by contracts traded, and one that has become a magnet for high-frequency trading firms amid a retail investing boom sparked by the pandemic. SEBI\u2019s order marks a rare instance of such an action against a foreign entity.\nThe U.S.-based market maker\u2019s operations in India came under a global spotlight last year after a court battle with Millennium Management revealed it earned $1 billion trading in Indian equity derivatives. Other details disclosed in the case helped trigger SEBI\u2019s investigation, which continued even as the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. earlier this year closed a separate probe into irregular trades by the firm.\nJane Street made about 365 billion rupees ($4.3 billion) in overall gain from trading in Indian derivatives and cash market during the period between January 2023 and March 2025, according to the SEBI order.\n\u201cSEBI is sending a message to global HFT giants that you are welcome to trade here but if you undertake unfair practices then we also hold a stick,\u201d said Tejas Shah, head of derivatives trading at Equirus Securities Pvt. \u201cI would expect some temporary impact on volumes as other HFTs sit back a little.\u201d\nShares of Nuvama Wealth Management Ltd., Jane Street\u2019s local trading partner, plunged 11% in Mumbai trading, the most in three months. India\u2019s benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index was little changed while a broader gauge of Asian equities fell 0.3%.\nSEBI alleged that on weekly index options expiry days, Jane Street used a large amount of funds to influence price action in the futures as well as the cash market\u2014where volumes are relatively low. That allowed it \u201cto put on significantly larger and profitable positions in the highly liquid index options market by misleading and enticing a large number of smaller individual traders.\u201d\nThe regulator had warned Jane Street to avoid such trading practices as early as January this year, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The investigation found that the trading strategy continued to be used in May, the person said.\nCurbs Imposed\nPending detailed investigation, Jane Street Group entities are immediately \u201crestrained from accessing the securities market and are further prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities, directly or indirectly,\u201d SEBI said. Banks have been directed to ensure no debits are made without SEBI\u2019s permission in respect of the accounts held individually or jointly by the entities, according to the interim order.\nSEBI also said the restrictions can be lifted if Jane Street deposits the said amount in an escrow account at a designated bank in India.\nJane Street disputes the findings of the SEBI interim order and will further engage with the regulator, a representative for the U.S.-based market maker said in a statement. SEBI said the firm can contest the regulator\u2019s \u201cprima facie observations\u201d within 21 days of the receipt of the order.\n\u201cThis may signal SEBI\u2019s growing vigilance and willingness to assert control over foreign institutional activity making hefty gains in its derivatives market\u2014particularly where such strategies blur the line between smart trading and market distortion,\u201d said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets in Singapore.\nDerivatives Boom\nGlobal high-frequency trading and market-making firms from Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Securities LLC to Optiver have rushed to expand operations in India in recent years as the retail investor-led boom saw options premiums surge 11-fold in the five years to March 2025.\nThe retail frenzy has helped foreign funds and local proprietary firms that use algorithms as they pocketed $7 billion in gross profits in the 12 months ended in March 2024, according to a SEBI study. Retail investors, meanwhile, lost an equivalent of $21 billion from trading futures and options in the three years to March 2024., according to the regulator.\nTo protect them, SEBI has since November imposed several restrictions on trading options including higher minimum investment limits and an increase in lot sizes to protect retail traders. The measures have helped cool trading this year.\nThe regulator\u2019s action \u201cwill also create a level playing field for everyone especially the local players who were losing a lot of money,\u201d said Shah of Equirus.\nSEBI also directed Jane Street entities to close out or square off any open positions they may have in exchange-traded derivative contracts within three months from the date of order or at the expiry of such contracts, whichever is earlier.\nJane Street is \u201ccommitted to operating in compliance with all regulations\u201d in the regions it operates in around the world, the firm said in its statement.\n\u201cThis is a good move by SEBI, but we need more corrective measures to protect market integrity,\u201d said Deven Choksey, managing director at DRChoksey FinServ Pvt. \u201cMechanisms like Algos, HFTs are creating inequalities in the markets. Institutions have an edge.\u201d"

      "text": "Jane Street guys are brilliant mathematicians, but we can have PhDs too: Sebi chief\nAug 4, 2025\nSynopsis\nSebi Chair Tuhin Kanta Pandey defended the regulator\u2019s probe into Jane Street, rejecting claims of overreach and stressing India\u2019s capability. He highlighted the need for structural reforms in the booming derivatives market and emphasized investor protection. Sebi continues to investigate Jane Street\u2019s alleged manipulation of Nifty and Bank Nifty indices.\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Chair Tuhin Kanta Pandey has said that the regulator is capable of matching the expertise of sophisticated global traders, and pushed back against criticism of its probe into U.S. trading firm Jane Street, according to a report.\n\u201cI know these guys are brilliant mathematicians and PhDs, but we can have PhDs from our side. We are not constrained,\u201d Pandey told The Financial Times.\nPandey also rejected Jane Street\u2019s defence that it was engaged in standard index arbitrage. \u201cManipulation is where you are artificially creating arbitrage,\u201d he said.\nSebi eyes structural reforms in derivatives market\nThe Sebi Chair told The Financial Times that India\u2019s booming derivatives market needed \u201cstructural reforms\u201d, and said the regulator was examining ways to strengthen protections for retail investors.\n\u201c[The] derivatives market needs some structural reforms,\u201d he told FT, noting that while volumes have declined, \u201cnot to the extent that is desirable\u201d.\nAccording to Sebi data, India\u2019s options market accounted for nearly 90% of global volumes last year. But a recent regulator report said nine out of ten individual traders lost money trading options.\nThe number of individual participants doubled to 9.6 million between March 2022 and March 2025, with annual losses swelling from $4.7 billion to $12.2 billion. Sebi has since tightened entry norms and introduced other reforms that brought down the number of active traders by 20% year-on-year as of June.\nPandey told The Financial Times that Sebi is trying to \u201csensitise\u201d investors \u201cnot to go into\u201d risky futures and options segments. Still, he said the regulator has no intention of stifling the market. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said this derivative market is important for us, there\u2019s no way we will kill the market. You develop the market, you don\u2019t kill it.\u201d\nJane Street fallout\nSebi\u2019s July order against Jane Street accused the U.S.-based firm of manipulating index movements, particularly in Nifty and Bank Nifty, on expiry days to profit from large options positions. The regulator alleged the firm took oversized bets in the cash and futures markets to move prices in its favour, calling the strategy a \u201csinister scheme\u201d.\nAccording to Sebi, Jane Street earned over Rs 36,500 crore in India between January 2023 and March 2025, Rs 43,289 crore from index options, and losses of Rs 7,687 crore in the cash and futures markets.\nOne such instance cited occurred on January 17, 2024, when the firm allegedly bought Rs 4,370 crore worth of Bank Nifty stocks and futures in the morning, triggering an index rally. While holding bearish options positions, it reversed the trades in the afternoon, causing a sharp decline and earning Rs 734.93 crore that day alone.\nThe trading ban imposed on Jane Street was lifted after the firm deposited approximately Rs 4,844 crore in an escrow account. The regulator continues to investigate.\nJane Street, according to the Financial Times report, said in an internal memo that it plans to challenge Sebi\u2019s order, which it described as \u201cextremely inflammatory.\u201d The U.S. based firm is reportedly engaging constructively with the regulator and has sought an extension to respond to the interim order issued on July 3.\nLooking ahead, Pandey told FT that Sebi expects the number of individual investors in Indian markets to reach 400 million by 2030, up from around 130 million today, driven by a new generation that is \u201cless inclined to go to the bank and more inclined to go to the market\u201d.\n[The Economic Times]"

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) claims Jane Street profited significantly while local retail investors suffered losses, with a recent study showing that 93% of retail traders in the futures and options segment lost money. The probe raises concerns about the influence of foreign high-frequency trading firms on India's financial markets and the need for regulatory reforms to protect local investors.",
