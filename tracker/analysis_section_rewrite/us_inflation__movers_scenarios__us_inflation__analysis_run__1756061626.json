      "feedback": "The draft is a good scaffold but needs to tighten the logic, horizon discipline, and sourcing discipline to reach world-class quality; actionable edits: reframe to four single‑sentence items in the exact format Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %, anchored to the three-window catalyst cadence (0–2 weeks, 2–8 weeks, 8–26 weeks) and to a consistent Regime A/B/C framing from NL5YYTLF2, replacing any mixed base/alternative terminology with Regime A (base) and Regime B (risk) (NL5YYTLF2); force a first-principles chain for the Up line (AI productivity → higher ROIC and capex intensity → reallocation to high‑productivity sectors → inflation/price dynamics) and tie it to explicit facts (e.g., Walmart ROIC anchor (4) and ROIC > cost of capital as a central frame) to avoid generic platitudes; lock catalysts to concrete triggers from the sources (GM Cadillac Elevated Velocity, GM capex, U.S. capacity ramp >2M (WTNT85IPR, GM), 25% tariff, 90‑day tariff truce (S15934PBQ, RHXDOHQQX)) and include a clear invalidation rule (tariff reversal, GM schedule delay, or negative FDA/Medicare milestones) with its IDs; ensure probability assignments reflect the best-supported numbers in the material (base 65% for Regime A vs Regime B 35% (NL5YYTLF2), Alt A bullish 40–50% and Alt B bearish 20–40% (WTNT85IPR)) and that every line cites IDs for the asserted facts to avoid parsing ambiguity; audit for conflicts (tariff pass‑through vs tariff deadlock) and reconcile them with a single, defensible base case plus clear alternative paths; prune non‑source numbers or claims and ensure all critical sources (NL5YYTLF2, WTNT85IPR, RHXDOHQQX, S15934PBQ, IGP1Q4ZEJ, GM, 4, 11, 22PL3Q360, 6OOEK8TUR, F8GF45MEU, U6HXAJR4J, ILY C1M41F) are consistently represented.",
