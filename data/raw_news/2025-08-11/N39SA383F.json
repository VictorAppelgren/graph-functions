Her loss is deeply felt by the entire Rockingham County Public Schools (RCPS) family,\u201d a tribute on Facebook read."

Charles County Sheriff's Office was the first to arrive, and discovered that two adult occupants escaped unharmed*, and they were told that possibly up to six others were inside. Deputies attempted to enter the home but could not due to heavy smoke and flames. Within minutes, firefighters from the Waldorf Volunteer Fire Department and surrounding departments arrived and immediately upgraded the incident to two alarms. Crews worked quickly to bring the fire under control while searching for victims. Another adult occupant arrived at the home while the fire department was on the scene; however, tragically, two other adults and four children were found deceased inside the home.\nInvestigators were assisted by K9 \"Taylor, the Calvert K-9 Search Team, and the Charles County Collapse Team, which assisted with shoring up the home due to extensive structural fire damage. While the cause remains under investigation, investigators determined the fire originated within an enclosed porch on the right side of the home. The identities and ages of the victims will be confirmed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, who will also determine their exact cause of death.\n\"This is an unimaginable loss for the community,\" said Acting State Fire Marshal Jason M. Mowbray. \"Our hearts go out to the families impacted by this heartbreaking event. In times like this, we must come together to support one another and remember the importance of fire safety in our homes.\"\nA joint investigation is a standard operating procedure between the Office of the State Fire and the local authority having jurisdiction whenever a fatal fire occurs. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives is our federal partner in fire and explosive investigations, and a joint investigation is routine in multi-fatal and high-dollar loss investigations.\n* - This corrects an earlier report that only one person escaped from the home\n###\nPhoto Credit - Unknown Source\nPhoto Credit - OSFM\nPhoto Credit - OSFM\nThe\nOffice of the State Fire Marshal is an agency of the Department of\nState Police dedicated to helping protect citizens from fire and\nexplosion through a comprehensive program of education,\ninspection, investigation and fire protection engineering.

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced an escalation of law enforcement in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 and warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while,\u201d the president threatened \u2014 also name-checking Chicago and Los Angeles as cities where he may order the feds next.\nTrump additionally announced plans for federal legislation that would override state laws barring judges from applying cash bail requirements to criminal defendants.\nTerry Cole, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer Metropolitan Police Department under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nThe federal Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the capital\u2019s local police for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending the authority.\nTrump noted many high-profile recent crimes in DC, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\nThe president held up a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed. And you all know people, friends of yours, where that\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTrump also mentioned the 2023 carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the stabbing of an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) the same year by a \u201cdemented lunatic\u201d and the shooting death of a three-year girl in July.\nThe president described criminals riding unauthorized ATVs and motorbikes down the roads and said he planned to beautify the District by fixing road medians, broken marble and potholes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums too. We have slums here. We\u2019re getting rid of them. I know it\u2019s not politically correct,\u201d Trump said, without offering additional detail on apparent plans to get rid of public housing in high-property-value DC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums where they live.\u201d\nHomeless encampments will also be removed from all public places, including in parks and underpasses, the president vowed, while the US Park Police \u2014 under the control of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 will be responsible for the removal of graffiti.\nTrump\u2019s federalization of DC police attracted a smattering of protests near the White House, but Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser told MSNBC Sunday ahead of the announcement \u201cwe do need the federal government\u2019s help\u201d and specifically requested assistance rebuilding the city jail.\nBowser recently invoked curfews in parts of the city in a bid to keep teens off the street as early as 7 p.m., but also has claimed crime rates are going down in the city, pointing to official data.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that DC police commander Michael Pulliam, whose district included the densely populated Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights neighborhoods, was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPulliam\u2019s police union defended him and accused MPD leadership of ordering subordinates to falsify violent crime data.\nIf necessary, Trump added, ordinary military members could be deployed to join the National Guard and the local cops.\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump summed up his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d"
