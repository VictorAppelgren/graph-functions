  "description": "\u201cI think we could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September,\u201d Bessent said in a television interview on  Wednesday.  Bessent reiterated his view that, had officials been aware of the revised data on the labor market that were released two days after that gathering, they might have cut rates.",
  "content": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made his most explicit call yet for the Federal Reserve to execute a cycle of interest-rate cuts, suggesting the central bank\u2019s benchmark ought to be at least 1.5 percentage points lower than it is now.\n\u2022 To Head Off Severe Storm Surges, Nova Scotia Invests in \u2018Living Shorelines\u2019\n\u2022 New York Warns of $34 Billion Budget Hole, Biggest Since 2009 Crisis\n\u2022 For Homeless Cyclists, Bikes Bring an Escape From the Streets\n\n\u201cI think we could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September,\u201d Bessent said in a television interview on Wednesday. \u201cIf you look at any model\u201d it suggests that \u201cwe should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower.\u201d\n\nFed policymakers kept their benchmark at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5% at their last policy meeting. Bessent reiterated his view that, had officials been aware of the revised data on the labor market that were released two days after that gathering, they might have cut rates. That may have also been the case for the June meeting, he said.\n\n\u201cI suspect we could have had rate cuts in June and July,\u201d Bessent said \u2014 alluding to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Aug. 1 that downwardly revised payroll gains in May and June by 258,000.\n\nTreasury secretaries have typically shied away from making specific calls on Fed rates, and Bessent himself for months has said he would only discuss the central bank\u2019s past policy decisions \u2014 not their upcoming ones. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Chair Jerome Powell for refraining from rate cuts this year.\n\nPowell and many of his colleagues have said they want to see greater evidence about any impact on inflation and inflation expectations from the tariff hikes.\n\nBessent said that there are 10 or 11 candidates under consideration to succeed Powell when his term as chair concludes in May, without running through the names. He said there are both current Fed officials as well as private-sector individuals on the list.\n\nHe also said that he didn\u2019t expect Stephen Miran, whom Trump has nominated to fill the existing opening on the Fed board, to stay at the central bank past January, when that term concludes.\n\u2022 Why It\u2019s Actually a Good Time to Buy a House, According to a Zillow Economist\n\u2022 Dubai\u2019s Housing Boom Is Stoking Fears of Another Crash\n\u2022 The Social Media Trend Machine Is Spitting Out Weirder and Weirder Results\n\u2022 A $340 Million New York Office Makeover Is Converting Boardrooms to Bedrooms",
