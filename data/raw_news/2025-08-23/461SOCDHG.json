  "content": "Flying green sex toys have made their way from WNBA courts to NFL fields.\n\nA green dildo landed on the Nissan Stadium field in Nashville during the fourth quarter of the Titans\u2019 23-13 preseason win over the Vikings on Friday night.\n\nThe Titans said they have images of those who orchestrated the stunt and have relayed the information to the Metro Nashville Police Department, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThis situation follows the recent bizarre string of flying sex toys that interrupted WNBA games \u2014 with at least six documented incidents \u2014 and resulted in at least three arrests.\n\nSeveral videos from Friday\u2019s game showed the object sitting at about the six-yard line, with the AP reporting the Titans had the ball at midfield with roughly five minutes remaining in the game.\n\nA man ran onto the field to pick up the object and then quickly left the field.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we have a dildo,\u201d reporter Easton Freeze of A to Z Sports said in a video he posted showing the neon green object on the field.\n\nThis prank follows the legal fallout from the WNBA dealing with a string of dildo-throwing incidents over roughly the last month, involving at least six documented cases.\n\nBrooklyn Police arrested 32-year-old Ohio native Charles Burgess on Wednesday for allegedly tossing a dildo and hitting a 12-year-old girl in the leg at a Liberty-Wings game on Aug. 5.\n\nArizona police arrested 18-year-old Kaden Lopez earlier this month for allegedly throwing a green dildo and hitting a man and his 9-year-old niece during a Mercury-Sun game on Aug. 5.\n\nGeorgia police arrested a third individual, 23-year-old Delbert Carver, earlier this month for allegedly throwing a sex toy during a July game involving the Dream, one of two pranks involving the team.\n\nA collection of cryptocurrency traders said they were behind the string of incidents, although the spokesperson for the group told USA Today that Carver and Lopez are not part of the group.\n\nWNBA players and coaches alike spoke out against the pranks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s dumb,\u201d Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s also dangerous and player safety is No. 1. Respecting the game, all those things. I think it\u2019s really stupid.\u201d",

      "text": "Access the Yankees beat like never before\nJoin Post Sports+ for exciting subscriber-only features, including real-time texting with Greg Joyce about the inside buzz on the Yankees.\nTry it freeAnthony Volpe\u2019s rough season got even worse Friday in a 1-0 loss to the Red Sox.\nNot only did the shortstop go hitless again to extend his slump to 1-for-25, he got booed after a strikeout in the eighth and made a mental error at shortstop an inning later.\nVolpe\u2019s miscue at short in the top of the ninth of a one-run game came with Jarren Duran on second.\nCeddanne Rafaela hit a grounder to Volpe and instead of making the routine throw to first, Volpe threw behind Duran to Jazz Chisholm Jr. at second.\nDuran was safe and Rafaela beat Chisholm\u2019s throw to first.\nThe play went as a fielder\u2019s choice, but Volpe\u2019s 16 errors is the highest in the league.\n\u201cIt was obviously not the right play, but it was a little bit of a heady play, too,\u2019\u2019 Aaron Boone said, somewhat in defense of his shortstop.\nBoone noted that there was a \u201cgap\u201d between Duran and Chisholm.\nStill, it\u2019s a play that can\u2019t be made at that point.\nVolpe followed with a solid throw home to get Duran at the plate on a contact play later in the inning.\nThe shortstop\u2019s slump is just as alarming.\nHe has 10 strikeouts in his last 25 at-bats and when he whiffed against Garrett Whitlock for the second out in the bottom of the eighth, Volpe heard some relatively loud boos.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t swung it great the last week,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThe last two days, he\u2019s just missed a couple pitches and then he had some confused swings. We\u2019ve got to get him going again offensively.\u201d\nOnly six players have a worse OPS than Volpe\u2019s .680 mark since June 12.\nAnd his .171 average is the worst among 162 qualified hitters in the same span.\nPrior to the game, hitting coach James Rowson said Volpe\u2019s performance at the plate hasn\u2019t been as bad as the recent numbers would indicate.\n\u201cIt shows up sometimes as he doesn\u2019t have hits in a certain number of at-bats, but it\u2019s not purely about results,\u2019\u2019 Rowson said. \u201cHis at-bats over the last month or so have been really good. The results have to be there, too, and there haven\u2019t been a lot of hits, but he\u2019s not doing much different than when he was locked in earlier in the season.\u201d\nTo Rowson\u2019s point, an argument could be made that Volpe has hit into some bad luck, with a .167 BABIP since Aug. 2, compared to his .272 career mark and .241 number for this season.\nBoone said there was no update on when Aaron Judge may be able to play the outfield as he deals with a right flexor strain that\u2019s limited him to DH duties.\nJonathan Lo\u00e1isiga is scheduled to see Dr. Keith Meister on Tuesday as the right-hander could be headed toward another elbow surgery. Lo\u00e1isiga has appeared in 30 games this season, but was on the IL with back tightness prior to the elbow injury.\nFernando Cruz (oblique) gave up a run in 1 \u00b9/\u2083 innings in a rehab appearance with Double-A Somerset.\nBoone said he considered pinch-hitting Amed Rosario for Trent Grisham against Aroldis Chapman in the ninth, but decided against it.\nRosario is 3-for-7 with two homers against the lefty, while Grisham is now 0-for-3 with three strikeouts.\n- CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND YANKEES STATS\nAustin Wells has seen his playing time dip recently, a result of his struggles at the plate, as well as the emergence of Ben Rice at catcher.\n\u201cBen has earned more opportunities there,\u2019\u2019 Boone said of Rice, who was at first Friday. \u201cWells has gone through struggles the last few weeks\u2026 We know what Austin is capable of and it\u2019s a product of Rice pushing in and [having Paul] Goldschmidt at first.\u201d\nWells was coming off a game in which he homered twice against the Rays.\n\u201cHopefully, Wells gets a little traction offensively,\u2019\u2019 Boone said.\nAustin Slater (left hamstring strain) has started baseball activities and did drills in the outfield Friday, but Boone said there was no updated timeline for his return."

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: WNBA sex toy incidents started by Crypto meme coin group\n- A cryptocurrency group has claimed responsibility for throwing sex toys at WNBA games.\n- The group says the acts are a protest against the \"toxic\" environment in the crypto world and not meant to disrespect women athletes.\n- Two individuals have been arrested for throwing sex toys, but the spokesman claims they were not affiliated with their group.\n- The group says they plan to continue with \"lighter\" and \"more tasteful\" pranks to gain attention.\nCryptocurrency meme coin creators say they are responsible for the sex toys being thrown at multiple WNBA games, and they are planning more \"pranks.\"\nFrom Atlanta to Los Angeles, no arena has been safe from neon green objects whizzing from the stands, through the air and onto WNBA courts. If there is an opportune window, a brightly colored entity will be thrown, causing intentional and symbolic chaos, according to a spokesman for the cryptocurrency group. The person, who uses the name @Daldo_Raine on social media, spoke to USA TODAY Sports on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue.\nOver the past two weeks, there have been six known incidents of green sex toys being thrown at WNBA games. The latest to garner attention happened Tuesday night during a game between the Indiana Fever and the Los Angeles Sparks at Crypto.com Arena in L.A. Green sex toys were also thrown in the stands at New York Liberty and Phoenix Mercury games Tuesday, at two Atlanta Dream games last week and a Chicago Sky game Friday. Two people have been arrested on multiple charges for allegedly throwing the objects.\n\"It\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s dumb, it\u2019s stupid,\" Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said after the game. \"It\u2019s also dangerous. Player safety is No. 1, respecting the game, all those things. I think it\u2019s really stupid.\"\nThe spokesman for the crypto group told USA TODAY Sports that was not the intention. He said a group of crypto enthusiasts and traders launched Green Dildo Coin (DILDO), a meme coin intended to be lighthearted and perceived as a joke, in late July to protest what they describe as a \"toxic\" environment in the crypto world. According to the group, many smaller players in the space are struggling to keep up with the influx of influencers and scammers.\nAs a form of protest, the meme coin was created, and the faction began infiltrating WNBA arenas with color-coordinated sex toys to coincide with the launch. USA TODAY Sports obtained text messages showing the group's coordination and planning before the coin's launch July 28 and the first sex toy being thrown at a WNBA game July 29.\nUSA TODAY Sports has reached out to the WNBA about the crypto group, the sex toy incidents and security measures moving forward. The league declined to comment on the record.\nThe crypto group's spokesman said it's not their intention to harm anyone, and members of the community have been advised to only throw their branded green items if there is a level of personal comfort and the objects can land without hitting someone. He also shot down any narrative that the sex toys were a sign of disrespect toward the women athletes.\nSex toys have been thrown at sporting events in the past, probably the most well known incident was at a New England Patriots vs. Buffalo Bills game in 2018.\n\"We didn't do this because like we dislike women's sports or, like, some of the narratives that are trending right now are ridiculous,\" he said. \"Creating disruption at games is like, it happens in every single sport, right? We've seen it in the NFL, we've seen it in hockey, you know . . . fans doing random things to more or less create attention.\n\"We knew that in order to get a voice in the space ... we had to go out and do some viral stunts to save us from having to pay that influencer cabal, sacrifice our souls and the fate of the project.\"\nThe incidents began 10 days after the WNBA All-Star game, which featured significant media coverage and many viral moments on social media.\nThe spokesman explained that catapulting sex objects (with drawn-on sunglasses and the name of their coin) is to spread awareness about a culture they want to perpetuate, cultivated around jokes, pranks and various stunts. The green sex toy is supposed to mirror a green candle, and if the price of the candle goes up, it represents volatility, which the spokesman for the meme coin group claims is a trader's dream. The bright color of the object was intentional, he said, to be disruptive and create curiosity.\nHe also said the two people arrested were not part of their group. Delbert Carver was booked for disorderly conduct, public indecency/indecent exposure and criminal trespass after allegedly throwing a sex toy at the Atlanta Dream's stadium Saturday. And 18-year-old Kaden Lopez was arrested in Phoenix on suspicion of disorderly conduct, assault and public display of explicit sexual material. According to the local FOX station, Lopez told police he saw the viral trend on social media and purchased his own green sex toy.\n\"Moving forward, we have a lot more pranks, but they're a lot lighter. They're a lot more tasteful,\" the spokesman said. \"They're with a lot of different branded merch, and it's more or less to keep the dildo being spotted in different places that are high-traffic areas with cameras.\"\nThe coordinated effort is a strategic protest against what the meme coin creators view as a small group of individuals controlling the crypto space. From the beginning, part of the group's mission has been to cause enough chaos to \"get a voice\" and media attention. The spokesman said they've since secured that and plan to continue with their rollout, though wouldn't reveal what the group has planned next.\nThe group has also placed a green sex toy on the Wall Street Bull in New York City and shared a video with USA TODAY Sports showing a person with a green sex toy sitting behind home plate at a Major League Baseball game. \"We wanna shift the culture in crypto, and we wanna be the 1,000 against the one,\" the spokesman said.\nA meme coin is a type of crypto asset inspired by internet memes, characters or trends \"for which the promoter seeks to attract an enthusiastic online community to purchase the meme coin and engage in its trading,\" according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meme coins are like collectibles with limited or no functionality, the SEC says, with value dictated by social and cultural influences. That carries more risk compared to other cryptocurrencies with values tied to more predictable supply and demand relationships.\nThe nature of the group's meme coin raises concerns this could be a short-term, pump-and-dump play. A pump-and-dump strategy typically involves inflating the price of a coin through marketing and the owners buying large quantities of the coin, then selling it to others who aren't in on the intention behind the coin. The original owners then release (dump) their coins to increase the supply once the price falls, and anyone left owning the cryptocurrency essentially has coins that have minimal value.\nThis particular meme coin has increased in value nearly 309% in the last seven days and more than 80% in the last 24 hours. It has a 24-hour trading volume of more than $1.3 million, according to cryptocurrency website coingecko.com.\nHowever, in a recorded conversation online, a member of the group said that is not their goal.\n\"Are we looking for a quick pump and dump? No. That\u2019s never been the vision,\" they said on X. \"The vision is \u2026 we wanna bring the trenches back to the timeline. We wanna bring a community of base [expletive] animals who like doing fun [expletive].\"\nThis is a developing story and will be updated."

      "text": "A group of cryptocurrency traders is claiming to be behind the epidemic of sex toys being thrown on the court during during several WNBA games.\nAn anonymous spokesman for the group, who reportedly goes by @Daldo_Raine on social media, told USA Today that some crypto creators who launched a meme coin called Green Dildo Coin (DILDO) are plotting more depraved \u201cpranks\u201d like the ones that have disrupted WNBA games.\nAt least five contests over the last week-plus have seen incidents with green sex toys being thrown, some of them landing on the court during play. One person attempted to throw one during Tuesday\u2019s Liberty game at Barclays Center, but it didn\u2019t make it out of the stands.\nDelbert Carver, 23, was reportedly arrested for throwing a sex toy onto the court during the Valkyries-Dream game in Atlanta on July 29 and charged with disorderly conduct, public indecency/indecent exposure and criminal trespass.\nKaden Lopez, 18, was reportedly arrested for allegedly throwing a sex toy toward a fan who was at Tuesday\u2019s Mercury-Sun game with his 9-year-old niece. Lopez was booked on suspicion of disorderly conduct, assault and public display of explicit sexual material.\nThe prank has gotten so out of hand that the WNBA was forced to release a statement on the issue last weekend.\n\u201cThe safety and well-being of everyone in our arenas is a top priority for our league,\u201d the league said in a recent statement. \u201cObjects of any kind thrown onto the court or in the seating area can pose a safety risk for players, game officials, and fans.\n\u201cIn line with WNBA Arena Security Standards, any fan who intentionally throws an object onto the court will be immediately ejected and face a minimum one-year ban in addition to being subject to arrest and prosecution by local authorities.\u201d\nFever star Sophia Cunningham took to X last week, imploring the pranksters to \u201cStop throwing dildos on the court \u2026 you\u2019re going to hurt one of us.\u201d\nA sex toy was then thrown at Cunningham and nicked her ankle during Tuesday\u2019s Fever-Sparks game in Los Angeles.\nAfter the latest incident on Tuesday, Sparks coach Lynne Roberts expressed her frustrations with the ridiculous situation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, it\u2019s dumb,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid. It\u2019s also dangerous and player safety is No. 1. Respecting the game, all those things. I think it\u2019s really stupid.\u201d\nLynx head coach Cheryl Reeve sees the odd development as yet another chapter in the long history of \u201cthe sexualization of women.\u201d\n\u201cThis has been going on for centuries \u2014 the sexualization of women,\u201d Reeve said. \u201cThis is the latest version of that. And it is not funny, and it should not be the butt of jokes on any radio show, or in print, or in any comments.\n\u201cThe sexualization of women is what is used to hold women down. And this is no different. \u2026 These people that are doing this should be held accountable. We\u2019re not the butt of the joke. They are the problem and we need to take action.\u201d\nLiberty player Isabelle Harrison told The Post\u2019s Madeline Kenney that players shouldn\u2019t have to deal with a safety issue like this.\n\u201cI think you just have to continuously prioritize the players, because it\u2019s obviously safety, but also just so immature to me, like, I just hate that that\u2019s being attached to our brand and our name,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThis is like, let\u2019s be professional here. I get the jokes, and things can be funny, but it just gets to a point.\n\u201cI don\u2019t take this lightly,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat my job is, it\u2019s not a joke. I know a lot of other players feel like that, too. So we just need to take it more serious.\u201d\nRidiculously, the crypto group claims it hasn\u2019t been throwing dildos because \u201cwe dislike women\u2019s sports.\u201d\nThe group also says the two people arrested weren\u2019t affiliated with them."

The mom and her daughter spoke to several security guards, who assured them they would pull camera footage to figure out who tossed it.\n\u201cIt was pretty chaotic,\u201d the fan said. \u201cI know a worker grabbed the item through the railing.\u201d\nThe Liberty declined to share any further comment other than the confirm an investigation remains ongoing.\nAn NBA security professional in New York told The Post, \u201cThis is new, and the league is trying to find out where this is originating from and what\u2019s the meaning of why it\u2019s being done. And they\u2019re going to come up with a strategy to try to eliminate it from the game altogether because it\u2019s not needed. It\u2019s not helping the game.\u201d\nA group of cryptocurrency traders has claimed responsibility for the incidents, per multiple reports.\nThe NBA security professional didn\u2019t have exact details of Tuesday\u2019s incident but said mitigating threats is the security team\u2019s top priority.\n\u201cEverybody wants to hide things. You can\u2019t hide things,\u201d they said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put it out there.\u201d"

We\u2019ve got to focus on the next two games and try to split the series.\u201d\nThe problem with that is the fact that Garrett Crochet is starting for Boston on Saturday \u2014 a day after the Yankees offense was overmatched again by Brayan Bello.\nBello, who blanked the Yankees for seven innings in a June win at Fenway Park, was equally as dominant in The Bronx on Friday before Garrett Whitlock followed with a scoreless eighth and Aroldis Chapman closed it in the ninth.\nIn the process, Bello became the first pitcher in Red Sox history to toss at least seven scoreless innings while allowing no more than three hits in consecutive games against the Yankees, according to Elias Sports Bureau.\nThe Yankees\u2019 getting shutout for the ninth time this season \u2014 after it happened just eight times all of last year \u2014 nullified Max Fried\u2019s best start in nearly two months.\nThe left-hander, who\u2019d put up a 6.80 ERA over his previous eight starts, rebounded with six scoreless innings before Mark Leiter Jr. allowed the game\u2019s only run in the seventh.\nFried wasn\u2019t dominant, but he pitched out of trouble when he had to.\nAnd Bello was better.\nRice singled with one out in the first, which seemed like a promising sign for the offense.\n- CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND YANKEES STATS\nThey got just two more hits off Bello before he left after seven innings \u2014 having faced just two batters over the minimum.\nThey got a leadoff single from Austin Wells in the bottom of the sixth, but the catcher was doubled off first on Trent Grisham\u2019s lineout to shortstop, as the Yankees\u2019 baserunning woes continued.\nAfterwards, Aaron Boone said that \u201ccan\u2019t happen.\u201d\nBello gave up just three singles and a walk \u2014 and got two double plays \u2014 before leaving after 92 pitches.\nLeiter took over for Fried to start the seventh and gave up a one-out, pinch-hit double to Nathaniel Lowe.\nConnor Wong followed with a double to left to drive in Lowe and that proved to be enough to beat the Yankees, as they couldn\u2019t score against Whitlock in the eighth or Chapman in the ninth.\nThe Yankees didn\u2019t help themselves with more sloppiness, from Wells on the basepaths, to Anthony Volpe and Jasson Dom\u00ednguez throwing to the wrong bases in the ninth.\nIf the Yankees have any shot of playing into October, they\u2019ll need the version of Fried they got Friday, when he once again looked like an ace, as he did for most of the first half of the season.\nHis toughest battle was with a squirrel in the top of the fifth.\nThe squirrel\u2019s presence on the field delayed the game for about a minute, which was followed by Fried firing his next pitch to the backstop.\nBut the left-hander retired the next two batters to get out of the inning.\nOn a night the Yankees failed to even get a runner into scoring position, Fried\u2019s performance was overshadowed.\nAnd if the Yankees don\u2019t figure out a way to turn the tables on Boston, their season won\u2019t end well.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like losing to them,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI don\u2019t like losing to anyone. They\u2019ve had our number here for a stretch.\u201d"

      "text": "An 18-year-old was arrested for alleged involvement in the latest in a string of incidents involving fans at WNBA games launching brightly colored sex toys toward the court during game action.\nKaden Lopez was taken into custody by Phoenix police while inside PHX Arena after he allegedly threw a \u201cgreen dildo\u201d and struck a man and his 9-year-old niece during Tuesday\u2019s contest between the Mercury and Sun, FOX 10 Phoenix reported on Wednesday night.\nLopez was booked on suspicion of disorderly conduct, assault and public display of explicit sexual material and appeared in court on Wednesday.\nThe Phoenix Police Department confirmed to The Post that an adult male was arrested on Aug. 5, around 8:03 p.m. local time, related to the incident, and that the person had been cooperative with officers.\n\u201cUltimately, the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office will make the final decision on prosecution,\u201d a department spokesperson said.\nCourt documents viewed by FOX 10 stated that the male victim said that he and his niece had been watching the action, \u201cwhen something hit his back then fell to the ground next to them.\u201d\nThe documents indicated that he quickly realized that he had been struck with a sex toy and \u201cdesires prosecution.\u201d\nThe incident was captured on video, and an arena volunteer witnessed it before following Lopez, tackling him to prevent him from leaving and waited for authorities to arrive, FOX 10 reported.\n\u201cVideo footage shows Lopez, sitting in his seat, he retrieves the green dildo from his sweater front pocket then throws the dildo forward. He then stands up and leaves the area, the court document stated.\nLopez allegedly bought the sex toy the day before to take to the game.\nThe court docs stated that Lopez was remorseful for what he had done and called it a \u201dstupid prank that was trending on social media.\u201d\nPHX Arena and the WNBA want Lopez to be prosecuted for disorderly conduct, FOX 10 reported.\nThe WNBA did not immediately respond to questions from The Post.\nThe incident in Phoenix is just the latest in an epidemic of similar instances where fans have launched objects toward the court during games. The sex toys made their way onto the courts during a game between the Valkyries and Dream in Atlanta on July 29, the Valkyries and Sky in Chicago on Aug. 1, and the Fever and Sparks in Los Angeles on Aug. 5.\nThe incident in Los Angeles on Tuesday garnered plenty of attention after the sex toy nearly struck Fever forward Sophie Cunningham and Sparks guard Kelsey Plum quickly kicked the item off the floor.\nAt Barclays Center, a sex toy was thrown, but did not reach the court, and the same happened with the incident in Phoenix.\n\u201cThe safety and well-being of everyone in our arenas is a top priority for our league,\u201d the WNBA said in a recent statement. \u201cObjects of any kind thrown onto the court or in the seating area can pose a safety risk for players, game officials, and fans. In line with WNBA Arena Security Standards, any fan who intentionally throws an object onto the court will be immediately ejected and face a minimum one-year ban in addition to being subject to arrest and prosecution by local authorities.\u201d\nEarlier this week, 23-year-old Delbert Carver was arrested and is facing charges of disorderly conduct, public indecency/indecent exposure, and criminal trespass for the July 29 incident in Georgia."

      "text": "A school board meeting in California descended into explosive debate after a girls\u2019 volleyball team forfeited to an opponent with a transgender player.\nThe players on the Riverside Poly High School girls\u2019 volleyball team chose to forfeit last Friday\u2019s game against Jurupa Valley High School.\nMultiple parents previously told Fox News Digital the forfeit was in response to the presence of trans athlete AB Hernandez on the Jurupa Valley team.\nLocal parents showed up to the Riverside Unified School District board meeting on Thursday to speak out in support of the girls who forfeited and against the school district for its current gender policies, while others spoke in support of trans athletes in girls\u2019 sports.\nHernandez\u2019s mother, Nereyda Hernandez, showed up to defend AB\u2019s right to play in girls\u2019 sports, and condemned board member Amanda Vickers for previously interviewing with Fox News Digital about the forfeit last week.\n\u201cAmanda Vickers, you interviewed with Fox. You actually entertained and welcomed harassment to my child. You are a board member. You have an oath to protect, to support all children, not just the ones that fit your ideas, your beliefs,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\u201cWhen you allow or tolerate targeted harassment, whether online, in person or allowing false narratives to be spread at board meetings, you are only failing morally.\n\u201cMy daughter is not the problem. The problem is coordinated external efforts often led by individuals that travel from district to district\u2026 to spread fear and put parents against each other using religion as a shield for discrimination. This has nothing to do with fairness in sports and everything to do with erasing transgender children.\u201d\nOne mother, Maria Correo, spoke in support of the Riverside Poly players and condemned parents enabling male children to play in girls\u2019 sports.\n\u201cThe girls, great job. Poly girls, we stand with you. Keep fighting, because these parents that support their confused child are the problem,\u201d Correo said.\n\u201cIf my child was on drugs, I would love him, but guess what? I would tell him the truth; drugs are bad for you. I would not feed him more drugs.\u201d\nRiverside became a hotbed of controversy involving trans athletes in girls\u2019 sports last year during Hernandez\u2019s highly-publicized season and after a lawsuit was filed by two girls at Martin Luther King High School that alleged a trans athlete took one of the girls\u2019 varsity spots on the cross-country team.\nThe students at the school then began wearing the \u201cSave Girls Sports\u201d T-shirts every week in response after school administrators allegedly compared the shirts to swastikas, according to the lawsuit.\nOne mother, who only identified herself as Sandy R., urged the board members to adopt their own resolution to ban trans athletes from girls\u2019 sports, breaking from state law.\nOne school board in California has already done this \u2013 the Kern County Board of Education, earlier in August. Sandy R. referenced the lawsuit that had been filed by the two students.\n\u201cI will be so proud and so honored that an RUSD family will be the ones that take down an unlawful and unconstitutional California law,\u201d she said.\nPresident Donald Trump warned California and Gov. Gavin Newsom about the state\u2019s transgender policies in a post on Truth Social on Thursday.\n\u201cAny California school district that doesn\u2019t adhere to our Transgender policies, will not be funded. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\u201d Trump wrote in the post.\nRiverside Unified School District board meetings featured several tense moments that went viral last fall amid the controversy at Martin Luther King High School.\nMeanwhile, AB Hernandez was the focus of a national media firestorm in May during the athlete\u2019s run to a California girls\u2019 track and field championship.\nThe postseason meets that Hernandez competed in were met with protests by female athletes and their families, who often wore the \u201cSave Girls Sports\u201d T-shirts.\nIn July, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the California Department of Education (CDE) and CIF for its policies that have allowed biological males to compete in girls\u2019 sports across the state despite Trump signing an executive order in February to prohibit it.\nA bipartisan survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found a majority of California residents oppose biological male trans athletes competing in women\u2019s sports.\nThat figure included more than 70% of the state\u2019s school parents.\n\u201cMost Californians support requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams matching the sex they were assigned at birth,\u201d the poll stated.\n\u201cSolid majorities of adults (65%) and likely voters (64%) support requiring that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with. An overwhelming majority of public school parents (71%) support such a requirement.\u201d"
