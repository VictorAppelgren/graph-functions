  "description": "It\u2019s not easy letting go of a bond that felt so right a season ago, but there are ways to deal with this loss. Here are four clear signs you're being summer shaded.",
  "content": "Dating involves a fair bit of uncertainty. It\u2019s impossible to always know why you\u2019re losing a connection, especially when you constantly put in the effort to nurture your relationships.\n\nFirst, there was ghosting. Then there was . And now, there\u2019s \u201csummer shading.\u201d This new dating trend refers to a sudden pause in a budding romance during the hot summer months. It means one partner in the relationship (or situationship) is left \u201cin the shade\u201d as the other cools off the connection without warning.\n\nIf you were seeing someone and your contact with them slows down abruptly, it may indicate a sign of summer shading. You may find them avoiding plans, texts and even refusing to communicate with you about their sudden behavioral change. But, they don\u2019t break up with you or reject you straight away either.\n\nSummer shading is like pressing \u201cpause\u201d on the relationship, often with vague reassurances or hints that things may resume once summer fades into fall. expert Julie Nguyen shares four clear signs you\u2019re being summer shaded:\n\u2022 They text less often\n\u2022 They fill up their social calendar (but you\u2019re not in it)\n\u2022 They ghost you (but not entirely)\n\nThis might be because the person shading you is looking to travel, have beach days and make the most of their summer without being committed. They may also want to date casually or seek out multiple partners for \u201csummer fun,\u201d while blowing you off.\n\nA 2012 published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found that people in the U.S. tend to have more sex during two specific times of the year: winter holidays and early summers. Sexual activity goes up, especially during December and January, often called the \u201choliday season effect,\u201d while the early summer period from May to July is referred to as the \u201csummer vacation effect.\u201d\n\nBut just because someone is interested in sex does not mean they\u2019re looking for emotional depth. Some people may only intend to \u201chave fun\u201d without any strings attached. Someone that\u2019s summer shading you might try to make plans with you every once in a while, but they\u2019re likely not consistent. As a result, you may be left in the shade without even realizing it.\n\nHere are three ways to navigate being summer shaded by someone.\n\n1. Do Not Rely On Their Intent\n\nNguyen explains that when someone summer shades you, they hit you with excuses like \u201cI\u2019m slammed,\u201d \u201cMy friends are in town\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m traveling soon,\u201d despite never having mentioned it before, every time you try to make plans with them.\n\nIf you ask them to reschedule, they\u2019ll give you vague assurances like \u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out soon!\u201d Except, they never do, leaving you frustrated as you keep trying to make it work.\n\nSociologists call this kind of dodging : when someone uses unclear, open-ended words to avoid making actual commitments. In planning theory, it\u2019s a smart strategy used under pressure when people don\u2019t really want to take the lead but need to seem cooperative.\n\nLeaders tend to be intentionally vague in their language and visuals when forced to plan the course of their action in difficult situations. In dating, this vagueness is a soft \u201cno\u201d in disguise.\n\nThe person summer shading you doesn\u2019t want to commit, but they don\u2019t want to be the bad guy either, so they keep you hanging in the limbo of \u201csometime\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, if someone wanted to make a relationship work, they would give you a clear indication of it. If they\u2019re always vague, that is the plan. So, stop relying on their intent and start counting on their actions instead. This will help you gain the clarity you need to move on.\n\n2. Make Plans Of Your Own\n\nWhen you\u2019re being summer shaded, you\u2019ll always see the other person out with their friends, but they seem more reluctant to make plans with you. They came back from their summer trip, and now they have work to attend to or some friends\u2019 birthdays to organize \u2014 their calendar is always full. Any space they may have gets booked under \u201cme\u201d time, so you never find out if they actually have any time for you or not.\n\nThe more it happens, the more disposable you start to feel. If their schedule only clears up for you when it\u2019s convenient or when no one else is around, it can make you feel like a backup plan, not someone they\u2019re actually excited to see.\n\nThis is why you need to deprioritize them and start making time for yourself. Start taking care of yourself by nourishing yourself with food, sleep, exercise, beloved hobbies or even your own travel plans.\n\nIn the summer, you\u2019re also likely to find other friends to hang out with or even someone else to date that would value your time and connection more. Do not make someone your sole priority, especially if you\u2019re not theirs.\n\n3. Do Not Let Them Treat You Like A Backup Plan\n\nWhen a relationship\u2019s been put on ice, the other person refuses to let go of you entirely. They never fully ghost you, but they never treat you that well either. They may even leave you wondering if you\u2019re together at all.\n\nBut why do such people keep others as backups? While a fear of commitment or a lack of interest in serious relationships may play a role, a 2017 published in Communication Research Reports found that people who are more sexually unrestricted, i.e., open to casual sex and multiple partners and high on sensation-seeking (seeking thrill or excitement) are more likely to have \u201cback burner\u201d connections.\n\nIt\u2019s always best to rely on their actions rather than words, especially if you don\u2019t know them too well or if they seem too unresponsive. Their mixed signals are not a sign of emotional availability.\n\nIf someone keeps you second-guessing and canceling plans time and time again, even when you tell them you\u2019re eager to see them, they\u2019re likely only keeping you around as an option.\n\nYou may find the duration between their responses getting longer and the texts and calls getting shorter or stopping entirely. Their \u201cLet\u2019s catch up soon\u201d message may keep replaying in your head, but you almost never get to see them and spend quality time with them during the summer months.\n\nIf this is the case, it\u2019s time to assess their intent, as well as your own. Ask yourself if you want something short-term or if you\u2019re looking for something serious. If your date has moved on, so should you. Don\u2019t let someone steal your joy.\n\nEnjoy the season and spend time with those who truly care. Catch up with your friends and family, go to the beach and go on holiday. But don\u2019t pace around your room and check your phone all day long for a text or a call that may never come.\n\nBeing summer shaded can make you feel lonely, even if you\u2019re still talking to someone. Take this science-backed test to find out how it\u2019s affecting you:",

      "text": "\u201cOrbiting\u201d is a dating trend that describes a situation where someone from your past, often an ex-lover or a person with whom you once shared romantic feelings, maintains a presence in your life, primarily in the online sphere, without engaging in meaningful interaction.\nThey remain in the periphery of your life, occasionally liking your posts, watching your stories and leaving comments, but never fully reestablishing contact or making their intentions clear.\nThere are several motivations behind an orbiter hovering over someone:\n- Difficulty letting go. The struggle to sever all ties with someone you still harbor feelings for can be emotionally challenging.\n- Dopamine reward. Continuously checking an ex-love\u2019s social media profiles can provide dopamine boosts, acting as a reward for curiosity, even if it doesn\u2019t aid in the healing process.\n- Backup option. Some individuals engage in orbiting to keep their former partner as a potential fallback option in case other relationships falter.\nWhile this behavior may not seem harmful at first, it can have negative psychological and emotional consequences for those who find themselves on the receiving end. This seemingly harmless digital behavior can take a turn for the worse in several ways, here are three:\n1. Orbiting May Turn Into Real-Life Stalking\nOrbiting often begins innocently but can take a dangerous turn. Some individuals who orbit you may become obsessed, seeking information beyond what\u2019s available online. They might show up at places you frequent, send unsolicited messages or try to track your movements.\nA 2019 study defines stalking as repetitive conduct by the perpetrator that induces a fear of harm in the victim. It involves tactics like surveillance, life invasion, intimidation and deception, often involving your family and friends.\nStalking can have far-reaching consequences, leading to public humiliation, life interference and even potential repercussions for your loved ones. It can also involve threats of assault.\nThis shift from online to real-life stalking endangers your safety and well-being. Tread carefully and be vigilant in recognizing and addressing such behaviors. Do not shy away from bringing suspicious behavior up to your loved ones or authorities.\n2. You Would Be Confused About Mixed Signals And, Hence, Stuck\nFrequent likes, views or comments from someone you once had a close connection with can send mixed signals and keep you confused.\nYou might find yourself questioning their intentions and wondering if they are still interested in rekindling the relationship. This confusion can keep you emotionally stuck, preventing you from moving forward and finding closure. It\u2019s crucial to recognize that orbiting doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate genuine interest or commitment. Rather, it creates a false perception of emotional investment.\nTheir constant monitoring gives the impression that they care because they are watching, but in reality, it requires minimal effort and is the least someone can do to maintain a presence in one\u2019s life. Clinging to this false hope can hinder your personal growth and emotional healing.\n3. Confirmation Bias Might Convince You That They Still Love You\nConfirmation bias refers to individuals\u2019 inclination to favor information that aligns with their preexisting expectations and convictions. It affects the choices people make regarding the information they seek or avoid, shapes their processing and interpretation of information and influences how they remember it in their memory.\nWhen someone continues to orbit your online presence, you may interpret their actions through a lens of nostalgia and believe that they still hold romantic feelings for you, even in the absence of concrete evidence.\nIn reality, orbiting can be a self-serving behavior for the person doing it, providing them with a sense of control or an emotional safety net without any genuine commitment. Clinging to the belief that they still love you can trap you in emotional turmoil and hinder your pursuit of healthier, more fulfilling relationships.\nConclusion\nWhile orbiting may seem innocuous on the surface, it can have serious negative consequences for your emotional well-being and personal safety. Recognizing these risks should prompt you to take protective measures. If you encounter such a situation, set boundaries, create distance, and seek support from loved ones or a mental health professional to manage the complex emotions it evokes."

      "text": "Loneliness In Intimate Relationships Scale\nTake this test to understand why you feel lonely, even when around your partner.\nBy Mark Travers, Ph.D. | December 8, 2023\nThe Loneliness in Intimate Relationships Scale is a newly introduced scale designed to gauge the experience of \"loneliness\" within intimate relationships, which can influence one\u2019s emotional, physical and spiritual well-being even when in close proximity to their partner.\nThe scale evaluates three primary factors that reflect loneliness in such relationships: feelings of detachment or emotional distance from the partner, sensations of hurt or emotional pain and elements of guilt tied to the relationship dynamics.\nGiven that the nuanced experience of loneliness within intimate unions has not been extensively explored in the past, the scale serves as a crucial instrument in understanding, assessing and delving deeper into the facets of this specific kind of loneliness and its implications.\nYou can take this test here. Please follow all of the steps to receive your results.\nStep 1: Rate, on a scale of Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree, how closely each statement aligns with your feelings or thoughts during a particular time or situation when you experienced loneliness in your relationship.\nReferences: Rokach A, Sha'ked A, Ben-Artzi E.

      "text": "Dealing with ghosting can be deeply demoralizing. You\u2019re texting them regularly, feeling more and more emotionally invested, until one day, they suddenly stop all forms of communication, leaving you in a state of uncertainty.\nIf you\u2019re someone that\u2019s been ghosted, you may feel a range of emotions, including anxiety, confusion and self-doubt. You likely start wondering if you\u2019ve said or done something wrong.\nWhatever the reason, the distress you feel from the harshness of the perpetrator\u2019s sudden disappearance is undeniable. Social rejection can be tough to digest for all of us, and it\u2019s especially difficult in the case of ghosting, where there\u2019s no clear answer as to what may have provoked the other person to react this way.\nAt least 25% of the young adult population has faced it at some point, as per a 2018 study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships. All of us seek closure whenever a relationship ends, for our emotional, psychological and physical wellbeing, but we rarely get it when it comes to ghosting.\nA new 2025 study published in Personal Relationships conduced two studies to find the difference in responses between those who are ghosted versus those who get explicitly rejected.\nHere are two key ways ghosting impacts you, as opposed to outright rejection:\n1. It Leaves You In A State Of Uncertainty\nAs a 2020 study published in Personal Relationships explains, ghosting differs from typical relationship breakdowns. Ghosting initiators can \u201cvanish\u201d anytime digitally, without any accountability, which leaves the one ghosted hurt and distressed.\nUnlike a typical relationship, it lacks a breakup storyline with a beginning, middle and end. It can also happen multiple times, with a person stopping communication and initiating contact months later, known as zombieing.\nYou don\u2019t need to be in a serious or official relationship to be ghosted. It can happen in any type of personal communication, as long as there was some expectation that the conversation or connection would continue.\nDue to the lack of typical relationship rules, ghosting leaves people wondering if they were actually rejected, even though they clearly feel so. This lack of clarity causes people to stay emotionally attached to the ghoster. They may even imagine getting back together, even though it could lead to the cycle repeating.\n2. It Encourages Unhealthy Behaviors That Delay Healing\nA lot of people shy away from double texting someone who rejected them. This includes people who were either rejected directly or ghosted. However, the researchers of the 2025 study noticed something interesting. After 24 hours without a response, ghosted individuals showed an interest in regaining contact with the rejector, almost as much as people who were accepted.\nHowever, those who suffered explicit rejection did not act the same way, potentially to avoid future loss and embarrassment.\nThis could be because ghosted individuals often try to piece together what went wrong. This leads to them to \u201cstalk\u201d or check up on the other person\u2019s social media or dating profile to find clues of what they\u2019re up to, and what could have gone wrong between them.\nIronically, this search for answers often leaves them feeling more upset, confused and longing for the one who rejected them. They hold onto hope longer, so their psychological recovery slows down, especially on days when they initiate contact.\nEven after realizing they may have been ghosted, people often convince themselves it\u2019s not over. They\u2019re more likely to reinitiate contact or keep checking their phones for a response. This false hope can drag out their heartbreak far longer than a direct, respectful rejection might.\nIf you\u2019ve ever considered ghosting because you\u2019re not interested in pursuing a romantic connection anymore, the best thing you can do is be kind, and direct. Not only does it reduce distress and guilt on your part long-term, it also gives the other person a sense of closure, even if it stings a little at first.\nThe ghosted person is unlikely to initiate contact repeatedly if you just do them the favor of telling them you\u2019re not interested, instead of leaving them in the dark.\nIf you\u2019re the one dealing with a ghoster, remember not to take it personally. There may be several reasons why they may not have been able to re-initiate contact. Perhaps, they really were dealing with a personal circumstance, fear any potential form of conflict or just failed to communicate their lack of interest clearly.\nWhatever their reason, their silence is a clear indicator that it\u2019s time for you to move on. As frustrating as it is, you may have to accept that no answer is an answer, and that moving forward only creates space for connections where direct communication will be a given.\nBeing ghosted can feel like being broken up with, even if you weren\u2019t yet in a relationship. Take this science-backed test to gauge how you\u2019re coping with these feelings: Breakup Distress Scale"

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses a new dating trend called 'summer shading,' where one partner in a budding romance suddenly reduces communication during the summer months, leaving the other feeling neglected. Signs of being summer shaded include decreased texting, a busy social calendar excluding the other person, and vague reassurances about future plans. The article also offers advice on how to cope with this situation, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing oneself and recognizing mixed signals as indicators of a lack of commitment.",
