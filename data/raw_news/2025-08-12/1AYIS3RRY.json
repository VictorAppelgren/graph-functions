  "description": "The U.S. stock market rallied to records after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.",
  "content": "Trader William Lawrence works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, July 29, 2025.\n\nThe U.S. stock market rallied to records on Tuesday after data suggested inflation across the country was a touch better last month than economists expected.\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 rose 1.1% to top its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 483 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.4% to set its own record.\n\nStocks got a lift from hopes that the better-than-expected inflation report will give the Federal Reserve leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September.\n\nLower rates would give a boost to investment prices and to the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment. President Donald Trump has angrily been calling for cuts to help the economy, often insulting the Fed\u2019s chair personally while doing so.\n\nBut the Fed has been hesitant because of the possibility that Trump\u2019s tariffs could make inflation much worse. Lowering rates would give inflation more fuel, potentially adding oxygen to a growing fire. That\u2019s why Fed officials have said they wanted to see more data come in about inflation before moving.\n\nTuesday\u2019s report said U.S. consumers paid prices for groceries, gasoline and other costs of living that were overall 2.7% higher in July than a year earlier. That\u2019s the same inflation rate as June\u2019s, and it was below the 2.8% that economists expected.\n\nThe report pushed traders on Wall Street to increase bets that the Fed will cut interest rates for the first time this year in September. They\u2019re betting on a 94% chance of that, up from nearly 86% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\n\nThe Fed will receive one more report on inflation, as well as one more on the U.S. job market, before its next meeting, which ends Sept. 17. The most recent jobs report was a stunner, coming in much weaker than economists expected.\n\nSome economists warn that more twists and turns in upcoming data could make the Fed\u2019s upcoming decisions not so easy. Its twin goals are to get inflation to 2% while keeping the job market healthy. Helping one with interest rates, though, often means hurting the other.\n\nEven Tuesday\u2019s better-than-expected inflation report had some discouraging undertones. An underlying measure of inflation, which economists say does a better job of predicting where inflation may be heading, hit its highest point since early this year, noted Gary Schlossberg, market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. That helped cause some up-and-down swings for Treasury yields in the bond market.\n\n\u201cEventually, tariffs can show up in varying degrees in consumer prices, but these one-off price increases don\u2019t happen all at once,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. \u201cThat will confound the Fed and economic commentators for months to come.\u201d\n\nOther central banks around the world have been lowering interest rates, and Australia\u2019s on Tuesday cut for the third time this year.\n\nOn Wall Street, Intel\u2019s stock rose 5.6% after Trump said its CEO has an \u201camazing story,\u201d less than a week after he had demanded Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s resignation.\n\nCircle Internet Group, the company behind the popular USDC cryptocurrency that tracks the U.S. dollar, climbed 1.3% despite reporting a larger loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said its total revenue and reserve income grew 53% in its first quarter as a publicly traded company, which topped forecasts.\n\nOn the losing side of Wall Street was Celanese, which sank 13.1% even though the chemical company delivered a better profit than expected. It said that customers in most of its markets continue to be challenged, and CEO Scott Richardson said that \u201cthe demand environment does not seem to be improving.\u201d\n\nCardinal Health dropped 7.2% despite likewise reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and analysts said the market\u2019s expectations were particularly high for the company after its stock had already soared 33.3% for the year coming into the day.\n\nCritics say the broad U.S. stock market is looking expensive after its surge from a bottom in April. That\u2019s putting pressure on companies to deliver continued growth in profit.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 72.31 points to 6,445.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 483.52 to 44,458.61, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 296.50 to 21,681.90.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes edged up in China after Trump signed an executive order late Monday that delayed hefty tariffs on the world\u2019s second-largest economy by 90 days. The move was widely expected, and the hope is that it will clear the way for a possible deal to avert a dangerous trade war between the United States and China.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.1%, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell 0.5% for two of the world\u2019s bigger moves.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28% from 4.27% late Monday.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.73% from 3.76%.\n\nChoe writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "Most stocks fall as hopes weaken for a September cut to interest rates\n- Share via\nMost U.S. stocks slipped on Wednesday after doubts rose on Wall Street about whether the Federal Reserve will deliver economy-juicing cuts to interest rates by September.\nThe Standard & Poor 500 edged down by 0.1%, coming off its first loss after setting all-time highs for six successive days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 171 points, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%.\nStocks felt pressure from rising Treasury yields in the bond market after the Federal Reserve voted to hold its main interest rate steady. The move may upset President Trump, who has been angrily lobbying for lower interest rates, but it was widely expected on Wall Street.\nWhat may have surprised investors more was Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s pushing back on expectations that the Fed could cut rates at its next meeting in September. Besides Trump, two members of the Fed\u2019s committee have also been calling for lower rates to ease the pressure on the economy, and they dissented in Wednesday\u2019s vote.\nBut Powell would not commit to a September cut in rates, pointing to how inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, while the job market still looks to be \u201cin balance.\u201d\nA cut in rates would give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it could also risk fueling inflation when Trump\u2019s tariffs may be set to raise prices for U.S. consumers. The Fed\u2019s job is to keep both the job market and inflation in a good place.\nTrump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff on imports coming from India, along with an additional tax because of India\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, beginning on Aug. 1. That\u2019s when stiff tariffs Trump has proposed for many other countries are also scheduled to kick in, unless they reach trade deals that lower the rates.\n\u201cThe economy is in good shape, but it\u2019s in an unusual situation,\u201d Powell said.\nHe also said that the Fed will receive two months\u2019 worth of data on inflation, the job market and other economic indicators before it meets again to vote on rates in September. That could give the Fed more confidence that the risk of high inflation is no longer bigger than the risk of a weak job market, a combination that would prod officials toward lowering rates.\nPowell\u2019s comments drove traders to pare back bets on a cut in September. They now see just a 45% chance of that, down from a nearly 65% probability a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\nThe yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 3.93% from 3.86% late Tuesday. It tends to closely follow expectations for what the Fed will do with its overnight interest rate.\nThe 10-year Treasury, which also takes into account longer-term expectations for the economy and inflation, rose to 4.36% from 4.34%.\nA report earlier in the morning suggested the U.S. economy\u2019s growth was much stronger during the spring than economists expected. But underlying trends beneath the surface may be more discouraging.\n\u201cCutting through the noise of the swings in imports, the economy is still chugging along, but it is showing signs of sputtering,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.\nOn Wall Street, Humana rose 12.4% after the insurer and healthcare giant reported stronger results for the spring than expected. It also raised its forecasts for profit and revenue over the full year.\nVideo-game maker Electronic Arts climbed 5.7% after likewise topping Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\nCompanies are under pressure to deliver solid profit growth. They need to in order to justify the big jumps in their stock prices during recent months, which has caused some critics to say the broad U.S. stock market looks too expensive.\nTrane Technologies, whose stock came into the day with a 27.5% gain for the year so far, tumbled even though it reported a stronger-than-expected profit for the latest quarter. The heating, ventilation and air conditioning company\u2019s revenue came up short of analysts\u2019 estimates, as did its forecast for profit in the current quarter. It dropped 8.4%.\nFreeport-McMoRan, a copper producer with mines around the world, tumbled 9.5% after Trump signed an executive order to tax imports of copper at 50%.\nStarbucks slipped 0.2% after reporting a weaker profit than analysts expected as it tries to turn around its operations. The company is hoping to boost its performance through improved store operations and new products, including a cold foam protein drink.\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 7.96 points to 6,362.90. The Dow dropped 171.71 to 44,461.28, and the Nasdaq composite rose 31.38 to 21,129.67.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 1.4%, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 0.7% for two of the bigger moves.\nChoe writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "Wall Street ticks up to another record as GM and others show how tariffs are affecting them\n- Share via\nWall Street inched to another record Tuesday after some mixed profit reports, as General Motors and other big U.S. companies gave updates on how much President Trump\u2019s tariffs are hurting or helping them.\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index added 0.1% to the all-time high it had set the day before. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4%, though the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.4% from its own record.\nGeneral Motors dropped 8.1% despite reporting a stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected. The automaker said that it\u2019s still expecting a $4-billion to $5-billion hit to its results over 2025 because of tariffs and that it hopes to mitigate 30% of that. GM also said it will feel more pain because of tariffs in the current quarter than it did during the spring.\nThat helped to offset big gains for some home builders after they reported stronger profits for the spring than Wall Street had forecast. D.R. Horton rallied 17%, and PulteGroup jumped 11.5%. That was even as both companies said homebuyers are continuing to deal with challenging conditions, including higher mortgage rates and an uncertain economy.\nSo far, the U.S. economy seems to be powering through the uncertainty created by Trump\u2019s on-and-off tariffs. Many of Trump\u2019s proposed taxes on imports are on pause, and the next big deadline is Aug. 1. Talks are underway on possible trade deals with other countries that could lower the stiff proposals before they kick in.\nTrump said he reached a trade agreement with the Philippines after a meeting Tuesday at the White House, that will see the U.S. slightly drop its tariff rate for the Philippines without paying import taxes for what it sells there.\nCompanies are already feeling effects. Genuine Parts, the Atlanta company that sells auto and industrial replacement parts around the world, trimmed its profit forecast for the full year to incorporate \u201call U.S. tariffs currently in effect,\u201d along with its updated expectations for business conditions in the second half of the year.\nIts stock rose 7.6% after it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\nRTX fell 1.6% after cutting its forecast for profit in 2025 but also raising its forecast for revenue. It made the changes to incorporate what Chief Executive Chris Calio called \u201cour current assessment of the impact of tariffs,\u201d along with other changes anticipated from Washington\u2019s recent approval of big tax changes.\nCoca-Cola slipped 0.6% even though it delivered a stronger profit than forecast. Its revenue for the quarter only edged past analysts\u2019 expectations, and it said higher prices that it charged helped offset sales of fewer cases during the spring.\nOpendoor Technologies, a company that caught interest among investors looking for the next \u201cmeme stock\u201d that could rise regardless of how its profits are doing, lost momentum and dropped 10.3% to $2.88. It had climbed as high as $3.99 in the morning, more than quintuple its price of 78 cents from just two Fridays ago.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 4.02 points to 6,309.62. The Dow Jones industrial average added 179.37 points to 44,502.44, and the Nasdaq composite fell 81.49 points to 20,892.68.\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields sank as traders continue to expect the Federal Reserve to wait until September at the earliest to resume cutting interest rates.\nFed Chair Jerome H, Powell has been insisting he wants to see more data about how Trump\u2019s tariffs are affecting inflation and the economy before the Fed makes its next move. That\u2019s despite often angry criticism from Trump, who has been lobbying for more cuts to rates to happen sooner.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.34% from 4.38% late Monday.\nIn overseas markets, Japan\u2019s benchmark jumped and then fell back as it reopened from a holiday Monday after the ruling coalition\u2019s loss of its upper house majority in Sunday\u2019s election. The Nikkei 225 shed 0.1%.\nAnalysts said the market initially climbed on relief that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba vowed to stay in office despite the loss. But the electoral results have only added to political uncertainty and left his government without the heft needed to push through legislation.\nA breakthrough in trade talks with the U.S. might win Ishiba a reprieve, but there\u2019s been scant sign of progress in negotiating away the threat of higher tariffs on Japan\u2019s exports to the U.S.\nIndexes were mixed elsewhere in Asia and Europe.\nChoe writes for the Associated Press."

      "text": "Stocks push further into record heights\n- Share via\nThe U.S. stock market added to its record on Monday as Wall Street closed out a second straight winning month.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.5% in its first trading after completing a stunning recovery from its springtime sell-off of roughly 20%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 275 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.5%.\nStocks got a boost after Canada said it\u2019s rescinding a planned tax on U.S. technology firms and resuming talks on trade with the United States. On Friday, President Trump had said he was suspending talks with Canada because of his anger with the tax, which he called \u201ca direct and blatant attack on our country.\u201d\nOne of the main reasons U.S. stocks came back so quickly from their springtime swoon has been hope that Trump will reach deals with other countries to lower his stiff proposed tariffs. Otherwise, the fear is that trade wars could stifle the economy and send inflation higher.\nMany of Trump\u2019s announced tariffs are currently on pause, and they\u2019re scheduled to kick back into effect in a little more than a week.\nThe U.S. stock market being back at a record high could actually raise the risk of renewed escalations on tariffs, according to strategists at Deutsche Bank led by Parag Thatte and Binky Chadha. They point to the pattern in 2018 and 2019 of rallies for the market prompting escalations for tariffs, which then drove the market lower and led to subsequent pullbacks on tariffs, which then sparked rallies again.\n\u201cDespite the rhetoric to the contrary, this dynamic looks alive and well,\u201d the strategists wrote in a report. \u201cIn our view, beyond the market reaction, if negative impacts of tariffs on growth, earnings or inflation start to materialize, we will get further relents.\u201d\nOn Wall Street, Oracle\u2019s 4% rise was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. CEO Safra Catz said the tech giant \u201cis off to a strong start\u201d in its fiscal year and that it signed multiple large cloud services agreements, including one that could contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue two fiscal years from now.\nGMS\u2019 stock jumped 11.7% after the supplier of specialty building products said it agreed to sell itself to a Home Depot subsidiary in a deal that would pay $110.00 per share in cash. That would give it a total value of roughly $5.5 billion, including debt.\nLess than two weeks ago, another company, QXO, said it was offering to buy GMS for $95.20 per share in cash. After the announcement of the Home Depot bid, QXO\u2019s stock rose 3.9%, and Home Depot\u2019s stock slipped 0.6%.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise rallied 11.1% and Juniper Networks climbed 8.4% after saying they had reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice that could clear the way for their merger go through, subject to court approval. HPE is trying to buy Juniper in a $14 billion deal.\nBank stocks were also solid after the Federal Reserve said on Friday that they are financially strong enough to survive a downturn in the economy. JPMorgan Chase climbed 1%, and Citigroup gained 0.9%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 31.88 points to 6,204.95. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 275.50 to 44,094.77, and the Nasdaq composite gained 96.27 to 20,369.73.\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields fell ahead of several major economic reports later in the week. The highlight will be Thursday\u2019s jobs report. It\u2019s often the most anticipated economic data of each month, and it will come a day earlier than usual because of Friday\u2019s Fourth of July holiday.\nThe job market has remained relatively steady recently, even in the face of tariffs, but hiring has slowed. Economists expect Thursday\u2019s data to show another step down in overall hiring, down to 115,000 jobs in June from 139,000 in May.\nSuch data has helped keep the Federal Reserve on hold this year when it comes to interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said repeatedly that it\u2019s waiting for more data to show how tariffs will affect the economy and inflation before resuming its cuts to interest rates. That\u2019s because lower rates can fan inflation higher, along with giving the economy a boost.\nTrump, meanwhile, has been pushing for more cuts to rates and for them to happen soon. Two of his appointees to the Fed have said recently they could consider cutting rates as soon as the Fed\u2019s next meeting in less than a month.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.23% from 4.29% late Friday.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes dipped modestly in Europe after a more mixed finish in Asia.\nStocks fell 0.9% in Hong Kong but rose 0.6% in Shanghai after China reported its factory activity improved slightly in June after Beijing and Washington agreed in May to postpone imposing higher tariffs on each other\u2019s exports, though manufacturing remained in contraction.\nChoe writes for the Associated Press."
