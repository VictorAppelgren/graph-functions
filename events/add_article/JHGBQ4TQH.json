      "title": "Are Douglas Tires From Walmart Any Good? Here's What Users Say",
      "summary": "Douglas Tires, sold at Walmart and manufactured by Goodyear, are a budget-friendly option that many users find adequate for everyday commuting, with some reporting up to 60,000 miles of service, while others note rapid tread wear and belt separations. Premium brands such as Michelin, Continental, and Goodyear use higher‑quality compounds that deliver shorter stopping distances, better handling, quieter operation, and longer life, but at a higher price point. Tire longevity varies widely—some Douglas sets fail after three years, while others last 40–60k miles—so proper maintenance (alignment, rotation, pressure checks, shade parking, and cleaning) can significantly extend life. Overall, the choice between budget and premium tires hinges on budget, driving habits, climate, and the desired balance of performance versus cost.",
