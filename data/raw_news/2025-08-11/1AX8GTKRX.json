  "description": "This is going to ruffle a few Apple-shaped feathers.",
  "content": "In the early days of the smartphone revolution, Android owners used to envy the look and feel of the iPhone. But things have changed since a lot. I am a longtime iPhone owner who has been increasingly looking at the other side of the fence with envy, all because of Apple's stagnant innovation when it comes to its most prized and supposedly innovative product.\n\nThe iPhone Has Looked the Same for Almost a Decade\n\nIt used to be that getting a new iPhone felt like getting a brand-spanking new iPhone. As much as it pains me to write this, those days are long gone now. The last major design was the iPhone X in 2017 with its fullscreen appearance and the infamous notch.\n\nThese days? You could hand someone an iPhone from 2020 and an iPhone from 2025, and they'd be hard-pressed to notice the difference on first glance. If I'm going to hand over my hard-earned cash to Apple every year, I want people to see that I've upgraded. But Tim Cook & Co. have been stuck in this copy-paste design cycle where each \u201cnew\u201d model is a repackaged version of the last. A new colorway here, perhaps a slightly different corner radius there, physical buttons moved a few millimeters for no apparent reason except to make you buy new cases...\n\nAnd look at the iPhone launches... The magic that once made people line up overnight for a fresh new design is long gone. Nowadays, I need to buy a flashy case to make my iPhone stand out. When something looks more or less the same, it starts to feel like it's the same.\n\nI don't expect a brand-new design every year\u2014that's not feasible when you ship 200+ million iPhones in a product cycle. But I don't care how much Apple hypes up the camera or custom silicon because the excitement fizzles if my +$1,000 \u201cupgrade\u201d is mistaken for last year\u2019s model.\n\niPhones nowadays are more of a cosmetic update. It's like a fashion drop where they only change the color and maybe add some design tweaks and call it a day.\n\nCan Your iPhone Do This?\n\nThe excitement in the Android world has been palpable, with Samsung, Google, Motorola, Oppo, and others experimenting with weird form factors that gave us phones that fold in half like a sci-fi communicator or styluses that snap in and let you sketch with precision.\n\nIn Apple's world, you won't find phones with a secondary e-ink display (for improved battery life and readability in sunlight) and similar bizarre phones such as the YotaPhone series or the HiSense A9, because folks in Cupertino prefer to play it safe. And don't get me started on foldables. Yes, Apple is expected to release its first foldable iPhone next year, but it's been coming next year for several years now, and I'm sick and tired of waiting!\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung has proven that, yes, shape-transforming phones have some unique advantages and\u2014more importantly\u2014that people actually want and will buy these things. Stylus support? Not unless you\u2019re willing to haul around an iPad like a sketchbook. Quirky ideas like smartphones with dual-screens are brushed aside by Apple's executives, as if that kind of innovation is something they're too cool to even consider, let alone try.\n\nI get it, Apple has managed to introduce a string of category-defining products and sell them in volume by saying a thousand no's for every yes. The stubbornness might\u2019ve been charming in the early days of the smartphone revolution, when the competition was clunky and desperate. But as modern Android phones are pulling magic tricks, the iPhone\u2019s big new feature is\u2026 a dedicated camera shutter button and a slightly deeper 5x optical zoom.\n\nApple is pretending that innovation in the Android world doesn't exist, and that\u2019s dangerous; once iPhone owners\u2014especially the younger generation that aren't loyal to the brand\u2014get a taste of what\u2019s possible elsewhere, they start questioning their purchasing decision. Why pay premium prices for a phone that\u2019s allergic to experimentation?\n\nRemember when a new iOS update felt like Christmas morning? You\u2019d wake up, download it, and suddenly it felt as if you had bought a shiny new phone. Through the power of software alone, your iPhone felt sleeker, different, better. You were excited! But that kind of excitement no longer there. The reality is, iOS 18 has just not been that great, and neither have iOS 17, iOS 16, and older releases.\n\nAnd when iOS 26 drops this fall with its glassy design overhaul, installing it is going to feel like getting a slightly different shade of beige paint on your wall. Simulated light refractions around the buttons, icons, and other user interface elements will bring some excitement for a couple of days, but it's just a fresh coat of paint that won't hide the fact that the basic interaction model and other fundamentals have stayed and looked the same for too many years in a row to be tolerated anymore.\n\niOS 26 is more about keeping you inside Apple\u2019s ecosystem than giving you something fun or useful. More nudges to use built-in apps, even more pop-ups reminding you to buy iCloud storage, and more hidden settings that you have to dig through just to turn off things you never asked for in the first place.\n\nInstead of bold changes, recent iOS updates have been a parade of \u201cquality of life\u201d tweaks that could\u2019ve been quietly slipped in with a bug fix. Half the \u201cnew\u201d features in iOS releases are Apple catching up to things that Android or the jailbreak community did many years ago. The other half are just gimmicks that you forget about within a week.\n\nGoofy Emojis and the Image Playground App Are Embarrassing\n\nWhen Apple Intelligence was announced, the name alone made it sound like we were about to step into the future. Sleek AI-powered productivity with Apple's focus on privacy, smarter tools promising to save time, and next-level creativity with generative AI\u2014what could possibly go wrong?\n\nAs it turns out, a lot went wrong. We got cartoon faces and a doodle app that looks like it was designed for a middle school art class. The stupid Genmoji feature spits out overstyled faces that feel more like something from a novelty sticker pack than a billion-dollar technology powerhouse. It\u2019s as if Apple's executives said, \u201cLet's use AI for emoji, but make it cringe.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Image Playground has no reason to exist. Whereas today's AI models from OpenAI, xAI, and others are capable of creating photorealistic images and turning static images into video, Image Playground feels like training wheels for true AI image generation.\n\nIt's supposed to be this creative sandbox, but in reality, it is a playground in the toddler sense. I had a full five minutes of fun with Image Playground before I got bored and wandered off. I gave it a few more chances, but the results were so goofy that I stopped using it altogether.\n\nApple markets Genmoji and Image Playground as groundbreaking features, acting like iPhone owners have been dying to make a cartoon pizza wearing sunglasses. Really, Apple? This is your big leap into artificial intelligence? Genmoji and Image Playground are fluff dressed up as innovation. These features are insulting to anyone who actually wanted AI tools that help them work smarter, create faster, or solve problems.\n\nSiri stopped being impressive a long time ago. What was once a futuristic voice assistant in your pocket is now basically the punchline of every smart assistant joke. Ask Siri to set a timer, and it\u2019ll nail it; ask it to do anything even slightly complex, and you\u2019ll get a \u201cHere\u2019s what I found on the web\u201d like it\u2019s 2013 all over again.\n\nMeanwhile, Alexa is holding full conversations, Google Assistant can book a restaurant table, and the agentic capabilities in ChatGPT are ushering in a new era of productivity. Siri still struggles to understand half your sentences. Voice assistants have been around for over a decade, but Apple still hasn\u2019t figured out how to make Siri feel smart and actually useful.\n\nBut wait, Apple is rebuilding Siri with AI smarts. The problem? Those upgraded features have been delayed until 2026, and Apple is already being sued for over-promising and under-delivering. If you\u2019re going to hype a reinvention, maybe have it ready and, you know, actually working before the next iOS update cycle? And stop making iPhone advertisements promoting vaporware!\n\nSiri remains a clunky reminder that Apple\u2019s AI game is years behind. Siri's AI delay isn\u2019t just embarrassing \u2014 it\u2019s proof that Apple's exectuives have been asleep at the wheel.\n\nApple calls it the Dynamic Island. Non-Apple users call it what it is: a giant hole in the screen. While Android manufacturers are shrinking camera cutouts to pinprick dots or hiding them entirely, the iPhone still wears this massive black blob at the top of the screen like a badge of honor. The Dynamic Island interrupts videos and photos, and eats into games I play.\n\nI'm sorry, but no amount of cutesy animations and handy status updates will make me forget the Dynamic Island is there. Apple had years to innovate a cleaner solution, and it's apparently coming in the form of under-screen Face ID in time for the twentieth anniversary iPhone in 2027, but I'm sick and tired of waiting.\n\nA 60Hz display on a premium phone is an insult in 2025. At a time when many sub-$300 budget Android phones are rocking silky-smooth 120Hz screens, Apple is still selling iPhones that refresh like it\u2019s 2018. Scrolling on a 60Hz iPhone feels sluggish, and animations look dated. Once you\u2019ve seen a 120Hz display in action, going back to 60Hz feels like watching a flipbook.\n\nIf you want a 120Hz iPhone, you must opt for a thousand-dollar iPhone Pro model, as if that's a premium feature. If Apple wants to keep calling the iPhone a premium smartphone experience, it either needs to stop charging flagship prices for specs that scream mid-range or stop limiting 120Hz screens to pricier iPhone Pros. Because right now, the cheapest Androids are outclassing the iPhone in one of the most obvious, visible ways possible.\n\nApple used to set the pace for the industry. But nowadays, it is just coasting on brand loyalty. Meanwhile, its competitors are racing ahead with bolder designs and real innovation.\n\nThe iPhone may be \u201ciconic,\u201d but it's no longer innovative. It\u2019s stagnant, predictable, and overpriced. If Apple is unwilling to take risks, maybe I should and simply... switch?",

      "text": "Modern phones have mostly converged into basic shapes with common materials. It hasn't always been this way, though. There have been some truly strange design and function decisions over the years. Let's take a look at some of the weirdest.\nLike in our list of the ugliest phones of all time, many of the phones in this list are pretty old. The beginning of the mobile phone era saw companies taking a lot of risks and everyone was trying to figure out what people wanted. That led to some big hits and some major \"what were they thinking?\" moments. Enjoy.\nMicrosoft Kin\n\"Bizarre\" doesn't always mean \"bad,\" but it also doesn't mean the device was a success. The Microsoft Kin was a strange device with some very interesting ideas. Ultimately, it didn't sell very well, but it was certainly bizarre.\nThe Kin was launched at a weird time. It was right before Microsoft decided to go all-in with Windows Phone 7. The user interface on the Kin has similar vibes to what would eventually become Windows Phone, but this wasn't a smartphone. It was a very small---and cute---feature phone with a slide-out keyboard.\nSadly, the cute-ness didn't matter. The Kin---which was actually several different models---was basically dead on arrival.\nMotorola Backflip\nThere are a lot of ways to put a physical keyboard on a phone. You can flip it, slide it, and even swivel it. Motorola took the flipping concept and used it in a very strange way, with the keyboard on the back of the phone.\nA typical flip phone has the keyboard fold to meet the screen, both protected inside when closed. The Motorola Backflip had the keyboard behind the display and you would flip it forward to have the keyboard underneath the display.\nI think there's a reason why no other phone has done this. Why have the keyboard out all the time like that? It's never protected and your hands are always touching it when you hold the phone. Motorola's Flipout was a better idea.\nYotaphone\nSome bizarre ideas are actually good ideas. The Yotaphone attempted to solve a problem in a very unique way. LCD and LED displays eat up a lot of battery. What if you have a low-power display that you could use for simple tasks?\nThe Yotaphone had two displays: On the front, a typical full-color smartphone display on the front. On the back, an e-ink display like you'd find on a Kindle or other eReader. The idea was you could save power by using the e-ink display. It was actually a pretty cool idea, but it never really caught on.\nToshiba G450\nYou're looking at the photo of the Toshiba phone above. I probably don't need to tell you why this is a bizarre phone, but I will anyway. What's going on here?\nThe number buttons and display are spread out across three round sections and the entire device is the shape of a contacts case. It's an incredibly strange-looking phone. I'm sure it's very comfortable to hold, but it just looks weird. Futuristic in a bad way.\nSiemens Xelibri 6\nSeimens had a whole line of phones under the \"Xelibri\" brand in 2004. The most bizarre of the bunch was the Xelebri 6. Imagine making a phone out of a makeup compact. That's exactly what this phone is.\nIt opens with a literal mirror on one side, with a small display in the middle. The number buttons were spread out in an array around the center of the bottom. And on top of it all is the tiny navigation pad and bold gold color.\nOf all the phones on this list, the Siemens Xelibri 6 is the most bizarre because it was basically designed to be that way. Some phones end up being weird on accident, but Seimens was specifically doing for something very different, and it succeeded."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/why-i-want-an-e-ink-phone/",
      "text": "Summary\n- E-ink screens can feel easier on the eyes due to the lack of a backlight, external light dependency, and optional front lighting.\n- E-ink devices may promote healthier phone habits by decreasing streaming and promoting reading.\n- E-ink screens provide a less distracting interface, simulate writing on paper, and can extend battery life on smartphones.\nE-readers have shown us the appeal of e-ink screens. The Light Phone 2 crammed this eye-friendly display technology into a phone. I want to see this technology come to smartphones. Let me tell you why.\nEasier on the Eyes\nI have carried around a Light Phone 2 for years. I loved the look of that tiny, credit-card sized phone with its minimal e-ink display. After a while, I returned to using a smartphone, but I wish that choice didn't mean having to give up e-ink.\nIn other parts of the world, it doesn't. There is a line of Hisense e-ink smartphones released in China. You can try running them elsewhere, but they don't work well in the States. If these phones were available here, I would likely have bought one.\nI find e-ink feels less straining on my eyes than conventional LCDs. Without a backlight, I would not spend hours with particles beaming directly into my irises. Sure, there isn't clear evidence yet whether blue light from displays is harmful, but that doesn't mean it's pleasant.\nLike with using pen and paper, e-ink leaves me more dependent on external light sources. That means I'm more likely to use my phone in a setting with better lighting and put it down when the lighting isn't cooperating.\nI know, not using your device in the dark sounds downright primitive at this point. That's why e-ink devices come with front-lighting. This makes the screen glow, but the light comes from the sides of the screen rather than behind. It shines down onto the text you're reading, rather than out toward your face.\nE-Ink Helps Form Healthier Habits\nFront-lighting gets the job done, but I find it off-putting and consider this reason to wait for the sun to come back up to read instead.\nThere are certain other use cases e-ink isn't well suited for. While you can watch a video on newer e-ink displays and actually have an idea what's going on, it feels more like watching someone flip pages rapidly rather than watching a cartoon on a TV. It works, but it's not exactly fluid.\nThis means you don't need to download apps to restrict how much time you spend on video-streaming apps. You're simply not going to want to use Netflix or Max. TikTok is much less appealing. You won't fall down the YouTube rabbit hole.\nYou won't want to spend much time on Instagram either, regardless of whether you prefer video or photos. E-ink does a better job with the latter, but images still lack the vivid colors you get from an ultra high-resolution OLED panel.\nSome games remain playable, but unless you're working on a crossword or playing Wordle, they aren't particularly fun.\nThis might sound like an e-ink phone would be unusable, but rather it just means you would have to use it differently.\nLess Streaming, More Reading\nIf e-ink displays aren't great for so much of what we do on our phones, why want one? They're far better for reading. Personally, this is something many (if not most) of us do much more of on our devices. We read texts, email, webpages, and social media posts. With e-ink, it's also more tempting to dive into ebooks.\nIf the idea of your phone doubling as your eReader sounds weird to you, check out the Boox Palma. Boox advertises it as a small, pocketable eReader. Really, it's an e-ink Android phone without the cellular modem. Many reviews, including our own review of the Boox Palma, point out how much of a delight the eReader is to use.\nI love the idea of a portable eReader that can be used to place calls, send texts, and draft email. It's good for the stuff I find most important about using a phone and discourages many of the things I consider distractions.\nA Less-Distracting Interface\nIt's not only the animations that take a hit. E-ink screens give icon designers more restrictions, limiting their ability to make their designs jump out at us as we swipe through our app drawers. This puts more control back in our hands, helping us resist the efforts of many of the world's best designers attempting to make us click on their team's app over doing something else.\nWhat do alternative Android launchers do when they attempt to dumb down your phone? Often, they switch to a monochrome color palette and, if they don't do away with them entirely, replace icons with simple outlines and shapes. This is the same thing companies do when designing interfaces for e-ink devices.\nE-ink screens do better with simple layouts than they do with gradients and animations. This makes the devices less eye-catching. It's hard to get excited about a presentation showing off the new home screen on a Nook GlowLight, yet enough of us have come to the conclusion that that's a good thing. Give us something straightforward that helps us do the task at hand and then encourage us to put the phone back down when we're done.\nIt's Like Writing on Paper\nWant to know why people buy the reMarkable tablet? Just like e-ink better simulates the experience of reading a physical book, this type of panel also helps replicate what it's like to write on paper.\nI love using a stylus with my Android phone. One of my favorite things about my foldable Galaxy Z Fold 5 is the extent to which writing in it feels like carrying around a Moleskin notebook. As an aside, I bought mine for around 50% less than MSRP\u2014you can save massively on Samsung phones with enough research.\nA foldable e-ink phone would take this to the next level, but I wouldn't complain about seeing an e-ink version of a slab like the Galaxy S Ultra. That would be a delight to write on, too.\nYou wouldn't be limited to writing, either. Color e-ink is an established technology at this point, one making advancements each year. If working on an iPad feels like using markers, drawing with e-ink feels like bringing out the color pencils. I'm not saving one is better than the other. Both have their place, and it's great to have the option. We do have this choice when it comes to tablets (shout out to the Boox Tab Ultra C and similar slates), but it would be great to see this come to phones.\nGet More Life Out of Our Batteries\nScreens are the most demanding component in our phones. This is why screen-on time is a much smaller number than standby time. E-ink screens don't eliminate the gap between these two numbers, but they can bring them much closer. Look at how much battery life you can get out of a Kindle versus an iPad.\nDon't expect miracles here. The Boox tablets intended for daily office work, like the Boox Tab Ultra C Pro, still need a top-up at the end of the day if you're using them as heavily as you would a laptop. E-ink uses power whenever the screen refreshes. That means you see big gains when doing activities where the screen doesn't change often, such as reading, but you'll still see power dip when the screen is changing often, such as when writing. Still, the improvements are there, and you have greater control over extending battery life even when you aren't turning things off or using power saver modes.\nIt's unlikely an e-ink smartphone will ever become the default choice for most people. Light decided to embrace an OLED panel for the Light Phone 3, saying half of the people who returned their Light Phone 2 did so because they couldn't get used to the refresh rate of the display. E-ink does come with a bit of lag and other limitations. Using an e-ink phone is a conscious choice, but it's one some of us would absolutely love to make."

      "text": "Quick Links\nWith the iPhone 16, Apple has introduced a new Camera Control button. This lets you launch the Camera in an instant, access different photo settings, and capture the moment without moving your fingers. Here's how.\n1 Open the Camera App\nFirst and foremost, pressing the Camera Control button instantly opens the Camera app. No matter which app you're currently using, the moment you press the button, it takes you to the viewfinder in the Camera app. This shortens the time that goes into opening the app manually.\nIf you haven't got the hang of the button and end up pressing it accidentally, there's something you can do about it. Simply go to Settings > Camera > Camera Control, and select \"Double Click\" under \"Launch Camera.\" Now, the button will require a double-click to open the Camera app, reducing the chances of false inputs.\nIn my experience with the Camera Control button, I've found that it doesn't open the camera from the lock screen, contrary to the information available online. Instead, pressing the button once simply wakes up the lock screen, and it is only when the screen is lit that the button launches the Camera app.\n2 Hold Lightly for Clean Previews\nThe Camera Control button on an iPhone 16, like a shutter button on a professional DLSR or mirrorless camera, recognizes varying pressure levels. As a result, it can distinguish between a light press (accompanied by haptic feedback), a light hold, and a complete click.\nUpon holding the button lightly, the Camera app hides all the on-screen controls, such as the shutter, flip camera, and zoom buttons at the bottom, for a clear look at the subject. However, you can still see the little overlay on the right, which, by default, highlights the current zoom level.\nIf you wish to retain the screen overlays, turn off the feature within the Settings app. Head to Settings > Camera > Camera Control and press the toggle beside Clean Preview.\n3 Click to Take a Photo\nOnce you're in the Camera app, a light press engages Clean Preview (while retaining the side overlay), and a complete click captures a picture (widens the overlay for a second). It might sound confusing, but you'll get the difference between a light press and a click when you start using the Camera Control button. It will make sense when you feel it for yourself.\n4 Hold to Shoot a Video\nYou can also record a video with the Camera Control button. Simply click and hold the button to start recording a video, and let go when you want it to end. Yes, this is a convenient way to start a video recording, but you can't record longer videos with it, as it will tire your finger.\nAlso, I don't like how the Camera Control button can't control the zoom levels while recording a video, given it supports sliding gestures (which we'll come to in a bit). The only way to zoom in/out during a video is by using the on-screen buttons or pinching gestures with your other hand.\n5 Slide to Adjust the Zoom\nApart from a light press and click, the Camera Control button also supports slide gestures. Once you're in the Camera app, slide your thumb up on the button to zoom in and slide down to zoom out. The changing zoom levels are shown as an overlay on the screen (next to the Camera Control button).\nNeedless to say, the phone switches through the camera lenses as you zoom in or out. The slide gesture might not work the first time, which looks like a measure to avoid accidental inputs. But it works fine for all subsequent gestures.\n6 Switch Between Camera Features\nSo far, you've learned about the basic inputs supported by the Camera Control button. Now, it's time to combine all of them to explore the camera options available in a particular mode.\nWhile lightly pressing the button brings up the zoom slider in the side overlay, a light double-press brings up the available camera features, including Exposure, Depth, Photographic Styles, and Tones. You can slide up/down between the options, and upon reaching the desired one, lightly press to select it. I'm listing down the steps in an ordered list so that it's easy to follow.\n- Double-press lightly to view all the camera options.\n- Slide to browse through the options.\n- Lightly press to select.\nOnce you've selected a camera feature, let's say Depth, sliding up or down the Camera Control button increases or decreases the depth-of-field. Similarly, you can adjust the exposure, switch between the cameras, apply different Photographic Styles, and lighten or deepen the tone of an image.\n7 Customize the Light Press Force\nYou can even customize the light-press force it takes to engage the Camera Control button within the Camera app. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Camera Control, and select Lighter, Default, or Firmer under \"Light-Press Force.\"\n8 Open the Magnifier or QR Code Scanner\nBy default, clicking the Camera Control button opens the Camera app on your iPhone 16. However, you can customize what the button does, including opening the built-in Code Scanner or Magnifier tools. Go to Settings > Camera > Camera Control, and select the required option from the list of apps at the bottom of the screen.\n9 Open Third-Party Camera Apps\nIf you prefer a third-party camera app, like Snapchat or Instagram, over the native Camera app, you can program the Camera Control button to launch it. In the Camera Control settings menu, select the required app from the available options toward the bottom.\n10 Access Visual Intelligence (Coming Soon)\nSoon, Camera Control will allow iPhone users to use Visual Intelligence, a point-and-search feature that helps gather more information about an object or a place by fetching online listings, reviews, and other publicly-available information.\nTo invoke Visual Intelligence, iPhone users must press and hold the Camera Control button. The feature will be released alongside the iOS 18.2 update.\nThe Camera Control button can take a while to win you over, and I can already see it being useful for Visual Intelligence. It also comes in handy to open the Camera app without having to wake up the lock screen and swipe on the shortcut.\nAs innovative as the Camera Control is, there's a learning curve involved in using it instead of the on-screen controls that people have become accustomed to over the years."

      "text": "Quick Links\nCompared to a PC, phones and tablets are fairly locked-down devices. Jailbreaking, rooting, and unlocking are all ways of bypassing their limitations, and doing things that manufacturers and carriers don\u2019t want you to do.\nSome countries have laws that prevent you from doing these things with the devices you paid for and legally own -- we won\u2019t get into those laws here.\nImage Credit: Blake Patterson on Flickr\nJailbreaking\nJailbreaking is the process of removing the limitations put in place by a device\u2019s manufacturer. Jailbreaking is generally performed on Apple iOS devices, such as the iPhone or iPad. Jailbreaking removes the restrictions Apple puts in place, allowing you to install third-party software from outside the app store. Some people may have the perception that jailbreaking is only used for piracy, but this isn not the case -- jailbreaking allows you to do things like change your iPhone's default browser and mail client. Essentially, jailbreaking allows you to use software that Apple doesn\u2019t approve.\nJailbreaking can be performed on other devices with similar limitations. For example, there is now a Microsoft Surface RT jailbreak that allows you to install unapproved desktop programs. (By default, Windows RT systems only allow you to run desktop applications written by Microsoft.) However, the desktop apps must be compiled for ARM, so you can't run any Windows desktop programs you already have, although open-source applications could be tweaked and recompiled for the Windows desktop on ARM.\nCompanies like Apple and Microsoft don\u2019t want you jailbreaking to get past a device\u2019s limitations -- so you can change the default programs on iOS or run third-party desktop applications on Windows RT. To perform a jailbreak, someone has to find a security vulnerability that allows them to \u201cexploit\u201d the device and get around the manufacturer safeguards.\nAndroid allows users to install third-party applications from outside Google\u2019s app store out-of-the-box and doesn\u2019t need to be jailbroken.\nRooting\nRooting is the process of gaining \u201croot access\u201d to a device. This is generally performed on Android devices, but rooting can also occur on other devices based on Linux, such as Nokia\u2019s now-retired Symbian operating system.\nOn Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems, the root user is essentially the same as the Administrator user on Windows. After rooting, you can grant specific applications access to root permissions, allowing them to do almost anything they want to the operating system. For example, an application with root permissions could uninstall system applications, install low-level system binaries, revoke permissions installed apps require, and do other crazy things. Almost anything you can do on a proper Linux system, you can do with root access on your phone.\nRooting gets around Android\u2019s security architecture and could potentially cause problems if users don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, so Android doesn\u2019t come rooted.\nOn some devices, rooting may need to be accomplished via a security exploit. Just like jailbreaking, manufacturers generally don\u2019t want you rooting. On some devices, such as Nexus devices (which are also intended for developers), rooting does not require a security vulnerability.\nUnlocking a Bootloader\nAndroid is an open-source operating system, so anyone can take the Android source code and create their own version of it. This allows custom ROMs like Cyanogenmod to exist. Lots of custom ROMs exist for Android -- everything from large projects that support a variety of devices to custom ROMs with a few theme patches some kid whipped up in his spare time.\nHowever, many Android phones come with locked bootloaders. A locked bootloader won\u2019t boot anything but the manufacturer-approved version of Android that comes with the device. Unlocking the bootloader allows you to install custom ROMs -- alternate versions of the Android operating system.\nThis isn\u2019t just useful to geeks -- Cyanogenmod brings new versions of Android to devices that manufacturers no longer update. It\u2019s a more vanilla Android experience, too -- many people like it because it is an alternative to the manufacturer-customized user interfaces most Android devices come with.\nUnlocking a device\u2019s bootloader may also require a security exploit, although companies like HTC and Motorola allow unlocking some devices. Nexus devices (which are also intended for developers) can be easily unlocked.\nUnlocking a boot loader can theoretically allow you to install non-Android operating systems, too. For example, you can install Ubuntu for phones or WebOS on a Galaxy Nexus with an unlocked bootloader. The desktop version of Ubuntu can be installed on the Nexus 7, too. Of course, the operating system must be built to be compatible with a specific device. These operating systems probably aren\u2019t particularly stable -- but developers can use the devices to run an alternate operating system while they work on it.\nImage Credit: Johan Larsson on Flickr\nUnlocking a Phone\nMany phones, particularly phones that come subsidized with a contract, come \u201clocked\u201d to a specific carrier. The phone is set up so that it can only be used on that carrier\u2019s network. If you insert a SIM card from a competing carrier into the phone, you will see a message indicating that the phone is locked and cannot be used with the SIM card.\nUnlocking a phone allows you to use it with a different SIM card -- either to use a different carrier while travelling or to take your current phone with you while switching to a new service provider.\nYou will generally need an unlock code to unlock the phone. Many carriers will unlock phones once your contract is up, while phones bought outright without a contract may not be locked to a carrier at all. There are ways to unlock phones without a carrier\u2019s permission, too.\nImage Credit: Kai Hendry on Flickr\nNot everyone has to jailbreak, root, or unlock their devices. However, the option is there -- and now you know why you might want to."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/apple-is-missing-out-on-an-important-trend-by-not-making-a-foldable-iphone/",
      "text": "Summary\n- Foldables offer compact storage with large screens when unfolded, but iPhone users currently cannot take advantage of these benefits.\n- Apple can redefine iPhone design with a folding model while putting the company's own spin on the concept.\n- On the flip side, Apple risks chasing a trend that is built heavily on nostalgia for the flip phones of the 90s.\nThere\u2019s one thing Apple isn\u2019t doing that nearly all its competitors are: foldable smartphones. People are flocking to these throwback gadgets that modernize the flip phones of the early 2000s. So, why isn\u2019t Apple delivering the goods on a folding iPhone?\nHere are four reasons why Apple should consider jumping on board this screen-bending trend (and one major reason why it shouldn\u2019t).\nFoldables Are Great for Small Pockets\nI wear jeans with big enough pockets to fit my iPhone 15 Pro Max, a luxury afforded by my over-six-foot height. However, this is certainly not the case for everyone. The size of modern smartphones has resulted in devices that many people struggle to comfortably carry around.\nThe flip phone variety of folding phones solves this problem by compacting into half their vertical length. For example, this year\u2019s Motorola Razr+ model is roughly 4 inches when folded, which is only a smidge larger than the original iPhone screen. Its nearly square shape is also much more manageable to shove in a pocket.\nThe only caveat is that when folded, the thickness of the phone doubles. Apple would need to reduce the thickness of its current iPhone line to avoid unnecessary bulk.\nA Smaller Package Hides a Bigger Screen\nBecause folding phones can cut their size in half, it means that there\u2019s a ton of wiggle room to create larger screens when unfolded. For example, the unfurled length of the Razr+ is 6.9 inches (that\u2019s .2 inches bigger than the iPhone 15 Pro Max). It\u2019s a best-of-both-words scenario: smaller for storing, bigger for using.\nIn addition, the half-sized screen that sits on the folded front of the phone can display all the information available via iPhone lock screen widgets while cutting out the dead space taken up by wallpaper. It would be a functionality bump for Apple\u2019s phones to provide all this information in compact form, almost like an Apple Watch display.\nThe other style of foldable phone\u2014those which open vertically into tablets like the Pixel Fold and Galaxy Fold\u2014achieve the same bigger screen goal for people looking to upsize. They\u2019re the actualization of the common yet erroneous claims that standard smartphones are becoming so large that they might as well be tablets.\nHowever, these phones have some downsides you should understand before going big.\nFlip Phone Nostalgia Is Real\nI grew up in the cellphone-owning age in the early 2000s, making me the target demographic for the original Motorola Razr and other style-forward flip phones of the era. This very specific nostalgia has led to a Millennial culture wherein name-dropping the original Razr is still commonplace, and it\u2019s undoubtedly the driving factor behind the surge of interest in foldable smartphones.\nThere\u2019s a reason that ads for the modern iteration of the Razr evoke the original\u2019s future-hip vibe. Companies are always looking for ways to sell consumers a revival of their childhoods. For an entire generation, flip phones defined their younger years and smartphones represent adulthood. It\u2019s understandable why this reminder of the past is tantalizing.\nAt the same time, looking back isn\u2019t really Apple\u2019s brand.\nIt Would Shake Up What an iPhone Can Be\nUntil now, the iPhone\u2019s arrival marked a swift end to the days of phone hinges and tactile buttons. Folding screen technology has once again made flip phones cutting edge, while the commonplace smartphone form factor has remained largely static for the better part of two decades.\nApple therefore has the chance to capitalize on this burgeoning space with a design of its own that once again redefines what we conceive a cellphone to be, or alternatively to risk becoming old hat.\nThere are plenty of ways in which Apple could improve on existing technology, like reducing visible creases, installing back-facing cameras that work in folded mode, and setting the software standard for the new aspect ratios presented by these devices.\nFoldable smartphones are still a nascent field with plenty of room for improvement and change, meaning Apple\u2019s knack for pushing boundaries could help situate the iPhone brand once more as a trove of imagination.\nOne Reason Apple Shouldn\u2019t: Trends Are Fleeting\nThe counterargument to this line of thinking is also potent: the iPhone\u2019s flat design has endured all these years because it works. Offering a flip phone iteration would discard proven success to chase after a small subset of the mobile market. And Apple has never fancied itself to be a chaser.\nEven if Apple were to pioneer within the flip phone sector, the average consumer would see the move as bandwagoning in a space that already has a defining brand leading it. Meanwhile, many (or even most) iPhone users would find the transition jarring at best. While change always leads to initially wracked nerves, it can be particularly disruptive when saddled to devices central to people\u2019s lives.\nAn iPhone that suddenly asks tens of millions of people to change how they interact with their phones is a risk that\u2019s tough to take on what may just be a trend. Foldable screens will never have the same impact as, say, Bluetooth headphones did when Apple\u2019s initially removed the headphone jack.\nA foldable iPhone could exist alongside a continuation of the standard line, but the existing splintering of iPhone SKUs confuses people as-is. If you\u2019ve ever had to explain the different iPhones available to an older relative or anyone who doesn\u2019t follow tech, you know what I mean.\nIt would complicate things even further if Apple and other software and accessory manufacturers had to cater to an even wider array of iPhone form factors. My gut tells me that the company would be reluctant to do this without an assured hit.\nIn an ironic catch-22, folding smartphones may only become a mainstream mainstay if Apple gets in the race.\nWhile I\u2019m hungry for Apple to innovate on the iPhone\u2019s design, it\u2019s understandable why the company won't flip the script. The tech geek in me wants to see its take on a flip phone as there are tangible benefits that could flourish on the iPhone alongside Apple\u2019s touch of mastery, but perhaps this niche is best left to companies with a history in the field."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/siri-still-sucks-how-to-work-around-it/",
      "text": "Summary\n- Siri sucks for a variety of reasons, but setting it up from scratch, simplifying your commands, and using a button to activate it can help.\n- Alternatively, you can find workarounds to avoid Siri, with the help of Spotlight Search, Shortcuts, widgets, and the dictation feature.\nChatting to Siri can feel like an uphill struggle sometimes, which could be enough to deter you from using the assistant at all. To counter that, here are some tips for working with (or working around) Apple's troublesome digital assistant.\nWhat's Wrong with Siri?\nSiri's problems are multi-faceted, but we've grouped them into a few main issues.\nSiri Doesn't Activate When You Want\nGetting Siri to trigger can be a chore in and of itself, no matter what device you're using:\niOS 17 introduced the ability to just say \"Siri\" followed by your command, but the feature is still hit-and-miss. On an Apple Watch, \"Raise to Speak\" seems to have gotten worse over the years, to the point where half of your commands fail simply because Siri is still dozing. And whenever I try to summon Siri on my Mac, she pops up on my iPhone instead.\nSiri Frequently Mishears Words\nVoice assistants are most useful for executing commands quickly when you're otherwise engaged, like when you're cooking or driving. But perhaps the most common and frustrating issue is that Siri is still prone to mishearing or misinterpreting commands, making it useless for this.\nSay you want to add ingredients to a shopping list while you're covered in food and in no state to pick up an iPhone. Siri would be a brilliant solution, except you can't trust it to jot down the ingredients accurately.\nEven with a relatively neutral English accent, some of the colorful interpretations I regularly see include:\n- Maple Sarah: She sounds lovely but it's \"maple syrup\" I'm looking for.\n- Curry Paradise: There's probably plenty of \"curry powder\" in Curry Paradise.\n- Currency: \"Currants,\" see?\n- Ground Cuman: Not \"cumin.\" This one is just plain weird when you consider who the Cumans were.\nSiri Is Too Tied to Apple\nSiri is still heavily biased towards Apple's apps and services, which can be a problem if you'd rather use third-party alternatives. It's possible to append some Siri commands with \"in Google Maps,\" but many apps\u2014like Evernote or Facebook Messenger\u2014simply aren't compatible.\nThis takes some of the utility out of being able to issue quick commands. There is no \"default apps\" setting for Siri to learn your preferences, so even playing a song in Spotify using Siri requires additional work.\nThere's a Lot Siri Can't Do\nSometimes, Siri will stonewall your requests with an \"I'm sorry I can't do that\" type response. Occasionally, it will completely misinterpret your response and respond with something utterly bizarre.\nThe result of all this is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts type situation where you're not sure whether Siri will hear you, understand you, be able to carry out your request, or go off the rails and do something entirely unpredictable.\nBut there are some steps you can take to help improve Siri.\nHow to Make Siri Work Better\nIf you're determined to keep using Siri, you might want to follow the advice below to give yourself the best chance of success.\nSet Up \"Siri\" and \"Hey Siri\" Again\nIf Siri isn't hearing you when using your device hands-free, you can try setting it up again.\nOn an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch go to Settings > Siri & Search. Simply toggle \"Listen for\" to \"Off\" and then turn the feature on again. You'll be invited to set Siri up on your iPhone again, which can improve voice detection.\nOn a Mac, go to System Settings > Siri & Spotlight. Then toggle the \"Ask Siri\" option, but make sure to re-enable \"Listen for\" afterwards.\nInvoke Siri by Holding the Side Button\nIf \"Siri\" and \"Hey, Siri\" are consistently failing you, or worse still triggering erroneously all of the time, you can disable the \"Listen for\" option under Settings > Siri and go back to doing things the old-fashioned way instead.\nModern iPhones and iPads trigger Siri whenever you hold down the \"Side\" or \"Top\" button. This is the same button you'd tap to lock or sleep your device, simply press and hold, speak your request, and then release. You can also use the double or triple-tap iPhone gesture to invoke Siri using Accessibility settings instead.\nOn an Apple Watch, you can press and hold the Digital Crown in the same manner.\nOn a Mac, you can hold the microphone button, or select a different shortcut in the System Settings.\nUse \"Thank You\" to Avoid Chaining Commands\nAs of iOS 17, Siri can chain commands together. This is designed to make it easier to issue follow-up requests without invoking Siri again, but it can also mean that Siri listens to you for way too long. This is especially true if you aren't used to the feature.\nYou can cut Siri off after a command by saying \"thank you\" or simply putting your device to sleep. Unfortunately, gratitude is not optional here. You can't say \"OK\" or \"Away, fool\" (trust me, I tried).\nSimplify Your Commands\nIt's a far cry from having a natural conversation with a digital assistant, but Siri works best when you reduce the complexity of your commands. For example, kindly asking \"Hey Siri, please set a timer for two minutes\" is more complicated than simply barking \"Siri, timer, two minutes.\"\nThe same is true for adding items to a list: \"add ketchup shopping list\" works fine (it might read \"catch-up\" but you get the idea). The key here is to break your commands down to their simplest forms. \"Text Dad I'll be home in five\" and \"Directions, Apple Store, Brisbane\" are further examples of this.\nDon't Wait to Give Your Command\nSome people say \"Hey Siri\" and then pause, waiting for the assistant to spring into action. You should instead speak your whole command in a single sentence, rather than waiting for Siri to catch up. It can be frustrating if Siri doesn't show up immediately after you've started your sentence, but it's the way the assistant was designed to be used.\nIf you're having trouble with this, we recommend breaking commands up a bit. So instead of dictating a long text or email to Siri in one go, tell Siri to \"send a new email to Michael\" and wait for the assistant to ask you what you'd like to say.\nHelp Siri Out to Improve Results\nYou can help Siri understand and pronounce names or define contacts by their roles and relationships to simplify commands. Use commands like \"Learn to say my name\" or \"Hey Siri, Luke is my son\" to improve the assistant's responsiveness. You can then say things like \"Text Son, I am your father.\"\nThis also works for smart home devices. If Siri is consistently mishearing device names, change the name of the device within the Home app to avoid the problem in the future.\nHow to Work Around Siri\nThough other parts of iOS have only improved over the last few years, Siri has seen a distinct lack of progress. If you can bear to touch your iPhone for a few seconds at a time, you can avoid using Siri at all and still execute commands quickly and efficiently.\nDictate Messages Instead\nThough dictation uses the same voice-to-text engine you'll encounter with Siri, you don't have to worry about the assistant sending your message to the wrong person if you get started manually. Open the conversation or message, then tap the microphone icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen or hit the microphone button on a Mac and start speaking.\nUse Spotlight Like a Boss\nJust like on macOS, Spotlight is the iPhone's killer search feature. You can access it by pulling down on the Home screen and typing. On a Mac, just hit Command+Space. You can use it to do things like launch apps, find Settings, convert currency and units, trigger Shortcuts, find documents and photos, find contacts, and much more.\nThink of it more as a command line than a search feature and you'll be amazed at how powerful it becomes.\nUse Home Screen Widgets\niOS 17 added interactive Home screen widgets that let you interact with apps without launching the app in question and macOS Sonoma brought widgets to the Mac. Widgets are arguably a better use of your Home screen than app icons (except for apps you use multiple times a day), so add widgets to your home screen and get information at a glance instead.\nUse Shortcuts to Build Workflows\nApple's Shortcuts are bespoke workflows that can do a lot more than Siri, you just need to put in the work to set them up correctly. In addition to being able to download ready-made Shortcuts, you can make your own Shortcuts to speed up repetitive tasks.\nThese can be very personal and carefully curated. Create shortcuts to log Health data, find out when the next bus is going to arrive, play a specific radio station on a specific speaker in a specific room, automate Low Power mode and other settings, trigger Home scenes, and more.\nYou can add these Shortcuts to your Home screen, search for them, or even trigger Shortcuts with Siri (which simplifies the command from \"do this, this, and this\" to \"run my Evening shortcut\").\nWhy Does Siri Suck?\nFor better or worse, Apple marches to the beat of its own drum. The company ditched optical drives and 3.5mm headphone jacks before anyone else, unceremoniously yeeted Google Maps in favor of its own half-baked Maps app, and keeps competitors at bay with a walled-garden approach to software rights.\nYou can't replace Siri with Google Assistant or Alexa (though honestly, would you want to?), and so Apple's digital assistant game is decidedly different from what you'll find on Android. Many have sought to explain why Siri is still bottom of the class, including an ex-Apple employee on Cult of Mac.\nIt looks like Apple is investing heavily in a smarter generative AI technology that should help Siri get the boost it needs in the years to come. Until then, you can always \"replace\" Siri with ChatGPT instead."
