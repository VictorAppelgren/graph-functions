Beyond that, she added, the company is \u201ctrying to be thoughtful\u201d about whether there are \u201cother interesting, novel ways we could do that beyond debt.\u201d\n\nOpenAI is unprofitable, hindering its ability to build data centers without outside investment, though the company has enjoyed revenue growth due to demand for its ChatGPT model. Friar said the company generated $1 billion in revenue in July, the first time it has done so.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Friar told CNBC that she believed the AI boom was just beginning, following news reports that the industry had reached a bubble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like the railroads or the buildout of electricity than anything I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Friar said. \u201cThe internet, it turns out in hindsight, was actually a relatively capex-light buildout. I think we are just getting started.\n\nHer comments came after a drop in tech stocks, driven in part over concerns that the AI sector is overhyped. Declines of high-profile tech firms like Nvidia, Arm and Palantir were fueled by a new study by researchers at MIT that found that most organizations are getting \u201czero returns\u201d on their investments in the generative AI space.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman had said last week Friday that the AI market is in a bubble, while adding that he thought the industry was nonetheless still strong.",

  "summary": "OpenAI is considering allowing other companies to access its data centers for artificial intelligence (AI). The move is similar to Amazon's practice of renting spare cloud computing capacity to other businesses. However, OpenAI is currently focusing on boosting computing capacity for its own operations. The company's CFO, Sarah Friar, said that the company is looking at ways to profit from its expertise in designing and establishing data centers. After years of relying on Microsoft for funding data center projects, banks and private equity groups are now offering to finance the company's infrastructure work. Despite being unprofitable, this could hinder OpenAI's ability to build data centers without outside investment.",

      "text": "\u201cWhen bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,\u201d Sam Altman said in a Friday (Aug. 15) interview with The Verge.\n\u201cIf you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.\u201d\nAltman\u2019s comments to the Verge were flagged Monday (Aug. 18) in a report by CNBC, which notes that the CEO is not alone in raising concerns about the speed of AI growth, joining the likes of Alibaba Co-founder Joe Tsai, Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Ray Dalio and Apollo Global Management Chief Economist Torsten Slok.\nSlok had contended that today\u2019s AI bubble is actually bigger than the dotcom bubble, with the 10 leading companies in the S&P 500 more overvalued than they were during the 1990s, the CNBC report added.\nRay Wang, CEO of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research, told the network that he believed Altman\u2019s comments carry some weight, but that the risks depend on the company.\n\u201cFrom the perspective of broader investment in AI and semiconductors \u2026 I don\u2019t see it as a bubble. The fundamentals across the supply chain remain strong, and the long-term trajectory of the AI trend supports continued investment,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, AI companies continue to rake in significant amounts of funding. Last week saw OpenAI rival Cohere raise $500 million at a $6.8 billion valuation. Also last week, Cognition reportedly raised $500 million to support its AI software code generation products, with the funding round doubling the company\u2019s valuation to $9.8 billion.\nIn other AI news, PYMNTS wrote recently about predictions about the technology\u2019s potential to one day cure cancer. Many experts expressed various degrees of skepticism about such claims.\n\u201cThe idea that AI will eliminate cancer is incredibly optimistic, but honestly, it is not as straightforward as it sounds,\u201d said Kiara DeWitt, CEO of Injectco and a nurse. \u201cAlthough AI can drastically improve diagnostics \u2026 a full cure is another matter entirely.\u201d\nAlthough AI-driven image recognition software has the potential to increase five-year survival rates by 30%, DeWitt added, \u201ccuring\u201d every case is \u201cstill beyond AI\u2019s reach alone.\u201d\n\u201cMost cancer \u2018cures\u2019 are heavily individualized, dependent on patient genetics, immune responses and countless environmental variables no AI model fully comprehends today,\u201d she said.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "Fears that the AI industry is overhyped are reportedly helping drive down tech stocks.\nThat\u2019s according to a Financial Times report Wednesday (Aug. 20), which pointed to downturns in the European and Asian markets following declines of big name tech companies such as Nvidia, Arm and Palantir.\nHelping fuel this drop, the report added, is a new report from MIT which found that most organizations are getting \u201czero return\u201d on their investments into the generative artificial intelligence (AI) space.\n\u201cThe story is spooking people,\u201d a trader close to a multibillion-dollar US tech fund told the FT.\nThe MIT report found that only 5% of \u201cintegrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable [profit and loss] impact.\u201d\nMeanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned last week that an AI bubble could be forming.\n\u201cAre investors over excited? My opinion is yes,\u201d Altman said in an interview reported by The Verge. \u201cI do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money, and I don\u2019t want to minimize that, that sucks. There will be periods of irrational exuberance. But on the whole the value for society will be huge.\u201d\nThe FT report also noted the rise of Chinese firm DeekSeek, which earlier this year released a high-performing AI modelthat called into question the level of spending by American artificial intelligence firms.\nDeepSeek claimed that model only cost $5.6 million to train using about 2,000 of slower Nvidia chips. That figure is significantly lower than what it took to train frontier models from companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic.\nThe news erased $600 billion of market value from Nvidia in a single day. While tech stocks rebounded, the FT says the incident highlighted investor sensitivity to negative AI news.\nIn related news, PYMNTS last week explored the cost of owning AI models for enterprises. While the cost of the models has fallen since 2022, the overall cost of ownership \u201chas been resistant to declines,\u201d said Muath Juady, founder of SearchQ.AI.\n\u201cThe real expenses lie in the hidden infrastructure, including data engineering teams, security compliance, constant model monitoring, and integration architects necessary to connect AI with existing systems,\u201d added Juady.\nFor every dollar spent on AI models, companies are spending $5 to $10 to make the models \u201cproduction-ready and enterprise-compliant,\u201d Juady told PYMNTS. \u201cThe integration challenges tend to be more expensive than the technology itself and require substantial investment in change management and process redesign, which many organizations underestimate.\u201d\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

And we are just getting started.\u201d\nCNBC reported Wednesday that OpenAI\u2019s revenue growth is continuing, with Friar saying that the company had its first $1 billion month in July.\nIt was reported Friday (Aug. 15) that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT mobile app alone is earning more than six times as much revenue as it did last year. The AI chatbot app for iOS and Android devices has made $1.35 billion this year, through July, up from the $174 million it made during the same seven-month period in 2024.\nOn Wednesday, it was reported that tech stocks were down in part due to fears that the AI industry is overhyped.

      "text": "The Stargate artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure project reportedly got off to a slow start.\nSix months after project was announced, the newly formed company operating the effort has not made a deal to build a data center and has shifted its goal from investing $100 billion immediately to building one data center by the end of 2025, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Monday (July 21).\nThe slow start was caused in part by disagreements between Stargate\u2019s two joint leaders \u2014 SoftBank and OpenAI \u2014 over where to build data centers, according to the report.\nAsked about the report by the WSJ, the companies said in a joint statement that they were making progress in several states and moving quickly to deliver AI infrastructure.\nIn the meantime, OpenAI has struck two data center deals \u2014 one with Oracle and one with CoreWeave \u2014 that do not include SoftBank and that together will give OpenAI access to as much computing power as Stargate said in January that it would deliver, according to the report.\nWhen Stargate was announced in January, it was described as an up-to-$500 billion project that aimed to build big AI-focused data centers in the U.S. The first 10 were to be constructed in Texas, with the total later to be expanded to 20.\nIt was reported in May that Oracle, one of the equity partners in Stargate, would buy $40 billion worth of Nvidia\u2019s chips to power the first Stargate project, a new data center in Abilene, Texas, and that the facility was expected to be fully operational by the middle of 2026.\nAI data centers are needed because traditional data centers and power grids are struggling to accommodate the computational power, data storage and energy required by AI, PYMNTS reported in January.\nIn another, separate effort, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said July 14 that his company will invest \u201chundreds of billions of dollars\u201d into AI infrastructure for its superintelligence effort.\nOn July 9, when Nvidia became the world\u2019s first $4 trillion public company, it was reported that the chip designer and manufacturer was enjoying a continuing boom in demand for AI technologies."
