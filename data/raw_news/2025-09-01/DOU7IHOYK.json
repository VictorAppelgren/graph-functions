  "title": "AI Agents Are Already Reshaping Business Leadership And Decision Making",
  "description": "AI agents are moving far beyond routine automation, and they are now shaping business management and leadership decisions.",
  "content": "When it comes to the work that can be carried out by AI agents, we often focus on repetitive and routine tasks. The types of tasks that machines can get really, really good at if they perform them again and again.\n\nExamples include writing and scheduling social media posts, solving routine customer service issues, or labelling and categorizing unstructured data.\n\nIn case you\u2019re not up to speed, agents can be thought of as generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT but with virtual arms, legs and the ability to take action on our behalf.\n\nA slightly more technical definition is that they are large language models (like ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-5 engine) capable of connecting with other tools, including web browsers, to carry out more complex and sophisticated tasks, with minimal human intervention.\n\nBut it would be wrong to think that agentic AI is only useful for low-level, tactical decision-making on the shop floor; What time should you send an email newsletter? Or which piece of machinery needs maintenance work?\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s increasingly being used by business leadership to make strategic or management decisions. One McKinsey study recently found that 53 percent of C-suite executives and 44 percent of middle managers use GenAI at work, putting them well ahead of the total overall figure.\n\nSo here, I\u2019ll take a look at some of the ways that agents are already making their way into business management functions. I\u2019ll also provide some tips for anyone who wants to make sure they\u2019re prepared for the convergence of agents and business leadership.\n\nNo one will expect the average CEO to be ready to hand over control of their company to a machine any time soon. But there are many theoretical and a growing number of real-world use cases for agents in leadership and high-level decision-making.\n\nOne of the most visible is through integration with the decision support systems often used to augment human decision-making by ensuring we have the information and guidance we need.\n\nFor example, luxury goods manufacturer LVMH recently announced its decision to build a platform that will use agents to monitor and surface signals so decision-makers can react more quickly.\n\nAsset managers BlackRock have developed their own agentic platform, called Asimov. Asimov can work through the night, gathering research data in real time, monitoring market activity and scanning company filings, ready to present an actionable report to executives in the morning.\n\nAnd Citi Group has talked about its plans to divert some of its $12 billion tech budget into agentic AI, which could be used to connect different business AI initiatives, improving strategic oversight.\n\nEnterprise software vendors like Microsoft and Salesforce are increasingly building agentic functionality into their tools, to assist decision-makers with strategic advice, or deploying their own agents.\n\nThis means we\u2019re likely to see agents being used in exciting new ways as adoption grows among leadership in different industries.\n\nFor example, in healthcare, agents could be used to monitor and oversee an increasingly sprawling connected health infrastructure. This helps leaders understand what's generating value, what's being underused, and what\u2019s just a waste of resources.\n\nAnd in manufacturing, agents can track production operations, supply chain effectiveness and energy efficiency, creating opportunities to make strategic plays.\n\nWhile agents aren\u2019t yet taking the wheel on business decision-making, they\u2019re increasingly in the passenger seat, ready to help us navigate or warn about trouble ahead.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a leader or a decision-maker, what steps should you be taking to make sure you aren't left behind?\n\nWhat Leaders And Managers Should Do Now\n\nBusiness decision-makers who\u2019ve already had experience with deploying generative AI will be at an advantage here. But agentic AI requires a different approach, more suited to the long-term strategic planning tasks agents are built for.\n\nAgents are more big-picture and goal-oriented, and your thinking should be too. While ChatGPT can draft you an email, an agentic platform like Manus or Operator can create an email marketing strategy and build the infrastructure to deliver it.\n\nAt least, in theory, it can, but it has to be noted that early adopters of those tools frequently report that they don\u2019t always get it right just yet.\n\nFrom a general usage point of view, it's important to remember that AI agents are not simply evolved AI chatbots. They\u2019re not really designed to chat or knock ideas back and forward about the best way to create something, which is something ChatGPT is good at.\n\nAgentic AI can be expensive because the \"thinking\" chews through a lot of tokens. So it\u2019s best to go in with a clear idea of what you want and instruct the agent explicitly on how you would like it to achieve it.\n\nOne of the great strengths of agents is that they can use digital tools just like we can, from using a web browser to shop online to controlling complex industrial machinery. Preparation for this might involve ensuring that proprietary and legacy systems can be persuaded to play nicely with agents. Or making a commitment towards open-source technology, where standardization is common and popular tools are likely to be quickly patched to work with an agentic ecosystem.\n\nNext tip: to fulfil their full potential, agents will need access to fast streams of high-value, timely data via well-documented APIs. Organizations that don\u2019t have their house in order here are likely to miss opportunities as they attempt to catch up.\n\nAnd, absolutely critically, leaders must take steps to ensure they understand the principles of secure, responsible and ethical AI use. As we take steps to give AI the power to make more decisions on our behalf, the need for guardrails, oversight and accountability is more important than ever.\n\nAutonomous Organizations And The Future Of Humans In Leadership\n\nWill we get to a point where machines are so good at predicting the right course of action that humans just aren\u2019t needed? Could we even become a liability?\n\nWell, maybe one day. It\u2019s pretty hard to know where this technology will be in two or three years, let alone ten years.\n\nBut one thing we do know is that human brains are still immensely more complex than the best artificial brains. That additional complexity allows us to understand nuanced situations, navigate complex interpersonal relationships and make complex, long-term, strategic plans in ways that computers probably won\u2019t be able to do for some time.\n\nThis means that human leaders probably aren\u2019t ready to delegate their powers entirely just yet. Instead, they will look to agents to help them become better leaders and more effective decision-makers.",

      "text": "ChatGPT\u2019s \u2018Operator\u2019 Mode Gives AI True Autonomy \u2013 And It\u2019s Both Thrilling And Terrifying\n4 March 2025\nUpdates to OpenAI\u2019s world-conquering AI chatbot ChatGPT are coming thick and fast, but the latest might just be the most significant leap forward yet.\nWhen ChatGPT launched just a little over two years ago, it was quite \u201cbare bones\u201d compared to today. Since then, it\u2019s evolved to browse the web, understand images, remember things, reason more effectively, and even work while we\u2019re offline.\nThat could all pale into insignificance compared to what\u2019s about to come next, though.\nChatGPT\u2019s latest upgrade \u2013 known as Operator \u2013 makes it capable of completing far more complicated tasks than ever before, including interacting with other web pages and services.\nIt manages all of this in an autonomous manner \u2013 without having to be hand-held by a human through every step.\nIn short, Operator is ChatGPT\u2019s first attempt at becoming a true AI agent \u2013 a new form of AI tool with capabilities far beyond those of a relatively simple chatbot.\nSo, what is an agent, why are they considered to be the next major leap forward in the evolution of AI, and does Operator mark the arrival of a whole new generation of intelligent applications, tools and services?\nWhat Is An AI Agent?\nFirst of all, what do we mean when we talk about an AI agent, and why do so many people think they will be so significant?\nOpenAI defines an agent as an AI tool that\u2019s \u201ccapable of doing work for you.\u201d\nCan\u2019t regular generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, already do this? They can certainly draft emails, summarize documents and translate languages. But Agents are able to carry out much more complex tasks involving multi-stage instructions.\nHere\u2019s the difference: Regular ChatGPT generally executes a single instruction (known as a \u201cprompt\u201d), then passes control back to the human user to tell it what to do next.\nAn autonomous agent, on the other hand, can execute the prompt and then use the result to work out what it should do next without human intervention.\nIt will always be working towards achieving the goal it was originally given by a human, but it will use its own knowledge, logic and reasoning abilities to work out each of the different steps it needs to get there.\nMicrosoft \u2013 another big believer in the power of AI agents \u2013describes a future where they will eventually become our AI colleagues, operating 24/7 on our behalf so we can dedicate our own time to tasks that require a human touch.\nHow Does Operator Work?\nThat\u2019s all very exciting, but how does ChatGPT with Operator actually achieve any of this?\nWell, essentially, it does it by combining ChatGPT's already famous natural language and vision capabilities with the ability to interact with third-party tools and plugins through a web interface.\nAccording to OpenAI\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s built around a new AI model known as a Computer-Using Agent. The CUA is trained to use graphical user interfaces \u2013 in this case, a web browser \u2013 with its GPT4-based vision capabilities, allowing it to navigate buttons and menus, as well as interpret text.\nThis means, for example, that it can browse and shop online, research travel plans, search for the cheapest available flights and make bookings, or plan a meal schedule and then arrange for all of the ingredients to be delivered.\nEssentially, Operator allows ChatGPT to make the leap from simply reacting to user prompts to being able to proactively determine and deploy the instructions it needs in order to get the task done.\nTowards AGI?\nFor me, the truly exciting thing about Operator, however, is that it represents another, albeit perhaps small, step towards the current \u201choly grail\u201d of AI development \u2013 Artificial General Intelligence.\nUsually known as AGI, this refers to AIs that are capable of learning how to do just about any task. This is in contrast to most current AIs, which are considered to be \u201cnarrow\u201d because they can only work on the field of tasks that they\u2019ve been designed for.\nTo be clear, agentic AI is not the same as general AI. However, giving machines the capability to work out how to complete complex tasks themselves is clearly necessary to eventually create AGI.\nOpenAI has made it clear that it considers progressing towards the ultimate goal of AGI as its number one priority. So, in this context, its current focus on agentic AI certainly isn\u2019t surprising and is a good indicator of where we can expect to see further AI developments in the future.\nSo, What Does This Mean For Us Today?\nOperator is currently available as a research preview to ChatGPT Pro subscribers in the US.\nOpenAI hopes companies will use it to create their own agents, enabling agentic AI to become an everyday part of everybody\u2019s workflows.\nIt\u2019s already collaborating with Doordash, Instacart, OpenTable and many others to create public-facing applications. But there\u2019s no reason that, away from household names, many smaller businesses won\u2019t create them for their own internal use, just as they\u2019ve been doing with OpenAI\u2019s GPT API over the last two years.\nOperator certainly isn\u2019t the first AI agent to be launched. The open-source repository Hugging Face is home to a large number of models that have been developed over the last two years.\nBy integrating them with its hugely popular ChatGPT platform, however, OpenAI will make agentic AI accessible to millions of individuals and businesses that may not have the technical skill to build them on open-source technology.\nIt\u2019s important to note that, as of writing, this is all at a very early stage, and early impressions are that there are still a lot of bugs to be squashed before agentic AI is genuinely ready for the mainstream.\nAnd that\u2019s without even considering the safety concerns that come with letting AIs go about business by themselves \u2013 making purchases and interacting with the world in ways that could potentially go wrong!\nNevertheless, this latest iteration of ChatGPT is, without a doubt, one of the most exciting developments we\u2019ve seen in publicly available AI for some time and one that\u2019s likely to open the doors to a great deal of further innovation.\nRelated Articles\nWhat Is Zero Click And Why Is It Turning Marketing On Its Head?\nBy now, \u201csmart\u201d versions exist of just about every home appliance, gadget and gizmos we can think of.

      "text": "Why AI Agents Will Trigger The Biggest Workplace Revolution In 25 Years\n23 June 2025\nImagine a future where the distinction between human and digital workers becomes increasingly blurred. Where AI agents don\u2019t just assist employees but independently handle 70% of customer service inquiries, help draft business plans, and collaborate with leaders on strategic decisions. According to Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff, this future isn\u2019t decades away \u2013 it\u2019s unfolding right now.\nIn a recent conversation, Benioff shared with me his conviction that we\u2019re entering an unprecedented transformation that will fundamentally reshape how businesses operate. \u201cWe\u2019re in an incredible new moment,\u201d Benioff told me. \u201cI think we can all see that, but I think we all know we\u2019re going to another unbelievable place, that it\u2019s kind of a transitionary period.\u201d\nTHE RISE OF DIGITAL LABOR\nWhat makes Benioff's perspective particularly compelling is that Salesforce is already seeing this transformation happen across its customer base \u2013 and within its own operations.\nDuring our conversation, Benioff explained that while Salesforce has grown into the second-largest enterprise software company in the world, with projected annual revenue of $40.9 billion and approximately 75,000 employees, they're now entering territory far beyond their traditional market. \"In the last six months, we've stepped into a new market that we kind of categorize as three to 12 trillion, the idea of delivering digital labor,\" he told me, highlighting a shift from their established multi-hundred-billion-dollar market into something exponentially larger.\nThat's an astronomical jump in market potential \u2013 and it's already manifesting in real business outcomes. Benioff pointed to 1-800-ACCOUNTANT, which just completed tax season with 70% of customer service inquiries handled autonomously without human interaction. Even Salesforce itself is seeing dramatic changes: \"We have about 9,000 support agents, but they're doing a lot less work lately 'cause we have help.salesforce.com, which is this agentic layer that is resolving issues without human interaction.\"\nTHE NEW BUSINESS STACK\nThe technical architecture enabling this revolution is what Benioff calls the Salesforce platform \u2013 a multilayered system consisting of a common platform, applications (sales, service, marketing, commerce, Tableau, Slack), a data cloud, and the newest addition: the agentic layer.\nThis agentic layer is where the magic happens. \"You can deploy agents either inside with employees or externally, directly to customers, and that idea that customers can build and deploy on that platform is really the most exciting thing,\" Benioff said.\nBut there's another component that often gets overlooked: data. Benioff emphasized that the foundation of effective AI agents is high-quality, structured data. \"The number one thing is really investing in data. You've gotta get your data together. You know, that's why the data cloud is so important. We've surpassed about 50 trillion records with our data cloud that we're managing for our customers.\"\nHOW BENIOFF WORKS WITH AI AGENTS\nWhat particularly intrigued me was how Benioff personally incorporates AI into his leadership practices. Each January, he drafts what Salesforce calls a V2MOM \u2013 a document outlining vision, values, methods, obstacles, and metrics. Traditionally, a collaborative process with another executive, Benioff now includes an AI agent as a third collaborator.\n\"Now I'll say to the AI: Hey, now tell me, look at my plan. Compare it to what all my competitors are doing. Give me a letter grade. Give me recommendations on what I should be doing differently,\" Benioff explained. \"Where am I weak? Where am I strong? You know, help me augment this plan. Edit it, reshape it. Transform it.\"\nThis three-way collaboration \u2013 executive, colleague, and AI \u2013 exemplifies the augmentation approach Benioff encourages across Salesforce. \"That's what I encourage all my employees to do, is to use AI to augment their employee productivity and to do more.\"\nTHE PHYSICAL DIMENSION: BEYOND SOFTWARE AGENTS\nWhile much of the AI conversation centers around software, Benioff sees a future where digital agents become embodied in physical robots. \"That I think is really one of the key parts of digital labor.\u201d He pointed to recent advances from Stanford University's Aloha model as evidence of this evolution, explaining how these robotic systems are already demonstrating remarkable capabilities.\nThis vision extends to customer-facing scenarios, like hotel service interactions, where robots not only clean rooms but engage guests on a personal level: \"You come into the hotel room and the robot's gonna say, Oh, Marc, how are you? Do you want us to leave? You know, are there changes that you wanna make to your hotel reservation?\"\nSalesforce is investing in this vision through partnerships and personal investments in model companies providing software for this robotic layer.\nTHE IMPACT ON JOBS AND SKILLS\nNo discussion about AI's future would be complete without addressing its impact on employment. Benioff is refreshingly candid about the transformations already underway at Salesforce: \"We're gonna look at rebalancing about 50% of our customer support agents. When it comes to engineering, for example, software development, we're not gonna hire any new engineers this year 'cause we're already getting 30% more productivity and we think we're gonna get 50% more productivity.\"\nThis productivity boost extends across departments, from legal to healthcare. In radiology, for instance, Benioff noted how AI systems are increasingly scoring and grading scans, with humans complementing rather than leading this work.\nThe skills that will matter most in this new landscape? \"You're gonna have to have fluidity in your ability to work with an AI,\" Benioff stated. \"The ability to understand how to interact with the AI, construct the prompts to be able to deliver this kind of interaction.\"\nTHE LEADERSHIP IMPERATIVE\nFor business leaders navigating this transformation, Benioff's advice is characteristically direct: \"Keep going faster.\"\nThe most effective CEOs in the age of AI, according to Benioff, will be \"the ones to fully embrace this technology. Really try it, take risks, deploy fast, fail fast. You know, being willing to look at what are those new ideas and hire people who want to use these technologies and experiment with them.\"\nThis commitment to AI-driven innovation recently prompted Benioff to replace his chief information officer with someone who had \"deployed a radical level of artificial intelligence in their last company.\"\nYet despite these dramatic shifts, Benioff emphasizes we're still in the early stages: \"People always overestimate what we can do in a year. They underestimate what we can do in a decade or two decades.\"\nTHE ROAD AHEAD\nLooking 15 years into the future, Benioff envisions companies where employees are \"highly augmented\" through technologies including brain-machine interfaces, alongside widespread deployment of digital labor. The result? \"Businesses\u2019 fundamental business KPIs are gonna be much better, so companies will be a lot more profitable and there'll be a real age of abundance when it comes to businesses and how they're being successful.\"\nWhile transparency and trust remain works in progress (\"there's no finish line when it comes to trust\"), Benioff remains convinced that agentic AI represents the next great frontier in business transformation.\nWhat struck me most throughout our conversation was not just the scale of change Benioff foresees, but how much of it is already happening. While many CEOs still view AI as a narrow tool for specific tasks, Salesforce is experiencing a fundamental shift in how work gets done, with the promise of even greater transformations ahead.\nThe key takeaway? As I often tell my clients, think bigger. Far bigger. Because if Benioff is right, we're not just upgrading our existing business models \u2013 we're entering an entirely new era of human-machine collaboration that will redefine what's possible.\nRelated Articles\nWhat Is Zero Click And Why Is It Turning Marketing On Its Head?\nBy now, \u201csmart\u201d versions exist of just about every home appliance, gadget and gizmos we can think of.

      "text": "- Citi is leveling up its AI game, according to a new memo sent Wednesday and viewed by BI.\n- The firm outlined its AI strategy, led by three bank leaders.\n- It comes as it faces a turnaround job on the tech side, and Wall Street clamors for AI.\nCitigroup's Jane Fraser is on a mission to modernize the global bank. Three executives have been appointed to ensure AI plays a big role in that.\nAs part of the push, the firm \u2014 which has long struggled with its reputation issues, some of which are directly tied to tech \u2014 said it's unveiling new tools, pilot programs, and a broader effort to embed AI across its operations, in a memo seen by Business Insider.\nThe internal memo, which went out to Citi's roughly 200,000 employees, reveals the scope and ambition of the bank's AI efforts, which will be overseen by new co-sponsors of Citi's AI strategy, who are part of the Executive Management Team, include Gonzalo Luchetti, head of US personal banking; Tim Ryan, head of technology and business enablement; and Anand Selva, the firm's chief operating officer.\n\"We are focusing on accelerating our AI strategy\u2014connecting teams and partners, prioritizing resources and expediting use cases across our businesses and functions,\" the three leaders wrote in a memo sent to staff on Wednesday.\nTo realize the push, the bank will rely on some of its $12 billion annual tech budget, though it's unclear how much is specifically dedicated to AI. But it comes as much of Wall Street, from JPMorgan to Goldman Sachs, races to integrate the technology into everything from consumer service to trading to internal operations.\n\"AI is reshaping how we operate, serve our clients and scale our business,\" they added. \"We firmly believe that to be competitive in this digital evolution, we must be an AI-ready workforce\u2014nimble and ready for what this technology can unlock.\"\nThey explained that Citi is scaling its generative AI capabilities across the company, with more than 150,000 employees now equipped with Citi AI tools. They're looking for opportunities to push ahead, such as the emergence of \"agentic AI,\" a type of artificial intelligence designed to be capable of pursing goals and making decisions without human input.\n\"We're also well underway with Agentic AI, the next big iteration of artificial intelligence with real promise to transform our bank, \" they said in the memo, adding that they'll share more on this initiative in the coming months.\nThe bank launched its Citi AI suite of tools in December, though some came online in the first quarter of this year, like a pilot program that assists with vocal response for its consumer bank operations in the United States. Beyond that, the firm has made available real-time chat in Citi Stylus, a browser plug-in for document and article analysis, and integration of Citi Assist into Microsoft Teams. The AI leaders encouraged using tools like Citi Stylus Workspaces for tasks such as mid-year self-evaluations.\nThe bank has enlisted more than 2,000 workers to provide feedback and help their colleagues master the tools through special AI-focused programs. It even announced in the fall a strategic alliance with Google, creating its in-house AI tools on Google's Vertex platform.\nA spokesperson for the company said it believes this trio of leaders is right for the next phase of Citi's strategy: Luchetti brings a consumer banking focus; Ryan's group has the tech know-how; and Selva's operations team is helping roll out the strategy across the firm's workforce.\nSelva has been entrusted with Fraser's \"Transformation\" mission, which seeks to appease regulators and update its technology that lags behind its other house-hold name peers.\nLooking ahead, the bank encouraged employees to engage with the new feature and discussed possibilities for expansion in areas like fraud prevention and trade confirmation matching in its markets business.\n\"All businesses and functions have been given the mandate to explore how we can build artificial intelligence into our day-to-day work and operations and, as the EMT co-sponsors, we are here to help,\" the memo authors wrote. \"We encourage you to just jump in and start exploring our current tools. With new capabilities added almost monthly, our tools are user-friendly and advancing quickly.\"\nHave a tip?

      "text": "Everyone in AI is talking about Manus. We put it to the test.\nThe new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload\u2014but it\u2019s highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.\nSince the general AI agent Manus was launched last week, it has spread online like wildfire. And not just in China, where it was developed by the Wuhan-based startup Butterfly Effect. It\u2019s made its way into the global conversation, with influential voices in tech, including Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey and Hugging Face product lead Victor Mustar, praising its performance. Some have even dubbed it \u201cthe second DeepSeek,\u201d comparing it to the earlier AI model that took the industry by surprise for its unexpected capabilities as well as its origin.\nManus claims to be the world's first general AI agent, using multiple AI models (such as Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and fine-tuned versions of Alibaba's open-source Qwen) and various independently operating agents to act autonomously on a wide range of tasks. (This makes it different from AI chatbots, including DeepSeek, which are based on a single large language model family and are primarily designed for conversational interactions.)\nDespite all the hype, very few people have had a chance to use it. Currently, under 1% of the users on the wait list have received an invite code. (It\u2019s unclear how many people are on this list, but for a sense of how much interest there is, Manus\u2019s Discord channel has more than 186,000 members.)\nMIT Technology Review was able to obtain access to Manus, and when I gave it a test-drive, I found that using it feels like collaborating with a highly intelligent and efficient intern: While it occasionally lacks understanding of what it\u2019s being asked to do, makes incorrect assumptions, or cuts corners to expedite tasks, it explains its reasoning clearly, is remarkably adaptable, and can improve substantially when provided with detailed instructions or feedback. Ultimately, it\u2019s promising but not perfect.\nJust like its parent company\u2019s previous product, an AI assistant called Monica that was released in 2023, Manus is intended for a global audience. English is set as the default language, and its design is clean and minimalist.\nTo get in, a user has to enter a valid invite code. Then the system directs users to a landing page that closely resembles those of ChatGPT or DeepSeek, with previous sessions displayed in a left-hand column and a chat input box in the center. The landing page also features sample tasks curated by the company\u2014ranging from business strategy development to interactive learning to customized audio meditation sessions.\nLike other reasoning-based agentic AI tools, such as ChatGPT DeepResearch, Manus is capable of breaking tasks down into steps and autonomously navigating the web to get the information it needs to complete them. What sets it apart is the \u201cManus\u2019s Computer\u201d window, which allows users not only to observe what the agent is doing but also to intervene at any point.\nTo put it to the test, I gave Manus three assignments: (1) compile a list of notable reporters covering China tech, (2) search for two-bedroom property listings in New York City, and (3) nominate potential candidates for Innovators Under 35, a list created by MIT Technology Review every year.\nHere\u2019s how it did:\nTask 1: The first list of reporters that Manus gave me contained only five names, with five \u201chonorable mentions\u201d below them. I noticed that it listed some journalists\u2019 notable work but didn\u2019t do this for others. I asked Manus why. The reason it offered was hilariously simple: It got lazy. It was \u201cpartly due to time constraints as I tried to expedite the research process,\u201d the agent told me. When I insisted on consistency and thoroughness, Manus responded with a comprehensive list of 30 journalists, noting their current outlet and listing notable work. (I was glad to see I made the cut, along with many of my beloved peers.)\nI was impressed that I was able to make top-level suggestions for changes, much as someone would with a real-life intern or assistant, and that it responded appropriately. And while it initially overlooked changes in some journalists\u2019 employer status, when I asked it to revisit some results, it quickly corrected them. Another nice feature: The output was downloadable as a Word or Excel file, making it easy to edit or share with others.\nManus hit a snag, though, when accessing journalists\u2019 news articles behind paywalls; it frequently encountered captcha blocks. Since I was able to follow along step by step, I could easily take over to complete these, though many media sites still blocked the tool, citing suspicious activity. I see potential for major improvements here\u2014and it would be useful if a future version of Manus could proactively ask for help when it encounters these sorts of restrictions.\nTask 2: For the apartment search, I gave Manus a complex set of criteria, including a budget and several parameters: a spacious kitchen, outdoor space, access to downtown Manhattan, and a major train station within a seven-minute walk. Manus initially interpreted vague requirements like \u201csome kind of outdoor space\u201d too literally, completely excluding properties without a private terrace or balcony access. However, after more guidance and clarification, it was able to compile a broader and more helpful list, giving recommendations in tiers and neat bullet points.\nThe final output felt straight from Wirecutter, containing subtitles like \u201cbest overall,\u201d \u201cbest value,\u201d and \u201cluxury option.\u201d This task (including the back-and-forth) took less than half an hour\u2014a lot less time than compiling the list of journalists (which took a little over an hour), likely because property listings are more openly available and well-structured online.\nTask 3: This was the largest in scope: I asked Manus to nominate 50 people for this year\u2019s Innovators Under 35 list. Producing this list is an enormous undertaking, and we typically get hundreds of nominations every year. So I was curious to see how well Manus could do. It broke the task into steps, including reviewing past lists to understand selection criteria, creating a search strategy for identifying candidates, compiling names, and ensuring a diverse selection of candidates from all over the world.\nDeveloping a search strategy was the most time-consuming part for Manus. While it didn\u2019t explicitly outline its approach, the Manus\u2019s Computer window revealed the agent rapidly scrolling through websites of prestigious research universities, announcements of tech awards, and news articles. However, it again encountered obstacles when trying to access academic papers and paywalled media content.\nAfter three hours of scouring the internet\u2014during which Manus (understandably) asked me multiple times whether I could narrow the search\u2014it was only able to give me three candidates with full background profiles. When I pressed it again to provide a complete list of 50 names, it eventually generated one, but certain academic institutions and fields were heavily overrepresented, reflecting an incomplete research process. After I pointed out the issue and asked it to find five candidates from China, it managed to compile a solid five-name list, though the results skewed toward Chinese media darlings. Ultimately, I had to give up after the system warned that Manus\u2019s performance might decline if I kept inputting too much text.\nMy assessment: Overall, I found Manus to be a highly intuitive tool suitable for users with or without coding backgrounds. On two of the three tasks, it provided better results than ChatGPT DeepResearch, though it took significantly longer to complete them. Manus seems best suited to analytical tasks that require extensive research on the open internet but have a limited scope. In other words, it\u2019s best to stick to the sorts of things a skilled human intern could do during a day of work.\nStill, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. Manus can suffer from frequent crashes and system instability, and it may struggle when asked to process large chunks of text. The message \u201cDue to the current high service load, tasks cannot be created. Please try again in a few minutes\u201d flashed on my screen a few times when I tried to start new requests, and occasionally Manus\u2019s Computer froze on a certain page for a long period of time.\nIt has a higher failure rate than ChatGPT DeepResearch\u2014a problem the team is addressing, according to Manus\u2019s chief scientist, Peak Ji. That said, the Chinese media outlet 36Kr reports that Manus\u2019s per-task cost is about $2, which is just one-tenth of DeepResearch\u2019s cost. If the Manus team strengthens its server infrastructure, I can see the tool becoming a preferred choice for individual users, particularly white-collar professionals, independent developers, and small teams.\nFinally, I think it\u2019s really valuable that Manus\u2019s working process feels relatively transparent and collaborative. It actively asks questions along the way and retains key instructions as \u201cknowledge\u201d in its memory for future use, allowing for an easily customizable agentic experience. It\u2019s also really nice that each session is replayable and shareable.\nI expect I will keep using Manus for all sorts of tasks, in both my personal and professional lives. While I\u2019m not sure the comparisons to DeepSeek are quite right, it serves as further evidence that Chinese AI companies are not just following in the footsteps of their Western counterparts. Rather than just innovating on base models, they are actively shaping the adoption of autonomous AI agents in their own way.\nDeep Dive\nArtificial intelligence\nIn a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses\nIt\u2019s the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.\nThe two people shaping the future of OpenAI\u2019s research\nAn exclusive conversation with Mark Chen and Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI\u2019s twin heads of research, about the path toward more capable reasoning models\u2014and superalignment.\nHow to run an LLM on your laptop\nIt\u2019s now possible to run useful models from the safety and comfort of your own computer.

      "text": "- Investment processes that once took months are gaining speed thanks to AI.\n- This is transforming an in-depth investment approach known as fundamental investing.\n- Executives from Alliance Bernstein to JPMorgan take us inside the fundamental investing revolution.\nIt took an AllianceBernstein healthcare analyst just one afternoon to analyze what would have once taken her months: the potential impact of President Donald Trump's \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" on specific drugs and insurance plans across state lines.\nAndrew Chin, the firm's chief artificial intelligence officer, said the analyst used one of the $790 billion asset manager's in-house tools to quickly interpret the legislation and identify which companies would be affected, allowing her to make a fast, confident investment call.\n\"Because she was able to do that, she was able to make money for our client portfolios a lot faster,\" said Chin, adding that the analyst \"locked in some of the alpha\" in a way that was not previously possible.\nFundamental investors take a slow and methodical approach to their investment decisions. Whether reviewing financial statements or talking to vendors and company executives, it can take months for a fundamental investor to reach a conclusion about what to invest in and at what price.\nNot anymore. Artificial intelligence is changing the slow investing game popularized by investors like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Peter Lynch of Fidelity.\nWhile asset managers have long used machine learning to crunch spreadsheets and detect trading signals\u2014especially in quant and systematic strategies\u2014 these tools can also quickly digest and analyze vast reams of unstructured information, like earnings call transcripts, regulatory filings, and even emails. It's allowing large asset managers to make fundamental investing decisions faster than ever before.\nHere are three firms that are using AI to transform their investment processes:\nJPMorgan Asset Management\nTwo and a half years ago, JPMorgan Asset Management AI strategist Dillon Edwards sat down with upward of 50 portfolio managers to understand what they needed. He asked them about the screens they use, the questions they ask themselves throughout the day, and the common thread was, \"Just get our attention to the right data, at the right time, in the right place.\"\nThat request led to the creation of Smart Monitor, which Edwards described as \"Spotify for the investor.\" It scans mountains of data to surface timely, relevant insights for the firm's portfolio managers and analysts.\nSmart Monitor is part of JPMorgan's broader AI build-out for its $3.7 trillion asset management arm, which is hosted on a platform called Spectrum. Another tool within this platform is Moneyball, which helps portfolio managers identify and correct potential biases in their investment decisions by analyzing historical data and market behaviors.\nRather than building something new for investors to learn, Edwards and his team focused on AI directly into the process that investors have spent years perfecting.\nThe bottom-up approach has helped to minimize AI skeptics: A handful of \"champion\" PMs worked closely with engineers during development and became in-house unofficial salespeople who market it to their own teams.\n\"No one wants another tool, another thing to do, something that the AI team somehow thinks is going to be helpful for an investor without empathizing with what they're doing today,\" he said.\nKristian West, JPMorgan Asset Management's head of investment platform, said the firm is also developing similar tools with the goal of seeing if they can continue to scale the quantitative process, or data-driven systematic investing.\n\"That's an area where we think it is just pretty obvious, whereas technology and data capabilities improve, those two worlds collide a lot more,\" he said.\nAlliance Bernstein\nFor fundamental investors\u2014portfolio managers and analysts who base long-term decisions on a deep understanding of individual companies\u2014this marks a turning point: a chance to move faster and dig deeper, but also a moment to rethink how they work.\nChin calls this evolution the rise of the \"iron person\": a human investor enhanced by AI armor. Not a replacement, but an upgrade.\nAB has developed an internal chatbot called AB AI, along with several tools to help pull from internal data, prep for company meetings, or conduct research tailored to the manager's investment philosophy.\nChin said that many AB analysts often develop their own AI agents using ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot with specific prompts to, for example, run an analysis on the companies in their sector after an earnings call.\n\"They're able to then analyze companies the way they want to, so they get a more tailored or customized version of what the tool can provide them,\" he said.\nChin said about 75% of the firm's over 500 investment professionals are using their tools.\nPeople sharing stories like \"it takes me a day rather than a month to do something, or I was able to get this insight that I did not get before,\" have driven others to try it, said Chin.\nFor the remaining 25% who haven't picked up AI, he believes they \"will just naturally come when they see the performance of their counterparts has gotten better.\"\nBlackRock\nA big reveal from BlackRock's investor day last month shows just how fast the field is moving. The $11 trillion investing behemoth has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its fundamental equity business. Agentic AI doesn't just answer questions following prompts \u2014 it can take action on its own.\n\"While everyone else is sleeping at night, we have these virtual AI agents, they're scanning research notes, company filings, emails to generate portfolio insights,\" the firm's chief operating officer, Robert Goldstein, said.\nHe hopes Asimov will be deployed across the firm by the next investor day, offering investors at the world's biggest asset manager a powerful teammate.\nRaffaele Savi, its global head of systemic investing, underscored how significantly AI is affecting the investing world.\nThe speed and power of having \"real-time, millions of stimulations a day happening in the background, developing situational awareness\" that helps ensure the portfolio reflects the manager's intentions are \"profound.\"\n\"The world has changed tremendously,\" he said."

      "text": "The Next AI Battleground: Why China\u2019s Manus Could Leapfrog Western Agent Technology\n1 May 2025\nThe next wave of AI transformation will be driven by agents. This next-generation AI surpasses chatbots like ChatGPT by not simply generating responses but by taking action.\nUnlike chatbots, these systems carry out complex tasks with little human involvement. In coming years, we may see them evolving into virtual assistants, teachers, employees, carers and even friends.\nRight now, everyone\u2019s waiting for AI agents to have their \u201cChatGPT moment\u201d\u2014when millions of people across the world suddenly realize it could actually be very useful. Now, in the wake of the market turmoil caused by DeepSeek, a new Chinese contender has emerged.\nThe developer of Manus AI claims it\u2019s \u201cthe first AI agent \u2026 a truly autonomous agent that bridges the gap between conception and execution\u201d and \u201cpotentially a glimpse into AGI\u201d.\nSo, what is it, what does it do, what are its political implications in a world where superpowers are racing for AI supremacy? And is it really a step towards the AI holy grail of AGI?\nSo, What Is Manus?\nManus is currently an invite-only research preview, immediately casting doubt on developer Monica\u2019s claim that it\u2019s the first AI agent. OpenAI\u2019s similar Operator agent model is also a research preview but is at least available to customers \u2013 if only for those paying for the $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro tier.\nBut a developer video has been released showing it performing real-world tasks like screening resumes, researching housing and analyzing stocks.\nIts name, derived from the Latin \u201cMens et Manus\u201d (\u201cmind and hand\u201d), reflects its structure: LLM algorithms as the mind and deterministic algorithms as the hand. Unlike ChatGPT, which only generates responses, Manus can execute actions\u2014integrating with services, processing data, and performing operations like a traditional computer program.\nFor example, ChatGPT can write Python code, but Manus can autonomously execute, test, and refine it. Instead of summarizing financial reports, it fetches real data and runs its own analysis.\nInterestingly, its creators say that coding doesn\u2019t have to be a goal for Manus, which actually thinks of it as a \u201cuniversal tool for solving problems.\u201d This suggests Manus could autonomously write and execute code to address challenges we've never thought to tackle through programming\u2014expanding AI's problem-solving horizon beyond our current imagination.\nOne other important point to consider is that although Manus is currently classified as a closed-source, proprietary engine (just like ChatGPT and Operator), it's built on open-source technology. The LLM \u201cmind\u201d is built on Anthropic\u2019s Claude LLM, as well as Alibaba\u2019s Qwen. The developers have said that they plan to open-source Manus itself \u2013 or parts of it \u2013 in the near future.\nIs This AGI?\nNo, it doesn\u2019t qualify as AGI \u2013 as the developers themselves state in their video, it\u2019s a \u201cglimpse\u201d of AGI - artificial general intelligence.\nAGI is best thought of as an eventual goal of developing AI that can learn to carry out just about any task, much like a human can. It uses the tools it\u2019s given or, if it doesn\u2019t have anything suitable, can work out how to find the tools it needs, or even design and use new tools.\nIt seems best to think of Manus as a collection of tools and models operating under agentic control, rather than one integrated software entity (like ChatGPT4o, for example).\nIt is, however, a clear sign that AI is evolving as fast, or perhaps faster, as expected. In a little over two years, since ChatGPT was released, we have seen AIs move from reactive, question-and-response systems to agents capable of actively managing digital and real-world tasks.\nGeopolitical Implications\nIn recent years, we have seen AI become a geopolitical battleground, primarily between the U.S. and China.\nThe leadership of both nations has made it clear they recognize its enormous potential to shape the future due to its impact on everything from medical research to the economy to warfare.\nHistorically, it\u2019s fair to say, U.S. companies have dominated the market, with OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and so on, leading on research and bringing products to market.\nChina, where the government plays a more hands-on role, has made significant strides to close the gap, however, first with DeepSeek and now potentially with Manus.\nDeepSeek caused a crash in the price of U.S. tech stocks when it appeared that a Chinese model was able to closely match the performance of top-ranked U.S. models, at a fraction of the cost.\nIf Manus proves to be as useful as its developers predict, it could signal a further shift in AI dominance, potentially prompting Western players to rethink their strategies.\nEveryday Agents\nSo, the race is on to create what I feel will become the equivalent of the computer operating system for the AI era. Essentially, agentic AI that enables anyone to do things with machines that previously would have taken expert-level knowledge and skills.\nBecause of this, AI and automation will become increasingly ingrained in daily life as we use them to assist in many everyday and workplace tasks.\nThis, in turn, will lead to a fundamental shift in the nature of the relationship between humans and technology as, for the first time in history, it becomes capable of acting autonomously on our behalf.\nRelated Articles\nHow AI Agents Will Revolutionize Your Day-To-Day Life\nBy now, \u201csmart\u201d versions exist of just about every home appliance, gadget and gizmos we can think of.
