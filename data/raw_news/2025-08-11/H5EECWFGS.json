  "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth explains what is \u2018front and center\u2019 in President Donald Trump\u2019s quest to make Washington, D.C. safe on 'The Ingraham Angle.'",
  "content": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth elaborated on what President Donald Trump has \"got the guts\" to do, after they announced Monday Washington, D.C.'s police force will be federalized.\n\n\"We're going to work right alongside our law enforcement partners as force multipliers,\" Hegseth told \"The Ingraham Angle.\"\n\nAs part of the White House\u2019s efforts to crack down on crime, Trump declared it was \"Liberation Day\" and officially placed the Washington D.C.\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. Hegseth also teased 800 National Guard troops will be deployed \"in the coming week.\"\n\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\n\nThis comes after recent acts of violence in the capital city made national headlines, including a former DOGE staffer being assaulted and a 21-year-old congressional intern being fatally caught in the crossfire of a drive-by shooting a mile away from the White House in June.\n\n\"If our capital city is a mess, if we can't control our capital city, then what does the rest of the country look like?\" Hegseth asked.\n\nWhen Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked how long the troops will be in the nation\u2019s capital, Hegseth called their deployment \"conditions-based,\" emphasizing the administration will support all parts of law enforcement to \"make sure people who are arrested are actually locked up.\"\n\nTRUMP ACTIVATES NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO ADDRESS \u2018TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL\u2019 CRIME IN WASHINGTON\n\n\"That's why the president's talking about cashless bail and sanctuary cities,\" Hegseth explained. \"If you're illegal here in D.C., that's going to be a problem. So all of these things that apply to law and order are front and center for us.\"\n\nThe National Guard could be deployed for weeks or months, but when they should pull out is ultimately the \"president\u2019s call,\" Hegseth added.\n\nHegseth also responded to accusations the Trump administration is acting as \"authoritarians\" would, insisting these critiques are no different than what he heard when they \"quelled the protests of the attacks on ICE officers\" in Los Angeles in June.\n\nHEGSETH SPARS WITH SENATE DEMOCRATS OVER MARINE DEPLOYMENT TO LA ANTI-ICE RIOTS: 'NOT ABOUT LETHALITY'\n\n\"I was told, \u2018Oh, you're going to lock up political opponents, you're going to go after Democrats,\u2019 yada yada. It's the same stuff every time. Mischaracterizing our intentions,\" Hegseth argued.\n\nHe continued, \"The intentions of this president is to establish law and order using legal and lawful and constitutional means, which he completely has, and you know why they don't like him? He's got the guts to do it.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn June, President Donald Trump had ordered 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, despite Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s, D-Calif, strong stance against it.",

      "text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sparred with Democratic senators during a hearing Wednesday about the Trump administration's deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles amid the ongoing anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots.\nIn his opening statement before the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Hegseth reiterated how President Donald Trump charged him to focus on restoring \"warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards and readiness\" to the Department of Defense \u2014 a point Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., later honed in on during his line of questioning for the secretary.\nReed noted that the Trump administration federalized 4,000 California National Guard members and deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles.\nReed said what is happening in Los Angeles comes in addition to the approximately 11,000 military personnel, including active duty soldiers and National Guard members, who have deployed to the southern border in support of U.S. Customs and Border Protection \u2014 a figure which Hegseth corrected. The defense secretary said some 13,000 military personnel have deployed to the southern border and that he has visited those troops several times.\nJOHNSON SAYS HEGSETH POSSIBLY SENDING MARINES TO ANTI-ICE RIOTS NOT HEAVY-HANDED: 'DETERRING EFFECT'\n\"People will say that mobilization hurts readiness. When you talk to them, it actually improves their readiness,\" Hegseth said.\nReed told Hegseth, \"Your whole ethic seems to be revolved on the lethality of the military force. How is this operation with Marines and National Guardsmen improving their lethality?\n\"Readiness and training and accountability is all about lethality,\" Hegseth said. \"The more ready you are, the more capable you are, the more accountable you are, the higher your standards are, it all makes you more lethal.\"\n\"The mission in Los Angeles, as you know well, sir, is not about lethality,\" the secretary continued. \"It's about maintaining law and order on behalf of law enforcement agents who deserve to do their job without being attacked by mobs of people. We are very proud that the National Guard and the Marines are on the streets defending the ICE agents, and they will continue.\"\nA Defense official told Fox News that the Marines who arrived in Los Angeles are an infantry unit and are still undergoing training, including in nonlethal weapons and use of force protocols in a domestic setting, at Seal Beach. They have not yet been tapped to respond to street demonstrations as of Wednesday morning.\nReed argued that \"law and order is a civil function under the Constitution,\" but Hegseth said that \"there is plenty of precedent for the U.S. supporting law enforcement officers.\"\n\"What your military is doing right now is laying concertina wire, guarding buildings, maintaining vehicles for other services,\" Reed said. \"This is not only, I think, illegal, but also a diminution of the readiness and the focus of the military.\"\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration for federalizing the National Guard to respond to the riots and for tapping the Marines. A federal judge on Tuesday night declined California's request for an immediate restraining order to block Trump's use of military personnel and scheduled a court hearing to further weigh the legality of the matter for Thursday.\nFEDERAL JUDGE REFUSES TO BLOCK TRUMP'S LA NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT ON NEWSOM'S TIMEFRAME\nIn a separate line of questioning at the Senate hearing on Wednesday, Hegseth said Newsom \"wants to play politics.\"\nSen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, had asked another witness, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. John D. Caine, if the U.S. had been \"invaded by a foreign nation\" or if \"there is a rebellion somewhere in the United States.\"\nCaine deferred to the Department of Homeland Security to answer border-related questions in terms of a potential invasion and added on the question of a rebellion that, \"there are certainly some frustrated folks out there.\"\n\"It\u2019s quite easy to point out that there has been an invasion of 21 million illegals in our country under the previous administration, so this administration was elected to get a hold of that,\" Hegseth added. \"And when you have ICE officers being attacked with concrete blocks, they should be allowed to do their jobs.\"\nSchatz interjected, telling Hegseth he would \"really like not to create a viral moment.\"\nThe senator said he was trying to \"understand the scope of the order,\" which, he says, does not specify a location or which Marines or which Guard members would be mobilized.\n\"Did you just mobilize every guard everywhere and every service member everywhere? I mean, create the framework for that,\" Schatz said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHegseth said an initial order federalized 2,000 National Guard troops in California and there was a follow-up order for an additional 2,000 members because the situation there \"required more resources in order to support law enforcement.\"\n\"So part of it is getting ahead of a problem, so that if in other places, if there are other riots in places where law enforcement officers are threatened, we would have the capability to surge National Guard there if necessary,\" Hegseth said. \"And thankfully, in most of those states, you'd have a governor that recognizes the need for it, supports it, and mobilizes it, him or herself. In California, unfortunately, the governor wants to play politics with it.\"\nFox News' Liz Friden contributed to this report."

      "text": "Gavin Newsom is a Democratic politician and the 40th governor of California, entering office in January 2019. With over 20 years of political experience in the Golden State, Newsom previously served as the lieutenant governor of California from 2011 to 2019 and was elected the mayor of San Francisco in 2004. As the leader of the biggest and most populated state, Newsom is considered one of the country's most influential Democrats.\nNewsom is a native of San Francisco, the son of William Newsom, an appeal judge for California Courts. Before he entered elected office, Newsom worked in the private sector, starting a winery funding he raised from investors, including billionaire Gordon Getty. Newsom eventually sold his winery shares in 2004 after being elected mayor of San Francisco.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Newsom faced widespread criticism after he was pictured breaking his own health guidelines while dining inside a luxurious restaurant in Napa Valley. The image showed Newsom dining maskless with a large group of close friends and political allies, including California lobbyists, while celebrating his birthday. The scandal helped grow support around the effort to recall the governor, gaining more than 2 million signatures to trigger a recall election.\nHowever, Newsom went on to defeat the recall attempt by over 3 million votes, defeating conservative talk show host Larry Elder, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, and a dozen other candidates. He will face another election in November 2022, but has already won the state's Democratic nomination with 61% of the vote.\nUnder Newsom's administration, California has seen a large exodus of its urban and rural population to other states such as Texas and Florida. Many experts have blamed the depopulation partly due to the state's high living costs for gas and rent and Newsom's tax policy \u2014 the highest in the nation."

      "text": "President Donald Trump announced Monday that he is activating approximately 800 National Guard troops and is taking over the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington, after beefing up federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital Saturday.\n\"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC,\" Trump told reporters at a Monday press conference. \"And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.\"\nTrump also said that he would federalize the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington to respond to crime, placing it under the authority of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nNational Guard troops are reserve forces that are mobilized in response to state and federal operations, including natural disasters, and are typically overseen by their respective state governments. However, Trump controversially deployed National Guard troops from California to respond to immigration riots in June, bypassing California Gov. Gavin Newsom to dispatch the troops.\nThe federal government oversees the District of Columbia National Guard.\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will operationalize the D.C. National Guard, and signaled that more National Guard troops could be roped into the deployment down the line.\n\"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week,\" Hegseth told reporters Monday. \"At your direction as well, sir, there are other units we are prepared to bring in. Other National Guard units, other specialized units. They will be strong, they will be tough, and they will stand with their law enforcement partners.\"\nTrump\u2019s remarks come just after he promised Washington would be \"LIBERATED\" from \"Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum\" in a post on Truth Social Monday morning. He said in the post that the \"days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER!\"\nTrump floated the idea of taking over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department and utilizing National Guard troops to manage crime in Washington Wednesday, following the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer on Aug. 3 in Washington\u2019s Logan Circle.\nTRUMP THREATENS TO FEDERALIZE DC AFTER EX-DOGE EMPLOYEE 'BIG BALLS' VIOLENTLY BEATEN\n\"What a shame \u2013 rate of crime, the rate of muggings, killings and everything else, we\u2019re not going to let it, and that includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly, too,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday at the White House.\nTrump also told reporters at the time he was open to taking over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department because crime in the nation\u2019s capital is \"ridiculous.\"\nWhile a temporary federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is justified in cases of emergency, Trump's move will likely be challenged in court over whether the situation in Washington qualifies as an emergency.\nTrump has historically railed against violence in Washington, and said Tuesday that crime is \"totally out of control\" in the nation's capital.\nMeanwhile, crime in Washington is on the decline. Violent crime is down 26% this year, in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. Likewise, assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.\nWATCH: TRUMP HINTS HE WILL FEDERALIZE DC SOON, BRING IN NATIONAL GUARD AFTER \u2018BIG BALLS\u2019 ATTACK\nWashington\u2019s Mayor Muriel Bowser challenged Trump\u2019s description of the city during an interview with MSNBC Sunday, and voiced concerns about the possibility of activating the National Guard to tackle the city\u2019s crime.\n\"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,\" Bowser said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I\u2019m concerned about them not being used efficiently, and I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\" Bowser said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated."

      "text": "President Donald Trump shared new details on Monday about his plan to take control of public safety in Washington, D.C., following a brutal attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer, but D.C. residents aren't convinced.\nTrump announced on Monday that he is activating the District of Columbia National Guard and seizing control of the Metropolitan Police Department after floating the idea since last week's assault in Washington\u2019s Logan Circle.\nSome Washington residents who spoke to Fox News Digital called it a \"terrible idea\" that \"doesn't make a lot of sense.\"\n\"I think D.C. politics should stay with D.C., and, unfortunately, the federal government is apparently overstepping their bounds right now, so I hope that D.C. is allowed to govern itself, as well as police itself,\" one Washington resident told Fox News Digital ahead of Trump's announcement.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nTrump controversially federalized the California National Guard amid anti-ICE protests that delved into riots in Los Angeles in June. Protesters were rejecting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations and Trump's robust immigration crackdown.\nThe president bypassed Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy National Guard troops to support ICE deportation. It was the first time a president federalized the National Guard without the governor's request in more than 60 years.\nNow, the tension between local and federal powers is unfolding in the nation's capital. But just like in California, many Washington residents have concerns about seeing \"troops on our streets.\"\n\"We have laws for a reason,\" one resident told Fox News Digital.\n\"Privatizing security is a terrible idea, and I think anything that Trump does is garbage,\" another Washington resident added.\nDespite their apprehension about National Guard troops patrolling the nation's capital, many residents said something needs to be done to address crime in Washington, D.C.\nWhile the Department of Justice indicated a 30-year low in violent crime last year, concerns about the city's safety linger, with one resident telling Fox News Digital, \"The city is getting dangerous.\"\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" one resident said of Trump's new plan. \"It's something that needs to be done for the city to be safe. Right now, we're not safe. The kids and the teenagers are doing everything. So yeah, I think that's a great idea.\"\nAnd another Washington resident said, \"We need all the protection that we can get in the city, because the city is really getting dangerous,\" telling Fox News Digital that she has to \"make sure to come home before sundown\" and she is afraid of getting robbed when she gets off public transportation.\n\"Things do seem out of control and desperate, but I don't know what kind of numbers to take, what numbers to read. One minute they'll say crime is out of control. Next minute, they will say crime is down a certain percentage. It's kind of confusing, and I don't know who to believe in and which way to go, to be honest,\" a Washington resident said, articulating the dichotomy between the low crime statistics and the alarming crime stories.\nBut another D.C. resident said, \"There's no way he should be in control of anything,\" and Washington, D.C., \"should be a state,\" so the district has more power to make decisions for itself.\n\"I don't think it's necessary,\" another Washington resident added. \"I do think there needs to be some change within [the] Metropolitan [Police Department] because safety is an issue.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe added: \"It needs to be localized.\"\nFox News Digital's Diana Stacy contributed to this report."
