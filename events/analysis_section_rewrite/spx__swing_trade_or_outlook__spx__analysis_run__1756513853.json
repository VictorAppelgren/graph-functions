      "feedback": "Remove the fifth, malformed “Down | 0‑3 weeks | 4,000 …” line – it contains price levels, a 2:1 ratio, and a confidence score that are not part of the required format and have no source ID. Keep only four mover lines (two Up, two Down). For each line add a “what to watch” clause (e.g., “earnings guidance, margin surprise” for CrowdStrike, “Q2 earnings guidance” for EPAM, “court ruling on damages” for Tesla). Ensure every driver/mechanism is linked to a canonical handle (spx, ndx) and cite the source ID immediately after the numeric fact (e.g., “CrowdStrike earnings release (KNWKYIQ1W)”). Probabilities must be justified by the material; if the source does not provide a probability, either remove the % or replace it with a range that reflects the magnitude of impact (e.g., 20‑30 % for a 5‑10 bp move). After the four mover lines, add a single Swing‑Trade line for the Tesla verdict: “Down | 0‑3 weeks | Tesla verdict | Entry: 0.74 % spx drop (≈ 0.74 % of index) | Stop: 0.5 % | Target: 1.5 % | R/R: 3:1 | Invalidation: Favorable settlement or NHTSA ruling | Trigger: Court ruling on damages (LJZYDXVL3) | Probability %: 70 % | Confidence 0‑100: 80”. Ensure the trade line follows the exact syntax and uses only IDs present in the source. Remove any extraneous text, keep the output concise, and verify that each line contains the required fields in the correct order.",
