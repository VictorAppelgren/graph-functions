  "title": "Patch Now: New WinRAR Flaw Used to Deliver Malware",
  "description": "ESET discovers a Russian hacking group exploiting the vulnerability to deliver malware through phishing emails. WinRAR patched it, but it's up to users to install version 7.13.",
  "content": "Security researchers have discovered a new flaw in WinRAR that was recently exploited to spread malware through phishing emails.\n\nThe flaw, CVE-2025-8088, can be harnessed through maliciously crafted archive files, according to BleepingComputer, which first reported on the vulnerability.\n\nNormally, WinRAR is supposed to extract files from an archive to the user's specified path. But through the flaw, it looks like a booby-trapped file can extract the data to a hacker-selected path, creating a way to execute rogue computer code on a victim\u2019s machine, including Windows PCs running WinRAR.\n\nThree researchers at antivirus provider ESET discovered the vulnerability. Although details are thin, the company told PCMag it\u2019s \u201cobserved spearphishing emails with attachments containing RAR files. These archives exploited the CVE-2025-8088 to deliver RomCom backdoors. RomCom is a Russia-aligned group.\u201d Past versions of RomCom malware can steal sensitive data and install other malicious payloads.\n\nThe good news is that WinRAR patched the vulnerability last week with version 7.13 Final . Unfortunately, the popular file-archiving tool doesn\u2019t feature an auto-update mechanism. So it\u2019ll be up to users to manually download and install the new version to receive protection, otherwise they\u2019ll remain at risk.\n\nIn the release notes, WinRAR said the problem affects \u201cprevious versions of WinRAR, Windows versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code and UnRAR.dll.\u201d However, Unix versions of RAR, UnRAR, portable UnRAR source code and UnRAR library, and RAR for Android, are not affected.\n\nAs a free archive utility, WinRAR has attracted over 500 million users. In June, WinRAR also patched a separate flaw that could be exploited through booby-trapped archive files as well.",
