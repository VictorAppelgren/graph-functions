  "title": "iOS 18 vs. iOS 26: Here's How Liquid Glass Changes the Look of Your iPhone",
  "description": "Is Liquid Glass the dramatic update you think it is? Yes and no. Here's how it compares to what's on your iPhone today.",
  "content": "Apple's Liquid Glass brings a new translucent gloss to several aspects of your iPhone's user interface and is a new unifying design language you'll soon find on the likes of your Mac, Apple Watch and iPad. It's noticeable but not glaring, and familiar in all the right ways while still feeling fresh.\n\nIf you're currently running the iOS 26 public beta, you already have an idea how Liquid Glass affects your overall iPhone experience -- which isn't dramatically different from what's on the current stable build of iOS 18 right now. The updates are welcomed, but you won't suddenly lose your way due to the design changes -- this is still the easy-to-use iOS you've known for years.\n\nThat said, some elements are different and are easy to notice, and that's just what I'll be pointing out below. Here's how iOS 26 and Liquid Glass compare to iOS 18.\n\nFor more, here's one thing Apple could do with the iPhone 17 that would be seriously impressive.\n\nLooking at the home screens, the primary difference you'll find is that in iOS 26, the dock background and the search option that sits between the dock and the home screen icons are more transparent and have a sheen to the edges, whereas in iOS 18, these are slightly darker.\n\nOther smaller changes are that the icons on iOS 26 look slightly larger, and some app icons seem to have been more influenced by the redesign than others, most notably (from the screenshots) Settings, Camera and Mail.\n\nFor Liquid Glass to really shine on the home screen, you'll want to opt for the \"All Clear\" mode, which will create the most dramatic change to your icons and widgets. Going this route could potentially introduce some viewability issues, but the \"reduce transparency\" setting remedies this quite well.\n\nThings here are largely unchanged. Outside of the new glassy look in iOS 26, the 1x2 and 2x1 controls are more rounded than those of iOS 18.\n\nIt's easy to see the differences that Liquid Glass brings to the iPhone lock screen. The digital clock in iOS 26 dynamically resizes depending on the wallpaper and the number of notifications you have at any given moment, which is pretty cool. The clock itself on iOS 18 can be changed, but it won't change in size in response to content displayed on the lock screen.\n\nThe background on notifications is clearly different between the two OS versions, with iOS 18 providing more opacity and black text versus iOS 26's near-transparent background on white text. The controls at the bottom in iOS 26 also appear more like physical buttons with depth and more of a see-through background.\n\nThe new unlock effect in iOS 26 is that the motion of unlocking your iPhone will appear as though you're lifting a sheet of glass, highlighted by a shiny edge to give it form when you begin to slide your finger up.\n\nA new addition in iOS 26 is the introduction of dynamic tab bars in apps that will change depending on whether you're scrolling or trying to perform a specific action. Apple says this will create a more intuitive experience while freeing up space for your content. If you were to replace the glass effect with heavily saturated colors, no one would blame you for mistaking this new tab bar with what Google's doing in Android 16 in some of its apps -- they look a lot alike. But compared to iOS 18, this new dynamic tab bar should not only reduce sifting through multiple menus, but it looks pretty good in the process.\n\niOS 26 will dynamically adapt to light and dark backgrounds\n\nWhile it's harder to compare Liquid Glass to iOS 18 here, an upcoming feature is that buttons and menus will adapt depending on the content's background color. For instance, when you're scrolling through an app with a light background, the floating menu options will appear with black text for easier viewing and will automatically change to white upon scrolling to a dark background.\n\niOS has had this type of feature show up in a less dramatic fashion before, as you can tell from the photos app screenshots above. Comparing these to what's on the horizon, it's hard not to get excited about the small tweaks Liquid Glass has in store, too.\n\nThose are just a few of our initial findings, and we'll likely add more once we surface them. If you want more about iOS 26, check out three upcoming features that are a bigger deal than Liquid Glass.",

      "text": "There are five models in Apple's current iPhone 16 lineup, and we tested and reviewed them all. Each has a different appeal, depending on your needs and budget. The $829 iPhone 16 gets you new buttons for shortcuts, an additional camera and MagSafe. Then there's the $999 iPhone 16 Pro, which has a new camera and a bigger screen. The $599 iPhone 16E is the most affordable. It has the same chip as the iPhone 16, along with a single rear camera, but it lacks Apple's most notable features, like MagSafe charging. Please note that we expect the iPhone 17 series to be revealed in September. So it might be best to hold off on buying any new iPhone until then.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat's the best iPhone right now?\nThe best iPhone for most people is the $799 iPhone 16. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger, 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps.\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and creating summaries of messages and web pages. There's also ChatGPT integration with Siri. The phones have an Action button, too, which can be programmed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at.\nBest iPhones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings\n- Photographic Styles makes photos pop\n- Ultrawide camera is better in low light\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t out yet\n- No always on display\n- No changes to wired charging speeds\n- No upgrades to the Action button\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.\nWho it's best for\nWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don\u2019t need the Pro\u2019s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won\u2019t disappoint.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.\nPros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $1,000\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.\nThe phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.\nWhy we like it\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech.\nPros\n- Does most of the Apple stuff I want\n- Battery life is great\n- Matte finish back\n- The rear camera is good\n- A18 chip performance\nCons\n- $599 price isn't cheap\n- Odd value proposition\n- Lacks MagSafe\n- Screen is good, but wonder how it will age\nApple took a Taco Bell-like approach with the $599 iPhone 16E, mixing and matching parts and features from prior phones to create a \"new\" iPhone. Its design and screen are similar to the iPhone 14. Its A18 processor is the same as the one in the iPhone 16. In my testing, I found that this gives the iPhone 16E a weird value proposition. It's new, but it's old. It's affordable, but not cheap.\nIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters. I do recommend looking into carrier deals, discounts and trade-ins to drop that price a bit, unless you're set on doing an installment plan over a couple of years. Read our iPhone 16E review.\nWhy we like it\nAfter testing the iPhone 16E, I was most surprised by how wonderfully uneventful it was to use. Along with all the standard iOS 18 functions and goodies, like iMessage and FaceTime, I used Apple Intelligence, made calls on 5G, took a bunch of share-worthy photos and videos and played video games like Resident Evil 4. If this is all you want in an iPhone, look no further.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the day plus battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters.\nWho shouldn't get it\nChoosing between the $829 iPhone 16 and the $599 16E is a tough choice. If you have the budget, I'd go with the regular 16. You get a brighter screen, MagSafe, and an ultrawide camera that doubles as a macro lens -- great for taking close-up photos like of food since the main camera automatically switches to a cropped version of the ultrawide in order to nail focus.\nPros\n- USB-C port is more convenient charging\n- Colorful matte design\n- Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\n- Dynamic Island brings better multitasking\nCons\n- No always-on display\n- Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\n- Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\n- Galaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.\nThe iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone.\nWho it's best for\nThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.\nWho shouldn't get it\nApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy.\nThe iPhone 16 is the recipient of a CNET Editors' Choice award, and you can get one for free when you switch to T-Mobile.

The $599 price is more than Apple's previous cheap phone, the $429 iPhone SE, but it has a similar appeal especially for those currently on an older iPhone.\nFactors to consider when buying a new iPhone\nHold the iPhone first: You may love or hate the way it looks and feels in person.\nDon't discount the last year's model: Apple has a history of keeping recent iPhone models from previous years around at a lower price. You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a new iPhone 16 can do for a fraction of the price. The iPhone 15 packs a great camera and a big battery, but comes at a more reasonable price.\nBuy an iPhone case and screen protector: You'll protect your iPhone from costly damage, and will increase the phone's resale or trade-in value for when you're ready to move on.\nKnow what you care about most: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? Phones like the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, for example, pack incredible cameras that almost rival the quality you'd get from a DSLR. If you're a photographer, then spending money here is a good idea.\nSeek out holiday discounts: Look for deep discounts and promo deals around major holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday. And find out what your grace period is in case you need a quick return or exchange.\nHow we test iPhone models\nWe test every iPhone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new iOS updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for the iPhone, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K 120fps slow-mo video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long the iPhone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test and a 45-minute drain test starting with a full battery, which isn't always included in the initial review and added later in an update.\nPerformance measuring\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos and videos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of the iPhone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. Some of these tests are added later in updates after the initial review is published.\nRead more: How CNET Tests Phones\nOther iPhones we tested\nWhile Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review.\nKey terms\neSIM\nAn eSIM takes all of the important information about your phone account -- including its number, wireless carrier and subscription -- and stores it in software instead of on a physical SIM card.\nWith the iPhone 14, 15 and 16 series Apple removed the physical SIM card tray and embraced embedded SIM cards in the US. This means you can't just pluck your SIM card out of your current phone and put it into a new one. But this shouldn't affect your experience since all the major US carriers and a number of smaller operators work with eSIM.\nApple has long supported eSIM, dating back to 2018's iPhone XS, XS Max and XR. When setting up a new iPhone 14, 15 or 16, tthe device will guide you through transferring your current provider over to the new phone. A list of supported wireless networks can be found on Apple's website.\niOS 18\nApple's iOS 18 is the latest iPhone software version. It's on the iPhone 16 by default and is also available as an update for the iPhone XR and later. iOS 18 includes new features such as being able to move apps anywhere on your home screen, change an app icon's color and a size, add buttons to Control Center, use emoji and live photo stickers as Tapbacks in Messages, support for RCS in messages and eventually Apple Intelligence on some models.\niPhone FAQs\nWhen is the best time of year to buy a new iPhone?\niPhone or Android?\nShould I wait for the new iPhone model (iPhone 17)?\nHow reliable is an iPhone?\nHow long does an iPhone last?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nThere's already been plenty of buzz about what we could see with the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 17 -- from a slimmer version of the upcoming device to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on baseline models. The camera module could also get a makeover, and reports suggest Apple will overhaul the look and feel of its software with the launch of iOS 19. Apple doesn't release details on future products, but to get an idea of what to expect, we rounded up rumors, leaks and analysis on the iPhone 17 Air (one of several nicknames for Apple's next iPhone).

      "text": "Google just kicked off this year's I/O developer conference with its first-ever Android Show, giving us an early look at Android 16 a week before the main keynote on May 20.\nCenter stage is Material 3 Expressive, Google's new design for Android and Wear OS, which brings new dynamic colors, springy animations and a more fluid experience to your smartphone and watch.\nRead more: We 'Stole' a Phone From Google's Sameer Samat and Were Dazzled by Android 16\nIt's not all about looks, though.\nGoogle also previewed new features and settings, like smarter notifications, improved privacy and security and greater customization. And, oh yeah: Gemini AI is coming to more of your devices, like watches, cars, TVs and even Samsung's upcoming XR headset.\nFrom the biggest Android redesign in years to Gemini rolling out across more devices, here's everything new, including Android 16, Wear OS 6, new tools to fight scammers and features focused on keeping your data safe.\nAndroid 16 is getting a major redesign\nGoogle's Material 3 Expressive design pushes Android's trademark customization even further. The theme this year seems to be \"springy,\" as in more fluid, as well as putting natural animations into every corner of your user interface.\nInteractions feel more tactile: Swipe away a notification and the whole stack ripples with a spring\u2011loaded motion, along with a satisfying haptic rumble when you snap the notification off. Even everyday gestures, like swiping down the shade, scrolling recent apps or adjusting the volume slider, all now come with the same playful bounce.\nAnd you'll see these changes, as well as updated dynamic color themes and bolder typography, across your entire phone, including in Google apps like Gmail and Google Photos.https://www.cnet.com/videos/everything-announced-at-the-android-show-io-edition-in-14-minutes/\nBesides aesthetics, Android 16 also brings new functionality to your phone. In Quick Settings, you can squeeze in more of your favorite toggles, like Flashlight and Do Not Disturb, while the new Live Updates feature lets you easily track real\u2011time progress notifications (your Uber Eats delivery, a rideshare ETA, navigation directions, etc.) so you never have to hunt for these status alerts.\nExpect Android 16 to debut first on Pixel devices later this year, with partner phones to follow.\nRead more: Find out why we're fans of Android 16's new, bouncier look, and how Gemini will improve your Google TV experience.\nWear OS 6 is rounder, smoother and longer-lasting\nMaterial 3 Expressive is also landing on your wrist, this time shaped around Wear OS' circular screens. As you scroll through your watch, lists animate so that more information is accessible, buttons stretch to hug the bezel of your watch so that they're more easily tappable, and the animations are also smoother and easier to follow, like on your phone.\nDynamic color theming syncs the whole system with your watch face palette, so that your interface feels cohesive instead of cobbled together. Tiles have been reengineered to surface more information, like a one\u2011tap shortcut to your favorite contacts or workout. With continued improvements to performance and power optimization, you can expect up to 10% more battery life, the company says.\nWear OS 6 is arriving later this year.\n3 privacy and security features coming to Android 16\nAndroid's security playbook is getting three solid upgrades aimed at keeping you one step ahead of scammers, thieves and hackers.\nFor starters, the AI-powered Scam Detection feature, which blocks suspicious messages within Google Messages, is getting smarter and better at spotting new text scams. On Android 16, Scam Detection can now flag everything from crypto \"investment\" hustles to bogus toll\u2011road fees, blocking billions of shady texts each month.\nNext, we have Find Hub, a new dashboard where you can track your phone and luggage tag or check that your child made it home safely. The service is adding more third\u2011party Bluetooth tags, and later this year, it will tap satellite connectivity (where carriers support it) so you can still share your location when cell service drops out. Google is also teaming with airlines like British Airways and Singapore Airlines to let you share your tag's location with the airline for speedier luggage recovery.\nTo round things out, Android 16 folds Google's beefiest security settings into an easier\u2011to\u2011toggle Advanced Protection mode. Flip it on and you get the same privacy and security features Google reserves for high\u2011risk users, like journalists and politicians, including stronger sign\u2011in requirements, stricter app checks and extra safeguards against malware.\nGemini is coming to more of your devices\nGoogle is pushing forward to bring Gemini onto every screen you own, whether it's your watch, dashboard, TV or the mixed\u2011reality headset Samsung is releasing later this year.\nOn Wear OS you'll soon be able to call out reminders mid\u2011workout (\"Remember that I'm using locker 43\") or dig up restaurant details without pawing at your keyboard.\nIn the car, Gemini takes over voice duties from Google Assistant, letting you speak to navigate to an EV charger near a park, summarize chaotic group chats, or catch you up on the day's news while you drive.\nBack at home, Gemini on Google TV will serve up kid\u2011safe movie picks and pull YouTube explainer videos on demand (\"How big is Jupiter, exactly?\"). And on Android XR, Google's new platform for headsets and smart glasses, you'll be able to plan an entire vacation in immersive 3D, surrounded by maps, videos and local tips.\nGemini is also coming to Sony and Samsung earbuds.\nGemini is coming to your car\nGoogle is bringing its Gemini AI assistant into your driver's seat, first on the 250 million vehicles that already run Android Auto (in the coming months), then on Google\u2011built\u2011in dashboards in car models like the Lincoln Nautilus, Renault R5 and Honda Passport (later this year).\nWith Gemini, you'll be able to talk to your car the way you talk to a passenger. You can ask Gemini to \"always text Joe in Spanish,\" surface taco joints along your route, or find an address in a buried Gmail thread, all without you having to memorize any complicated phrases or poke at your screen.\nAnd with Gemini Live, you can workshop ideas (\"How do I ask for that promotion?\") and learn something new (\"Tell me everything about Frank Lloyd Wright\") hands\u2011free in your car.\nGoogle's car advancements don't stop at AI. The company is also adding new apps to its catalog, along with new categories like games and videos, so that charging stops and school pickups are a little bit more entertaining. It's also rolling out digital car keys to more brands, including Audi, Volvo and Polestar.\nExpect deeper demos of everything next week at Google I/O."

      "text": "We're now less than a month away from Apple unveiling the iPhone 17, if rumors are to be believed. I always look forward to this highlight of the tech calendar, especially since I've been writing about and primarily using an iPhone for well over a decade.\nWhen it comes to the 2025 iPhone, there's one thing I'd love to see Apple prioritize -- and it might not be what you expect. It's not a cool new design, a bigger battery or a more impressive camera. It's definitely not advanced AI capabilities.\nInstead what I'd love to see from the iPhone 17 is even better repairability, particularly more self-repair options. A lot of tech inevitably passes through my hands as part of my job, but I feel a keen responsibility not to feed into the culture of over-consumption. Treating gadgets as disposable is an unrealistic way to live, and it places a heavy burden on our already overburdened planet.\nExtending the life of our tech through repair is one of the tools at our disposal to reduce that burden. Increasingly, and partly due to an increase in right-to-repair legislation coming into force around the world, tech companies are making it easier for us to perform these repairs ourselves, rather than relying solely on costly in-house repair schemes.\nFor a long time, Apple was not among them. In fact, it strongly advised people not to tinker with their iPhones at home at all. That all changed in 2021 when it introduced its Self-Repair Program. It's continued to take strides in making it easier to repair phones -- which, let's not forget, are complex, intricately designed pieces of technology. But it still has some way to go, especially when it comes to ease and accessibility.\nI'm currently using an iPhone 15 Pro Max that's rapidly approaching its second birthday. It's no spring chicken, but aside from its waning battery capacity, I have absolutely no complaints about its performance. Next month it will get its annual software upgrade with the release of iOS 26 and it will feel brand new to me all over again. This is a phone that has years of life left in it -- if I choose to replace the battery, that is.\nBut in all truthfulness, I'm nervous to do it. I've repaired plenty of tech in my time, usually under the supervision of someone far more skilled than I am, but the stakes feel so much higher. The spare parts and repair tools aren't cheap, and it could quickly get even more expensive if I mess it up. Then I'd have no choice but to invest in a new phone after all.\nI'm determined to try, but I'd also like Apple to make it even easier in the future for me to replace the battery -- I don't want to feel like I'm conducting open-heart surgery on my phone. I have to commend the company for its efforts in this direction already.\nWhen Kyle Wiens, CEO of online community, advocacy group and parts retailer iFixit, performed his first teardown of the iPhone 16 last year, he pointed out many of the repairability improvements Apple introduced with the model and praised the company for releasing the repair manual on the same day as the phone.\nTwo months later, Apple started selling replacement components via its Self-Repair Program. Even better, the company lets people rent, rather than buy, the repair kits they need, reducing further waste and the overall cost of making repairs.\nIt was an important step in the right direction for Apple and spurred iFixit to award the iPhone 16 a repairability score of 7/10. That still leaves room for improvement, and I hope to see the iPhone take at least one additional step toward becoming the gold standard in phone repairability this year. It's not an easy thing for a phone-maker to do, but Apple has been a pioneer in so many respects. Why not this one too?"

      "text": "Ever since downloading an early developer beta preview of iOS 26, my iPhone has more bounce, warble and bloop about it. The design changes coming to Apple gadgets have been a hot topic on social media. The new operating systems are adopting an interface style called Liquid Glass, revealed this week at the Worldwide Developers Conference, which transforms menus, apps and buttons into something of translucent jelly... with spunk.\nBut if you can see past the clear icons, there are other updates coming to iOS 26 that matter more to our day-to-day lives. Taking a screenshot of a party invite can instantly put it in your calendar. Maps can suggest route changes without you asking for driving directions. And robots can intercept phone calls -- or jump into the conversation as a live language translator.\nIn this week's episode of One More Thing, which you can watch in the video embedded above, I take an early poke at some of these new features and share questions I have about how it will perform when released to the public. Apple is still months away from finalizing the software, but perhaps I'm most curious about how folks will embrace the assistive tools (and if they will be accurate).\nOr maybe we'll just be too distracted by clear bouncy buttons to notice.\nIf you're looking for more One More Thing, subscribe to our YouTube page to catch Bridget Carey breaking down the latest Apple news and issues every week."

      "text": "If you've been itching to poke around Apple's next big iPhone update, today's your day.\nApple just opened the first iOS 26 public beta (July 23) to anyone in its free Beta Software Program, letting everyday users try the new OS months before it ships alongside the iPhone 17 this fall. The public beta follows six weeks of dev-only releases, capped yesterday with developer beta 4.\niOS 26 is Apple's most ambitious revamp in years. The entire interface now shimmers with Liquid Glass, a translucent layer that morphs as you scroll, and an updated Apple Intelligence powers live call translation and a souped-up Visual Intelligence search. You'll also see other perks, like call screening and personalized text message chats.\nBefore you download, double-check your hardware: iOS 26 needs at least an A13 Bionic chip, so only the iPhone 11 and newer models qualify. Apple Intelligence features stay exclusive to the iPhone 16 line and iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\nAlso remember that it's still beta software. Expect bugs, battery dips and the occasional app crash. You should definitely back up your phone first (better yet, create an archive on your computer), consider installing on a spare device and keep your computer nearby in case you need to roll back to iOS 18. If that sounds good, here's how to install the iOS 26 public beta.\nDon't miss: Revert Back to iOS 18 From iOS 26 Beta: The No-Stress, Step-by-Step Guide\nHow to download the iOS 26 public beta on your iPhone\nAs long as you know the risks and have backed up your phone, you can download the iOS 26 public beta. Here's what you need to do:\n1. Enroll in Apple's Beta Software Program\nOn the iPhone you want to update, open Safari and visit beta.apple.com. Sign in with your Apple ID. If you're new to the program, tap Sign Up and follow the prompts to accept Apple's beta agreement.\n2. Sign up for the iOS 26 public beta\nAfter signing in, choose iOS at the top of the page. You'll land on a dashboard with details about the iOS 26 public beta. Under Get Started, tap Enroll your iOS device. Because Apple now handles betas directly in Settings (no more configuration profiles), all you need to do is link your Apple ID and you're good to go.\n3. Enable beta updates\nOn your iPhone, go to Settings > General > Software Update > Beta Updates. Choose iOS 26 Public Beta from the list.\n4. Download and install iOS 26 beta\nNow return to Settings > General > Software Update. The iOS 26 public beta should appear. Tap Download and Install and follow the on-screen instructions. Keep your phone on Wi-Fi and plugged in during the update.\nOnce your iPhone reboots, you'll be running the latest iOS 26 public beta -- complete with the new Liquid Glass interface and (if your hardware supports it) Apple Intelligence features."
