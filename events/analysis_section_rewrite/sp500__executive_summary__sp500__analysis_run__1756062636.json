      "feedback": "This draft shows admirable breadth but fails the executive, 4–6 sentence brief test: tighten to a single crisp house view, then a tightly scoped watch list and triggers anchored to sources; otherwise the piece is long, repetitive, and muddled across horizons. Actionable edits: (1) distill to a base-case Regime A with explicit probabilities (e.g., A ~50%, B ~30%, C ~20% per NL5YYTLF2) and a one-line causal chain p → ROIC → capex intensity → inflation/pricing power that lands on a stronger ROIC/wacc differential for capital‑intensive leaders; (2) anchor Ford as a concrete test case in that framework with the numbers you already cite (Ford EV losses ~$1.3B; adj EBIT ~4.3%; ROIC ~10.1%; forward multiple ~10x; dividend yield ~5%) and explain why it remains an income proxy rather than a growth driver within Regime A (22PL3Q360; 65UUBU0OR; O4ZEED2EB); (3) convert the near‑term content into a compact catalysts/risks/invalidation set: tariff moves around 25% on autos/parts; explicit chip/EV capex announcements; Costa sale close near £2B; Nvidia AI capex/earnings cadence and Red Sea shipping normalization as timing anchors (STBVARD8F; WTNT85IPR; 4661GWFP7; J99EM2TPZ; T1QE6JPIX); invalidate if tariffs escalate beyond 25% or roll back abruptly, if Costa sale collapses or AI demand stalls; (4) reduce the multi‑section flourish (0–3 week, base/bear/bull, regime probabilities, cross‑asset channels) into one concise 4–6 sentence brief plus a single line “watch list” that cites the above triggers; (5) ensure every assertion is sourced and only use IDs present in SOURCE MATERIAL, mapping each claim to SGB2PAZGK, NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, 65UUBU0OR, O4ZEED2EB, STBVARD8F, 5S9GJV2O3, I2SJU04DF, J99EM2TPZ, T1QE6JPIX, WTNT85IPR, I19NO2GMNF, I11, I12, I3G1PVPWPD; (6) prune repetitive governance and macro‑color, fix typos/hyphenation, and present a summerized, decision‑useful house view with explicit numeric anchors rather than prose‑heavy narration.",
