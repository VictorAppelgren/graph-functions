      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid narrative on Ether’s macro‑drivers but it falls short of the Argos acceptance gate because it never links the story to a canonical handle with an explicit sign/magnitude and a dated catalyst window.  Add a sentence that ties Ether to a liquid equity index (e.g., “Ether’s price moves are tightly coupled to the Nasdaq‑100 (ndx); a Fed‑induced easing cycle that lifts ndx by 4–8 % typically pushes Ether up 10–20 %”).  Cite OGK8WLL69 for the Fed‑crypto link and add the concrete catalyst window (2025‑09‑16 – 2025‑09‑20, Fed September meeting).  Explicitly state the causal chain: Fed cuts → lower real rates → risk‑on equity rally (ndx up 4–8 %) → higher demand for crypto treasuries → Ether up 10–20 %.  Include an invalidation scenario: Fed rate hike → real rates rise → ndx down 5–10 % → Ether down 10–20 %.  Quantify the ranges for both ndx and Ether, and give a confidence rating (moderate‑high).  Finally, add a watch list: Fed minutes, corporate treasury flows, regulatory announcements (Project Crypto, retirement‑plan order).  This will satisfy the mapping, catalyst, and quantification requirements and bring the analysis up to world‑class standards.",
