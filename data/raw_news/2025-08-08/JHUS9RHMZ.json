  "content": "Democratic strategist James Carville publicly apologized Thursday for posting a video suggesting some sort of \u201cEpstein connection\u201d involving first lady Melania Trump.\n\nThe 80-year-old pundit issued the mea culpa at the start of his latest \u201cPolitics War Room\u201d podcast episode, noting that he also took down and edited the offending video after hearing from the first lady\u2019s attorney.\n\n\u201cIn last week\u2019s podcast episode, we spoke with Judd Legum. After the episode, we received a letter from Melania Trump\u2019s lawyer. He took issue with our title of one of those YouTube videos from that episode and a couple of comments I made about the first lady,\u201d Carville explained.\n\n\u201cWe took a look at what they complained about, and we took down the video and edited out those comments from the episode,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI also take back these statements and apologize,\u201d Carville, sounding like he was reading a prepared statement, added.\n\nMelania shared a transcript of Carville\u2019s apology on X \u2013 along with a screenshot of the pulled video with a red \u201cX\u201d across it.\n\nThe YouTube clip was titled: \u201cJames Carville: The Epstein Connection \u2013 Trump & Melania.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what specific claims made by the former Bill Clinton campaign manager peeved the first lady\u2019s legal team since the offending comments have been scrubbed.\n\nCarville\u2019s retraction and apology follows lefty news website Daily Beast taking down a Melania story last week after the outlet was contacted by her lawyers.\n\n\u201cAfter this story was published, The Beast received a letter from First Lady Melania Trump\u2019s attorney challenging the headline and framing of the article,\u201d read the editor\u2019s note that replaced the article\u2019s text.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing the matter, the Beast has taken down the article and apologizes for any confusion or misunderstanding,\u201d the note continued.\n\nThe retracted article highlighted dubious claims by author Michael Wolff that a modeling agent connected to notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein introduced Melania to her husband, President Trump.\n\nIn her self-titled 2024 memoir, Melania explained that she met Trump at a September 1998 Fashion Week party at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City.\n\nTrump sat down next to his future wife and started a conversation, Melania recalled.\n\n\u201cI found myself drawn to his magnetic energy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe Trumps got engaged six years later and married in 2005.",

      "text": "\u201cDebanking\u201d seems like something out of paranoid dystopian fiction, but this horrific abuse of government power is already all too real.\nWe\u2019re almost glad the Biden crew deployed it against then-former-President Donald Trump in 2021: That not only ensures he\u2019s aware of this outrage; it points to how even the powerful are vulnerable.\nIt\u2019s as simple as it is scary: Government regulators give a quiet nod to financial institutions that certain people or industries are to be \u201cunpersoned,\u201d and pretty soon they get the same treatment as North Korean tyrants, terrorists or drug kingpins: locked out of the financial system, which means social death.\nThe victim gets turned away at other banks, all with no way to appeal what\u2019s blandly painted as a \u201cbusiness decision.\u201d\nJust try life without any ready way to cash checks or pay bills, not even a debit card \u2014 nor, if you run a business, a line of credit to pay suppliers and meet payroll.\nThe abuse apparently began under President Barack Obama, deployed against disfavored businesses such as gun manufacturers on the laughable ground that they posed a \u201creputational risk\u201d; it expanded under President Joe Biden to hit crypto and tech startups, as well as individuals whose opinions or political activity got labeled \u201cdangerous.\u201d\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen calls it a \u201cprivatized sanctions regime\u201d; American victims apparently number in the thousands.\nIn the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, Trump was first personally dropped by Chase, then refused service by Bank of America.\nAnd First Lady Melania Trump reports that she and her son Barron were dropped by their bank.\nThe good news is that Donald Trump is signing executive orders to crack down on the abuse and will surely sign legislation to prevent it.\nBanks have a duty to watch out for criminal abuse of their services, but forcing them to secretly enforce political insiders\u2019 ideological agenda is frighteningly totalitarian."

      "text": "Carville claims Dems are ditching anyone from failed 2024 Harris campaign as the party looks ahead to 2028\nLongtime Democratic strategist James Carville issued a warning Thursday to former Vice President Kamala Harris and her allies: the Democratic Party wants nothing to do with them in 2028.\nIn the months after the 2024 election, the Democratic Party has had a fraught relationship with former President Biden and Harris remaining in the public eye, with some prominent party figures wishing they would fade into the background.\nHarris recently announced she would not run for California governor, a move which many speculate leaves the door open for her to run for president again in 2028.\nDuring the episode of Carville\u2019s Politics War Room Podcast, a listener expressed concern that Harris might run again with party backing \u2014 a prospect Carville swiftly dismissed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be terrified,\u201d Carville said in response.\n\u201cShe wisely chose not to run for governor of California.\u201d\nHe shared his belief that she will not be the Democratic Party nominee in 2028.\n\u201cAnybody that had anything to do with 2024, the party wants to move on from that,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t anybody\u2019s fault.\u201d\nCarville expressed the same attitude towards Harris\u2019 former running-mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., and anybody else associated with her campaign.\n\u201cThis goes to Walz, too. I wouldn\u2019t run again,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat would be my \u2013 if I were your friend, if I would be your chief advisor, I\u2019m doing this not \u2013 from a personal standpoint. This is not going to be the environment that a 2024 Democrat that \u2013 the Democrats are not going to look to anybody that had anything to do with the 2024 campaign.\u201d\n\u201cJoe Biden, would you please go take the restful retirement you so richly reserve?,\u201d Carville\u2019s co-host Al Hunt responded.\nFox News Digital reached out to Harris and Walz and did not receive an immediate reply."
