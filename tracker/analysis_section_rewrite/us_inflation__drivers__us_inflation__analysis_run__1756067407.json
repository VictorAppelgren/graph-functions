      "feedback": "Key fixes to reach world-class quality: reinvent the piece around a disciplined, first-principles cross‑topic thesis (auto-capex earnings durability as the core driver, with an oil regime overlay shaping risk premia and cross‑asset dynamics) and embed it in a formal Fed Policy three-regime framework (Regime A: disinflation with conditional easing; Regime B: sticky inflation requiring higher discount rates; Regime C: growth slowdown that favors defensives), with transitions pinned to wage-growth momentum, inflation persistence, and Jackson Hole cues plus the semiconductor capex cadence as a timing signal; build a clear causal chain from capex cadence to EV unit economics to earnings durability to margins/ROIC to discount rates and risk premia to valuations; anchor the financials with specific source numbers (Ford: EV losses ≈ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%; ROIC ≈ 10.1%; revenue CAGR 2.5% 2014–2024; ACMR: 2025 revenue midpoint ≈ $900m; gross margin ≈ 4%) and overlay the oil path (Regime A ~50%: 2025 supply +2.5 mbpd; 2026 +1.9; demand ≈ 0.68–0.70; refinery runs ≈ 85.6 in 2025; Brent mid-60s; WTI low-60s) with Regime B ~30%; then convert these into explicit sensitivity paths for 10Y yield, risk premia, and cyclicals vs defensives; replace broad statements with numeric watchpoints and a tight, 5–7 signal watch-list (capex cadence shift, auto profitability trajectory, oil balance/refinery utilization, wage-growth/inflation persistence, Jackson Hole cues) with thresholds; reconcile data conflicts (e.g., refinery‑run figures) by presenting a transparent mid-point range and citing all sources; ensure every assertion cites a SOURCE MATERIAL ID (22PL3Q360, J99EM2TPZ, T1QE6JPIX, ACMR); and deliver as one concise paragraph that integrates macro/policy/flows/valuation per SECTION FOCUS, plus a clear invalidation rule for when the scenario base-case would be displaced.",
