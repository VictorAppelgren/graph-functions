      "text": "Oliver Glasner says Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze will start for Crystal Palace in their Conference League play-off match with Fredrikstad on Thursday.\nThe Palace manager confirmed the pair would play in the first leg of the game at Selhurst Park despite continued transfer interest from Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur respectively, with two weeks remaining before the transfer window closes.\nAdvertisement\nEze and Guehi trained as expected on Wednesday, having played in Palace\u2019s 0-0 draw with Chelsea in their opening Premier League match of the season on Sunday.\n\u201cMany of you were surprised that he and Marc started against Chelsea,\u201d Glasner said at a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cYou may be surprised they will start again tomorrow because of all the rumours but they are committed here.\n\u201cThey will play a crucial part for as long as they are here they are committed to the team. If they leave, they want to leave as the guys who gave 100 per cent to Crystal Palace.\nGlasner also addressed speculation around Guehi, who walked off quickly after applauding the Palace supporters but appeared to not acknowledge the Austrian speaking to him on the pitch at full-time at Stamford Bridge.\n\u201cThere has been so much nonsense written,\u201d Glasner said. \u201cI have not met many colleagues more ambitious than me but Marc is one of them, and he was upset on Sunday.\n\u201cHe was emotional after this game, exhausted. He was disappointed the goal was disallowed, that we did not win. It was written in a negative way, I see it as the opposite.\n\u201cMarc was upset that he didn\u2019t win the game and I loved this. It\u2019s the best sign that he could show of how ambitious we are. We can react the same way every time. I never want it to be that we are satisfied with getting a draw.\n\u201cThis shows the development and progress of Crystal Palace in the last few years, that we are not happy with just a draw at Chelsea.\n\u201cIt is not a big issue. We are not saying \u2018Thank you for arriving today\u2019. Things can always happen until the window is closed, but we are always focused on what we have to do. We take it game by game, showing the best performance we can.\u201d\n\u2018Selections not a surprise\u2019\nIt is not a surprise that Guehi and Eze are due to play against Fredrikstad \u2014 they have shown commitment to Palace and will continue to be picked until such a time as a deal is imminent.\nGuehi is Palace\u2019s captain and an integral part of their side, with little cover at centre-back leaving them with only centre-midfielder Jefferson Lerma or Nathaniel Clyne to play in the position if required. Unless Liverpool, or another team, meet Palace\u2019s demands, there is no reason for him to be left out of the team to their detriment.\nAdvertisement\nEze is in a similar boat. He may be pulled from the starting XI if Tottenham match Palace\u2019s asking price, but as yet that has not happened. If Glasner had any concerns over either of them, then they would not be involved, but it appears to be the opposite \u2014 he has stated several times recently how impressed he has been with their professionalism.\n(Photo: Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 summer transfer window.\nArsenal have an agreement in principle with Crystal Palace to sign Eberechi Eze.\nThe deal is worth in the region of the expired \u00a368million (\u20ac78m, $91m) release clause, matching the level of fee Tottenham Hotspur were prepared to pay, and personal terms have been agreed.\nAdvertisement\nThe 27-year-old is expected to play for Palace against Fredrikstad in the Conference League play-off on Thursday before undergoing a medical with the north London club.\nThe operation was executed by Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta and vice-chairman Tim Lewis.\nEze is set to become Arsenal\u2019s seventh signing of what has been a busy first summer under Berta since his arrival from Atletico Madrid.\nGoalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, defender Cristhian Mosquera, midfielders Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard, winger Noni Madueke and striker Viktor Gyokeres have all moved to the Emirates Stadium.\nThe move for Eze, who was a boyhood Arsenal fan and played for the club\u2019s academy, follows the injury for Kai Havertz, who is being assessed and could be set for a spell on the sidelines.\nEze joined Palace from QPR in the summer of 2020 in a deal worth around \u00a317m and has made 169 appearances for the south London club, scoring 40 times. He has been capped 12 times by England, scoring once.\nWhy Arsenal want Eze\nAnalysis from Arsenal correspondent James McNicholas\nArsenal are huge admirers of Eberechi Eze\u2019s talent.\nThe club initially explored a move for Eze when contact negotiations with Ethan Nwaneri were at a delicate stage. Once Nwaneri agreed a new deal, Arsenal\u2019s interest waned, and they focused on other areas of the squad.\nThroughout, Arsenal have held concerns over price: they have been loath to meet a Palace valuation in the region of \u00a360million.\nTheir pressing need for attacking reinforcements, particularly in the light of Kai Havertz\u2019s injury, may change things. Arsenal are still awaiting the full prognosis for Havertz, but if he is to be absent for a considerable period, it will weaken their attack.\nEze is not a direct replacement for Havertz, but his signing would potentially free up the likes of Mikel Merino and Leandro Trossard to fill in at centre-forward until the Germany international returns.\nAdvertisement\nAside from Eze\u2019s obvious quality, there\u2019s an emotional component for Arsenal fans: Eze is a boyhood Arsenal fan who was part of the club\u2019s academy. Throw in the prospect of beating Spurs to his signing, and there\u2019s plenty for Arsenal supporters to be invested in\u2026\nWhat he would bring to Arsenal\nAnalysis by senior data writer Mark Carey\nMikel Arteta has needed to strengthen the left side of his attack this summer.\nLeandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli\u2019s output was in the good-not-great bucket last season, and it is clear that Arsenal needed players with the same attacking ferocity that comes from their right flank with Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard.\nAlong with Noni Madueke, Eze\u2019s arrival provides that added strength from the left side of the pitch with a truly versatile profile \u2014 operating best as a No 10 but able to play on the left side of his team\u2019s attack or drop into a left-sided midfield position if required. Whatever his role, he will look to find the space to impose maximum damage to the opposition with the sharpest efficiency.\nIn the modern game, those who can break a player-for-player press with a drop of the shoulder or a driving run forward have never been so valuable \u2014 opening up the opposition structure with a moment of individual quality as the dominoes begin to fall. Eze also has the ability to thread a pass forward when spaces open up in front of him, making him a double threat in the attacking third.\nAcquiring an attacking midfielder of the 27-year-old\u2019s creative profile will be a crucial addition in Arsenal\u2019s attack, and could well be the difference between a good season and a title-winning one.\n(Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Offside via Getty Images)"
