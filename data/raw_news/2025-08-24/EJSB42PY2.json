  "content": "A wild scene unfolded at the US Open when a photographer entered the court during the match between Daniil Medvedev and Benjamin Bonzi, leading to chaos and a nearly seven-minute delay in the match as Medvedev let his emotions get the better of him.\n\nWith Bonzi serving for the match \u2014 leading 6-3, 7-5, 5-4 \u2014 a photographer entered the playing surface for an unknown reason, leading chair umpire Greg Allensworth to call for time on the court at Louis Armstrong Stadium.\n\n\u201cWait please, not now,\u201d Allensworth shouted. \u201cGet off the court, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst serve. Ladies and gentlemen, because of the delay caused by an onside interference, first serve has been granted,\u201d Allensworth then called.\n\nThe decision infuriated Medvedev and went over to confront the chair ump, encouraging the crowd to boo the decision before crashing out on the official and questioning what was wrong.\n\n\u201cAre you a man? Are you a man? Why are you shaking? What\u2019s wrong, huh? Guys, he wants to leave. He gets paid by the match not by the hour,\u201d the 13th-seeded Medvedev said into the camera that was positioned right next to the chair umpire.\n\nThe crowd continued to boo for another five minutes, with the unseeded Bonzi refusing to serve until the amped up Queens crowd quieted down.\n\nMedvedev managed to fend off match point once play continued and rallied back to send it to a fifth set.",

      "text": "Emma Raducanu\u2019s smile is back.\nSo is her game.\nThe young Brit broke her three-year U.S. Open drought, winning her first match in Flushing Meadows since the breakthrough 2021 title that changed her life.\nRadacanu rolled past qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2 at Louis Armstrong Stadium with a 26-minute first set and a brisk one-hour domination.\nShe\u2019s cleared a huge mental hurdle, making New York her happy place for the first time in years.\n\u201cYeah, it has been on my mind,\u201d said Radacanu, 22. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years, and it\u2019s a very special tournament for me. I did feel different coming into it this year. I felt like I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it\u2019s in the back of your head. So I\u2019m just very pleased to have overcome that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first win here since 2021, so it\u2019s extra special. First rounds are always difficult and especially at a Slam. I\u2019m just so happy with the way I came through that.\u201d\nRadacanu won the 2021 U.S. Open as an 18-year-old qualifier, dazzling with not just her game but her megawatt smile.\nBut after her title defense ended with a first-round loss to Alize Cornet \u2014 making her just the fourth reigning U.S. Open champ ousted in the opening round \u2014 she missed 2023 due to injury and suffered another first-round exit last year to Sofia Kenin.\nShe acknowledged New York had become a mental hurdle.\n\u201cI really struggled when I came back in 2022. I didn\u2019t enjoy coming back here,\u201d Radacanu said. \u201cNow is the first time that I feel like I can come back to the U.S. Open and really enjoy the memories that I made here. I can be proud of that and see it as a happy place.\u201d\nRadacanu looked happy on the court Sunday, serving well and taking an aggressive return position.\nShe seemed confident, self-assured and in control.\nShe also seemed comfortable with her new coach, Francisco Roig.\nRafa Nadal\u2019s ex-coach, the Spaniard constantly gave loud positive reinforcement.\n\u201cI put a lot of trust in what I\u2019m doing with Francisco on the practice court,\u201d Radacanu said. \u201cWe\u2019re just working really well, doing the right stuff on the practice court, and I just feel like I\u2019m improving. To take confidence from what I\u2019m doing behind the scenes and not just have confidence because I\u2019ve won these matches on the tour.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a lot day to day. It\u2019s going well, and I\u2019m enjoying it. I\u2019m enjoying getting better, and the process of feeling like, at the end of the day, I\u2019m satisfied I got a little bit better and just repeating it. That\u2019s probably the biggest success and reason why I feel the way I do right now.\u201d\nDespite being nervous beforehand, starting quickly helped Radacanu settle in.\nShe ended up with an encouragingly clean match, just six unforced errors \u2014 one in the second set \u2014 to 36 by her outmatched Japanese foe.\nRaducanu raced out to a quick 5-0 lead and cruised.\n\u201cI started off really well, and that helped relax me a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially serving first game, that was a confident start, and then I felt like I could keep going.\u201d\nNow, Raducanu has a chance to keep going.\nShe\u2019s provisionally up to world No. 33 in the live rankings after the win and well-placed to crack the top 30.\nWith No. 24 Veronika Kudermetova getting upset by Janice Tjen, Raducanu gets to face another qualifier.\nWith an extra day baked into the first round this year, she\u2019ll get some free time in New York, now a happy place again.\n\u201cMy nana \u2014 it\u2019s not my actual grandma, but I\u2019m like her adopted granddaughter, I\u2019d like to think \u2014 she\u2019s from New York, and she told me to go to the Frick Collection,\u201d Raducanu said. \u201cI\u2019ve been into my art a lot more recently, and it\u2019s reopened after I think four or five years of being under construction. That will be really exciting.\u201d"

      "text": "\u201cIt has been 86 Grand Slam tournaments,\u201d the elderly Rose DeWitt Bukater said wistfully, \u201csince an American man has won a major singles championship.\u201d\nThere were the decades through which the Yankees owned Major League Baseball. There has been NFL domination by the Patriots and Chiefs over much of the past two decades. The Canadiens, Islanders and Oilers had deeds to the Stanley Cup for the better part of 20 years. First, the Celtics, then the Bulls and Lakers were lords of the NBA.\nBut there has never been a sport ruled by hegemony like the men\u2019s side of tennis since the 2003 U.S. Open, when Andy Roddick became the last American man to win a Grand Slam. A pro sport or pro sport league has never been more dynastic.\nFor while there have been 86 majors since Roddick\u2019s triumph, just 13 different champions have emerged, The Big Three of Novak Djokovic (24), Rafael Nadal (22) and Roger Federer (19) combining for 65 of them with Carlos Alcaraz (5) and Jannik Sinner combining for nine tiles and indeed all seven Slams over the past two calendar years."

      "text": "Venus Williams says playing in the U.S. Open again isn\u2019t old \u2014 it\u2019s exciting.\nThe icon may as well have been talking about herself.\n\u201cSuper thrilling to be back,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt does not get old. It just gets more exciting.\u201d\nWhen Williams takes on 11th-ranked Karolina Muchova on Monday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, it will be her record-extending 25th appearance in the U.S. Open.\nIt comes at the ripe age of 45, making her the oldest player to compete in singles at the U.S. Open since 47-year-old Ren\u00e9e Richards set the record in 1981.\n\u201cI love my job,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo there\u2019s the joy right there.\u201d\nWhile Williams is one of the all-time greats, with seven Grand Slam singles titles, including in 2000 and 2001 here in Flushing Meadows, this was an unexpected comeback.\nShe got a wild-card entry after being ranked 610th in the world.\nIt comes following a 16-month layoff from tennis that included surgery for uterine fibroids.\nShe had just returned last month at the Washington Open.\n\u201cI want to be my best, and that\u2019s the expectation I have for myself, to get the best out of me. That\u2019s all any player can ask for,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI haven\u2019t played as much as the other players, so it\u2019s a different challenge when you\u2019re dealing with that. So I\u2019m just trying to have fun, stay relaxed and be my personal best.\u201d\nMonday\u2019s appearance comes 28 years after Williams\u2019 1997 debut at the U.S. Open, and she doesn\u2019t plan to stop swinging a racket anytime soon.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll always play tennis. It\u2019s in my DNA. So it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s now or 30 years from now,\u201d Williams said. \u201cGod willing, I\u2019ll be here. We\u2019ll all be here. We\u2019ll all be hitting balls. But in any case, tennis will always be one of the most important parts of my life.\u201d\nTaylor Fritz beat Emilio Nava 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 and has won 22 of his past 27 matches since the end of the French Open, the most wins of any man on tour over that span.\nHe\u2019ll have two days off before playing Sebastian Baez or Lloyd Harris.\nNo. 6 Ben Shelton ripped Ignacio Buse 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 and faces either Pablo Carreno Busta or Pablo Llamas Ruiz.\nShelton \u2014 an entertainer whose celebrations seemingly vexed Novak Djokovic \u2014 was asked if he\u2019d like to see tennis ease up on the stoic decorum and etiquette, citing the attention the Noah Lyles-Kenny Bednarek beef in track and field has drawn.\n\u201cYeah, I understand respecting your opponents and the traditions of tennis. At the same time, people get called out for little things or the wrong things that it\u2019s, like, really? We\u2019re going to give someone a hard time about that?\u201d Shelton said. \u201cHaving a younger crowd in tennis is really important in attracting younger fans, the future fans of our sport. The kids love the flair and excitement and competition, and Bednarek shoving Lyles and them talking about it in the press conference afterwards, it\u2019s exciting.\n\u201cNow when they go to Tokyo for the World Championships, something\u2019s on the line and everyone\u2019s tuning in. That\u2019s sports.\u201d"
