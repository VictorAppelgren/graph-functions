      "text": "FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif., August 21, 2025 \u2013 Hyundai has once again been recognized as the top mass-market brand in the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Tech Experience Index (TXI) Study SM, marking the sixth consecutive year the brand has earned this distinction. Now in its tenth year, the TXI Study evaluates how effectively automakers bring new technologies to market. Based on feedback from more than 76,000 owners of 2025 model-year vehicles after 90 days of ownership, the study measures innovation, quality of execution, and the real-world usefulness of advanced features. Hyundai\u2019s leading performance reflects its ability to make cutting-edge technology intuitive, reliable, and valuable in everyday driving.\nThe 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe is photographed in California City, Calif., on November 9, 2023.\nThe 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe has also been recognized with J.D. Power\u2019s Mass-Market Driver Assist and Connected Vehicle Awards. For the second consecutive year, Santa Fe\u2019s phone-based digital key technology received top honors, highlighting the convenience of accessing and sharing vehicle functions through a smartphone. In addition, the model was celebrated for its Blind-Spot View Monitor, which provides drivers with enhanced visibility and added confidence when changing lanes.\n\u201cWe appreciate this recognition because it demonstrates our focus that the best tech disappears into the drive, feeling natural from day one, building confidence behind the wheel, while continuing to be updated throughout the vehicle\u2019s life,\u201d said Olabisi Boyle, senior vice president, product planning and mobility strategy, Hyundai Motor North America. \u201cWe do this in service of a drive that is safer, smoother, and more satisfying. Hyundai\u2019s continued success in the TXI Study highlights its mission to democratize advanced technology, making premium innovations widely accessible to mass-market customers.\u201d\nHyundai Digital Key 2 Premium[i]Standard on nearly all 2025 Santa Fe trims, Digital Key 2 Premium technology allows drivers to unlock and start their vehicle using a smartphone app by leveraging Near-Field Communication (NFC), Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technologies, replacing the need for a traditional physical key fob. With Hyundai Digital Key 2 Premium, owners can enjoy seamless access and enhanced control, all from the palm of their hand.\nThe 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe Digital Key 2 Premium\nBlind-Spot View Monitor (BVM)[ii]The Hyundai Santa Fe\u2019s Blind-Spot View Monitor (BVM) is a smart safety feature that helps drivers make safer lane changes. When the turn signal is activated, cameras on the vehicle\u2019s bodysides show a live video of the corresponding blind spot on the instrument cluster. This real-time view helps drivers spot nearby vehicles, cyclists, or other hazards that may be hidden from mirrors, reducing the risk of potential collisions while improving the driver\u2019s overall awareness and confidence.\nAbout the J.D. Power U.S. Tech Experience Index (TXI) StudySMThe 2025 U.S. Tech Experience Index (TXI) Study is based on responses from 76,230 owners of new 2025 model-year vehicles who were surveyed after 90 days of ownership. The study was fielded from March 2024 through February 2025. The U.S. TXI Study complements the annual J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study (IQS)SM and the J.D. Power U.S. Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout (APEAL) StudySM by measuring how effectively each automotive brand brings new technologies to market. The U.S. TXI Study combines the level of adoption of new technologies for each brand with excellence in execution. The execution measurement examines how much owners like the technologies and how many problems they experience while using them.\nFor more information about the U.S. Tech Experience Index (TXI) Study, visit https://www.jdpower.com/business/automotive/us-tech-experience-index-txi-study.\nHyundai Motor AmericaHyundai Motor America offers U.S. consumers a technology-rich lineup of cars, SUVs, and electrified vehicles, while supporting Hyundai Motor Company\u2019s Progress for Humanity vision.

The No. 33 Hyundai Elantra N TCR, piloted by Mark Wilkins and Bryson Morris for Bryan Herta Autosport (BHA), navigated a challenging race to claim the top spot on the podium in Wisconsin. This win builds on Hyundai\u2019s strong form earlier in the season, which featured multiple podiums and victories across the Elantra N TCR lineup.\nBryson Morris and Mark Wilkins celebrate on the podium with the Bryan Herta Autosport crew after winning the Road America 120 in the No. 33 Hyundai Elantra N TCR. Plymouth, Wisc., August 2, 2025. (Photo/Bryan Herta Autosport/Richard Prince Photography)\nThe race began with a strong Hyundai presence at the front of the grid, with the No. 33 starting in third position and the No. 98 of Mason Filippi and Harry Gottsacker starting in fourth. The No. 76 of Denis Dupont and Preston Brown started in eighth place, while the No. 9 of Madison Aust and Suellio Almeida started in eleventh. The rest of the Hyundai field, including the No. 18 and No. 72, were also in contention.\nThe action started quickly, with an early full-course yellow just 13 minutes into the race after the No. 98 made contact with another car. No. 98 was later issued a stop-plus-60-second-hold penalty, forcing the team to battle back from a significant setback. Despite a brief mechanical issue for the No. 76 car, Hyundai\u2019s entries demonstrated resilience throughout the race.\nThe race\u2019s pivotal moment came in the final 40 minutes, when the No. 33 cycled to the front of the pack, taking advantage of other competitors\u2019 pit stops and on-track contact. The No. 33 entry of Morris and Wilkins led a total of 18 laps on its way to the checkered flag.\nThe team\u2019s strong performance was further highlighted by several impressive drives, as the No. 98, after its early penalty, made an impressive recovery to finish in fourth place. The No. 76 recovered from its mechanical problems to finish fifth, climbing three positions from its starting spot. Meanwhile, the No. 9 of Madison Aust and Suellio Almeida finished eighth, also gaining three positions during the race. The No. 72 of Riley and Larry Pegram also advanced three positions to finish in tenth.\nVictory lane at Road America proved once again to be Hyundai territory, as the win further extends the brand's lead in the IMSA TCR Manufacturers' Championship.\nHyundai looks forward to carrying this momentum into the next round of the championship, the Virginia Is For Racing Lovers Grand Prix at Virginia International Raceway on Saturday, August 23. The race will be streamed live on Peacock.\nThe No. 33 Hyundai Elantra N TCR driven by Bryson Morris and Mark Wilkins during the Road America 120 at Road America in Plymouth, Wisc., August 2, 2025.
