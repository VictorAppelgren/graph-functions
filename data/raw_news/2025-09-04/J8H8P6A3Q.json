  "title": "Pennsylvania Couple Kept 5 Children in \u2018Deplorable\u2019 Conditions, Police Say",
  "description": "The children, between the ages of 5 and 14, were locked in a room that the authorities said \u201cfunctioned as a dungeon,\u201d with no beds and boarded-up windows.",
  "content": "The couple, James Russell Kahl, 65, and Carly Kahl, 41, were arrested on Wednesday on charges that include aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of children, use of an incapacitation device and drug possession. It was not immediately clear if Ms. Kahl had a lawyer. Susan Elizabeth Ritz, a lawyer for Mr. Kahl, could not be reached on Thursday.\n\nMr. Aubele told CBS Pittsburgh that the State Police went to the couple\u2019s house after a relative alerted the authorities to the children\u2019s living conditions.\n\nState troopers went to the home on Aug. 8, accompanied by workers from the Fayette County Children and Youth Services, according to the police report. The troopers saw that the children were locked in their room from the outside, behind a door with three deadbolts that had no inside handle, according to the report. The children would be locked in the room all night and for several hours during the day, the authorities said.\n\nThe children did not have adequate clothing or food, and their room was ridden with fleas, the report said.\n\nThe children were removed from the home at the time of that visit, the authorities said. On Wednesday troopers returned with a search warrant and seized a stun gun, a replica pistol, drugs and drug paraphernalia, the authorities said. The state police did not specify what type of drugs were found, though marijuana possession is among the charges that have been filed against the Kahls, according to court records.",
