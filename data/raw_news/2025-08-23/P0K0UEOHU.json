  "description": "Tesla has been the EV market leader, but Rivian has a big opportunity with the R2.",
  "content": "\u2022 Both Rivian and Tesla are facing headwinds with tariffs and the end of federal EV tax credits.\n\u2022 Rivian has a big opportunity with the launch of its cheaper R2 SUV.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Rivian Automotive \u203a Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has dominated the electric vehicle (EV) market for over a decade, but the company's core business has begun to struggle. Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN), meanwhile, is still in the early innings as an automaker, but is starting to hit important milestones. Both stocks come with risk, but one has a much better setup for investors right now. Rivian slipped back into negative gross margins in Q2 after two straight positive quarters, with higher material costs due to supply constraints and new tariffs taking their toll. The loss of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit this fall will be another drag. Those are real headwinds, but they don't take away from the progress that Rivian has been making. Building out a profitable EV business is not easy, with even major automakers often struggling to sell their EV models for a profit. However, Rivian took a big step in this direction when it switched to a zonal architecture. This slashed the number of electronic control units and wiring in its vehicles, making its SUVs cheaper to build. It also helped the company secure a major partnership with Volkswagen, which opened up its checkbook to gain access to the technology and form a joint venture. The next big step for Rivian will be launching its new, smaller R2 SUV next year. At a starting price of around $45,000, it will target a much broader audience than the R1 luxury line, which costs over $100,000 for some versions. Importantly, Rivian has locked in costs through supplier contracts and expects the R2 to deliver stronger margins through lower material costs, higher volumes, and shared fixed expenses with its R1 and electric delivery van lines. On the financial front, Rivian is backed by Amazon, which uses its delivery vans, and it still has more cash coming from Volkswagen if and when certain milestones are reached. It has also secured a $6.6 billion loan from the Department of Energy to help build a second U.S. plant. With $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, the company has plenty of capital to support the R2 launch. Management is targeting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven by 2027, which seems like a realistic timeline if the R2 is successful.\n\nRivian is still a high-risk name, but it has the balance sheet, the partners, and the right vehicle strategy to grow into a profitable business. Tesla's core auto business has been heading in the wrong direction. Deliveries dropped double digits in each of the past two quarters, while auto revenue slid 16% in Q2. Profitability and cash flow have also taken a hit. Adjusted EPS dropped 23% last quarter, while operating cash flow fell 30% and free cash flow collapsed to just $146 million. Meanwhile, its high gross margin regulatory credit sales were cut by more than half during the quarter. Musk has already warned investors that things could get worse once the EV tax credit disappears later this year. Rather than focusing on improving its ailing auto business, Musk has instead continued to try to sell investors on Tesla's autonomous driving and robotics ambitions. The company has launched a small pilot robotaxi program in Austin, Texas, but the service is limited to a geofenced area and requires a Tesla employee as a safety driver. It's also already drawn scrutiny from local officials after several safety incidents. Tesla is promising a rapid rollout of robotaxis across half the U.S. by year-end pending regulatory approvals, but the technology does not appear ready. Its decision to eschew lidar technology and use a camera-only approach remains controversial. This design saves costs, but the technology has struggled in some complex driving conditions, leading to questions around the safety of its approach. By comparison, Alphabet's Waymo robotaxi is far ahead, with years of experience operating paid, driverless rides in multiple cities. Both Tesla and Rivian stocks carry their fair share of risk. Rivian is still unprofitable and faces near-term headwinds from tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits. Tesla, however, has a weakening auto business, a valuation that assumes big success in robotaxis and robotics, and a CEO whose actions have hurt the brand with many consumers. Between the two, Rivian looks like the better investment. The company is improving its cost structure, expanding its market with the R2 SUV, and has the support of well-financed partners to help fund its growth. Tesla's stock, by contrast, is still priced as if its autonomous driving and robotics bets will pay off, even though it has yet to prove they can. For investors willing to take on risk, Rivian is the better EV stock to own in my view. Should you buy stock in Rivian Automotive right now?

      "text": "It costs money to make money. Every successful business keeps its costs below revenue to generate profits. One way to measure a company's profitability is to calculate its gross margin, which is the percentage of revenue it retains after subtracting the costs directly related to the sale of goods or services.\nWe'll take a closer look at this profitability measure by exploring:\n- What is gross margin?\n- How to calculate gross margin.\n- Gross margin vs. gross profit: What is the difference?\n- How to use gross margin to evaluate a company.\n- What are the limitations to gross margin?\nWhat is it?\nWhat is gross margin?\nGross margin -- also called gross profit margin or gross margin ratio -- is a company's sales minus its cost of goods sold (COGS), expressed as a percentage of sales. Put another way, gross margin is the percentage of a company's revenue that it keeps after subtracting direct expenses such as labor and materials. The higher the gross margin, the more revenue a company has to cover other obligations -- like taxes, interest on debt, and other expenses -- and generate profit.\nHow to calculate\nHow to calculate gross margin\nThe computation for gross margin is a two-step process. First, you need to determine a company's gross profit, which is a straightforward calculation:\nGross profit = Revenue-COGS\nYou can find the revenue and COGS numbers in a company's financial statements.\nYou can then use the gross profit number to determine gross margin:\nAs an example of how to calculate gross margin, consider a company that during the most recent quarter generated $150 million in sales and had direct selling costs of $100 million. The company's gross profit would equal $150 million minus $100 million, or $50 million, during this period.\nWe can use the gross profit of $50 million to determine the company's gross margin. Simply divide the $50 million gross profit into the sales of $150 million and then multiply that amount by 100. The gross margin for this example company is 33.3%.\nGross margin vs. gross profit\nGross margin vs. gross profit: What is the difference?\nThere can be some confusion between gross margin and gross profit. Gross profit is a measure of absolute value, while gross margin is a ratio. Gross profit is simply the difference between a company's sales and its direct selling costs, and a company's gross margin is its gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales. Gross margin puts gross profit into context by taking the company's sales volume into account.\nHow to use it\nHow to use gross margin to evaluate a company\nMargins are metrics that assess a company's efficiency in converting sales to profits. Different types of margins, including operating margin and net profit margin, focus on separate stages and aspects of the business. Gross margin gives insight into a company's ability to efficiently control its production costs, which should help the company to produce higher profits farther down the income statement.\nCalculating gross margin is useful for comparison purposes. Determining a company's gross margins for multiple reporting periods provides insight into whether the company's operations are becoming more or less efficient. Determining the gross margins of multiple companies within the same industry is another type of comparison, and it can help you to understand which market participants have the most efficient operations.\nLimitations\nWhat are the limitations to gross margin?\nWhile calculating gross margin can be helpful for evaluating a company's reporting periods or similar companies, the metric has more limited value when comparing companies in different industries. Capital-intensive industries, like manufacturing and mining, often have high costs of goods sold, which translates to relatively low gross margins. Others, like the tech industry, that have minimal costs of goods typically produce high gross margins.\nRelated investing topics\nGross margin is a strong indicator of profitability\nDetermining gross margin is an easy and straightforward way to understand the core elements of a business. It's also a great way to get started when assessing any income statement. Gross margin is something that all investors should consider when evaluating a company before buying any stock."

      "text": "Electric cars -- commonly called electric vehicles or EVs -- are automobiles with engines powered by electricity rather than gas. Electric car stocks comprise companies primarily focused on manufacturing electric cars. Companies that manufacture the components used in electric cars -- such as batteries or autonomous vehicle systems -- can also be considered part of the electric car industry.\nEven though all the major car companies, including Ford (F 3.44%) and General Motors (GM 3.29%), are developing and/or manufacturing at least one model of electric car, they're not usually considered electric car companies because their primary products aren't electric. The best electric car company stocks are generally companies focused solely on electric cars rather than traditional automakers producing primarily gas-powered vehicles.\nList of EV stocks\nElectric car stocks on the map\n| Company | Headquarters | Notable Models |\n|---|---|---|\n| Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Palo Alto, California | Model 3 and Model S sedans, Model X and Model Y crossovers |\n| NIO (NYSE:NIO) | Shanghai, China |\nET9 sedan, ES8 and ES6 SUVs, EC6 crossover |\n| Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) | Irvine, California | R1T truck, R1S SUV |\n1. Tesla: An industry leader\nAny list of electric car stocks should include the granddaddy of them all, Tesla. While BYD (BYDDY 3.63%) reported 2024 revenue of about $107 billion compared to the $89 billion that Tesla posted on the top line, Elon Musk's electric car company still demands respect as a force driving the EV industry forward after delivering almost 1.8 million vehicles in 2024. Most of the vehicles were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs, and the rest were Tesla's older, pricier models.\nDespite a tough macroeconomic backdrop, Tesla continues to aggressively expand production. Production is currently ramping up at Tesla's factories in Texas and Germany, and the company is building a new factory in Mexico.\nTesla has resorted to price cuts to sell vehicles this year as consumer demand faltered, a move that has hurt the bottom line. In 2024, Tesla's overall gross margin slipped by 39 basis points year over year to 17.9%, while its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin contracted slightly to 17% from 17.2% in 2023. The company is still profitable, but profits are trending lower.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Tesla stock plunged 36% as investors balked at the company's weakening financials and expressed disapproval of Elon Musk's apparent distraction from leading the company due to his activities in Washington, D.C. But shares are still expensive by any measure. With a market capitalization currently topping $833 billion, Tesla stock trades at lofty price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. The valuation makes the stock risky, but there's no denying the company is a leader in the electric vehicle industry.\n2. NIO: A Chinese SUV specialist\nChinese electric car maker NIO has been publicly traded since September 2018, but several initial public offerings (IPOs) by other Chinese electric car makers -- such as Li Automotive (LI 2.56%) and Xpeng(XPEV 4.4%) -- have increased investor interest in NIO.\nNIO is benefitting from strong customer demand in China. After reporting 221,970 vehicle deliveries in 2024 -- a 38.7% increase from 2023 -- NIO reported continued growth in the first quarter of 2025, reporting 42,094 vehicle deliveries in Q1 2025, 40.1% higher than the same period in 2024.\nAs to be expected, total vehicle revenue also rose. In 2024, NIO posted vehicle revenue of about $7.98 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18.2%. In addition, NIO expanded its gross profit margin from 5.5% in 2023 to 9.9% in 2024.\nNIO further expanded its product line with the deliveries of the ET9 starting in March 2025, a vehicle that NIO characterized as \"a flagship smart executive sedan,\" on its fourth quarter 2024 conference call.\n3. Rivian: An up and comer\nInvestors were very excited about Rivian when the EV company went public in late 2021. It was one of the biggest U.S. IPOs ever, with the company raising almost $12 billion. Rivian's market value briefly topped $150 billion soon after its debut.\nRivian had barely delivered any of its electric trucks or SUVs when it went public, so investing in the stock was the ultimate leap of faith. The company managed to produce more than 1,000 vehicles in 2021, a tiny number compared to Tesla and other large automakers. Deliveries equaled 51,579 vehicles in 2024, and the company projects vehicle deliveries of 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles in 2025. The delivery outlook may be lower than 2024, yet it reflects the company's plan to pause production lines at its plant in Illinois for one month in late 2025 in preparation for the launch of production of the R2 in the first half of 2026.\nRivian is taking a risk by vertically integrating critical components like electronics, the propulsion platform, and software. The strategy may pay off if the company can rapidly grow production over the next few years, but it also means costs will be higher in the near term.\nRivian is driving closer to profitability. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Rivian posted its first quarterly gross profit of $170 million. Rivian has $7.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet, so it can afford to lose vast sums as it ramps up production. But if the company hits a roadblock, it could be in serious trouble.\nRevenue\nRivian stock dove 43% through the first six months of 2024, but it has shown signs of recovering in the second half of the year. The company is valued at just over $14 billion, which doesn't seem expensive relative to sales. A lot will need to go right, though, for Rivian to deliver for investors.\nOther EV companies\nOther companies in the electric car space\nBuilding a successful electric vehicle business is an expensive proposition, and the bankruptcies of Lordstown Motors in 2023 and Fisker in 2024 are good reminders that investing in this sector is inherently risky. After struggling with production issues, Lordstown and Fisker both ultimately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nIf you want to diversify your portfolio exposure to the electric car sector and stay away from controversy, an alternative is to buy stock in any of these companies:\n- QuantumScape (QS 3.62%): Maker of EV lithium batteries\n- Blink Charging (BLNK 6.59%): Producer of electric car charging stations\n- Hyliion (NYSE:HYLN): Manufacturer of EV drivetrains\n- Luminar (LAZR 0.25%): Maker of autonomous driving technologies, such as Lidar\n- Ballard Power Systems (BLDP 6.61%) and Plug Power (PLUG 9.09%): Developers of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technologies\nYet another option is to buy shares of Lucid Group (LCID -3.11%). After producing 9,029 vehicles in 2024, the luxury electric car maker projects significant growth, forecasting 2025 production of approximately 20,000 vehicles. Lucid delivered 10,241 vehicles in 2024, a 71% increase over that which it delivered in 2023.\nLucid raised about $4.2 billion in additional capital in 2024, which will help cover its losses as it scales up production. Lucid stock is pricey, valued at $7.75 billion despite 2024 revenue of $808 million, so investors should tread carefully.\nETFs\nElectric car ETFs\nInvestors seeking portfolio exposure to the electric car market who don't want to select individual stocks can buy shares in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There are plenty of options when it comes to electric vehicle ETFs, including some that specialize in clean energy, which are often popular with ESG investors.\nFidelity Electric Vehicles and Future Transportation ETF (FDRV 4.18%) is a fairly small but focused choice and includes many of the stocks noted above. It also includes companies like Uber (UBER 2.62%), ON Semiconductor (ON 6.21%), and ChargePoint (CHPT 4.15%), adding to the diversification of the offering while remaining true to EV-enabling technologies. BYD is the largest holding at just more than 6.3%.\nThe Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW 5.63%), which tracks the performance of the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, invests broadly in clean energy. Although no single stock comprises more than 2% of the fund's holdings, the ETF owns the stocks of plenty of electric car makers. The stocks of NIO, Tesla, and Rivian are all held by WilderHill. The fund also owns shares of Blink Charging, lithium-ion battery maker Albemarle (ALB 3.04%), and Plug Power.\nThe Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV 3.61%) invests in makers of electric and self-driving cars. But the fund mainly focuses on traditional automakers making forays into this space, such as Toyota (TM 2.08%), and large tech companies, including semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) and Alphabet (GOOG 2.98%L) (GOOG 2.98%), which is developing autonomous vehicles.\nWhy the EV industry is different\nWhat makes the electric car industry different?\nThe electric car industry differs from the traditional automotive industry because it is so new. Until recently, very few companies manufactured any kind of electric vehicle, but every major automaker in the world is developing or producing an EV now.\nBecause major interest in electric cars is so recent, the only established industry leader is Tesla. Start-up EV makers can compete fairly well with traditional automakers for electric car market share, making it difficult to discern which companies will ultimately dominate the market. That unpredictability makes investing in the electric car industry riskier than adding portfolio exposure to the automotive industry as a whole.\nRelated investing topics\nFuture of EVs\nThe future of the electric car industry\nMultiple major automakers have recently adopted Tesla's EV charging technology, making it likely to become the standard in the U.S. This standardization should make purchasing and charging EVs simpler, which could help drive growth in the industry.\nMany companies participating in the EV sector are going public, while legacy automakers plan to release a plethora of electric vehicles over the next five years. Investing in this highly competitive and fast-growing industry is likely to be profitable, but it's important to take steps to minimize your investment risk. Don't invest in just one electric car company; hold positions in several companies of various sizes, and consider buying shares in an ETF.\nFAQ\nInvesting in Electric Cars FAQ\nWhich electric car stock is best?\nSince individual investing goals vary, there's no way to categorically say which EV stock is best. For those seeking a more conservative option, Tesla is a good fit since it has already achieved profitability. Investors more focused on growth, however, may find NIO and Rivian more compelling.\nWhat EV company is the next Tesla?\nWhile NIO is often recognized as the Chinese version of Tesla, Lucid has also received strong comparisons to Elon Musk's EV endeavor.\nWhat EV stock can I buy instead of Tesla?\nThere are numerous options for EV investors seeking alternative investments to Tesla. While NIO, Rivian, and Lucid are pure-play EV stocks that represent great options, investors looking to mitigate risk may feel more comfortable choosing an EV ETF.\nWho will dominate the EV market?\nBYD and Tesla are both industry leaders, but time will tell if they are able to maintain their commanding positions."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

  "argos_summary": "Rivian and Tesla both face headwinds from tariffs and the loss of federal EV tax credits, but Rivian\u2019s upcoming R2 SUV, cost\u2011saving zonal architecture, and strong partner backing give it a more favorable outlook. Rivian\u2019s cash reserves, VW partnership, and DOE loan support a 2027 EBITDA breakeven target, while Tesla\u2019s declining deliveries, shrinking margins, and unproven robotaxi program undermine its valuation. Despite remaining unprofitable, Rivian\u2019s improving cost structure and broader market reach make it the better risk\u2011adjusted EV stock, whereas Tesla\u2019s valuation hinges on future autonomous and robotics success that has yet to materialize.
