I love it. I loveeeeee it! Yes, I love it!\u201d\n\u201cOprah\u2019s Bank Account\u201d was released last month and will be featured on Lil Yachty\u2019s new album, \u201cLil Boat 3,\u201d to be released this year. The song is currently No. 23 on Billboard\u2019s rap songs chart.\nIn the 9-minute music video for the song, Lil Yachty, as the character Boprah, is dressed like Winfrey and hosts a talk show, where Drake appears as his guest. Lil Yachty also interviews DaBaby in the clip.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the video,\u201d Winfrey said, adding: \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to be in a Drake song no matter what \u2014 especially for your bank account, OK!\u201d\n\u201cOprah\u2019s Bank Account,\u201d which debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart last month, became Drake\u2019s 208th song on the all-genre chart. It helped the rap star set a new record for most songs on the chart as he surpassed the 207-song run by the \u201cGlee\u201d cast, who had success with cover versions of well-known songs that would debut on the charts after episodes aired."

      "text": "Chart Rewind: In 1989, New Kids on the Block Were \u2018Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2019 at No. 1\nThe Boston boy band topped the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 with its breakthrough album and the set's title cut, respectively.\nIn every era of pop music, boy bands have elicited irrepressible shrieks from adoring fans. In the \u201960s, it was the Beatles. In the \u201970s, the Jackson 5. More recently, the likes of Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, who then passed the boy band baton to One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer.\nIn 1989, it was New Kids on the Block\u2018s turn to rule music like only boy bands can.\nAfter Boston-based producer-songwriter Maurice Starr had formed New Edition, which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985 with \u201cCool It Now,\u201d he followed with New Kids on the Block \u2013 brothers Jonathan and Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood. While their self-titled first LP didn\u2019t hit the Billboard 200 upon its release, follow-up Hangin\u2019 Tough filled the late-\u201980s boy band void, yielding five infectious Hot 100 top 10s, including the quintet\u2019s first No. 1 in June 1989, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Loving You (Forever).\u201d The ballad followed the No. 10-peaking \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Go Girl\u201d and the No. 3 hit \u201cYou Got It (The Right Stuff),\u201d which built even more buzz.\nOn Sept. 9, 1989, New Kids\u2019 rise culminated in the set and its title track taking over atop the Billboard 200 and Hot 100, respectively. The set was a slow-burner that took 55 weeks to reach the Billboard 200 summit, completing one of the longest climbs to No. 1 in the chart\u2019s history.\nBy years\u2019 end, New Kids on the Block had charted at last on the Billboard 200, reaching No. 25, and generated its own top 10, the group\u2019s No. 8 cover of the Delfonics\u2019 \u201cDidn\u2019t I (Blow Your Mind).\u201d The group even gleaned a top 10 from a third album, the holiday set Merry, Merry Christmas, when \u201cThis One\u2019s for the Children\u201d reached No. 7. In between, Hangin\u2019 Tough\u2018s fifth single \u201cCover Girl\u201d rose to No. 2.\n(On their summer 1989 tour, New Kids on the Block \u2013 and former Billboard publisher Tommy Page, then in his teen-idol days [he passed in 2017] \u2013 set out as the opening acts for Tiffany. By the end of the tour, Tiffany and New Kids had swapped spots.)\nThe Kids\u2019 blend of street (i.e., Wahlberg\u2019s semi-rap on \u201cHangin\u2019 Tough\u201d) and sweet (Jordan Knight and McIntyre served as the voices of the band\u2019s biggest ballads) helped make them a chart, touring and merchandise powerhouse, one that continued with 1990\u2019s Step by Step. Like its predecessor, the album and its title song became respective Billboard 200 and Hot 100 No. 1s. Follow-up single \u201cTonight,\u201d which playfully name-checks several of the act\u2019s earlier hits, rose to No. 7.\nUltimately, the group earned the honor of Billboard\u2018s top artist of both 1989 and 1990.\nAs musical trends shifted from pure-pop to rap and grunge, New Kids on the Block released the No. 37-peaking Face the Music (billed as NKOTB) in 1994 before taking a hiatus. With enough time passed for nostalgia to help restore its image (along with a return to prominence for pop music), the band blew back in 2008 with the No. 2 hit album The Block (featuring a track with then-new act Lady Gaga), which yielded the quintet\u2019s first top 40 Hot 100 hit since 1992, the No. 36-peaking \u201cSummertime.\u201d Its 2013 album 10 hit No. 6. In between, the act embraced its place in boy band lineage: In 2011, it released NKOTBSB, a collaborative set with Backstreet Boys, which hit No. 7. The acts\u2019 partnership continued in the form of Nick & Knight, aka BSB\u2019s Nick Carter and New Kid Jordan, in 2014.\nMost recently, New Kids on the Block released the album Still Kids, which launched at No. 4 on the Top Album Sales chart in June. Lead single \u201cKids\u201d has hit both the Adult Pop Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, marking the group\u2019s first appearance on the latter list in nearly 35 years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of not wanting to let each other down,\u201d Wahlberg said when the group chatted with Billboard in New York in May. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency that I think you can sometimes hear in the voices, of wanting to deliver the best of a performance. I think that\u2019s present in this record, even in the writing.\u201d"

      "text": "Janet Jackson\u2019s Biggest Billboard Hot 100 Hits\nHere's a look at the pop icon's history on the chart.\nAs Janet Jackson celebrates her birthday (May 16), Billboard takes a look at the singer\u2019s history on the Billboard Hot 100.\nBorn as the youngest of 10 children to Joseph and Katherine Jackson, Janet was almost pre-destined to enter the music industry with her brothers and sisters. By her fifth birthday, five of her brothers \u2014 as The Jackson 5 \u2014 had already scored four Hot 100 No. 1 hits. Following in her family\u2019s musical footsteps, Janet made her Hot 100 debut in 1982 with \u201cYoung Love,\u201d at 16 years old. Though that single and her second career entry, 1984\u2019s \u201cCome Give Your Love to Me,\u201d both peaked outside the top 50, Jackson found her hit-making stride with 1986\u2019s Control. Among its many hits, she landed her first of 10 No. 1s on the chart with \u201cWhen I Think of You,\u201d which reigned for two weeks.\nThrough the next 15 years, Jackson remained a Hot 100 force: Her next four albums, Janet Jackson\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814, janet., The Velvet Rope and All for You, each all generated at least one Hot 100 champ.

The song advances from No. 3 \u2013 having previously reached No. 2 \u2013 despite a less than 1% gain in plays in the week ending Dec. 26, according to MRC Data, to become the most played song on U.S. monitored adult R&B stations. (The previous week\u2019s No. 1, Wizkid\u2019s \u201cEssence,\u201d featuring Tems, falls to No. 2 with a 9% decline in plays.)\n\u201cCome Through\u201d gives singer-songwriter H.E.R. a seventh No. 1 on Adult R&B Airplay among 10 total career entries on the chart. With the new addition, here\u2019s her updated roster:\nSong Title, Artist (if other than H.E.R.), Weeks at No. 1, Date Reached No. 1\n\u201cFocus,\u201d one week, Oct. 6, 2018\n\u201cBest Part,\u201d Daniel Caesar featuring H.E.R., four, Oct. 20, 2018\n\u201cSlow Down,\u201d with Skip Marley, three, May 23, 2020\n\u201cMake the Most,\u201d Lonr. featuring H.E.R., one, Oct. 24, 2020\n\u201cGotta Move On,\u201d Toni Braxton featuring H.E.R., two, Feb. 20, 2021\n\u201cDamage,\u201d eight, June 26, 2021\n\u201cCome Through,\u201d featuring Chris Brown, Jan. 1, 2022\nIn addition, a seventh champ pushes H.E.R. into a tie for fourth place for the most No. 1s among all artists since the chart began in 1993. Check out the current leaderboard:\n12, Alicia Keys\n11, Toni Braxton\n8, Charlie Wilson\n7, H.E.R.\n7, Kem\n7, Maxwell\n7, R. Kelly\nFor Chris Brown, meanwhile, \u201cCome Through\u201d sustains his Adult R&B Airplay success streak with a third consecutive leader. The single follows his two other champs, \u201cNo Guidance,\u201d featuring Drake, an 11-week No. 1 in 2020 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d with Young Thug, which reigned for seven weeks in 2020-21.\n\u201cCome Through\u201d continues the newfound radio breakthrough for Brown with adult R&B audiences. After some success with his initial 14 chart appearances from 2006-16, the hitmaker has grown into a favorite of adult R&B radio programmers and audiences in recent years. In 2019, he found his first top five success on his 15th try, with \u201cUndecided\u201d reaching No. 4 before the three No. 1s streak.\n\u201cCome Through\u201d appears on H.E.R.\u2019s debut full-length studio album, Back of My Mind. The set, released in June, debuted at No. 1 on Top R&B Albums and led for one week."

      "text": "Another day, another Drake album. After nearly 10 months of teasing, delays, and an album campaign characterized by his first poetry book and a 21 Savage-assisted tour equally focused on music and bras, Drake has finally unveiled For All the Dogs.\nArriving on the heels of three consecutive Billboard 200-topping projects that were all received rather tepidly \u2014 2021\u2019s Certifed Lover Boy and 2022\u2019s Honestly, Nevermind and Her Loss \u2014 For All the Dogs promised a return to \u201cthe old Drake.\u201d Now, the \u201cold Drake\u201d \u2014 whether that\u2019s referring to some nebulous collective recollection of his Take Care glory days or a direct return to the ethos and sonic aesthetics of his earlier records \u2014 has been a term that has hounded the \u201cJimmy Cooks\u201d rapper for years. Between forays into dance music and collaborative projects, a vocal segment of Drake\u2019s fans have been clamoring for the moody, introspective R&B-informed stream-of-consciousness raps about relationship dynamics that dominated the tracklists of his first few studio efforts.\nStanding at a whopping 23 tracks with one hour and 25-minute runtime, For All the Dogs spends what feels like an eternity trying to recapture the ember of \u201cthe old Drake\u201d \u2014 but the efforts are futile, because so much of the album leans on an exact recreation of the \u201cold Drake\u201d approach to those topics, rather than returning to focusing on those storied subjects with a matured and evolve outlook.\nNevertheless, For All the Dogs boasts a star-studded roster of collaborators and surprise guests, including SZA (twice), J. Cole, Chief Keef, Sexyy Red, Snoop Dogg, Sade, Teezo Touchdown, Bad Bunny, Yeat, 21 Savage, Lil Yachty and PARTYNEXTDOOR \u2014 a wide-ranging list that reasserts Drake\u2019s ability to select artistic partners who will expand his already vast audience and push him into trending sounds and styles that might be a bit removed from his usual wheelhouse. From soulful piano-laden Griselda-nodding soundscapes to party-ready mixtures of Miami bass and \u201980s synths, For All the Dogs covers a lot of ground while remaining relatively sonically cohesive. The album certainly overstays its welcome and takes too long to truly find its pocket, but For All the Dogs works best when Drake makes it clear that he\u2019s not taking himself too seriously, as he does on the genuinely hilarious \u201cBBL Love (Interlude)\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s not always the case, which makes the record feel tedious at best.\nWith a tracklist this bloated, sorting through For All the Dogs is no easy task, so here is a preliminary ranking of every song on Drake\u2019s new record.\n-\n\u201cCalling For You (feat. 21 Savage)\u201d\n21 Savage and Drake have proven to be fruitful collaborators over the past few years, but after getting an album\u2019s worth of songs that are much better than this one just under a year ago, \u201cCalling For You\u201d feels flat. With a voicemail interlude that ends with \u201cThat\u2019s on you, it\u2019s on you/ Sorry for your loss,\u201d the Her Loss connection is too overt to make this song feel a part of the For All the Dogs world. Not to mention that neither rapper fills up the sparse production with interesting or innovative bars; it\u2019s more of them reminiscing on past romances and throwing general shots and unspecified opps \u2014 which, again, we just got from this exact pairing last year.\n-\n\u201cAnother Late Night\u201d (feat. Lil Yachty)\nLil Yachty has had a banner year across genres, and this new record with Drake probably would have been better off just being his and his alone. With a shimmering beat punctuated by fuzzy synths and an eye roll-inducing hook \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s just another late night with my b\u2013ch/ Just another late night with my b\u2013ch / And I hate to even call her a\u2013 my b\u2013ch / \u2018Cause I love that ho, don\u2019t even make no sense, man\u201d \u2014 \u201cAnother Late Night\u201d struggles to leave a lasting impression that transcends the 22 other songs it has to share space with. Not bad, but not that memorable either.\n-\n\u201cFear of Heights\u201d\nFor All the Dogs features some of the worst hooks of Drake\u2019s career, and \u201cFear of Heights\u201d is chief among those lackluster offerings. With a beat that pulls from the high-octane thrill of rage rap, Drake throws subliminals at past flings and peers alike. The issue here, and across a number of the album\u2019s tracks, is that Drake\u2019s voice is so bereft of energy that the song begins to drag, despite boasting verses that are actually some of the most interesting on the whole record.\n-\n\u201cAmen\u201d (feat. Teezo Touchdown)\n\u201cAmen\u201d \u2014 the first of two Teezo Touchdown collaborations on For All the Dogs \u2014 is something akin to Drake\u2019s version of \u201cCiara\u2019s Prayer.\u201d Over an arrangement that opens with a prayer from Teezo, churchy piano keys, and doo-wop-adjacent harmonies, Drake prays not for gratitude, but for God to not expose him for doing his girl(s) wrong, even as she prays for him while he\u2019s on the road.\n-\n\u201cIDGAF\u201d (feat. Yeat)\nThis long-awaited collaboration is really a moment of victory for Yeat above all else. The 23-year-old Cali rapper brings Drake into his realm for a raucous bass-heavy anthem of, well, giving no f\u2014ks. Because of their wealth, talent, and fame neither Yeat nor Drake feel the need to waste energy thinking about those who are beneath them. To nobody\u2019s surprise, Drake doesn\u2019t sound awkward or out of place alongside Yeat \u2014 but this is Yeat\u2019s moment, and he takes his golden opportunity and runs all the way to the bank.\n-\n\u201cPolar Opposite\u201d\nInstead of remaining in the \u201copposites attract\u201d realm that the title suggests, Drake takes things even further and spends this song playing armchair psychiatrist as he lambasts a former flame for blocking him \u201cunprovoked.\u201d Now, realistically, Drake probably did something to deserve that, but that\u2019s not the focus here. Drake is convinced that \u201cpropaganda\u201d is the reason she\u2019s walking away from the relationship, and he\u2019s using some of his corniest lines to date to convey his feelings about the whole situation: \u201cYou tried to grease me, but we\u2019re not in Mykonos/ I don\u2019t get hurt much, but I\u2019m not invincible/ Bidin\u2019 my time with you, then things got political.\u201d\n-\n\u201cMembers Only\u201d (feat. PARTYNEXTDOOR)\nYou can rarely go wrong with Drake and PND on the same track, and \u201cMembers Only\u201d is a solid addition to their lexicon. Deep in the murky R&B vibe of PND\u2019s solo work, the pair\u2019s chemistry is as vibrant as ever. Their languid rap-sung cadences overlap with each other like a multi-layered cake, with each tier providing a new shade of nuance for the song. Unfortunately, \u201cMembers Only\u201d is marred by lyrics that are childish and lazy: \u201cSay you started datin\u2019 girls now, say it to me with a straight face/ Oh, now it\u2019s girls/ I wanna know all of your kinks.\u201d\n-\n\u201cGently\u201d (feat. Bad Bunny)\nBetween \u201cGently,\u201d \u201cSlime You Out,\u201d and Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cK-POP,\u201d there seems to be a trend of the year\u2019s biggest names of music collaborating on some of the most boring and predictable songs they have to offer. With a thumping dembow riddim in the background and ample X-rated Spanish-language lyrics from both Drake and Benito, \u201cGently\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily a bad track, but it certainly isn\u2019t as catchy as \u201cMIA,\u201d nor is it particularly memorable in the context of the full album. Collaborations between artists of this caliber should be especially fearless because, more often than not, they don\u2019t have to seriously worry about the immediate commercial success of a left-field song because their fans will always give anything a listen. Unfortunately, Drake and Bad Bunny decided to play it safe.\n-\n\u201cSlime You Out\u201d (feat. SZA)\nIt\u2019s quite funny to reflect on the initial reception of \u201cSlime You Out\u201d \u2014 which ended up debuting atop the Billboard Hot 100 regardless \u2014 given that the song is far from the worst offering on For All the Dogs. Take from that what you will, but there are at least some real stakes and tension in this SZA-Drake duet in comparison to some of the album\u2019s other collaborations. It\u2019s still miles away from the surefire stunner that a SZA-Drake duet should be, but it\u2019s not a complete waste of space.\n-\n\u201cVirginia Beach\u201d\nTo commence For All the Dogs, Drake pens an ode to archnemesis Pusha T\u2019s hometown of Virginia Beach as he waxes poetic about the city\u2019s \u201cpretty but ghetto\u201d girl and the varying effects they have on his mind and heart. Bogged down by a clunky chorus and more corny bars \u2014 \u201cHe gon\u2019 find out that it\u2019s on sight like W-W-W/ On sight like dot-com, put a baby in you, a hot mom\u201d \u2014 the intro starts to flounder, but 40\u2019s skittering production keeps things engaging.\n-\n\u201c7969 Santa\u201d\nBetween a nifty sample of Chief Keef\u2019s seminal \u201cI Don\u2019t Like\u201d and a surprise interlude from Teezo Touchdown, \u201c7969 Santa\u201d synthesizes myriad elements to explain some of the ethos behind the album\u2019s title. On the one hand, this record is for all of Drake\u2019s dawgs \u2014 that is to say, his homies and longtime supporters. On the other hand, the new album is also (and arguably primarily) for all the dogs \u2014 as in the womanizing Peter Pan syndrome-scarred bachelor characters he assumes throughout the record.\nThe song itself is solid \u2014 BNYX\u2019s production is stellar and the Snoop Dogg radio host bit at the end is dope \u2014 but Teezo\u2019s interlude steals the show. His interlude isn\u2019t life-changing, but it is particularly funny because he makes what sounds like wolf howls right after hammering home the whole \u201cdog\u201d theme of the album.\n-\n\u201cDaylight\u201d\nPrior to the release of For All the Dogs, Drake announced that he and Nicki Minaj would have a song together on the record. The song never materialized \u2014 and we still have no explanation as to why \u2014 but \u201cDaylight\u201d offered something of a consolation prize. On this track, he interpolates the same Scarface speech that informed the bridge of Minaj\u2019s \u201cChun-Li.\u201d Unlike Minaj\u2019s, Drake\u2019s villain era feels quite forced, but that doesn\u2019t negate Southside\u2019s ominous oscillating synths and a cheeky response to those BBL accusations and, more importantly, those XXXTENTACION conspiracy theories \u2014 \u201cTBS think that I bought the body/ Internet swear that I bought the body/ Take more than that to go pop somebody.\u201d\n-\n\u201cBahamas Promises\u201d\nWhen we\u2019re talking about \u201cthe Old Drake,\u201d \u201cBahamas Promises\u201d is it. Back in the spirit of \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room,\u201d Drake pours his heart out over a plaintive piano-backed beat as he works his way through an emotional stream-of-consciousness verse. In the final line, Drake perfectly recreates the energy of \u201cold Drake\u201d \u2014 vulnerable, but ultimately self-serving. \u201cPromise I won\u2019t cause a scene/ I got too much respect for me,\u201d he croons.\n-\n\u201cBBL Love (Interlude)\u201d\nFor All the Dogs shines brightest when Drake escapes the trappings of actual misogyny and properly taps into the comedic aspect of his ever-evolving ostentatious artistic persona. From giving lavish gifts to plastic surgeons while on tour to rumors of him going under the knife, Drake\u2019s brand has become increasingly infused with the contemporary BBL craze. Here, he compares a BBL to love, saying, \u201cThey say love\u2019s like a BBL, you won\u2019t know if it\u2019s real until you feel one.\u201d If that\u2019s not one of the most utterly ridiculous lines of the year, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find something more unserious. But that\u2019s the beauty of the interlude: Drake finally allows himself to play into his persona on a character level, instead of worryingly muddying the lines between his actual person and how he presents himself in the music.\n-\n\u201cFirst Person Shooter\u201d (feat. J. Cole)\nFor their first collaboration in a decade, Drake and J. Cole tackle the \u201cBig 3\u201d debate that has dominated hip-hop conversations since they and Kendrick Lamar entered the ring in the early 2010s. Now a decade-plus into their respective reigns, both Cole and Drake adopt an attitude of elder statesmen, but they still have some skin in the game. \u201cLove when they argue the hardest MC/ Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?/ We the Big Three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammed Ali,\u201d Cole spits.\nOver the subtle-yet-triumphant instrumental \u2014 which features production credits from Tay Keith and Boi-1da, among others \u2014 the two stars dig into their braggadocious bag, yet it still feels like they\u2019re holding back ever-so-slightly. However, Drake did offer this nice sequel to his infamous \u201cmore slaps than the Beatles\u201d line: \u201cWhat the f\u2013k bro? I\u2019m one away from Michael/ N\u2014a, beat it, n\u2014a, beat it, what?\u201d\n-\n\u201cAll the Parties\u201d (feat. Chief Keef)\nNot only does Chief Keef appear on For All the Dogs via a sample, but the \u201cLove Sosa\u201d rapper also appears on \u201cAll the Parties,\u201d a Boi-1da- and BNYX-helmed joint that finds Drake doing his usual reflections on his success and how he moves in the music industry. It\u2019s a two-part track that\u2019s anchored by Chief Keef\u2019s chorus in the first half, in which he references the classic \u201cLove Sosa\u201d and provides a sing-songy cadence to counterbalance Drake\u2019s rap-heavy verses. The beat switch, however, is the real star of the show. The song assumes a more atmospheric, synth-y tone that allows the space Drake to vent about his frustrations with the permanence of death as it relates to dynamics in the rap game. \u201cAnd I wish I could dead all the beefin\u2019/ And I wish I could dead all the dissin\u2019 deceased friends/ I wish we could be friends/ Probably sound like I\u2019m preachin\u2019.\u201d\n-\n\u201cWhat Would Pluto Do\u201d\nDrake and Future are obviously a dynamic duo, but \u201cWhat Would Pluto Do\u201d proves that the \u201cWait For U\u201d rapper\u2019s presence can still pull some great material out of Drake \u2014 even if he isn\u2019t actually on the track. Over a beat accented by twinkling piano and steady percussion, Drizzy makes Pluto a stand-in for Jesus. While Jesus would likely give Drake advice that amounts to him moving with grace and respect, when it comes to Pluto\u2026 \u201cWhat would Pluto do? He\u2019d f\u2013k the ho, so I did it.\u201d And it\u2019s really as simple as that. With a crisp, effective hook and immersive production that gives Drake the space to place with comedy and vulnerability, \u201cWhat Would Pluto Do\u201d is an easy standout. (And now we wait for the inevitable remix.)\n-\n\u201c8am in Charlotte\u201d\nUnveiled less than 24 hours before the album\u2019s full release, \u201c8am in Charlotte\u201d is a worthy addition to Drake\u2019s timestamp songs collection that also honors Griselda\u2019s impact with soulful production courtesy of Conductor Williams. With three meaty metaphor-packed verses that feature Drake standing staunchly in his rap bag, this, in many ways, is the proper return to \u201cold Drake\u201d that he promised so many months ago.\n-\n\u201cScrew the World (Interlude)\u201d\nIt certainly does say something that this Drake-less interlude is a better song and more enjoyable listen than several of his own songs on this album. A heartfelt tribute to the late DJ Screw, \u201cScrew the World\u201d effortlessly transports us not just to Houston, but to a time when Drake used to properly build worlds within individual records. Here, he gives DJ Screw\u2019s flaming freestyle all the space it needs, a moment of much-needed reprieve from the album\u2019s obsession with Instagram-ready Drakeisms.\n-\n\u201cRich Baby Daddy\u201d (feat. Sexyy Red & SZA)\nFor All the Dogs is an interesting album, for the simple fact that for all of the album\u2019s journeys into hot new sounds across the marketplace, the album doesn\u2019t really feature the undeniable pop-facing hooks of, say, Scorpion or Views. Luckily, Sexyy Red is on the case. The St. Louis rapper blesses \u201cRich Baby Daddy\u201d with yet another earworm hook and a guest verse, while SZA stops for her second and final guest appearance on the album. With infectious production that heavily nods to Miami bass, this is the song of the summer that we deserved \u2014 from Sexyy\u2019s \u201cLooking for the Hoes\u201d interpolation to an outro from Drake that basically cements him as the ultimate rich baby daddy. Song of the Fall, perhaps?\n-\n\u201cDrew A Picasso\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t picture you with him/ That\u2019s just so embarrassin\u2019/ I want to di\u0435, to die,\u201d just might be the most relatable Drake has ever been. Again, when he leans into the innate melodrama and theatrics of dynamic relationships, he excels. \u201cDrew a Picasso\u201d features production credits from a slew of collaborators, all of which contribute to the song\u2019s subtly tenebrous tone \u2014 the perfect backdrop for Drizzy to sort through his confusion, hurt and frustration over a relationship too dysfunctional to last.\n-\n\u201cTried Our Best\u201d\n\u201cTried Our Best\u201d is classic Drake \u2014 a song that sits perfectly between rap and R&B, lyrics that offer a vivid, insightful look at the complexity of a relationship marred by miscommunication and unforeseen incompatibility, and ethereal piano-anchored production. \u201cThere\u2019s no ribbon given to anyone that you dealt with/ No badge of honor, no ceremony or benefits/ I gotta start us up a support group with a membership,\u201d he sings \u2014 biting lines that, of course, absolve of his own accountability for the relationship\u2019s demise. Sure, he\u2019s telling a one-sided story, but he\u2019s aware of that and he\u2019s doing it well. All of this combined with a Frank Ocean allusion (\u201cThe girl that the boy cherishes workin\u2019 late night at the Pyramid, and it ain\u2019t right\u201d) that connects \u201cTried Our Best\u201d to the Ocean-sampling \u201cVirginia Beach,\u201d and you\u2019re left with a winning record.\n-\n\u201cAway From Home\u201d\nAs the penultimate track on a 23-track album, \u201cAway From Home\u201d fought an uphill battle to emerge as the crown jewel of For All the Dogs. The first verse of this track \u2014 which boasts production credits from Lil Yachty and BNYX \u2014 finds Drake shedding the glided costumes of celebrity and wealth and returning to the headspace of his come-up days sleeping in his car and funneling the heartbreak of rejection into determination to achieve his dreams. For a few minutes, the hunger of \u201cold Drake\u201d actually does reappear, and that resilience makes his voice sound alive in ways that simply feels DOA elsewhere on the record. The rest of the song traces his dual life and career journey since those days, offering a legitimate full-circle moment for an artist who so often feels like he\u2019s either running away from who he\u2019s becoming or running in circles trying to figure out what\u2019s next."
