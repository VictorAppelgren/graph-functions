      "feedback": "Your draft is solid but still drifts from the strict “DXY‑only” focus, over‑cites non‑canonical handles, and leaves key quantitative links implicit. Tighten the causal chain by anchoring every claim to a canonical handle (e.g., ust2y, ust10y, dxy) and a single, dated catalyst (e.g., Sep FOMC, Aug PCE, 29‑31 Aug tariff). Replace generic “high‑probability” language with explicit probability ranges (e.g., 89 % chance of a 25‑bp cut, 57‑bp spread steepening). Quantify the translation from yield moves to DXY moves (e.g., 10 bp drop in ust2y ≈ 0.3 % DXY depreciation) and cite the source IDs. Remove the “political pressure” paragraph unless you can link it to a measurable handle (e.g., dxy‑vs‑us‑debt‑spread) and provide a catalyst window. Consolidate watch signals into a concise list: (1) 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (Z7O1DCHS7), (2) Trump‑Fed lawsuit status (Z7O1DCHS7), (3) tariff announcement (29‑31 Aug, FAN5RYW6T), (4) Fed meeting (Sep FOMC, FAN5RYW6T). Ensure each bullet ends with a single inline citation. Finally, trim the confidence paragraph to a single sentence that states a 70 % confidence level with the caveat that a core‑PCE > 3 % or a Fed tightening would invalidate the view. This will bring the brief to 4–6 crisp sentences, fully aligned with the SECTION FOCUS and the 1‑sentence‑per‑bullet rule.",
