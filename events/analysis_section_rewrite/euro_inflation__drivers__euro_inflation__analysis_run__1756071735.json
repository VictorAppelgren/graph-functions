      "feedback": "The draft correctly anchors to NL5YYTLF2 and uses a Ford EV example to illustrate cross‑topic transmission, but it lacks a formal, regime‑based causal map, coherent valuation linkages, and consistent numerics; to reach world‑class quality, implement a tight three‑regime matrix tied to NL5YYTLF2 (Regime A: AI‑driven productivity with contained displacement and lower discount rates; Regime B/C: policy‑design tradeoffs that reprice discount rates and earnings power) with explicit macro inputs (inflation path, growth impulse, policy stance) and bounded probabilities, then tie each regime to a concrete valuation outcome via a present‑value/earnings‑power framework (explicit P/E or EV/EBITDA sensitivities by regime); strengthen the oil cross‑current by correcting inconsistent year/volume figures (e.g., 2025 vs 2026 refinery runs, Brent/WTI targets) and linking oil trajectories to inflation and real yields under Regimes A–C (cite T1QE6JPIX for oil, NL5YYTLF2 for regime context); translate Ford’s $1.3B Q2 EV losses, 4.3% automotive margin, and ~10.1% ROIC into regime‑specific earnings trajectories and sector impacts, not as external data points; ground the narrative in first‑principles PV logic plus clear sector sensitivities to discount rates and productivity shocks; ensure citations are attached to the claims they support (NL5YYTLF2 after regime claims, T1QE6JPIX for oil, J99EM2TPZ for Ford) and reconcile any regime conflicts with explicit trade‑offs; add a concise watch‑list of 4–6 decisive signals with trigger thresholds and a 12–24 month horizon, and tighten formatting to avoid repetition while keeping the IDs strictly to the source IDs provided.",
