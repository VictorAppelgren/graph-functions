      "feedback": "Overall, the draft shows a solid link between crypto pricing and a policy-regime framework but falls short on a single, testable causal chain, disciplined probability weights, and explicit, monitorable triggers; it needs sharper first-principles grounding, a clean four-line Up/Up/Down/Down structure (if kept in that format), and tighter use of source facts. Actionable edits: (1) construct a single causal chain: policy regime (Tight/Transition/Easy) and real-rate differentials → crypto discount rates → ETH/BTC price drivers (ETFs, staking, institutional demand) with explicit links to OGK8WLL69, 2QRLB974F, NL5YYTLF2, S1OY7ISLY; (2) anchor probabilities to the source regime weights (Regime A ≈ 50%, Regime B ≈ 30%, Regime C ≈ 20%) and derive Up/Down calls from those, not ad hoc 15–60% figures; (3) replace vague price descriptions with precise numbers from the material (ETH ~4,955; BTC ~110k–124k; July ETH ETF inflows >$5B; ytd ETH inflows ~ $9.6B; staking ≈ one-third of supply) and tag every factual claim with the correct IDs; (4) formalize four explicit catalysts/triggers with thresholds and clear invalidation points (e.g., Powell data-driven easing plus ETF approvals → upside; hawkish surprises or GENIUS/Project Crypto underperforming → downside; ETF approvals accelerate plus corporate ether purchases or staking toward/above one-third → upside; persistent inflation or delayed demand → downside); (5) deliver a crisp watchlist with numeric thresholds and a simple reconciliation rule (prefer Regime A on disinflation signals with modest capex, escalate to B/C on wage/inflation persistence or weaker capex) and ensure every assertion relies only on the IDs from the source material to avoid conflicts.",
