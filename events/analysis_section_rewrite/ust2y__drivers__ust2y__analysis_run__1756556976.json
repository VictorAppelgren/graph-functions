      "feedback": "Your draft captures the core drivers of the DXY but needs tighter causal logic, sharper quantification, and cleaner citations. 1) Correct the Fed‑yield logic: Fed tightening expectations raise the 10‑yr yield, increase the risk‑premium in the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, and *strengthen* the dollar; Fed cuts compress the spread, lower the 30‑yr mortgage rate (6.548 % → 6.45–6.50 %) and *weaken* the dollar. 2) Re‑state the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread effect: a 57‑bp steepening (Z7O1DCHS7) signals risk‑on and supports a *stronger* dollar, whereas a flattening below 30 bp (7XH2DKEKV) signals risk‑off and weakens the dollar. 3) Quantify probabilities: 89 % chance of a 25‑bp Fed cut (7XH2DKEKV) → DXY decline 200 bp to 95.8 by Aug 31; 10–20 % chance of a Fed pivot → DXY rebound to 96.5–97.0 in early September. 4) Add explicit risk‑reversal scenarios: Fed signals a pause/hike (prob ≈ 10 %) → mortgage rate rises 0.1–0.2 %, DXY climbs 50–100 bp; global risk‑off (prob ≈ 15 %) → DXY > 96.0. 5) Tighten the narrative: remove the sentence “Fed tightening expectations lower the 10‑yr yield” and replace with the corrected logic. 6) Ensure every claim has an inline ID: e.g., mortgage rate link to LF0UUL917, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread to Z7O1DCHS7, Fed cut probability to 7XH2DKEKV. 7) End with a concise watch‑list: Fed minutes (Aug 30), PCE (Aug 30), NFP (Aug 31), 2‑yr/10‑yr spread trend. 8) Remove any generic “primary risk” phrasing; replace with specific probability ranges. This will satisfy the truth‑>verbosity rule, map to canonical handles (dxy, ust10y, mortgage_rate), and provide a clear, actionable view.",
