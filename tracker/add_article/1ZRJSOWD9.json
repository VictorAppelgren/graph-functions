      "summary": "The U.S. Treasury has created “Trump Accounts,” a tax‑advantaged savings vehicle for children born 2025‑2028 that starts with a $1,000 federal deposit and allows up to $5,000 annual contributions from parents, employers, and charities. The accounts must be invested in low‑cost U.S. equity index funds, cannot be accessed until age 18, and are treated as traditional IRAs thereafter. While the program offers free money and potential long‑term growth, critics argue it offers limited tax benefits, excludes vulnerable children, and adds administrative complexity compared to existing plans such as 529s. The bill estimates the program will cost about $15 billion through 2034 and is part of a broader push to incentivize savings for future generations.",
