      "summary": "The Smithsonian Institution is undergoing a comprehensive review to align its exhibits with President Trump's interpretation of American history, following pressure from the White House. New exhibits include a diorama of Revolutionary War forces and a Civil War display featuring fictional elements, while interactive features aim to present a sanitized version of history. Critics argue this represents a dangerous politicization of historical institutions, while supporters claim it promotes a unifying narrative. The changes are set to be implemented within 120 days, with the Smithsonian emphasizing its commitment to scholarly excellence amidst these alterations.",
