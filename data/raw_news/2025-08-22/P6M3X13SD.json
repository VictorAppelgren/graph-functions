  "content": "Thursday was another down day for the stock market, with the mega-cap indices all giving up between 0.3% and 0.5%. The small- and mid-cap indices were virtually flat on the day. So far, the S&P 500 (SPX) has held trendline support off the lows since May 23. During the first mini pullback on July 31/August 1, the index held this trendline perfectly. The SPX also is holding right at its 21-day exponential moving average (EMA). The rising 50-day simple average sits at 6,261, and the recent closing low comes in at 6,238. The prior breakout level from February 19 is down at 6,144, with the slowly rising 200-day average at 5,942. For the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ), short-term support from the closing low on August 1 is at 554, while the rising 50-day average lies at 557. The key breakout level from February is down at 538. While the volatility index (VIX) of the SPX has been well behaved, sitting at 16.6, the VXN volatility index of the Nasdaq 100 has jumped from a recent low of 16.5 to Wednesday's intraday high of 21.7. The VXN ran right into its 200-day average on Wednesday before pulling back. A close and sustained advance by the VXN over 22 could be very telling and signal more trouble for the mega-cap IT names",
