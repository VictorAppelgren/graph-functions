  "title": "How Newcastle United play: Tonali\u2019s vital role, picking when to press and the sweepiest of \u2018keepers",
  "description": "At Newcastle United last season there was one player who was arguably more influential than any other ... his name was Sandro Tonali",
  "content": "This is part of a series from The Athletic breaking down the tactical approach of Premier League teams for the 2025-26 season. You can read about the other teams we\u2019ve covered so far via the links below.\n\n\n\nIn outlining how Newcastle have played under Eddie Howe, a certain wantaway Swedish centre-forward has been pivotal. The question mark over Alexander Isak\u2019s future means that, should he depart before September, Newcastle\u2019s overall game plan will need to alter.\n\nBut the overarching blueprint will not be discarded. Newcastle\u2019s head coach will not deviate from his defined principles \u2014 front-foot defending, aggression and high intensity are key traits of \u2018Howe-ball\u2019.\n\nHere, The Athletic breaks down Newcastle\u2019s approach under Howe \u2014 and the changes that may occur in the 2025-26 season.\n\nHowe will hate reading this, but his team selection has been mostly predictable, at least in its formation.\n\nFor 113 matches straight from November 2021 to March 2024, Howe sent out his Newcastle side in a 4-3-3. Since then, any occasional deviation has always been followed by a reversion.\n\nTo the untrained eye, it may appear as if Howe sticks to the same tactical approach for every game. Yet meticulous planning means that there is always a nuanced plan \u2014 4-3-3 is his nominal starting formation, but individual roles are tweaked depending on the opposition.\n\nTowards the end of 2024-25, Howe even shifted to a back three. That three-man defence was occasionally seen during pre-season but it is more likely that Howe will save that setup when facing European-qualification rivals. Sven Botman, Dan Burn and Fabian Schar have operated well as a trio, while defender Malick Thiaw, who last night completed his move from Milan, is adept at playing in any centre-back position.\n\nThe predominance of 4-3-3 is evident in the graphic below, which shows the average position of Newcastle\u2019s players during the \u2018build-up\u2019 and \u2018creation\u2019 phases.\n\nDuring the creation phase \u2014 when a side builds out from the back \u2014 Newcastle try to use greater width, with the full-backs often closest to the touchlines and the wingers pushing outwards.\n\nOnce Newcastle advance into the creation phase \u2014 which starts once they have moved the ball into attacking areas \u2014 their shape narrows. The gaps between players close and the midfield three push to join the forwards, with Howe keen to flood the box with runners.\n\nNewcastle are still evolving, especially in possession. Just as it will take time for the club to compete against the elite clubs within the bounds of profit and sustainability rules (PSR), their territorial dominance does not yet mirror the traditionally successful sides.\n\nWhereas Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool are dominant across the pitch, Newcastle\u2019s focus is directed towards wide attacking areas and then centrally inside their own half.\n\nAthleticism and physicality are hallmarks of Howe\u2019s Newcastle. Energy and intensity are central, too.\n\nIn the Premier League last season, Newcastle players produced the most high-speed sprints per minute of build-up play.\n\nNewcastle generated 8.6 xG (expected goals, a measure of the quality of their chances) from Opta-defined \u2018fast breaks\u2018, second only to Liverpool. The pace of Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, Jacob Murphy, Tino Livramento and Isak \u2014 and the newly acquired speedster Anthony Elanga (who showed glimpses of what he can do against Atletico Madrid on Saturday, as shown below) \u2014 means Newcastle can attack with rapid ferocity.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Newcastle ranked highly across Europe for overlapping and underlapping runs, as well as for runners attacking crosses, throughout 2024-25.\n\nAs the graphic below shows, Newcastle rarely build up laterally or by coming short \u2014 instead, there is a verticality about their approach.\n\nThey rely upon runners getting beyond the ball carrier, through underlapping or overlapping runs, or on players arriving late into the box to meet crosses.\n\nBarnes and Livramento developed an understanding down the left last season and regularly overlapped and underlapped one another. Their connection led to Newcastle\u2019s second goal in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool in March (shown below).\n\nNewcastle have become adept at delivering open-play crosses to the back post. Last season, they scored the most goals (11) from these chances and generated the highest xG (11), from the third-most chances (38).\n\nWhen one of Newcastle\u2019s wingers stays wide, the other tends to head into the area, ready to get on the end of crosses. Livramento, Lewis Hall and Kieran Trippier look to advance from full-back and pepper the area with crosses.\n\nGreat combination play, with Barnes and Livramento dovetailing once more, led to Murphy\u2019s back-post goal against Leicester in April (shown below).\n\nAs inverted left-wingers, Gordon and Barnes naturally cut inside onto their right foot. They regularly dart in from their flank, desperate to create an angle to shoot. As they do so, the full-backs overlap or underlap, presenting a passing option or attracting defenders away to create more space for the winger (as shown below against Brentford in April).\n\nThe graphic below shows how Newcastle entered the box across 2024-25.\n\nBruno Guimaraes (133), Murphy (128) and Gordon (109) provided the most passes into the area, while Gordon (47), Barnes (37) and Isak (33) carried the ball into the box most frequently. There is a fairly even split between passes and carries into the area from the right and the left, yet Newcastle rarely run with possession from central positions into the box.\n\nMurphy developed a healthy knack for finding Isak in goalscoring positions last year. The winger laid on seven goals for the striker in 2024-25, the most provided for an individual team-mate in the Premier League. Whether that lethal combination continues moving forward, time will tell.\n\nWhen it comes to attacking set pieces, Newcastle were decidedly mid-table last season. Only 17.7 per cent (12) of their 68 league goals came from dead-ball situations, while they generated an xG of 11.7 from 145 shots.\n\nMartin Mark\u2019s arrival as the club\u2019s first dedicated set-piece coach feels timely, then.\n\nJason Tindall, the assistant head coach, Stephen Purches, the first-team coach, and Kieran Taylor, the set-piece analyst, previously oversaw dead balls. While their involvement will continue, Mark specialised in set pieces at Midtjylland and his innovative ideas were already evident during pre-season, when Newcastle attempted new corner and free-kick routines.\n\nWhether Mark alters Newcastle\u2019s throw-in blueprint will be intriguing to see. Last season, Newcastle only took one long throw, the fewest attempted in the Premier League, and even that was Dan Burn trying to quickly send his team clear down the wing, rather than a classic launch into the box.\n\nIn 2024-25, there were two very different versions of Newcastle: pre- and post-December. Or, to single out one specific tactical tweak, pre- and post-Sandro Tonali\u2019s shift to the deep-lying No 6 position.\n\nAs critical as Isak\u2019s successive 20-goal-plus Premier League campaigns have been, Tonali was arguably their most influential player once he had been repurposed.\n\nDuring his first 18 months on Tyneside (when he was available to play, either side of his ban for gambling offences), Tonali usually operated as a right-sided No 8 (central midfielder). The graphic below shows how the areas in which he touched the ball in open play changed once he was moved to deep-lying midfielder for most of 2024-25.\n\nTonali is not an archetypal holding No 6, he is so much more. He can cover ground defensively, thwart potential counters and start attacks with his magnificent passing range, yet he also has the licence (and engine) to advance and create overloads around the box.\n\nSo much of what Newcastle did well en route to winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League stemmed directly from Tonali and the balance he provides.\n\nWhen Newcastle qualified for the Champions League in 2022-23, they swarmed opponents \u2014 pressing high, forcing high turnovers and being aggressive in almost every off-the-ball phase.\n\nThat marked a dramatic change from the Rafa Benitez and Steve Bruce days, when Newcastle sat deep and tried to counter. Howe took over in November 2021 and focused on solidifying the defence. Across that first campaign, Newcastle\u2019s average defensive line was 22m from their own goal. The following season, when Newcastle finished fourth, their defensive line had moved 7m higher up the field to 29m.\n\nThat distance remained almost identical for 2023-24 (28m) yet rather surprisingly, it dropped to 25m last season (as shown below).\n\nDropping back slightly appears to be a deliberate evolution. Newcastle conceded 62 goals across 2023-24, but that was cut to 47 as they became far more rigid defensively.\n\nRather than press high all the time, Newcastle pick and choose their moments (and games). They did so late on against Manchester United in April, with six players positioned in the final third, leading to Guimaraes scoring.\n\nAgainst some opponents, Newcastle will sit deeper. Against others, they will harry the goalkeeper and defenders whenever they pass it across the back line. In certain games, such as against Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal last season, Newcastle will go man-for-man and players will literally follow their opposite number wherever they roam. Usually, Newcastle switch between all of these (especially the first two) within matches.\n\nYet, even though Newcastle\u2019s defensive line has moved deeper, they are still reliant on Nick Pope\u2019s willingness and ability to come out of his box and involve himself in the game (as shown below against Crystal Palace in April).\n\nLast season, Pope\u2019s figure of 2.4 sweeper-keeper actions per 90 minutes was the highest in the Premier League by a significant margin.\n\nIn December 2023, Pope was sidelined through injury and deputy Martin Dubravka is not as comfortable coming out of his box, exposing Newcastle\u2019s high defensive line. The decision to drop slightly deeper last season aimed to compensate for Newcastle\u2019s lack of pace at centre-back \u2014 although Thiaw\u2019s arrival should add speed to the back line, perhaps making Howe\u2019s side less reliant on Pope\u2019s sweeping.\n\nAaron Ramsdale has arrived on an initial loan from Southampton and will compete with Pope. He made only 0.7 keeper-sweepings per 90 last season, so he offers different strengths, although that figure is skewed downwards by Southampton\u2019s out-of-possession style.\n\nOne of Ramsdale\u2019s strengths is his comfort with the ball at his feet. While Pope can distribute excellently out of hand, he often appears awkward when kicking from the floor.\n\nAgainst Espanyol on Friday, Ramsdale often played simple passes, but always scanned the pitch and tried to break the lines when he could (as shown below).\n\nIn open play, Ramsdale went long more often than Pope (35 per cent to 16 per cent), as the graphic below illustrates.\n\nRamsdale does not just launch the ball, however \u2014 he gets involved in build-up play and looks to beat the first line of the opposition press by floating passes into the middle third of the pitch.\n\nSo we return to where we started.\n\nIt is difficult to say how efficiently Newcastle would continue to operate if Isak, the central goalscoring cog in their machine, was sold. That hypothetical scenario also depends upon who would replace him.\n\nNewcastle failed to win any of their final six pre-season friendlies and have struggled for goals without Isak. He missed four Premier League matches last season, and Newcastle\u2019s record was not pretty \u2014 two draws and two defeats.\n\nHowe is an astute and forward-thinking coach, however, and he will undoubtedly inject some fresh innovations into this Newcastle side.",

      "text": "1. \"Per 90\" metricsWhat it is: This is an important place to start when outlining metrics in football analytics, at a player and a team level. Using raw, total numbers for a metric can be misleading, as it does not account for the minutes played to reach that number. Context is key, and we need to find a fair way to compare performance by looking at those numbers within the context of a full game (per 90 minutes or \"per 90\").How it can be used: Since the start of the 2019-20 season, Liverpool\u2019s Sadio Mane has scored 29 goals in the Premier League, while Tammy Abraham has only scored 21 for Chelsea.This would initially point to Mane being the more clinical player in front of goal, but the added context is that Mane has played more than 2,000 minutes more than Abraham in this period. When you look at this goal output per 90, we see Abraham actually scores at a higher rate (0.58 goals per 90) than Mane (0.47 goals per 90) \u2014 which makes more sense given their different roles across the forward line.A closer look at the top goalscorers from the 2020-21 season is interesting to see on a per 90 basis. Considering only players who have played 900-plus minutes in the Premier League, the player with the highest goal rate was Tottenham Hotspur loanee Gareth Bale. While he may not have accrued as many minutes as some of his peers,\nBale\u2019s rate of more than one goal per 90 minutes is an outstanding return for the time he was on the pitch.\n2. Expected goals (xG)What it is: A lot of the football world will have at least heard of xG by now. Put simply, xG is a way to measure the likelihood of a shot becoming a goal. Not all shots are equal in their quality \u2014 one shot might be a speculative 40-yarder and another might be a two-yard tap-in. Therefore, xG measures the quality of each shot before the player shoots, taking into account many factors, including:\n- The shot angle\n- The distance from goal\n- Whether it was with the head, or with the weaker/stronger foot\n- Whether it was from a cross, through ball, short pass etc\n- Whether there were multiple defenders in the way\n3. Expected goals on target (xGOT)What it is: Building on xG, we can dig deeper into the likelihood of a shot becoming a goal. Whereas xG provides a value of the shot before the player shoots, expected goals on target (xGOT) provides a modified value of an on-target shot after the player shoots. The value presented is the same \u2014 a number between zero (no chance of a goal) and one (a certain goal). But it adds further context by crediting the shots that head towards the top corner vs those that are straight down the middle of the goal. As you would imagine, this xGOT model only calculates a value for shots that are on target, so relies on the player to at least work the keeper to be registered \u2014 of course, if the shot is off-target your chance of scoring a goal is zero (barring an unlikely deflection). Let\u2019s take this example below from Harry Kane last season. Before he takes the shot outside the area, his xG is 0.03 \u2014 a low-value chance that would be expected to be a goal only three times out of 100. However, the quality of the strike from Kane is outstanding, as it flies into the top corner. Having taken the shot, the xGOT value of this chance now jumps up to 0.54, meaning that the location of that strike would lead to a goal 54 per cent of the time. A high-quality finish indeed.How it can be used: The main thing xGOT provides is a clearer idea of a player\u2019s shot execution. If a player has an xGOT value that is consistently higher than their xG, this tells us that they are shooting at a better rate than the quality of the chances they are getting.It is worth noting that such figures do only include shots that hit the target, which unfortunately excludes blocked shots. Therefore, there may be some players who can count themselves unlucky that they executed the perfect shot but the defender simply got in the way.We can then use Opta's metric of \"shooting goals added\" which calculates the difference between a player's xG and xGOT. Below, you can see that Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Son Heung-min added the most value to his shots last season, by improving his chances of scoring by 3.8 goals from the placement of those shots.\nAt the other end of the scale, it was Leicester City's Jamie Vardy with the biggest discrepancy between the chances he found himself in vs his execution of those chances, underperforming by 3.4 goals owing to poor technique in placing his on-target efforts on goal. Likewise, we can look at xGOT as a good way to measure goalkeeper performance. This provides a more accurate reflection of performance as it shows how many goals a goalkeeper is expected to have conceded based on the quality of the shots on target they have faced. We can then use this to measure the number of \u201cgoals prevented\u201d \u2014 this compares how many goals a goalkeeper actually conceded against the number they were expected to. The higher the goals prevented number, the better the shot-stopping performance. Last season, the best shot-stopping performance was from Hugo Lloris at Tottenham Hotspur, who kept out 5.1 goals above expectation across the season.\n4. Non-penalty goalsWhat it is: This metric requires little explanation, but it is important to consider why goalscoring tallies are often assessed by removing penalty goals from the total. Penalties themselves are not a great indicator of a player\u2019s ability to generate chances for themselves. Of course, you can have a player who both wins and takes penalties, but often the penalty taker is handed the ball even if they were not involved in the play leading up to the foul. Changes to handball rules, and the microscopic scrutiny from the introduction of VAR also means that the number of penalties awarded was at an all-time high last season with 125 spot-kicks in total \u2014 an average of one penalty every three games.How it can be used: Penalty takers can inflate their numbers quite significantly from what is ultimately an unsustainable source of goalscoring income. Looking at last season\u2019s top goalscorers in the Premier League, Manchester United\u2019s Fernandes and Leicester City\u2019s Vardy both doubled their goal tally from the spot and would be far from the top 10 goalscorers without such high-value opportunities to score (approximately 0.75 xG for those interested).Given this, it is a little more reliable to assess goalscoring opportunities in open play by looking at non-penalty goals or non-penalty xG \u2014 where you provide more of a level playing field to explore a team or player\u2019s opportunity to score.\n5. Expected assists (xA)What it is: Assists themselves can be a very poor indication of a player\u2019s creative ability. One player could play a simple two-yard pass for their team-mate to put one in the top corner, while another could run the length of the field and put it on a plate for their team-mate to score. Hardly comparable. Also, to register an assist, the passer is reliant on the receiver to finish the chance \u2014 which does not always happen.Therefore, another extension of the expected goals framework is expected assists (xA). It works in much the same way as xG, but works back slightly in giving credit to the player who passed the ball before the shot was taken.Put simply, xA measures the expected goals value of the shot that is assisted, and is also presented as a number between zero (no chance of an assist) and one (a certain assist). How it can be used: xA can provide credit to those creative players and gives a clearer idea of how many assists a player should have, given the quality of their attacking output. We can similarly add up all of the values to explore whether a player is creating highly valuable chances or playing it a little more safe in their passing.\nLooking at last season, it is no surprise to see Manchester City talisman Kevin De Bruyne lead the way for the most creative player. Given that the Belgian missed a fair share of games through injury, looking on a \"per 90\" basis once again highlights his quality when he is in the team \u2014 providing passes worthy of an assist at a rate of more than one every three games (0.37 xA per 90). Of course, just as penalties can inflate a player's goal output, being a set-piece taker (i.e. corners or free-kicks) can also inflate a player's creative output, given that they have a greater opportunity to deliver the ball, unopposed, into a dangerous area with more players to attack the ball. Therefore, it is worth looking at last season's xA among all players in open play, which shows a slightly different configuration. Here, Fernandes just about claims top spot ahead of De Bruyne, while players like Callum Hudson-Odoi and Allan Saint-Maximin show their creative quality to find team-mates in dangerous positions with their passing in open play.\n6. Passes per defensive action (PPDA)What it is: Passes per defensive action (PPDA) is a proxy of pressing intensity at the team level, used to try and capture the degree to which an opponent is pressuring the opposition when they don\u2019t have the ball.\nPut simply, this metric counts how many passes a team allows the opposition to make before attempting to win the ball back with a defensive action, such as a tackle, interception, or clearance. Importantly, this metric applies only to a certain area of the pitch \u2014 the final 60 per cent of the pitch to be precise \u2014 roughly in line with the edge of the centre circle in your own half. A low PPDA number indicates higher intensity when trying to win the ball back and a higher figure indicates a team that is more passive without the ball. As you can see below, Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds were unsurprisingly the most intense off the ball with an average PPDA of 9.3 last season, while Newcastle United were nearly half as intense in their pressing with a PPDA of 18.3 as they preferred to drop back into shape when losing possession. How it can be used: Just as above, PPDA can give an indication of a team\u2019s intent to win the ball back. It can show which teams are more active in trying to regain possession when they lose it. Importantly, PPDA doesn\u2019t give us any indication of the success of that strategy \u2014 it is more indicative of a team\u2019s style in winning the ball back. As teams such as Liverpool and Manchester City have shown in recent years, pressing is most effective when the team acts in unison and knows when to pounce. Which can bring us nicely onto our next term\u2026\n7. PressuresWhat it is: This metric is a little more \"what is says on the tin\", but it\u2019s important to know why it is useful. Here, we turn to StatsBomb who provide this data, and define pressures as the \u201cnumber of times applying pressure to the opposing player who is receiving, carrying or releasing the ball\u201d. This can be studied at player or team level to show the intent in pressing the ball, rather than simply the outcome of making a tackle or block. The higher the number of pressures, the more the player or team attempted to engage with the opponent on the ball. Be careful here though, as more pressures may not mean a higher intensity per se, but might just mean that the team had less possession of the ball. We can account for this by adjusting the metric for the amount of possession \u2014 something we will come onto below.How it can be used: Using this information, we can consider how often that pressure was successful \u2014 i.e. the quality of the press that leads to a turnover of possession. StatsBomb pressure data via fbref provides this with \u201csuccessful pressure percentage\u201d, defined as the percentage of time that a team gained possession within five seconds of applying the pressure.As you can see below, champions Manchester City were the most co-ordinated in their press, regaining possession 32 per cent of the time when making their pressures. Meanwhile, Newcastle United remained rooted to the bottom of the table once again, alongside relegation sufferers Sheffield United with a pressure success of 25 per cent.\nUnfortunately, there is not a silver bullet metric for measuring pressing among teams, but using the PPDA metric alongside this pressure data can be useful to build a picture of a team's style to win the ball back and understand how successful they are when they do look to regain possession.\n8. Possession-adjusted metricsWhat it is: When considering defensive metrics (e.g. tackles, blocks, interceptions), a player\u2019s ability is not represented reliably by the raw numbers. A busy defender isn\u2019t always a good one, and many defensive metrics most often represent a team or player\u2019s style rather than their quality.One way we can help to overcome this issue is to adjust these defensive metrics based on the amount of possession a team has. Why do we do this? Essentially, a player can only perform a defensive action when their team does not have the ball. If a team has less possession of the ball, they have more opportunities to defend. Therefore, it is difficult to reliably compare the defensive contribution between, for example, Manchester City vs Newcastle United based on the raw frequency of defensive actions (e.g. blocks per 90 minutes).What we can do is adjust these defensive statistics for the number of times that they make these actions for every 1,000 opponent touches \u2014 which allows us to assess all players on more of a level playing field.How it can be used: Let\u2019s run through an example. Manchester City full-back Joao Canceloaverages 2.4 interceptions per 90, which was enough to rank him 16th among all defenders in the Premier League last season. When adjusting for possession, he jumps to 4.2 interceptions per 1,000 opponent touches, which ranks him 9th among the group of defenders. This accounts for the fact that Manchester City were so dominant in possession, so gives more credit to Cancelo\u2019s actions when City don\u2019t have the ball.This is definitely one to look out for when you next see a players\u2019 defensive statistics \u2014 more actions does not necessarily mean a better defender.\n9. Field tiltWhat it is: Field tilt is a simple way of showing the territorial dominance between teams. Put simply, it measures the share of possession a team has in a game, considering only touches or passes in the attacking third.So, if Team A makes a total of 80 final-third passes, and Team B attempts just 20 final-third passes, Team A has a field tilt of 80 per cent. The better attacking teams usually dominate this metric because they have more of the ball in attacking areas. As you can see below, Manchester City and Liverpool, in particular, were suffocating teams by keeping possession in the attacking third last season.How it can be used: Field tilt is useful in revealing which side is more dominant in matches. Rather than simply looking at the average possession statistics, field tilt provides a clearer picture of where that possession is. It\u2019s not always about simply keeping the ball, it\u2019s about getting into the areas that matter.Likewise, it can be an interesting way to explore the change in a team\u2019s dominance in the final third, over time. For example, in the 2019-20 season, Aston Villa had a field tilt of 41 per cent, meaning the opposition had more passes in their final third than Villa did in the opponent\u2019s final third. It also ranked Villa as 18th in the Premier League for such territorial dominance that season.In contrast, Villa had a field tilt of 50 per cent in the 2020-21 season which was the ninth-best in the league. They were having a larger share of the play in the opposition's final third than they did in the previous season, getting the ball into greater areas of threat for longer.In isolation, field tilt metrics may not provide too much insight towards a team\u2019s success, but it does give an indication of their style in getting the ball into advanced areas compared with the opposition.\n10. Game stateWhat it is: Another straightforward term, but one that can provide crucial context when evaluating a team\u2019s metrics.Game state refers to whether the team is in a losing, drawing or winning position when they are performing certain actions. This is important to consider, as it can heavily influence a team\u2019s approach during the game. A team that is losing is more likely to chase the game by taking more shots and creating more chances. By contrast, a team that is winning might be more likely to defend a lead and subsequently create fewer chances because of the game state they find themselves in.How it can be used: As outlined above, the main use of this is to provide further context as to why a team may have certain performance metrics. For example, Tottenham Hotspur didn\u2019t attempt a single shot in the second half at home to Arsenal last season. Instantly, this suggests weak attacking play from Spurs, but they had built a 2-0 lead before half-time. Therefore, the game state meant Spurs were in a winning position, so their low attacking output was contextualised by them protecting their lead.\nLooking at the game state across the season for each team, we can see that Spurs actually spent a long time in a winning position compared with others in the league, something which is likely to have fuelled the frustration towards the recently-departed Jose Mourinho, as Spurs often retreated after taking the lead. Meanwhile, many may point to champions Manchester City having the lowest goals scored in a season since Pep Guardiola arrived (83 goals), but the added context is that they spent more than half their time in the lead \u2014 more than any other team in the league \u2014 and were not obliged to score any additional goals to pick up three points. Game state can determine the tactical approach taken by a team, and provides useful context when assessing both attacking and defensive metrics at the player or team level.\n11. Sequences and possessionsWhat it is:\nThis could be a whole article on its own, but the principle of sequences and possessions is very simple. A sequence starts with a player making a controlled action on the ball \u2014 i.e. making a pass is controlled but making a tackle is not controlled. Opta defines a sequence as a \"passage of play which belongs to one team and are ended by defensive actions, stoppages in play or a shot\". For example, if a team makes 15 passes and works it forward before the opposition defender clears it out for a throw-in, that would be one sequence. When the player throws it back in to a team-mate, that starts a second sequence but importantly, the team still has possession of the ball. Therefore, possessions are the combination of one or more sequences in a row belonging to the same team. That possession continues until the opposition wins the ball back by making a controlled action on the ball themselves \u2014 thus starting their own sequence of play. Think of it like a chain \u2014 the sequences are the individual links which join together to make the overall chain (i.e. possession). How it can be used: These metrics help us to build a wider picture of a team or player, beyond simple event metrics (i.e. a pass). It can help to show the style of a team in how many passes they tend to have within a sequence \u2014 i.e. Manchester City tend to have more passes within a sequence of play than Burnley do. By looking at the number of possessions between the teams, we can understand the style and tempo of games. Essentially, we can look at how many times the ball changed hands between the teams during the game (i.e. Team A has it until Team B has it, which continues until Team A wins it back, etc). This can help show the approach taken in games, with more possessions indicative of a higher tempo and a more frenetic game. There are many more avenues to take this information, but it highlights the value of adding further context to understand what is occurring on the pitch based on individual events.\n(Design: Sam Richardson)"

      "text": "This is part of a series from The Athletic breaking down the tactical approach of Premier League teams for the 2025-26 season. Read about other clubs below:\nBurnley\u2019s last campaign as a promoted club in 2023-24 was a chastening lesson in life at the top and one that has drastically reshaped their tactical approach this time around.\nUnder Vincent Kompany \u2014 now at Bayern Munich \u2014 they stormed to promotion playing a daring, swashbuckling brand of football, setting a Championship record with an average of 64 per cent possession. But the adventurous ball-dominant approach that thrived in the second tier was brutally exposed and cut down by superior Premier League opposition.\nSuddenly, loose touches were ruthlessly pounced upon, while stray passes triggered rapid, clinical counter-attacks. Imposing their style became impossible as they were relegated back down to the Championship with a paltry 24 points.\nIn came former Bournemouth and Fulham manager Scott Parker, bringing with him a healthy dose of pragmatism. Under his guidance, Burnley returned to the Premier League at the first time of asking, but this time their promotion was built firmly on defence-first foundations.\nThey shipped just 16 goals across the course of the season, an astonishing feat even if it did come at the expense of entertainment. Josh Brownhill\u2019s joke that they \u201cbored their way to the Premier League\u201d contained more than a kernel of truth as they played out 12 goalless draws.\nTo survive this season, Burnley are massively up against it again. They remain dauntingly out-resourced in terms of playing talent, but the hope is that their more attritional tactics will prove more robust at a higher level, where they expect to spend the majority of matches without the ball.\nBut Parker hasn\u2019t simply reverted to the direct, rugged, no-nonsense football Burnley were known for under Sean Dyche to shore up their defence. Stylistically, many of the tactical principles set out by Kompany remain, albeit employed with more caution.\nShort, considered build-up from the back is still a cornerstone of their play. As the graph below shows, Burnley\u2019s direct speed \u2014 how quickly they move the ball upfield \u2014 and passes per sequence have only shifted slightly last season compared to their previous promotion campaign.\nStructurally too, their in-possession formation mirrors Kompany\u2019s, lining up with the same 4-2-3-1 that morphs into a 4-3-3 in more advanced areas. But while formations and ball circulation appear similar, dig beneath the surface and the difference in approach is stark.\nFor Kompany, formations were more of a loose framework than fixed positional rules. Players were encouraged to rotate fluidly, making Burnley\u2019s attacks unpredictable and potent. Under Parker, formations are far more literal, with his side rigidly adhering to the areas and responsibilities tied to their positions.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2022-23, 13 of the 15 outfield players registered 10 or more shots on goal, a reflection of the freewheeling rotation in attack. Last season, only six players reached that mark. Player roles are now much simpler: defenders defend, attackers attack.\nThe intent behind their possession-based approach also differs in subtle ways. Now it leans towards caution, with players preferring to retain the ball through a safe pass rather than risk losing it in a dangerous area.\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke summed it up after a drab 0-0 draw in January: \u201cThey take pretty little risk with the ball, so if they lose it, it\u2019s only in areas where they can\u2019t be hurt on the counter-attack\u2026 you have to prepare to create a chance, more or less, against a compact block.\u201d\nThe data backs this up. In their 2022-23 Championship campaign, Burnley conceded an average of 13.2 counter-attacks per game; last season, that figure dropped to 10.7. In a Premier League increasingly defined by transitions \u2014 a record number of goals were scored on the break last season \u2014 it\u2019s prudent to play cautiously and maintain a steady shape in possession to limit those potent opportunities.\nBut given their record-breaking defensive efforts, it\u2019s off the ball where Burnley really came to the fore last season. It\u2019s first worth noting that while Burnley were undoubtedly well-organised, a big part of their defensive record owed to last-ditch heroics.\nLeading the way here was James Trafford, who put in one of the greatest shot-stopping performances in Championship history. His goals prevented \u2014 the number of goals saved above expectation based on the quality of shots faced \u2014 finished at an extraordinary +12.7 for the season. Ahead of him, centre-back Maxime Esteve embodied the art of last-ditch defending, blocking a league-high 3.64 expected goals.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s unlikely Burnley can sustainably rely on this kind of defending, but their disciplined organisation and compact shape are qualities they can reproduce. They remained aggressive in the press last season, posting a PPDA of 11.7 \u2014 the seventh-best rate in the division \u2014 but chose their moments to engage more selectively.\nTypically, when losing the ball high up the pitch, Burnley\u2019s front line press in unison to win it back immediately, but quickly drop into a 4-2-4 mid-block if bypassed. Below is one example from their April match against Swansea, where they shift as a unit to close space and cut off passing lanes rather than aggressively chase the ball.\n\u201cI get it\u2019s not fashionable, but it\u2019s nothing short of remarkable what we\u2019ve done defensively as a group and as a team,\u201d said Parker last season. Their dogged discipline in plugging gaps and condensing the pitch should at least make them more competitive in games this season.\nBut to paint them as one-dimensionally focused on defending would be a disservice to a side that finished as the third-highest scorers last season. As first-team coach Mike Jackson \u2014 who was involved in both promotion campaigns \u2014 put it: \u201cIt might have been a bit more flamboyant the first time around, but there\u2019s still been a lot of really good stuff this year.\u201d\nParker took over a side undergoing significant transfer churn after relegation, with key players such as Sander Berge, Wilson Odobert and Zeki Amdouni among those to leave. That it took time to build attacking cohesion was understandable, but things improved towards the tail end of the season \u2014 particularly after right-winger Marcus Edwards joined on loan from Sporting CP in January \u2014 with goals per game rising from 1.3 in the first half of the campaign to 1.7 in the second.\nMuch of their business this summer has focused on making loan players like Edwards, Jaidon Anthony and Zion Flemming permanent, but the addition of Armando Broja from Chelsea is a potential boost to their attacking firepower. Their other major signing from Stamford Bridge, defensive midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu, goes some way towards offsetting the losses of Trafford and centre-back CJ Egan-Riley.\nAdvertisement\nUltimately, Burnley\u2019s squad on paper doesn\u2019t scream Premier League quality. Tactics can only do so much. Their more street-smart, defensive approach might help, but last season\u2019s success was still built on controlled possession, which will be far harder to sustain against elite opposition.\nInstead, they\u2019ll need to call upon every ounce of the grit and determination Parker has instilled in this squad.\n(Top photo: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)"

      "text": "This is part of a series from The Athletic breaking down the tactical approach of Premier League teams for the 2025-26 season. Read about other clubs below:\nAfter eight long seasons away, Sunderland\u2019s return to the top flight of English football was never going to be quiet.\nBut even by their own turbulent standards, a dramatic stoppage-time winner at home to Coventry City in the play-off semi-final, before Tommy Watson\u2019s perfectly placed finish in the 95th minute of the final, was an extraordinary way to come back up.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s been a winding road back to the Premier League for Sunderland, suffering consecutive relegations down to the third tier in the spring of 2018. It took four attempts to get out of League One, twice losing out in the play-offs, before eventually defeating Wycombe Wanderers at Wembley, shooting up to sixth in the Championship, and plummeting back down to 16th in the space of two dramatic years.\nThings were no more straightforward last season, and while Regis Le Bris\u2019 side held onto fourth for six months to coast into the promotion picture, their end-of-season form \u2014 losing all five of their remaining games, scoring just once in the process \u2014 didn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence ahead of another play-off attempt.\nBut Sunderland somehow made it. And while there are flaws to this side \u2014 they are rarely a team you can rely on to control the momentum of games\u2014 their bold approach to the transfer window this summer is cause for cautious optimism that they can scale up an expansive, counter-attacking style to pose problems in the Premier League.\nReinforced with some of Europe\u2019s most exciting young players, this is how a new-look Sunderland could face up to the challenge.\nWhile they are capable of smothering opponents with possession and passing patterns, many of Sunderland\u2019s best performances under Le Bris have come when they are able to cede the initiative, defend in a compact shape, and hit on the break.\nAs we can see from the graphic below, they were outliers in the Championship for how quickly they looked to get the ball forward last season. One in every five of their carries were considered progressive, while only Millwall recorded a higher proportion of progressive passes, pointing to a team that attempted to move the ball into dangerous areas as often as they could.\nSunderland\u2019s incisive, direct play was best showcased in the first leg of the play-off semi-final against Coventry, where Le Bris strayed from his preferred 4-3-3 to deploy both Wilson Isidor and Eliezer Mayenda as centre-forwards. With just 26.7 per cent of the ball, his team soaked up the pressure in a compact 4-4-2 mid-block, before devastatingly hitting with their two transition specialists on the break.\nAdvertisement\nIsidor and Mayenda were involved in all but one of Sunderland\u2019s nine goals from fast breaks last season, and each scored in a decisive 2-1 win at Coventry. Both goals arrived within 15 seconds of a touch in the defensive penalty area, including this slick move and emphatic finish from Isidor to win it.\nBoth forwards bring a different kind of firepower on the transition for Sunderland. Mayenda\u2019s solo effort against Bristol City in April was named as the club\u2019s goal of the season, as he took on six players and drove the length of the pitch before sweeping home at the near post. He is more of an agile, tricky dribbler who can also play out on the wing.\nIsidor, meanwhile, is more about direct, explosive movement, and he clocked up the most runs in-behind the defensive line in the Championship last season per SkillCorner.\nLike his strike partner that day, Isidor\u2019s form in front of goal can be patchy, but there have been some moments of inspiration from the Frenchman in a Sunderland shirt \u2014 an excellent turn and finish away at Leeds, an improvised volley against Oxford, and this lightning-quick run and dinked finish at Hull.\nThe speed. The finish.\nAn incredible solo goal from Wilson Isidor in the reverse fixture \u23ee\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/sjjGSgIzxe\n\u2014 Sunderland AFC (@SunderlandAFC) February 22, 2025\nWith space to attack against more front-footed Premier League sides next season, both forwards could be potent options on the counter.\nFacing a more organised defensive block, Le Bris likes his teams to target the flanks and create triangles out wide. His wingers \u2014 Patrick Roberts and occasionally Chris Rigg from the right, Romaine Mundle and stand-in Enzo Le Fee from the left \u2014 often look to cut inside onto their stronger feet, allowing full-backs to push on and the ball-side central midfielder to drift over and link up with the inverted wide player.\nThe sequence below shows just how those rotations can pull opposition defenders out of shape.\nFirst, Rigg receives the ball out wide and immediately looks to scamper inside, triggering an underlapping run from adventurous right-back Trai Hume to take a marker away.\nRigg chops back and plays the simple pass to supporting midfielder Dan Neil, who in turn moves the ball down the flank to Hume, before looking to make the forward run himself. That allows Hume to cut inside and find Rigg, who has drifted into a pocket of space, and Rigg picks out a one-two with a precise reverse pass into the box.\nIn the space of 10 seconds, the triangle takes on four different forms, with overlapping and underlapping runs crucial in creating a one-vs-one for the player on the ball.\nSimilarly, on the opposite flank against Watford below, the movement of left-back Dennis Cirkin helps to isolate Le Fee against a defender, while Neil is again on hand for the short ball.\nWith a slick turn, Le Fee is able to dart around the outside before poking the ball through to Cirkin, who has continued his run into the box.\nOn both wings, having skilful, technical wingers who can beat their man is key to Sunderland\u2019s ball progression under Le Bris \u2014 they were the team with the most take-ons attempted in the division last season, while, as we saw earlier, 20 per cent of their carries were classified as progressive, by far the highest share of any team in the league.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s why the signing of Simon Adingra makes a lot of sense, a forward-thinking winger with Premier League experience and potential to improve. As we can see from the visual below, the 23-year-old is equally comfortable \u2014 and unpredictable \u2014 on both flanks, able to cut inside, skip to the byline or drive into the box.\nChemsdine Talbi is a similarly exciting acquisition on the other side and had the most carries into the penalty area per 90 minutes in Belgian football last season.\nThe idea seems to be to ramp up the direct, quick-footed wing play, while keeping those swirling triangles intact with wide players who like to cut inside.\nAnother key strategy for Sunderland to create those wide situations was through raking crossfield passes, most effectively struck by centre-back Luke O\u2019Nien. The 30-year-old \u2014 a former central midfielder \u2014 boasts an impressive passing range, able to hammer the ball out to the flanks on either foot.\nOnly Burnley\u2019s CJ Egan-Riley completed more switches of play in the Championship, while O\u2019Nien ranked sixth for line-breaking passes according to SkillCorner, outlining his ability to move the ball effectively up the pitch.\nHere, against Leeds, we see the centre-back carry the ball through the first line of pressure and spear a pass into Roberts. The winger\u2019s first touch instantly takes him inside, and with another lung-busting supporting run from Hume, the triangle is formed, creating space for Roberts to drive towards the box and take a shot at goal.\nExpect to see O\u2019Nien (if he plays) and new signing Granit Xhaka hitting those long diagonals to wingers whenever they get the chance.\nThe attacking quality, particularly on the transition, is clear to see. But the big question upon Sunderland\u2019s return to the Premier League is whether they can make the step up without the ball.\nWith the sale of Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund for a record \u20ac38million (\u00a333m; $44m) fee, Le Bris has lost a strong box-to-box midfielder, an excellent carrier of the ball, and a strong duel winner in the centre of the pitch. In the sequence below against Norwich, for example, Bellingham crunches into a challenge on the edge of his own penalty area, before leading the counter-charge barely seconds later.\nSunderland have looked to replace his bustling presence with Habib Diarra, another ground-eating midfielder who likes to charge forward with the ball at his feet. The Senegalese international is less destructive in his defensive work than Bellingham, but looks set to thrive in a right-sided No 8 role, where he can drive forward and link up with the wide players.\nAdvertisement\nOn the opposite side of holding midfielder Xhaka, Le Fee is a sure bet to step into the other attacking midfield role, having covered for the injured Mundle out wide for much of last season. His technical quality is evident, an incisive forward passer who can split back-tracking defences with nicely weighted through balls, but Le Fee is also bursting with energy, a snappy tackler and keen interceptor who likes to go hunting for the ball.\nFrom the 4-3-3 shape outlined earlier, Sunderland should have no issues retreating into their preferred 4-4-2 shape without the ball, with Le Fee\u2019s versatility and tenacity allowing him to defend the left flank as he did for most of last season.\nOnce again, the play-off win against Coventry illustrates how Sunderland will need to work hard and maintain pressure in their defensive shape against higher-quality opposition.\nFirst, Le Fee steps out and looks to squeeze Jack Rudoni to the touchline, forcing their opponents to pass the ball across the defensive line, with the pass into midfield blocked off by the two centre-forwards. On the opposite side, Roberts applies pressure with similar intensity and ushers Coventry back.\nDefender Bobby Thomas then limbers up to play the long pass over the top, but Sunderland\u2019s back four is alert to the runs in-behind and sweeps up the eventual ball.\nLe Bris will want his team to avoid sinking too deep into their own half and inviting pressure onto their goal, and will rely on the athleticism of his new-look midfield to retain a solid, proactive shape.\nWith eight new arrivals and close to \u20ac150m (about \u00a3130m) spent, Sunderland still weren\u2019t finished in the transfer market, with a season-long loan deal for Chelsea\u2019s Marc Guiu adding to the squad. He is another strong, physically disruptive centre-forward who can add more power to Sunderland\u2019s transitional game.\nAdvertisement\nThere may look to be a lot going on, but the plan is falling into place.\nIt\u2019s clear that Sunderland have recruited to enhance their approach from their promotion season \u2014 dialling up the unpredictability and explosiveness on the wings, improving the service into runners in-behind, while injecting more energy and defensive bite into midfield.\nSunderland are looking to make sure that their clearly defined transitional style under Le Bris stands the best possible chance.\n(Top photo: Tony King/Getty Images)"

      "text": "This is the latest article in a series from The Athletic breaking down the tactical approach of Premier League teams for the 2025-26 season. Read about other clubs below:\nFew managers or head coaches in the game have a tactical philosophy as clear and consistent as Ruben Amorim\u2019s. But within his first year in charge of Manchester United, he has found putting that philosophy into practice has been anything but straightforward.\nAppointed 11 league games into last season, Amorim was unable to halt United\u2019s slide from the days of being serial champions during the post-Alex Ferguson era, as they slumped to a record-low Premier League finish of 15th, with the players unable to get to grips with his radically different approach.\nAdvertisement\nImplementing a new system on the fly, mid-season, was always going to bring its share of challenges. But now with the benefit of a full pre-season \u2014 and the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko in attacking positions this summer \u2014 could things be about to change?\nHere, The Athletic breaks down Amorim\u2019s tactical vision at United: what he\u2019s trying to build, why it hasn\u2019t clicked yet, and whether this season could mark a turning point.\nIn case you weren\u2019t paying attention last season, here\u2019s a quick refresher of the 3-4-2-1 system that Amorim is so resolutely committed to. The graphic below shows United\u2019s average shape during the build-up and creation phases under the Portuguese coach and will be instantly recognisable to their fans.\nThis structure is built on three centre-backs at the base, with wing-backs stretching the pitch laterally and vertically, dual No 10s supporting a lone striker and two midfield pivots tasked with holding it all together.\nWhether through dogmatic stubbornness or sheer conviction, no manager in the Premier League was more wedded to a single setup than Amorim last season. His United made just seven in-game formation changes, the fewest in the league. \u201cI maintain my idea: I want to play a certain way until the end,\u201d Amorim said after a 2-0 home defeat to Newcastle in December, after he\u2019d been in the job for a month.\nThe hope for United is that this consistency of style breeds familiarity, and that the patterns of play Amorim hopes to instil become second nature to the squad. After his first game in charge, a 1-1 draw at Ipswich, he said, \u201cI think my players were thinking too much.\u201d\nUnlike previous managers who leaned into United\u2019s chaotic, transition-heavy identity, Amorim has made it clear he wants to \u201ccontrol\u201d games, and believes that a stable, structured approach in possession is key to doing so.\nAdvertisement\nHe\u2019s made some progress in that regard, as shown in The Athletic\u2019s playstyle wheel below.\nUnited are among the best in Europe for circulating the ball through central areas, while only Manchester City have recorded a slower average direct speed in the Premier League since Amorim replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag.\nThis more measured approach has helped United shore things up defensively \u2014 at least statistically.\nWhile they conceded just four fewer goals than the season before, their expected goals against dropped from a massive 70.1 in 2023-24 to a more respectable, though still concerning, 55.1. Building up more slowly with three centre-backs on the pitch means that, when United are turned over, there is at least some structure between the ball and their goal.\nStill, adding an extra centre-back to the side hasn\u2019t come without drawbacks, particularly in how it has stifled ball progression. A third of United\u2019s passes last season were played by centre-backs, but many of these were passive, with the defenders often knocking the ball around among themselves.\nAt previous club Sporting CP, Amorim spoke about how \u201cthe centre-backs are the builders, more so than the central midfielders.\u201d With United often being outnumbered in midfield, he relies on his centre-backs to progress the ball through the lines and moonlight as holding midfielders as the build-up develops.\nFor much of last season, though, Amorim simply did not have that profile of defender at his disposal.\nThe graphic below shows that Leny Yoro and Lisandro Martinez are, by some distance, United\u2019s most comfortable ball-progressing centre-backs, both ranking among the Premier League\u2019s top five for line-breaking passes per 90 minutes played last season.\nBut both missed extensive periods of that season through injury \u2014 summer 2024 signing Yoro played just 1,162 minutes in the Premier League (of a possible 3,420), and Martinez only 1,754. While Martinez is still making his way back from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) suffered in February, Yoro has shone in pre-season and his availability will be crucial if United are to build threateningly from the back under Amorim.\nAdvertisement\nRegardless of personnel, three at the back caused problems for United out of possession. The two central midfielders are left to cover vast amounts of space, especially when both wing-backs push high and none of the centre-backs step up into midfield.\nThe pitch map below shows the number of passes played into different zones against United, compared to their six-season Premier League average. While the three-man defence has helped reduce the volume of passes conceded around their own penalty area \u2014 a prominent issue under Ten Hag \u2014 it has also created a soft central zone just past the halfway line.\nA memorable example came in the 1-0 defeat to Tottenham in February, when Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro played as the double pivots. With Fernandes naturally more attack-minded and Casemiro, who was about to turn 33, no longer able to cover ground as he once did, Spurs carved through the centre with ease.\nHow Amorim addresses this vulnerability and stops United from getting overrun in midfield will be a season-defining tactical conundrum.\nOther options in that area include Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo. Ugarte brings more energy and bite than Casemiro, and is prolific in breaking up play, but his limits in terms of passing range and ability to progress the ball pose a different kind of challenge. Mainoo, on the other hand, shares some of Fernandes\u2019 instincts to drift higher up the pitch.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom, though. The signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha spruce up United\u2019s attacking options no end, and both could find their strengths amplified by aspects of Amorim\u2019s system.\nHis two No 10s are given licence to drift across the pitch and exploit spaces between the lines. Those voids are created in two main ways. First, the marauding, overlapping wing-backs drag markers away with decoy runs, opening up lanes for the attacking midfielders to exploit. This should suit Cunha and Mbeumo, who are both talented ball-carriers.\nBelow is an example from United\u2019s pre-season friendly against West Ham, where left wing-back Patrick Dorgu\u2019s run pulls Aaron Wan-Bissaka deep and opens up space for Cunha to drive into.\nThe movement of the centre-forward is another important aspect that helps free up the attacking midfielders.\nRasmus Hojlund\u2019s struggles last season were well documented, and United\u2019s pass network for that campaign shows just how peripheral the Dane was in their build-up.\nNew signing Benjamin Sesko, with his superior target-man qualities, should avoid a similar fate.\nAs the plot below shows, the 6ft 4in (195cm) Slovenian is far stronger in the air than Hojlund and fellow United striker Joshua Zirkzee, and also more adept at carrying the ball through take-ons.\nFor all Hojlund\u2019s shortcomings in producing decisive contributions, he remained a willing off-ball runner for Amorim. His surging channel runs in behind were often mistimed or directed into non-threatening wide areas, but did still serve to push back opposing defences.\nSesko, meanwhile, was frequently forced deeper last season with RB Leipzig\u2019s midfield struggling to progress the ball, yet his run profile from their more successful 2023-24 campaign demonstrates a similar willingness to stretch defences.\nWith Cunha and Mbeumo offering more reliable service in behind, and a more complete striker leading the line, United should carry far more threat in the final third this season.\nTheir warm-up friendlies may have offered glimpses of greater fluidity and the excitement of new attacking signings, but the intensity of competitive Premier League football is a different beast, one where any tactical vulnerability is quickly exposed and relentlessly targeted.\nUnited fans will be hoping that the squad\u2019s summer upgrades, both in system and personnel, have helped improve what has been a spluttering setup.\n(Top photo: Getty Images)"

I have learned so much. I have grown as a footballer but also as a person.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThiaw is a long-term target for Newcastle and the player has pushed hard for a move to St James\u2019 Park.\nNewcastle\u2019s interest in the centre-back dates back to the summer of 2024, and Thiaw played for Milan against Eddie Howe\u2019s side in the opening round of Champions League group-stage games in the 2023-24 season.\nThe 24-year-old helped his side keep a clean sheet in the goalless draw at San Siro. He was out with an injury for the reverse fixture at St. James\u2019 Park.\nWhen Howe was asked about the player last summer, he replied: \u201cHe\u2019s a player I know about, of course I do, from our games in the Champions League against Milan and and he\u2019s a very good player.\u201d\nThiaw has a contract through to 2027 at Milan, who signed the central defender from Schalke in 2022.\nThe Italian side, who re-appointed Massimiliano Allegri as head coach this summer, have centre-backs Fikayo Tomori, Matteo Gabbia, Strahinja Pavlovic and Davide Bartesaghi in their current squad.\nThiaw has made 85 appearances for Milan since arriving three years ago. Last season, he featured 31 times and helped the club win the Supercoppa Italiana, although it was a disappointing domestic season for the club with an eighth-place Serie A finish and losing the Coppa Italia final to Bologna.\nAll three of Thiaw\u2019s appearances for the Germany international side came in 2023.\nNewcastle have signed Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest while goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale has joined on a season-long loan deal from Southampton.\nHowever, multiple Newcastle transfer targets including Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool), Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United), Liam Delap, Joao Pedro (both Chelsea), Dean Huijsen (Real Madrid) and James Trafford (Manchester City) have moved elsewhere, rather than Tyneside, during the current window.\nCentre-back Lloyd Kelly has been among the players to leave Eddie Howe\u2019s squad on a permanent basis as he completed his permanent transfer to Juventus.\n(Top photo: Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)"

      "text": "This is part of a series from The Athletic breaking down the tactical approach of Premier League teams for the 2025-26 season. You can also read about Arsenal\u2019s approach.\nOne of the toughest aspects of transitioning from the Championship to the Premier League is balancing the attacking approach that brought promotion with the required caution against stronger opponents.\nLast season, Leeds United won the Championship with a ball-dominant style but adapting that approach against Premier League teams who control possession, press high and are lethal on the break is harder than it sounds.\nAdvertisement\nDaniel Farke\u2019s side are not going to transform completely. \u201cWe spoke about the way we want to play, how we want to approach the season and how we are not going to change our approach,\u201d Wilfried Gnonto told The Athletic last month.\n\u201cThe level is high, but we want to be aggressive, we want to be dictating games. Hopefully, that\u2019s what is going to happen. When you play against top teams, it\u2019s not always going to be possible, but it\u2019s good to have this type of approach and mentality.\u201d\nThe 4-3-3 adopted in pre-season is a slight change from Leeds\u2019 regular 4-2-3-1, resulting in tweaks to the build-up and defensive shape, and extra physicality in midfield. Yet Farke\u2019s team haven\u2019t moved away from the attacking and defensive principles that led them back to the Premier League.\nIn the Championship, Leeds built up in a 3-1 shape, with one of the two deeper midfielders dropping into the first line to help progress the ball to the wide areas where Farke\u2019s side mainly focused their attacks.\nIn front of them, full-backs pushed forward to support the front four, who were usually in narrow positions, apart from Daniel James, who had the freedom to stick to the touchline to exploit his one-v-one abilities (below).\nThe narrow front three behind Joel Piroe or Mateo Joseph allowed Leeds to attack multiple vertical channels, with the full-backs, Jayden Bogle and Junior Firpo, who has since left, supporting them, as seen in the below example from October\u2019s 2-0 victory against Sheffield United.\nFirpo and Bogle often occupied the width as the wingers roamed inside, but Leeds\u2019 approach was flexible, allowing the full-backs to interchange positions with the narrow forwards.\nWhen they operated more centrally, Brenden Aaronson, Manor Solomon and James helped knit together passing combinations in the final third.\nIn this example, in the 2-0 win at Stoke City in December, Aaronson, Solomon and left-back Sam Byram are overloading the opponent\u2019s right centre-back and wing-back.\nSolomon\u2019s movement prevents Ben Wilmot from tracking Aaronson as Joe Rothwell finds the United States forward between the lines.\nAaronson then immediately puts Piroe through on goal, before the centre-forward tries to round the goalkeeper and strikes the ball into the back of the net.\nIn another example, from the 1-0 victory against Derby County three days later, Solomon attracts the opposing centre-back as Aaronson dashes forward when Byram plays the ball to Leeds\u2019 left-winger.\nAaronson then continues his movement to attack the space between the centre-backs, while Solomon\u2019s pass to Piroe grabs their attention.\nLeeds\u2019 centre-forward then threads the ball through the defence\u2026\n\u2026 to find the third-man run of Aaronson, who slots the ball into the bottom corner to score the winner.\nPiroe\u2019s link-up play is instrumental to Leeds\u2019 attacking combinations. The Dutch forward regularly drops into midfield to aid these moves, either by dragging centre-backs out of position or linking the play.\nThe heatmap of the open-play passes he received in the Championship last season shows an inclination to roam towards the right side of the pitch.\nTowards that side, James\u2019 inside dribbles and his team-mates\u2019 off-ball movement are the initiating moves that allow Leeds to combine and play through the opponent, as illustrated in Piroe\u2019s offside \u2018goal\u2019 against Millwall in March.\nEven if Piroe isn\u2019t central to the move, Leeds\u2019 right-sided combinations were an essential part of their attack in 2024-25. Starting as an attacking midfielder, Aaronson would roam to the right to help Bogle and James, who smartly positioned themselves to enable these combinations.\nTheir first-minute goal in the 2-0 win against Norwich City in January is an example of Leeds\u2019 right flank operating fluently.\nThe dynamics of Leeds\u2019 attack are interlinked. The narrow positioning of the wingers plays an important role in attacking the wide areas while placing them in threatening positions to attack the crosses.\nIn this example, from the 1-0 win against Oxford United in April, it\u2019s the usual approach from Farke\u2019s side with a 3-1 build-up shape, narrow forwards and Bogle in an advanced position.\nAs Joe Rodon searches for a passing option, Piroe drops deeper\u2026\n\u2026 and Gnonto\u2019s similar action means that Oxford\u2019s left-back and centre-back are stretched and dragged out of position. Meanwhile, Bogle complements that with a run behind the defence, which is found by Rodon.\nThe right-back then plays the ball across goal, and Solomon\u2019s initial narrow position makes him a goalscoring option at the back post.\nAnother feature of Leeds\u2019 attack is their focus on crosses towards the back post, which is helped by the narrow positioning of the forwards \u2014 such as in the above example \u2014 or the full-backs\u2019 dashes into the half-space when the wingers stay wide.\nLast season, Leeds scored 15 goals from crosses towards the back post, which was the second-most in the Championship after Coventry City (16). Meanwhile, an accumulated 13.1 expected goals (xG) \u2014 which was the highest in the division \u2014 from 39 chances shows that they were creating high-quality opportunities from these situations.\nThe profiles of Leeds\u2019 wingers and Aaronson suit the Premier League\u2019s transitional nature, as their pace and one-v-one ability make them threatening in these situations. Additionally, Leeds are expected to have less possession this season, which adds to the importance of their transitional threat once they win the ball.\nAdvertisement\nThe data illustrates their focus on getting it forward. \u2018Direct attacks\u2019 are defined as possessions that start in a team\u2019s own half and result in a shot or a touch inside the opposition penalty area within 15 seconds \u2014 in other words, a counter-attack.\nLeeds\u2019 rate of 2.8 direct attacks per 90 minutes in the Championship last season was level with Middlesbrough as the joint third-highest in the league, behind Sunderland (3.3) and Watford (3.1).\nPlenty of these attacking transitions originated from the midfield\u2019s ability to win possession and play the ball forward. Rothwell, Ethan Ampadu, Ilia Gruev and Ao Tanaka protected the space in front of the back four and consistently broke the opponent\u2019s attacks.\nThe deeper midfield duo had another role that helped Leeds\u2019 defence. One of the centre midfielders would drop to defend the area between the full-back and centre-backs, keeping the rest of the defensive line compact, while his partner protected the area in front of them.\nTanaka\u2019s out-of-possession role in midfield was instrumental in Leeds\u2019 promotion. Last season, his 4.8 \u2018true\u2019 interceptions \u2014 denoting interceptions plus blocked passes \u2014 per 1,000 opponent touches was the fourth-highest in the Championship among all defensive and central midfielders who played at least 900 minutes.\nThe Japan midfielder is adept at sweeping up the ball in midfield, whether counter-pressing to regain possession after Leeds lose it or hoovering up loose balls in that area. His rate of 11.1 ball recoveries per 1,000 opponent touches was the fifth-highest in the same pool of midfielders.\nDefensively, Leeds conceded the second-fewest goals (30) in the 2024-25 Championship after Burnley\u2019s extraordinary total of 16. However, they conceded the lowest non-penalty xG per game in the division (0.6).\nConsidering the amount of time they will be defending in the Premier League, building on that defensive solidity will be important. Improving their set pieces could be crucial, too.\nAcross the last two Premier League seasons, all six promoted teams have been relegated. Leeds\u2019 mission is to buck that trend.\n(Top photo: Scott Heppell/PA Images via Getty Images)"

      "text": "In Newcastle United\u2019s two full seasons under Eddie Howe, the team\u2019s No 6 had a defined role in how the side attacked. It was a position mainly occupied by Bruno Guimaraes, with the Brazilian\u2019s profile suiting the team\u2019s on-ball demands.\nGuimaraes\u2019 ability to carry the ball forward without losing it, even when under pressure, has been key in helping Newcastle maintain possession. His passing ability enables the side to progress the ball down the wing or switch play to the other flank. And, when playing as a holding midfielder, he supports the team\u2019s right wing by consistently finding runners behind the defence.\nBut teams \u2014 and managers \u2014 evolve. This season, Howe has tweaked his midfield setup and has recently started playing Sandro Tonali as the team\u2019s No 6, something that has coincided with a distinct upturn in form.\nSince the beginning of the season, Newcastle\u2019s No 6 \u2014 whether it\u2019s Guimaraes or Tonali \u2014 has had more freedom to attack the central space, but only when there is a team-mate in a position to cover.\nIn the 1-0 defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion in October, Guimaraes played as the holding midfielder with Tonali and Joelinton flanking him.\nIn this attack, Newcastle progress the ball down the left wing through Joelinton\u2026\n\u2026 and by the time it reaches Anthony Gordon, Guimaraes and Tonali have moved up the pitch.\nWhen Gordon drops deeper, Guimaraes spots the space between the lines and attacks it. Gordon then combines with Tonali to find Guimaraes behind Brighton\u2019s midfield\u2026\n\u2026 and the latter puts Alexander Isak in front of the goal, but the centre-forward fails to score.\nAt the start of the attack, Guimaraes was Newcastle\u2019s deepest midfielder, but with space to move into and Tonali in position to cover, the Brazilian surged forward.\n\u201cFreedom within a structure is always the optimum for me. You can give players too much freedom and it becomes a mess,\u201d said Howe after the 4-0 victory against Ipswich Town this month. \u201cWe have always worked really hard on freedom within a structure.\u201d\nIn another example, from the surprise 2-0 defeat against West Ham United in November, Guimaraes is the deepest midfielder when Lloyd Kelly plays the ball to the dropping Isak.\nIsak\u2019s involvement drags Jean-Clair Todibo up the pitch, and with Tomas Soucek focusing on Joelinton, there are spaces to attack in West Ham\u2019s lines. Lewis Hall spots that and moves forward as Isak plays the ball back to Joelinton.\nWith Joelinton in a position to cover, Guimaraes attacks the space in midfield as Hall moves into the gap in the defensive line.\nJoelinton finds Guimaraes\u2019 run between the lines\u2026\n\u2026 and the Brazilian plays it into the path of Hall, but the move doesn\u2019t lead to any significant danger.\nIt\u2019s not all misses and half chances, however. This move has led to several goals. Newcastle\u2019s penalty, from which they equalised against Manchester City in September, originated from Guimaraes\u2019 forward runs in midfield.\nHere, Joelinton drops to receive the ball from Dan Burn\u2026\n\u2026 and Guimaraes attacks the space between Rico Lewis and Ilkay Gundogan.\nJoelinton\u2019s position provides cover for Guimaraes in case Newcastle lose possession, and the Brazilian finds his compatriot, who receives the ball with his left foot and dribbles forward with his right\u2026\n\u2026 before playing the through ball that enables Gordon to win the penalty.\nBut since the 2-0 victory against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup, Tonali has played as the No 6 in every game he has started, with Guimaraes moving to a higher position in the midfield three.\n\u201cThe plan is Sandro (Tonali) plays a little bit deeper than (Joe) Willock and Bruno (Guimaraes), but they are still given a freedom to express themselves and to move,\u201d Newcastle\u2019s head coach told BBC\u2019s Match of the Day after the 4-0 victory against Ipswich last Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s just getting that balance right between the freedom and making sure the structure is right.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIn that game, it was Tonali\u2019s clever advancement in midfield that helped progress the ball up the pitch, leading to Newcastle\u2019s second goal.\nIn this example, Sam Morsy is keeping an eye on Willock while Jens Cajuste is marking Guimaraes. Tonali starts deep\u2026\n\u2026 but when Guimaraes drops to receive the ball from Tino Livramento, he moves forward into the space in midfield.\nTonali\u2019s movement puts him in a position to attack the space between the lines when Guimaraes drags Cajuste higher up the pitch, and the Brazil midfielder finds him\u2026\n\u2026 before Tonali carries the ball into space and starts the attack that leads to Jacob Murphy\u2019s goal.\nIn the following game, the 3-0 victory against Aston Villa on Boxing Day, the advantages that come from freeing the No 6 in attack were on show again.\nAfter Newcastle switch the play towards their right side, Guimaraes and Tonali are in their expected positions in midfield. Kieran Trippier plays the ball back to Guimaraes, and because Amadou Onana is close to the midfielder\u2026\n\u2026 Tonali spots the gap in Villa\u2019s lines and accelerates from behind Ollie Watkins. Tonali\u2019s decision is also supported by Guimaraes being in a position to cover for him in case the ball is lost.\nGuimaraes finds the Italy midfielder between the lines\u2026\n\u2026 and Tonali\u2019s movement forces Watkins to drop deeper, vacating the space in front of Villa\u2019s midfield.\nAs Tonali plays the ball to Trippier, Guimaraes drops into that space, with Onana maintaining his position to defend his zone and Watkins being dragged away by Tonali.\nThis means Guimaraes has time and space when he receives the ball from Trippier\u2026\n\u2026 which helps him find Murphy\u2019s run behind the defence.\nMurphy then plays the ball across the goal, and Isak scores to make it 2-0.\nThe profiles of Guimaraes and Tonali mean that they can both play as a No 6 or a No 8, which aids the theory behind introducing more freedom in Newcastle\u2019s midfield. Since they can play in both positions, spur-of-the-moment interchanges won\u2019t weaken the team\u2019s structure or put one of Newcastle\u2019s players in a position they are uncomfortable in.\nBy allowing his holding midfielder more freedom to attack the central space, Howe has added solutions that play to the strengths of his best players \u2014 and Newcastle\u2019s improved form is proof that it\u2019s working."

      "text": "A first domestic trophy in 70 years and a spot in the Champions League for 2025-26 are wrapped up but, obviously, the prize truly craved at Newcastle United is The Athletic\u2019s player-of-the-season award.\nAnthony Gordon ran away with the accolade across 2023-24, but there are many candidates for it a year on.\nChris Waugh and George Caulkin debate the merits of five contenders from a historic season (and reach differing verdicts)\u2026\nAlexander Isak\nWaugh: Last season, Isak scored 25 goals, yet Gordon (rightly) pipped him. This time around, Isak scored 27 times, including 23 in the top flight, making him the first to reach 20 or more goals for Newcastle in successive Premier League campaigns. It\u2019s been a strange season for him \u2014 he only scored once in the league before October 27 and his form dipped again after the Carabao Cup final win in March \u2014 yet those numbers still warrant recognition.\nAdvertisement\nCaulkin: In any other year, Isak would probably be a no-brainer selection \u2014 but this has not been just any other campaign. Isak has not necessarily been brilliant every week, but he was phenomenal during that club-record-equalling nine-game winning run across December and January.\nWaugh: He\u2019s a pleasure to watch as well. When Isak has been on it, he has been borderline unplayable. Arsenal\u2019s William Saliba and Liverpool\u2019s Virgil van Dijk will still be having nightmares about facing him.\nCaulkin: Without question, Newcastle have one of the best strikers in the world \u2014 and that\u2019s a great thing to be able to say.\nJacob Murphy\nWaugh: Isak can score all types of goals, but he has largely relied upon deliveries from a team-mate who has risen from ridicule to remarkable. One of our editors cleverly headlined a piece about their unique understanding as \u201cprovide and conquer\u201d. Murphy supplied seven assists for Isak, which was the most goals somebody laid on for any individual team-mate in this season\u2019s Premier League.\nCaulkin: You identify stories of the season and Murphy is one of many, which is why this is such a great conversation. I\u2019m so pleased Murphy is getting the recognition he deserves. He has been underappreciated and underrated. We always talk about the combination between Alan Shearer and Nolberto Solano, now Isak and Murphy have created their own history.\nWaugh: Only Mohamed Salah provided more Premier League assists than Murphy\u2019s 12. Only Salah and Isak had more goal involvements from December 1 than Murphy\u2019s 18. This was the season of Murphy\u2019s life. If you\u2019d told me three years ago he would be capable of these figures, I would have laughed at you. He has proven everyone wrong.\nCaulkin: He had some really difficult moments and he has risen to all those challenges. Like Dan Burn, his career has been a slow burn but after winning at Wembley, they have automatically become legends and proved they\u2019re more than good enough.\nWaugh: Murphy must also be a serious goal-of-the-season contender for that wonderstrike against Crystal Palace in April. If one moment encapsulates how hot he has been in 2025, that\u2019s it.\nLewis Hall\nWaugh: Football is fickle and we risk applying recency bias. Going back to \u2018stories of the season\u2019, until March, Hall would have been that. He is definitely the club\u2019s most-improved player, year on year. Last season, he dropped to fourth-choice left-back behind a centre-half and two right-backs, while he was hooked at half-time in three of his first four starts. Fast-forward a year and he revolutionised that left-back role (before Tino Livramento\u2019s excellent form), making himself integral.\nAdvertisement\nCaulkin: It\u2019s felt like a journey for him, and he\u2019s still such a young lad (Hall turns 21 in September). The coaching and recruitment staff had seen something in him, but for much of last season, it felt like a forlorn jump. He looked like a boy lost. But the coaching staff and, more importantly, Hall deserve great credit for sticking at it, coming through those tough moments and then standing out by a mile for much of the season.\nWaugh: In pre-season, the theory was that Hall would compete with Lloyd Kelly at left-back. By the end of the winter transfer window, Kelly had been sold to Juventus, while Hall had established himself as the undisputed first-choice left-back and started 22 consecutive league games before injuring his foot in late February. Given what has happened since, it\u2019s easy to forget that when Hall was sidelined and then Gordon got himself suspended, that had a massively deflating effect pre-final because of how important Newcastle\u2019s left-sided duo had been.\nCaulkin: Had Hall stayed fit, he may well have won this.\nDan Burn\nWaugh: So we come to the player who is definitely among the stories of the season, who scored the all-important opener at Wembley and who has probably been the most consistent across the campaign, starting all bar one of Newcastle\u2019s league matches. Burn has been so reliable \u2014 and often excellent \u2014 something he will say is unsurprising, given that he was regularly played in his natural position as a centre-half, rather than at left-back.\nCaulkin: He\u2019s one of the best-value signings in Newcastle\u2019s history. Last season was difficult for him, he had his struggles at left-back after he had battled to return early from a broken back. That premature comeback doesn\u2019t get recognised enough. But the cliche I use about him is: he plays every game as if it\u2019s his first or last. This season, though, has been different. He\u2019s always shown leadership but Burn personifies Howe\u2019s Newcastle in so many ways because he\u2019s fearless, takes responsibility and shows leadership. He\u2019s been phenomenal.\nAdvertisement\nWaugh: He\u2019s \u201cEngland\u2019s Dan Burn\u201d now. Thomas Tuchel summarised it perfectly when he expressed surprise that Burn had never been called up before he did it in March, given his consistency at the top level. Burn was usually among the best performers every week and was even defending well when Newcastle were labouring in the autumn.\nCaulkin: It\u2019s a beautiful story because he\u2019s one of our own and he\u2019s taken a mazy route to get where he is. Isak was probably born elite, but Burn has had to turn himself into an elite player. This really has been Burn\u2019s season.\nSandro Tonali\nWaugh: For an individual\u2019s transformative effect, nobody has had as great an impact as Tonali. He missed the start of the season as he served the final weeks of his 10-month suspension for breaking gambling rules and it then took him weeks to establish himself in the XI. Strangely, once he did, that dream midfield three on paper of Tonali, Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton just did not quite gel when the Italian was playing further forward, as a No 8. There was a period when it seemed it should be one of Tonali or Guimaraes, not both. Some idiot even wrote about that (although that article was your idea\u2026)\nCaulkin: But it really did feel like that. It was like a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces didn\u2019t fit together.\nWaugh: When Howe played Tonali deeper, in a No 6 role, against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup in October, he excelled. He then did so in the league game at Palace at the end of November and Tonali showed promising signs. The switch with Guimaraes became permanent soon afterwards and it is not coincidental that Newcastle\u2019s nine-game winning run followed \u2014 and then the team\u2019s magnificent form continued almost unbroken until the very end. Tonali makes Newcastle tick. On and off the ball, he sets the tempo.\nCaulkin: He hasn\u2019t necessarily done it for the whole season, but he\u2019s an exceptional footballer and altered the course of Newcastle\u2019s campaign. He is not an archetypal holding midfielder \u2014 he covers so much ground and starts attacks, but then he sprints forward and joins them.\nWaugh: Tonali is technically-gifted enough to produce special moments \u2014 including his non-intentional goal against Brentford \u2014 but what impresses me most is how he does the simple things brilliantly. He almost always makes the right decision, and has the skill to execute it. He\u2019s world-class and Newcastle\u2019s recruitment team deserve immense credit for identifying him and three of the other player-of-the-season nominees here.\nSo, who gets it?\nCaulkin: Well, we haven\u2019t really mentioned Guimaraes, the first Newcastle captain to lift a trophy since Bobby Moncur in 1969. So if I really had to choose, it\u2019d be Burn. I may be biased, but I also think that\u2019s justified.\nWaugh: For consistency across the season, you\u2019re right. But I\u2019m going for Tonali, just in terms of his effect from December onwards. Having a split vote feels apt, really.\n(Top photo: Burn and Tonali; Alex Dodd/CameraSport via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Which players will \u201cthe streets never forget\u201d?\nThiago?\nWe tasked our Premier League reporters with picking a five-a-side team from the club that they cover. There are some obvious picks \u2014 and some less obvious ones.\nThe rules\n- The ball is not allowed over head height\n- Slide tackles are forbidden\n- Each team must have a goalkeeper and they can\u2019t come out of the area\n- Outfield players are not allowed in the area\n- They can score from anywhere outside the area\nHere we go then. Please feel free to disagree wholeheartedly with their picks in the comments section\u2026\nArsenal\nEven though goalkeepers can\u2019t come out of their box, their ability to distribute the ball effectively in tight spaces will be of crucial importance. With that in mind, Aaron Ramsdale makes for the obvious choice between the sticks for Arsenal.\nThe first outfield name on the teamsheet has to be Bukayo Saka. He is the ideal five-a-side player: two-footed, athletic, and brilliant when operating in tight spaces. If you\u2019re going to include Saka, it\u2019s tempting to put Emile Smith Rowe alongside him \u2014 having come through the academy together, they have a fantastic understanding. Both players bring creativity, work ethic and goals. They\u2019re natural choices to storm up and down the flanks for our five-a-side team.\nAt the base, I\u2019ll go for Thomas Partey. It\u2019s tempting to include a defender like Ben White or Takehiro Tomiyasu, but Partey has ball-winning abilities as well as the ability to dribble through the most congested parts of any pitch. All those rondos during his football education in Spain will come in very handy here.\nAdvertisement\nThen the team needs a spearhead \u2014 someone who can finish chances, but also tirelessly close down the opposition. I\u2019ll go for Gabriel Martinelli \u2014 a tigerish predator who could seize on any loose ball.\nJames McNicholas\nAston Villa\nThe best five-a-side teams are fun, fluid and full of goals. It\u2019s all about outscoring the opponents and Villa have four outfield players who could cause some serious damage in this format.\nBut I\u2019m bottling it and instead of playing four forwards and a goalkeeper, I guessed this group will need Tyrone Mings somewhere along the way. So, for his blocks and speed over a short distance (plus he\u2019s a handy dribbler when he gets going) he\u2019ll sit in front of Emi Martinez. Pepe Reina would have got in if it was 2020.\nCreating all the damage with their silky skills and quick feet will be Emi Buendia and Philippe Coutinho. Who cares if they can\u2019t play together in 11-a-side? This is different. The South Americans will occupy so many opponents and it will be brilliant to watch.\nWith space, freedom and endless goalscoring opportunities, Danny Ings is my man up top as he\u2019s still a better finisher than Ollie Watkins.\nGregg Evans\nBournemouth\nIt would be difficult to look past Mark \u2018El Pulpo\u2019 Travers in goal. While ball-playing isn\u2019t one of his strengths, he should still get by \u2014 especially if his cat-like reflexes keep the team out of trouble as they did last season.\nFor a defender, Lloyd Kelly looks more comfortable on the ball than some midfielders. His athleticism means he can cover the space to man the defence on his own and his knack for coolly winning the ball by brushing opponents off is even more of an asset in this format.\nLewis Cook is the perfect player to patrol the middle of the pitch. He plays like he has eyes on the back of his head, loves a tackle and his eye for a pass is unlike any other Bournemouth player. That kind of awareness is so valuable in the confines of a five-a-side cage. Combative, creative and has an eye for a screamer too. What\u2019s not to like?\nAdvertisement\nAs the most skilful player in the team, Siriki Dembele gives the side its X factor. Stepovers, rabonas, nutmegs \u2014 he\u2019s got it all and can use any wiggle of the right analog stick to bend markers to his will. Just pure \u201cHOW HAS HE STILL GOT THE BALL?!\u201d energy.\nFinally, every team needs a marksman and Bournemouth don\u2019t have to look very far to find theirs. Left foot, right foot, long-range finishes, solo goals, tapping home lovely passing moves, Dominic Solanke can do it all. The only slight trouble is where the rest of the goals will come from.\nAhmed Shooble\nBrentford\nDavid Raya is potentially the best-suited goalkeeper in the Premier League to five-a-side football. The Spain international is quick, extremely nimble and grew up playing futsal so passing the ball under pressure and through the lines comes naturally.\nWe need to make some sacrifices to squeeze our best attacking talents into the side. Pontus Jansson or Rico Henry would have been reliable options at the back, but instead, Christian Norgaard, who normally plays in midfield, starts in defence. He attempted the most tackles and completed the fifth-highest amount of interceptions in the top-flight last season so should excel in his new role.\nChristian Eriksen is our playmaker, because this fictional tournament takes place before his contract expires, and he will combine with Ivan Toney to devastating effect. As an added bonus, Toney is unafraid to throw his weight around which will be helpful on a tight pitch and deter opposition players from being too clever with their tricks.\nThe final spot comes down to the flip of a coin between Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo. They are both agile, tricky forwards who can wriggle between tight spaces and provide a special spark. Mbeumo\u2019s work rate is superior, but Wissa is more efficient in front of goal so he gets the nod.\nJay Harris\nBrighton\nUnsurprisingly, I\u2019ll start my five-a-side team with Robert Sanchez in goal. A commanding figure who wears the badge on his sleeve. It\u2019s almost a shame he isn\u2019t allowed outside the box or to slide tackle because he would definitely volunteer himself for a last-ditch-dodgy-slide attempt to stop the opposition scoring \u2014 his sending off against Newcastle comes to mind.\nAdvertisement\nChoosing a defender is the hardest part considering the amount of talent Brighton have at the back. Difficult. But I\u2019m going for perhaps the wildcard option of Joel Veltman. He can defend like a centre-back and run with the ball like a wing-back\u2026 and he scores goals. So I reckon he\u2019s a good shout.\nNo Brighton team is complete without the intelligence of Alexis Mac Allister, he\u2019ll be the general playmaker of the team with secret weapon Moises Caicedo sitting behind the Argentinian.\nFinally, the cherry on the top of the Brighton cake, Leandro Trossard will be up front. With his swift turns and long-range shots, he will be perfect for shooting along the ground outside the D.\nDayna Richman\nChelsea\nThis was harder than I thought. For starters, I\u2019ve left out Chelsea\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper Edouard Mendy! But I went for Kepa because as this is five-a-side, the keeper will see a lot of the ball and that is probably Mendy\u2019s biggest weakness.\nThiago Silva was in to begin with and then I realised I had to find room for Reece James. He\u2019s so strong, fast and comfortable in possession, he can be in charge at the back instead.\nYou need two confident guys who are combative in the tackle close by to help out. That\u2019s where Mateo Kovacic and Mason Mount come in. They\u2019re faster than the ageing pair of Jorginho and N\u2019Golo Kante and have more of an understanding with each other than Chelsea\u2019s other attacking midfielders. Both can dribble and do fancy flicks going forward.\nKai Havertz doesn\u2019t have much competition for the striker role. But his silky touch and movement is just what you want to outwit opposition defenders.\nSimon Johnson\nCrystal Palace\nJudging by how poor I\u2019ve always been at it, five-a-side football is all about speed across short distances, skill and energy. With a dose of sound technique, close control and power thrown in.\nSo Wilfried Zaha walks into the Palace team, with Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze \u2014 both better at tracking back and contributing defensively than they once were, for all that I\u2019m already pining for Conor Gallagher in this selection \u2014 flitting around the Ivorian.\nAdvertisement\nMarc Guehi can be the defensive organiser, not least because he is so comfortable in possession.\nI could have picked any of Palace\u2019s three senior goalkeepers, but let\u2019s go with young Joe Whitworth, usually with the under-23s, not least because he has already demonstrated how comfortable he is with the ball at his feet.\nDominic Fifield\nEverton\nWord doesn\u2019t seem to have travelled much further than Goodison, but Jordan Pickford arguably had his best season yet in goal for Everton. I\u2019m backing him to shine in this five-a-side team thanks to his quick reflexes and ability to build attacks.\nIn front of him, I\u2019ll go for Yerry Mina. The Colombian is Everton\u2019s best defender when available; so commanding that he calms down everyone else around him. If only he could string a regular run of games together\u2026\nThis feels like an ideal environment for Alex Iwobi to showcase his skills. As a child, he grew up playing on the caged pitches of east London, looking to emulate his uncle Jay-Jay Okocha. His industry, quick footwork and ability to manipulate the ball in tight spaces would be invaluable here.\nUp front, I\u2019ve paired Richarlison\u2019s goalscoring instinct and grit with Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s hold-up play and ability to sniff out chances close to the area. A formidable duo, but can Everton keep hold of them this summer?\nI\u2019m confident this side would improve on Everton\u2019s 16th-place finish in the league last season. With Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole, Leighton Baines and Duncan Ferguson in the ranks, the coaching staff would field a decent team too.\nIn fact, can I pick them instead?\nPaddy Boyland\nFulham\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable in possession, you aren\u2019t getting in Marco Silva\u2019s all-conquering Fulham side \u2014 you\u2019re certainly not earning a spot in this five-man joga bonito extravaganza either.\nMarek Rodak, a pillar of Fulham\u2019s last two promotion-winning campaigns, gets the nod in goal. With his imposing frame, the Slovakian is capable of stunning reaction saves and is comfortable with the ball at his feet, not that it matters too much in this instance \u2014 all he will be doing is passing to Tosin Adarabioyo.\nThe towering centre-back carries out his defensive duties aggressively, as Silva demands of his defenders, and is capable of getting his side up the field quickly with his penchant for a marauding run \u2014 echoes of Joel Matip, perhaps.\nAdvertisement\nCaptain Tom Cairney may not be a permanent fixture in Fulham\u2019s starting line-up anymore, but his composure, passing range and devilish left foot make him a sure-fire figure in this side.\nWelsh playmaker extraordinaire Harry Wilson takes up one of the two attacking berths. Like Cairney, his left foot is a thing of beauty, making him a goal threat from pretty much anywhere, while his intelligent movement and weight of pass are bound to bamboozle opponents.\nFinally, Aleksandar Mitrovic will hopefully have the time to give Neeskens Kebano a lift to the cauldron that is this hypothetical 3G pitch. As dominant as the Serbian was last season, the ball not being allowed over head height takes away a key facet of his skill set and, while his link-up play improved significantly in Silva\u2019s first season, what \u201cMitro\u201d has in brutish brilliance, he lacks in agility and fluidity. Step forward Kebano, fresh off the back of his best season at Craven Cottage, to be the resident skillsman (not a word, but should be) of this side. Agile, pacy and direct \u2014 a nightmare for any defender hot-tailing it after a long day at the office.\nRhodri Cannon\nLeeds United\nIllan Meslier is a big, big fella and five-a-side goals were not made for him but there\u2019s no other goalkeeper you\u2019re picking at Leeds United so the gloves are his.\nWe\u2019ll have Kalvin Phillips for the defensive duties, which he can easily do on his own \u2014 assuming he has not left Elland Road by the time we kick off. Smash everyone, that sort of thing, and keep it simple.\nWe\u2019ll want Raphinha (also transfer dependent) for his tricks and the ability to embarrass people, not to mention his quality in tight spaces. And speaking of quality in tight spaces, Joe Gelhardt gets the nod with instructions to serve up goals and assists like the one against Brighton last month. Gelhardt seems like the sort of player who scores about 10 in the average game of fives, a proper street footballer.\nAnd last but not least, Mateusz Klich. Okay, we haven\u2019t seen peak Klich for a good while now but short passes and quick interplay are his strengths and like Raphinha and Gelhardt, he can also cope without acres of room to work in \u2014 a handy trait in cage football.\nPhil Hay\nLeicester\nNo head heights, so no set pieces \u2014 which means Leicester could excel at The Athletic\u2019s five-a-side.\nThe keeper would be a given for me. Kasper Schmeichel, for his shot-stopping abilities.\nIn front, I would go for athleticism and versatility, so James Justin gets the nod at the back, although Wesley Fofana and Ricardo Pereira would be good shouts as well.\nAdvertisement\nIn midfield it would have to be the guile of James Maddison \u2014 City\u2019s master of the nutmeg \u2014 teamed with the industry and power of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, and in attack the evergreen Jamie Vardy. Although he is a penalty-box striker, and he can\u2019t go inside the box in our rules, his finishing is still so cool and clever.\nRob Tanner\nLiverpool\nAlisson, who grew up playing futsal, is the goalkeeper. If he fancies a run outfield donning a slick hairstyle I\u2019m letting him. He picks himself. So does Trent Alexander-Arnold. There\u2019s no one quite like West Derby\u2019s finest.\nAnd who wouldn\u2019t want Thiago in their five-a-side team? He would be doing some ridiculous flicks and tricks melting the heads of the opposition. Luis Diaz would be doing the same. He\u2019s in the team because he likes to beat you and then go back and beat you again. He\u2019s punishing and so is Mohamed Salah, cutting in on his left and curving his shot into the corner.\nCan we have substitutions please? Because Roberto Firmino is desperate to get off the bench and do some no-look genius.\nCaoimhe O\u2019Neill\nManchester City\nYou\u2019d surely struggle to find a group of players better suited to five-a-side than Manchester City. Their players live in a rondo, and could ping it about in small spaces better than anybody. So the difficulty here became selecting the most suitable in a squad full of prime candidates.\nEderson is obvious in goal because he could easily score if he wanted to, and his passing is just about as good as anybody. In defence, you could have John Stones, Aymeric Laporte or Oleksandr Zinchenko but Rodri surely has enough defensive instincts to get by and his passing is truly top-tier.\nWith Bernardo Silva, you\u2019ve then got a wonderfully gifted technician who can move the ball in tight spaces but also beat a man, cover lots of ground and score goals. It was very tempting to pair him with Phil Foden, who\u2019s exactly the same, but what do you do about the rampaging brilliance of Kevin De Bruyne?\nAdvertisement\nAnd let\u2019s go with Erling Haaland because the idea is simply hilarious (we were also able to twist some arms at the Premier League to register him before July 1). Julian Alvarez could be a decent contender one day, as he\u2019s more of a technician and he knows where the goal is, but you\u2019ve got to go for Haaland. Imagine him banging the goals in.\nSam Lee\nManchester United\nI\u2019m writing this with the additional rule that this team is playing in a cage/enclosed pitch so you can kick the ball off the walls.\nDavid de Gea has weaknesses to his game that will thankfully be covered up with these mandates, so he gets the nod in goal here. Harry Maguire is a physical, ball-carrying centre-back who will do much of the talking for this team. You can practically hear him yell, \u201cI\u2019ve got two here!\u201d as he retreats to deal with a counter.\nLast summer, Jadon Sancho said, \u201cStreet football is about the megs and all that, so you want to violate a couple man\u201d, so he\u2019s going straight into the team. Marcus Rashford was in the top five for nutmegs in Europe in 2020-21 along with Sancho, so in he goes too.\nUp top is Cristiano Ronaldo. The directive for this team is \u201cbadding people up\u201d, as Sancho once said.\nCarl Anka\nNewcastle United\nIf Bruno Guimaraes and Allan Saint-Maximin are thrilling to watch in the 11-a-side format, imagine how exhilarating the pair of them would be on the smaller courts that shaped them as youngsters?\nGuimaraes learned his craft playing futsal, which is where he developed his trademark flick control, while Saint-Maximin honed his stepovers and flamboyant skills in the caged courts of Meudon in Paris. In truth, across the entire Premier League, Newcastle probably possess two of the players most ideally suited to five-a-side football.\nTo add end product to the beautiful and explosive build-up play, Callum Wilson, Newcastle\u2019s top-scorer, is a shoo-in up top. Then, in goal, Martin Dubravka maintains his No 1 berth, mainly because of his consistency and the paucity of alternatives. I did consider fielding Jonjo Shelvey as a makeshift goalkeeper, just so he could display some of his magnificent passing range from inside his own D, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be best pleased with that suggestion\u2026\nFor the final spot, I had to go for a defender. Kieran Trippier as captain was given serious consideration, but the head-height rule means he can\u2019t whip crosses in and acted against him, and Fabian Schar\u2019s footballing skills were close to getting him the nod. However, Big Dan Burn, who somewhat surprisingly won national futsal tournaments as a teenager, can use his enormous frame to stride up and down the pitch and lead this exciting side to Premier League five-a-side glory.\nChris Waugh\nNottingham Forest\nAnother reason to want the master of shithousery, Brice Samba, to remain at Nottingham Forest would be to have him in goal. A great shot-stopper but he would also talk the opposition into submission \u2014 or just a blind fury.\nAs a defender, let\u2019s make a Steve Cooper-style big call and leave out Joe Worrall in favour of Scott McKenna who, while not quite yet the new Des Walker, has taken over his chant. It\u2019s a long way round him and he can play.\nAdvertisement\nRyan Yates would launch you in the air, but be polite enough to pick you up and apologise. Before doing it again seconds later. More energy than a six-year-old full of cola. Cafu alongside him in midfield, just because his love for the game is so infectious. And his goal celebrations at Powerleague would be just as joyous as they were at Swansea.\nBrennan Johnson would just be the so-and-so who everyone would try to kick, but would repeatedly stick it in the top corner, regardless.\nPaul Taylor\nSouthampton\nFraser Forster would have been my first choice, given he has a tendency in certain matches (I\u2019m looking at your turf, Arsenal) where he just seems to sprawl every flailing limb successfully. Alas, he isn\u2019t here anymore so I\u2019ll go with Gavin Bazunu, whose athleticism prevails over Alex McCarthy.\nI need an all-encompassing defender capable of dealing with counters (yes, they do exist in five-a-side) and can play out under pressure. Mohammed Salisu, providing he\u2019s at his best, gets the nod.\nThis may surprise you but Oriol Romeu will anchor my midfield. He\u2019s been slowly improving his ball progression but he\u2019s not here for that. Not only is he a very nice man, who will probably pay the subs, he\u2019s more press resistant than James Ward-Prowse and when spaces on the pitch are small, he covers them excellently.\nKyle Walker-Peters, the jinky, elusive dribbler, will work alongside Romeu. Ralph Hasenhuttl has used Walker-Peters in varying midfield roles intermittently, noting his inherent ability to work between opposition lines. This may be a slightly defensive lineup on paper, but Walker-Peters was arguably Southampton\u2019s most incisive attacking outlet last season.\nThe shootaholic Adam Armstrong will lead the line. His first season at Southampton was lukewarm at best, but his shoot-on-sight style and quickened step pattern around the box \u2014 he does a little two-step shuffle if you watch closely \u2014 may work well.\nJacob Tanswell\nTottenham\nGiven goalkeepers can\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll avoid the temptation to select five outfielders. So, in goal it\u2019s Hugo Lloris who, to be fair would be extremely useful in a cage with his laser-sharp reflexes.\nMy defender would be Cristian Romero who, let\u2019s face it, would be absolutely terrifying in that kind of confined environment. Can you imagine chasing a ball into a corner with him?! No chance he would respect the \u201cunwritten rule\u201d and allow you to back out if you got there first.\nAdvertisement\nNext up would be my wildcard pick Tanguy Ndombele. Yes, he might start flagging in the second half of games but his skill and close control in tight areas would be absolutely mesmerising. Having someone who can take out opposition players from a standing start is invaluable in fives, and so I\u2019m giving a lifeline to the Spurs outcast.\nMy final two picks would be Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. Kane would be invaluable, not only because of his goals and assists, but the fact that if he wanted to he could play in pretty much every position. Even if Lloris gets injured, Kane has gone in goal for Tottenham before and you know would back himself to give it a go again.\nThen there\u2019s Son, whose two-footedness and ability to whip a ball into the corner from outside the box (no going inside the area, remember) would give this team an even greater threat.\nI\u2019ve talked myself into the idea that this team would be essentially unbeatable. Especially with Dejan Kulusevski as first reserve in case anyone\u2019s running late after work and can\u2019t make kick-off.\nCharlie Eccleshare\nWest Ham\nAlphonse Areola would have got the nod over Lukasz Fabianski had West Ham completed his signing before the deadline for this piece. Fabianski nonetheless is still a good option with reflexes one of his strengths.\nFor a five-a-side game I need a defender who will have no issues tackling opposition players to throw them off their game. Kurt Zouma is perfect for this but honourable mention to Craig Dawson who narrowly misses out.\nIn colloquial terms, I need players who have \u201ctekkers\u201d. With it being a small-sided affair Declan Rice, Said Benrahma and Jarrod Bowen complete my team. Rice has the ability to dictate the tempo, Benrahma is capable of providing assists, scoring and humiliating the opposition, while in school terms Bowen is that kid on the playground who always gets picked first for games like these.\nAdvertisement\nThere is experience, flair and leadership in my team. We are massive, now can someone give us directions for where we collect our trophy?\nRoshane Thomas\nWolves\nGiven that Wolves have an international futsal player in their ranks, the first name on the teamsheet is clear. With apologies to Conor Coady, Max Kilman is in as captain, ball-playing defender and the voice of experience when it comes to competitive, small-sided football.\nJose Sa is the clear choice in goal where, with keepers banned from leaving their penalty areas, the game will be all about shot-stopping \u2014 the area where last season\u2019s player of the year is especially adept.\nAnd then three attacking players are needed, two of whom are no-brainers.\nJoao Moutinho and Ruben Neves are top-quality performers who could pass opponents off the pitch as well as chipping in with goals, and they are on the same wavelength too.\nWhile it is tempting to add a No 9 as the attacking spearhead, physicality is less of an issue here so Pedro Neto gets the nod for his individual flair as his eye for goal.\nSteve Madeley\nWho do you think is winning the five-a-side Premier League then?\nLet us know in the comments below\u2026\n(Photos: Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)"

      "text": "Sandro Tonali is set to return to competitive action for Newcastle United from August 29 \u2014 although the midfielder has been handed a fresh two-month suspended ban.\nThe 23-year-old Italy international is already midway through a 10-month suspension, imposed on October 27, after being found guilty of breaching rules on gambling by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC).\nAdvertisement\nAlthough that suspension covered bets made while under the jurisdiction of the FIGC, the latest ban \u2014 which is fully suspended for the duration of the 2024-25 season \u2014 and \u00a320,000 fine, as well as a warning about his future conduct, have been handed down by the English FA. It relates to alleged gambling since he joined Newcastle from AC Milan in a \u00a355million ($68.9m) transfer in July.\nEddie Howe said on Friday: \u201cIt\u2019s the right decision. Sandro\u2019s currently working hard behind the scenes, he\u2019s trained very well. But as always, referring to this situation, we\u2019re still supporting and helping him as he serves his time.\u201d\nA three-person independent regulatory commission convened via Microsoft Teams on April 25 to hear Tonali\u2019s case. The hearing is summarised in a 26-page \u201cDecision and Reasons\u201d document \u2014 some sections of which have been redacted \u2014 and, here, The Athletic runs through the key takeaways from it.\nTonali bet on four Newcastle matches \u2014 although he fails to recall one of them\nTonali was charged with misconduct concerning 50 alleged counts of placing bets on football matches between August 12 and October 12, in contravention of Rule E8 of the FA regulations.\nOf those 50 bets, four of them were classed as \u201ccategory three\u201d because they were placed on Newcastle matches and, in each of those cases, he backed his own team to win.\nAlthough the commission rejected Tonali\u2019s submission that the potential damage to the integrity of the game \u201cis insignificant or substantially lessened\u201d because he bet on his own team to be victorious, they did accept that the \u201cseriousness\u201d would have been far greater had he backed Newcastle to lose. This could have prompted a ban ranging from six months to a life suspension.\nSome of those bets were part of an accumulator, in which Tonali gambled on several matches collectively. While Tonali could recount three specific Newcastle fixtures he definitely bet on, he could not recall whether the fourth match was against Brighton & Hove Albion or Burnley, but he \u201cwas certain that it was not both\u201d.\nThe bets involving Newcastle games were:\n- An accumulator involving either Newcastle to beat Brighton on September 2, which they lost 3-1, or Newcastle to beat Burnley on September 30, which they won 2-0 (both Premier League fixtures);\n- An accumulator including Newcastle to beat Brentford in the Premier League on September 16, which they won 1-0;\n- A single bet on Newcastle to beat Manchester City in the Carabao Cup third round on September 27, which they won 1-0;\n- An accumulator featuring Newcastle to beat West Ham United in the Premier League on October 8, which they drew 2-2.\nTonali definitely bet on three matches he played in \u2014 he started against Brighton, Manchester City and West Ham \u2014 and, for the fourth, he was an unused substitute against Brentford, while he came on as a 68th-minute substitute against Burnley.\nThe FA declared that Tonali\u2019s involvement in the three matches was a \u201cserious aggravating factor\u201d and they refuted the player\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere has been no damage to (the) integrity of the match in question or the game as a whole\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nThe other 46 bets were deemed to be \u201ccategory two\u201d \u2014 which Tonali insisted would only carry a financial penalty rather than a sporting sanction \u2014 as they were not placed on Newcastle matches. Although Tonali could not recall all the matches he bet on, he admitted he did gamble on other Premier League fixtures, but not on Champions League games or international football.\nHe took a \u201csubstantial\u201d voluntary reduction in wages\nDan Ashworth, Newcastle\u2019s outgoing sporting director, did not confirm or deny whether Tonali had taken a pay cut when questioned about it in November, but the list of FA intermediary transactions had hinted at that outcome when it stated that Tonali\u2019s contract had been \u201camended\u201d \u2014 and now there is confirmation of that salary change.\nAs well as reiterating how \u201csorry\u201d he is for his actions, Tonali\u2019s submission revealed that his \u201cnet weekly football income has already been voluntarily reduced very substantially\u201d since he received his ban from the FIGC in October.\nHis specific initial and reduced salary levels are not disclosed. However, the FA asserted that any fine the commission imposed upon Tonali \u201cshould bear proper and appropriate correlation to his total net football income\u201d because, at the time of his gambling, he was receiving \u201ca significant weekly wage\u201d.\nTonali was fined \u00a320,000, with the panel having considered his \u201ccurrent net weekly football income\u201d, while he must also pay the costs of the regulatory commission.\nHis cumulative bets totalled between \u20ac100,000 and \u20ac500,000\nTonali failed to recount the exact amount of each bet he placed, though he insisted they \u201cwould not be more than \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,550, $10,730)\u201d each. His submission insisted that his gambling was not for financial gain and he \u201chasn\u2019t been enriched\u201d by his betting. Rather, the player\u2019s agent, Beppe Riso, declared in October that Tonali was suffering from a \u201cgambling illness\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nThe FA was keen to highlight that Tonali could have bet up to \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3427,800) across the 50 matches and such a value becomes \u201can additional aggravating factor\u201d, which it felt \u201cmust elevate the appropriate sanction\u201d towards the upper limit of the proposed zero-to-six-months range for this offence.\nHowever, Tonali\u2019s submission disputed this. Accepting that the player \u201cis in a very fortunate position to earn a significant amount of money\u201d, his argument was that the amounts placed were merely a portion of his monthly pre-reduction salary, although the precise percentage is redacted.\nThe commission deduced that Tonali must have bet \u201ca very significant sum, well in excess of \u20ac100,000 (\u00a385,600) and certainly a six-figure sum,\u201d which it concluded was a \u201csignificant aggravating factor\u201d in determining his punishment.\nWithout Tonali\u2019s testimony, the FA did not have a case\nDescribing the situation as \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented in many respects\u201d, the FA acknowledges that without Tonali\u2019s testimony, they simply did not have a case and it is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d they would ever have become aware of his misconduct otherwise.\nMost betting cases prosecuted involve a betting company flagging a potential breach to the FA. Yet the player self-reported on October 20, then Newcastle sent nine supporting documents to the governing body on January 26, before Tonali was interviewed by FA investigators on March 5 and admitted the alleged misconduct in writing on April 9.\nYet, despite Tonali\u2019s cooperation, the FA was \u201cunable to verify any of the betting activity admitted to\u201d, with none of the six regulated betting companies they contacted able to provide breaches, and there were no accounts identified in Tonali\u2019s name that showed breaches at any UK-licensed gambling operator.\nInstead, the FA admitted that Tonali \u201cclearly initiated the investigation himself\u201d, provided \u201cproactive assistance\u201d and \u201cfully cooperated thereafter\u201d, which \u201crepresents a significant mitigating factor\u201d.\nTonali did receive FA training \u2014 and his \u201clanguage barrier\u201d defence was dismissed\nA mitigating factor cited by Tonali was that, when receiving FA training on gambling on August 3, he \u201chad not fully understood the content due to the language barrier, his English being extremely limited\u201d given it was only a month after he had signed. Admitting he did know \u201che was not allowed to bet in some form or another\u201d, he claimed he was not fully aware of the FA\u2019s exact gambling regulations.\nAdvertisement\nBut the FA disputed this account, insisting that they had provided \u201cguidance material (on gambling) translated into Italian\u201d to Newcastle, meaning Tonali should have been in \u201cfull knowledge that he was not permitted\u201d to place bets on football in England.\nDespite this, Tonali placed his first bets just nine days after the FA training, on August 12, and the governing body invited the commission to recognise this as \u201canother serious aggravating factor\u201d for which to \u201cattach considerable weight\u201d.\nThe Italian FA\u2019s suspension guidelines may be more punitive than the English FA\u2019s\nInterestingly, and perhaps frustratingly from a Newcastle perspective, the FA\u2019s sanctions may actually be less punitive than the FIGC\u2019s for the offences Tonali committed during his time in Italy.\nWhile Tonali was banned for 18 months, eight of which were commuted, by the FIGC, mitigation on Tonali\u2019s behalf argued that an FA ban for those offences would have carried a \u201czero to six-month sanction\u201d. Although the FA declared that the commission \u201cshould not speculate\u201d as to what sanction would have been handed down had the offences been committed in England and declared \u201csuch considerations an irrelevance\u201d, they did not fully dispute the suggestion.\nRegardless, Tonali\u2019s assertion that a further sporting sanction would represent \u201cdouble punishment\u201d, given his FIGC suspension, was dismissed by the FA. They insisted this case was \u201centirely separate\u201d from the Italian one because they were only considering his offences during his time as a \u201cparticipant\u201d in the English game, which commenced with his transfer on July 3.\nThe FA also disagreed with Tonali\u2019s plea to \u201capply no sporting sanction\u201d due to the \u201cprofound effect\u201d on the player. Rather, due to the \u201cvery serious nature of the breaches\u201d, they felt a sporting sanction was necessary, even if \u201cmitigating factors\u201d could reduce that to a \u201cmedian point\u201d within the zero to six-month timescale. The FA claimed that \u201cit would be so unduly lenient as to be unreasonable\u201d if the commission chose to \u201cimpose no sporting sanction whatsoever\u201d.\nThe governing body \u201cdid not seek to resist\u201d that there are \u201cclear and compelling reasons\u201d due to a \u201cunique set of circumstances\u201d that any sporting sanction could be suspended \u2014 as Tonali argued \u2014 but the FA did not believe that any ban, commuted or otherwise, needed to run \u201cconsecutive\u201d to Tonali\u2019s current suspension.\nHow the verdict was reached\nWith Tonali admitting the misconduct, the independent commission only needed to determine the sanction.\nThe panel was made up of Abdul Iqbal KC, a leading lawyer and part-time judge, as the chair, alongside Tony Agana, the former Sheffield United and Notts County striker, and Alan Knight, the ex-Portsmouth goalkeeper, all of whom have experience of similar independent FA commission hearings.\nAdvertisement\nUsing the FA\u2019s sanctioning guidelines, they determined that a three-month suspension was an \u201cappropriate and proportionate starting point\u201d, before considering aggravating and mitigating factors. The panel dismissed Tonali\u2019s submission that a sporting sanction was \u201cinappropriate\u201d.\nSix \u201caggravating factors\u201d were cited as relevant and increased the starting point for a sporting sanction to a four-month suspension:\n- Tonali\u2019s understanding of the rules and his understanding of the \u201cimpact of such betting on the integrity of the game\u201d\n- The FA training Tonali received, his admission that betting on football was \u201cillegal\u201d and the guidance material provided to Newcastle in Italian\n- The player\u2019s decision to continue such betting \u201cwith this knowledge\u201d\n- The overall impact these bets could have on the integrity of the game\n- Betting on matches in which he was directly involved\n- A six-figure cumulative valuation of the bets\nThe 50 bets placed were described as an \u201cintermediate number, which is not a particular aggravating or indeed mitigating factor\u201d. However, four \u201cmitigating factors\u201d were highlighted as \u201coutweighing to a degree the aggravating factors\u201d to reduce the sporting sanction to a two-month suspension, although one of those four points was entirely redacted:\n- Tonali had already admitted to breaching similar Italian betting rules, but that misconduct \u201chad not been proved at the time\u201d of these offences\n- The player was described as \u201cstill relatively young, but not very young\u201d, so his age was \u201ca mitigating factor to a degree\u201d\n- Tonali\u2019s self-referral, his admission of evidence for the case and the fact he \u201cadmitted formally the misconduct as soon as reasonably possible\u201d provided \u201cvery strong mitigation\u201d\nIn addition, the panel concluded that there were two \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d to suspend all of the two-month ban. One of those reasons was completely redacted, while the other related to Tonali\u2019s self-referral and the FA\u2019s reliance on the player\u2019s own evidence to bring their case.\nTo have a \u201cdeterrent effect\u201d, the suspension period of the two-month ban extends until the end of the 2024-25 Premier League season, which is deemed a \u201cnecessary, appropriate and proportionate\u201d length.\nBut, if Tonali does not commit another offence, he can return to playing for Newcastle by August 29.\n(Top photo: Michael Regan/Getty Images)"

      "text": "This is part of a series from The Athletic breaking down the tactical approach of Premier League teams for the 2025-26 season. You can also read about Leeds United\u2019s approach.\nIt\u2019s now been over two decades since Arsenal were last crowned Premier League champions.\nFive FA Cup victories have eased the long wait in the years since, but an elusive 14th league title remains the priority in north London, with a third consecutive second-place finish under Mikel Arteta last season only fuelling their determination to go one better this time around.\nAdvertisement\nArsenal\u2019s recruitment drive this summer speaks to that ambition, having invested close to \u00a3200million into the squad, already the second-most lavish window in the club\u2019s history. Martin Zubimendi was the first to arrive, one of Europe\u2019s most coveted deep-lying midfielders, before the arrivals of Noni Madueke and, in particular, Viktor Gyokeres, began to hint at a change of approach at the top of the team \u2014 both bringing more direct dribbling and raw power to the front line.\nWith an eye on pre-season performances, The Athletic breaks down how Arsenal could approach the upcoming season.\nThough Arsenal have been highly adaptable from game to game under Arteta, cycling through various build-up shapes and attacking styles across his five-and-a-half years in charge, a handful of key themes \u2014 most obvious to the eye \u2014 have emerged.\nThe first is that Arsenal have become much more patient in their approach play, preferring to build up carefully with measured passing out from their centre-backs, looking to create numerical advantages, with more advanced players taking up pre-planned positions on the pitch.\nAs we can see below, comparing the speed Arsenal move the ball towards goal with the number of passes they average per possession sequence, they have tended towards Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City sides near the bottom right corner of the graph.\nThe exact shapes that Arsenal take up can change from minute to minute, but the broad idea is to have at least two, often three, quick defenders on hand to defend against any potential counter-attacks. New signing Cristhian Mosquera, a strong, clean-tackling central defender standing at 6ft 3in (191 cm), is another to add to their collection.\nUp ahead, two midfielders will look to jump into spaces to receive the ball, while five attacking players \u2014 generally speaking \u2014 will take up positions across the width of the pitch to stretch and overload the opposition defensive line.\nHere against Real Madrid, for example, we see Myles Lewis-Skelly drifting in from left-back to help form that 3-2-5 shape, acting as a midfield receiver alongside Thomas Partey to allow Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard to push on behind enemy lines. Such a structure allowed for incisive passing moves through the centre of Madrid\u2019s passive 4-4-2 block.\nOther times it\u2019s Odegaard dropping in, sometimes Rice floats out wide \u2014 the key is flexibility and movement, looking to pull players out of the defensive shape and strike quickly to exploit the spaces.\nFrom a build-up perspective, the arrival of Zubimendi opens up more variety.\nHe is a press-resistant midfielder with an unerring ability to receive a wide range of passes, often under pressure, and emerge unscathed with the ball. Such ability allows the 26-year-old to play as a sole receiver against less aggressive teams, allowing Arsenal to push more players up the pitch.\nPart of what makes Zubimendi so valuable in these sequences is his constant movement to offer himself for the pass, often seen bouncing around midfield, constantly scanning the pitch, with a real knack for showing up at the right time to help his team-mates escape.\nIn the sequence below against Milan, for example, he starts as the deepest midfielder, lingering behind the two opposition strikers. But he is quick to dart towards Mikel Merino as he receives a pass with his back to goal, jumping from the blind spot and leaving centre-forward Mattia Liberali behind.\nHaving created that separation from his marker, Zubimendi can push forward and produce a nicely weighted through ball to Reiss Nelson into the box.\nAgainst deeper defensive structures, he\u2019s also happy to pick up the pace and force the issue when the opportunity presents, as against Villarreal below.\nWith Noni Madueke doubled up on out wide, Zubimendi shuffles backwards to receive the pass, and then fires a pass into Martin Odegaard, breaking the first two lines of the opposition\u2019s 4-4-2 defensive block.\nThough early in his Arsenal career, a series of smooth performances on the ball, topped off with a pleasing array of punchy passes into the final third, bodes well for the season ahead.\nThough largely successful across the seasons, Arsenal\u2019s attentive approach to build-up can see them frustrated by rigorously organised, aggressive pressing sides.\nOn top of disheartening results against Fulham, Newcastle and Everton last campaign, there has been a feeling at times during pre-season that the approach play can feel blunt and easily containable at times, with a lack of tight-space dribblers, off-the-cuff creativity, and forward thrust to move stubborn defensive shapes around.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s where the second recurring theme of Arteta\u2019s Arsenal jumps out \u2014 a tendency to lean heavily on their right-hand side.\nAs we can see from the visual below, no team came close to the percentage of attacking touches that Arsenal took in the right third last season \u2014 even with the inventive trio of Bukayo Saka, Ben White and Odegaard having large periods out with respective injuries.\nWhite\u2019s return to fitness in pre-season has been particularly promising, as he has provided overlapping runs to aid Saka on the right.\nArsenal have also benefited from more direct approach play in parts of matches this summer. The emphasis on playing long passes in behind was noticeable against Spurs, with at least five played in the opening 20 minutes in Hong Kong.\nThey cropped up again in the 3-0 win over Athletic Club, which was the first time Arteta started Odegaard, Zubimendi and Rice as a midfield trio. Zubimendi and Rice excelled in particular, interchanging positions and continuing to find Saka in dangerous areas.\nArteta said after the win that: \u201cWe saw another evolution today.\u201d But that was just one part of it.\nNew centre-forward Gyokeres made a devastating habit of storming down the left flank during his time at Sporting CP in Portugal, while his desire to target the spaces in behind and tussle with defenders can provide Arsenal with a more direct route through a defensive block should all else fail.\nWhile he was unable to score in his first two pre-season appearances, there were glimpses that he could be a handful down Arsenal\u2019s weaker side. He took it upon himself to dart into the left channel against Villarreal, while Gabriel Martinelli occupied the centre-backs.\nLater in the first half, Gyokeres popped up and produced a nice shimmy to cut inside and get a shot away from a similar position, before showing his intensity without the ball in the second half \u2014 dropping back to nick the ball, barging his way to the edge of the penalty area and almost slipping Saka through inside the box.\nAdvertisement\nIn moments like these, Arsenal\u2019s midfielders and wingers will need to make strong supporting runs to help Gyokeres. He has claimed over 10 assists in his last three seasons in all competitions, and this could be a critical source of goals that some may not expect.\nThe Sweden international undoubtedly adds a new dynamic to Arteta\u2019s attack.\nA look at where he and Kai Havertz received their passes last season illustrates that the latter drifts to the right, but Gyokeres maintains a much more central presence.\nGyokeres also took 9.1 touches inside the opposition box per 90 minutes last season, as opposed to Havertz\u2019s 5.1, suggesting he can also help with those more instinctive finishes closer to goal.\nGyokeres\u2019 battering ram approach might also help to boost Arsenal\u2019s transitional potential, particularly after quick recoveries in midfield.\nOnly Bournemouth, Newcastle and Liverpool won the ball more often outside their own defensive third than Arteta\u2019s side last season, but as the graph below illustrates, only 6.7 per cent of those resulted in a shot within 10 seconds, the third-lowest rate in the division.\nGyokeres at least gives them the option to speed things up and break quickly \u2014 he is able to chase down a long pass and scrap his way into dangerous areas unlike any other player that Arsenal currently possess.\nThere may also be a slight alteration in how Arsenal generate chances from wide areas.\nWhile Lewis-Skelly has shone by drifting into midfield from left-back, there seems to have been more emphasis on him fulfilling more traditional full-back duties this summer.\nNew first-team coach, former Manchester United and Real Madrid defender Gabriel Heinze, was seen doing crossing drills with the 18-year-old \u2014 situations that were replicated in games.\nAlso, for Arsenal\u2019s first goal of pre-season, Lewis-Skelly overlapped to allow for a pass inside to Jakub Kiwior, whose first-time cross was turned in by Saka.\nGyokeres\u2019 first Arsenal goal then came from an almost identical passage on the right.\nSaka retrieved an overhit corner and laid the ball back to Zubimendi to whip into the box first time. The Swede timed his run and headed the ball well to get off the mark.\nAside from crosses, Arsenal will also be thankful for the individual brilliance shown by Max Dowman.\nThe 15-year-old has shown extraordinary confidence and talent against top European opposition, slaloming through challenges and winning two penalties with his blend of acceleration and technique.\nArteta played down Premier League involvement when asked after the loss to Villarreal, but his involvement this summer has been telling. And to his credit, the England Under-17 international has made an impact whenever he has played. Whether the manager thinks someone so young is ready to contribute to Premier League games remains to be seen.\nSimilar levels of individuality have also been shown by Ethan Nwaneri, who has played a more central role. Having contributed to 11 goals last season, the 18-year-old\u2019s ability to beat a man one-v-one, find team-mates and take shots that others wouldn\u2019t will be important alongside the qualities of Odegaard, Zubimendi and Rice in midfield.\nArsenal\u2019s dedication to set-pieces has been another distinguishing feature of Arteta\u2019s reign.\nSpecialist coach Nicolas Jover constantly develops new routines to give them the dead-ball edge. No team scored more than Arsenal\u2019s 17 set-piece goals last season, while they also generated the most expected goals (xG) from corners in the division.\nAdvertisement\nEarly signs in pre-season suggest that Jover\u2019s influence is showing no signs of slowing down, as a trademark corner routine led to Christian Norgaard\u2019s first goal for the club in the 3-2 defeat to Villarreal.\nBefore the corner is struck, we see six Arsenal players cluster towards the back post, before Gyokeres, Kiwior and William Saliba dart forward, leaving Norgaard behind. In frame three, we see the efforts that are made to block Villarreal\u2019s recovery runs, allowing the Denmark international to head home in space.\nThey have also tried different routines in pre-season. Against Spurs, they had five players starting runs from the edge of the box from one corner, while they split into groups of three against Athletic Club at the Emirates.\nWhatever the season holds, more set-piece innovation should be expected.\nArsenal will know better than anyone that these trends and evolutions will not guarantee that this will finally be the year that they get over the line.\nEven so, it is clear that they have taken steps in an attempt to alter the end of the story that they have become so familiar with.\nIf anything, after setting the pace for most of the 2022-23 title race, the last two seasons have shown how costly dropping points early on can be. They face Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City in their opening five games, so whether they like it or not, eyes will be on them immediately.\nNow, it needs to be their time to deliver.\n(Top photo: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Tactically, the Premier League is in a real state of flux.\nAfter four consecutive title-winning years with a distinct, possession and territory-based style, Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City were reduced to a third-place finish on 71 points in 2024-25 \u2014 their worst since Guardiola\u2019s debut campaign of 2016-17.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile Liverpool cruised to the title in their first season post-Jurgen Klopp, with Arne Slot\u2019s side developing a reputation for their flexibility and adaptability. They had 25 wins and only lost twice across the first 34 matches, by which point the trophy was theirs.\nNottingham Forest showed European football can be earned with a throwback, defend-first and counter-attack strategy, while for the second season running all three promoted teams were relegated.\nSo what might we expect from 2025-26?\nFlying full-backs, not inverted ones\nLast season, the chasing pack of European clubs seemed to realise, en masse, that they did not need to copy City, Chelsea, and Arsenal by rolling a full-back into midfield. In fact, those clubs had even more success with flying full-backs running beyond a winger.\nPer SkillCorner, Milos Kerkez was the only player in the division to make 100+ overlaps and 100+ underlaps, which suited the directness of Bournemouth\u2019s in-possession approach \u2014 and with him joining Liverpool this summer, makes him a younger iteration of Andy Robertson.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a player that, because of his physical condition, arrives so many times to the last third with the ball under control to put good crosses,\u201d said Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola of Kerkez last season.\nLikewise, the arrival of Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen, a wing-back in their Bundesliga-winning team of 2023-24, means Slot can deploy maximal width and beyond-the-ball full-backs on both sides.\nNewcastle United\u2019s full-back pairing of Lewis Hall and Tino Livramento were particularly frequent underlappers; Antonee Robinson put up 10 assists for Fulham last year, completing the most crosses of any player in the division, consistently running beyond from left-back.\nOther honourable mentions include Daniel Munoz (Crystal Palace), Aaron Wan-Bissaka (West Ham United), Michael Kayode (Brentford) and Lucas Digne (Aston Villa).\nAs per SkillCorner, the frequency of full-backs overlapping has decreased in recent seasons, down nearly 14 per cent in 2024-25 compared to the 2018-19 campaign. Meanwhile, underlaps are on the rise \u2014 up by more than a third over the same period.\nAdvertisement\nThis might seem strange considering the prevalence of inverted wingers, who play on the opposite side to their dominant foot, and like to cut inside, which would suit a supporting overlap.\nHowever, many coaches want their wingers to start with high and wide positions regardless, and by enticing opposition full-backs out one-v-one, an underlap can often unlock a defence.\nThe \u2018Lavolpiana\u2019 \u2014 dropping a pivot in\nPremier League midfield battles are changing. We see that at goal kicks, when teams will often build-up with six players close to their own goal and position four up on halfway, leaving a hole in central midfield because opponents press man-to-man so often.\nIn settled possession, 4-4-2 mid-blocks are increasingly common, to man-mark in central midfield. Consequently, short passing routes through the centre of the pitch have a lot more risk than reward (unless a team has a pivot with the press resistance of Rodri or Ryan Gravenberch).\nAs per Footovision, an advanced data provider, the proportion of line-breaking passes played centrally during build-up dropped by five percentage points from 2023-24 to 2024-25 in the Premier League.\nExpect to see more of the Lavolpiana tactic, named after Argentine coach Ricardo La Volpe. This is where a central midfielder drops deeper, playing between the two centre-backs, and breaks lines with longer-range passes.\nHere is Newcastle\u2019s Sandro Tonali playing that role, allowing right-back Kieran Trippier to push forward and create a two-v-one against Ipswich Town\u2019s left-back.\nIf any midfielder was made for the role, it is Youri Tielemans at Aston Villa. He ranked ninth in Europe\u2019s top-five leagues last season for through balls (24).\nWith Rodri injured for most of last season, Bernardo Silva used the tactic on an as-needed basis against particularly stubborn mid-blocks. Mateo Kovacic has operated similarly for Guardiola, with this being a consistent feature of his sides.\nAnd here is Carlos Baleba doing that in the build-up for Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s opener away at Manchester United.\n\u201cWe had a good balance between defence and controlling the game in possession,\u201d Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler said afterwards.\nCoaches tend to value this build-up tweak not just for the way it opens passing lanes \u2014 as opponents are reluctant to commit a player too high to press the midfielder \u2014 but also because it provides extra cover as rest defence versus counter-attacks.\nBack to basics set pieces\nThere is an irony that even as clubs focus on and invest ever more deeply in set pieces, the tactics are trending towards yesteryear.\nLast term, 60 per cent of all corners were inswingers, up from 41 per cent in 2018-19. Short corners have remained pretty consistent (roughly one in five) while outswingers have really fallen out of fashion.\nTeams largely copied the approaches of Arsenal and Aston Villa, two of the earlier Premier League clubs to hire formal set-piece coaches, who tended to pack the six-yard box and drop inswingers onto the opposition goalkeeper. Everton, too, consistently caused teams problems with these delivery types under Sean Dyche.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt is special in the Premier League because you can block, push, foul and there is no whistle,\u201d Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner said of corners last season, indirectly offering an explanation of why more teams are prioritising inswingers \u2014 because they are allowed to.\n\u201cThis gives you more opportunities in attacking set plays but it causes more trouble when defending set plays\u201d.\nLikewise, teams are increasingly launching the ball upfield from kick-off, and long throws have been on a steady rise across the past four years too: there were 279 throws into the penalty area in 2020-21 (and only three goals from throw-ins that season). Last season, it was 501 and 20 goals from throw-ins.\nThomas Frank\u2019s Brentford were \u2014 as in previous seasons \u2014 league leaders here, with 103 penalty-box throws and six goals from throw-ins. Frank, now being Tottenham Hotspur head coach, might give the tactic more popularity if his new side continue to use it.\nThe potential re-rise of the 3-4-2-1\nChelsea in 2016-17 were the last team to win the Premier League playing a variation of a 3-4-3. City morphed into this shape plenty in attacking during 2022-23 (when John Stones would move from centre-back into midfield), but generally there has been a homogeneity of 4-3-3 among the league\u2019s best.\nHowever, the 3-4-2-1 is starting to creep its way back in. It is the first-choice shape of Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, and Glasner at Crystal Palace \u2014 the pair having success with it at their respective former clubs Sporting CP and Eintracht Frankfurt.\nHere is how it looked for United and Palace in settled possession, able to commit a wing-back onto the last line and with dual No 10s that can pin opposition full-backs, while playing close to their No 9.\nIt was a similar story with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Vitor Pereira. When he arrived in December 2024, the club were 19th on nine points after 16 matches.\nHis predecessor Gary O\u2019Neil had switched between a back three and four, but Pereira went purely with a 3-4-2-1 for the rest of the season and Wolves took 33 points from their remaining 22 games. They survived comfortably, finishing 16th.\nIt might be a blueprint for more teams, particularly promoted sides needing a solid defensive foundation. With so many teams defending in a back four, a wing-back system can be a relatively straightforward way of overloading opponents and creating a front five.\nIn total, there were 120 instances of the 3-4-2-1 or 3-2-4-1 (different ways of labelling the same thing) in 2024-25, with its frequency trending upwards since 2019-20, where it was only 25 times.\nA focus on attacking transitions\nThe Premier League took the German Bundesliga\u2019s crown last season: England\u2019s top tier is, statistically, the most counter-attacking among Europe\u2019s major leagues.\nFast break shots have been on a five-year rise, as has the expected goals (xG, or chance quality) from those scenarios.\nAfter 54 fast break goals in 2021-22, the past three campaigns have seen 87, 83, and, most recently, 112 goals.\nMore teams trying to play expansively, and in the opposition half, are increasing counter-attacking opportunities. Add to this that there is a particularly high frequency of strikers and wingers with the physical and technical capacity to exploit disjointed and underloaded defences.\nLiverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal were the top teams at scoring from fast breaks last season \u2014 it is no longer an underdog tactic \u2014 while Brighton, Tottenham, Leicester City, Nottingham Forest and Brentford were a quintet of clubs who conceded at least eight goals from those scenarios.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEveryone is talking about what we\u2019re doing with the ball, scoring goals, but when you look at our counter-press, how we win the ball back, it\u2019s so hard for opponents,\u201d Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard said in March 2024.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the other side before. Trying to defend deep and escaping that when you are being pressed is so difficult.\u201d\nExpect to see even more aggressive counter-pressing next season, perhaps more tactical fouls, and coaches with a focus on rest defence \u2014 the positioning of players and spacing between them when a team has possession, ready to counter-press should a turnover occur.\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"

      "text": "Welcome to the 11th edition of The Athletic\u2019s Transfer DealSheet for the summer 2025 transfer window.\nOur team of dedicated writers, including David Ornstein, will take you inside the market to explain the deals being worked on. The transfer window is open and will run until September 1.\nThe information found within this article has been gathered according to The Athletic\u2019s sourcing guidelines. Unless stated, our reporters have spoken to more than one person briefed on each deal before offering the clubs involved the opportunity to comment. Their responses, when they were given, have been included.\nAdvertisement\nWe aim to bring you analysis you can trust about what is happening at Europe\u2019s leading clubs and the latest information we\u2019re hearing from across the market. This year, The Athletic\u2019s football finance writer, Chris Weatherspoon, will be adding to our analysis of the transfer market. Our Manchester City reporter Jordan Campbell will return with the latest from the club next week.\nLast week, we looked at the striker high among the options left on the market, a possible deal for an Arsenal midfielder, and the latest on Benjamin Sesko before he joined Manchester United. This week, David Ornstein gives us his One To Watch, we have news on Liverpool\u2019s interest in a young defender and the latest on Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nThis article is long but detailed, so enjoy it all \u2014 or search for the club or player you want to read about.\nDavid Ornstein\u2019s One To Watch\nWhen supporters are awaiting Newcastle United\u2019s line-up to face Aston Villa on Saturday, a burning question will be what role \u2014 if any \u2014 Alexander Isak might occupy for Eddie Howe\u2019s team.\nIsak has not featured in pre-season amid Liverpool\u2019s ongoing pursuit, and while Newcastle have stressed they have no intention of allowing a sale, potential replacements continue to be explored.\nThe anticipation is that Isak will miss the trip to Villa Park, with his future shrouded in uncertainty. Based on conversations with sources privy to the matter, The Athletic understands Isak is adamant he will never represent Newcastle again.\nEven if Newcastle refuse to sell the 25-year-old Sweden striker and he remains on Tyneside when the transfer window closes, Isak regards his career at St James\u2019s Park as finished and has no desire to reintegrate into the squad.\nIsak\u2019s perspective is that, after being informed last summer that a new contract would not yet be offered to him \u2014 because of Newcastle\u2019s need to comply with football\u2019s financial rules and Isak already having a lucrative deal until 2028 \u2014 he made clear it would be his last campaign with the club.\nSome at Newcastle deny that this was expressed and believe the forward planned to discuss the situation, including the possibility of fresh terms, once 2024-25 concluded.\nAdvertisement\nLast campaign, Isak helped his side win the Carabao Cup and qualify for the Champions League. Two weeks before the season ended, he told Howe of his wish to leave and reiterated this on a call to the manager before flying to Sweden after the club\u2019s final-day defeat by Everton.\nLiverpool are yet to make another offer since their \u00a3110million bid at the beginning of August was turned down. Newcastle\u2019s stance may soften if a proposal closer to \u00a3150m arrives and they can fill Isak\u2019s void through the market.\nThe Premier League champions\u2019 interest remains firm, and Isak is focused on a move to Anfield.\nKeep an eye on Ramsey\u2026\nAnother situation to watch as the transfer window enters its final few weeks involves Aston Villa midfielder Jacob Ramsey.\nThe 24-year-old is now in the final 24 months of his Villa contract, and despite several offers to extend, no agreement has been reached. In such circumstances, both parties are open-minded about finding an alternative solution, and that is likely to mean a sale.\nThis would avoid further limbo, allowing Villa to plan ahead with more clarity and Ramsey the opportunity to achieve greater career stability. Many suitors have expressed an interest to Ramsey\u2019s camp, but emerging as his preferred destination are Newcastle United.\nThe Tyneside club made an approach for the former England youth international in January 2024, and boss Eddie Howe is a big fan.\nOther sides from the Premier League and abroad are also keen, including West Ham United. Their head coach Graham Potter admires Ramsey, and the feeling is mutual. However, Newcastle\u2019s project and the chance to work under Howe are thought to carry the greatest appeal.\nBefore opening their seasons in Saturday\u2019s lunchtime kick-off at Villa Park, Newcastle and Villa are starting talks to explore whether a compromise can be reached.\nAdvertisement\nRamsey is a priority target as Newcastle aim to strengthen in his position \u2014 and up front \u2014 amid what has been a testing market.\nA number of ambitious options have moved elsewhere, but they have landed Anthony Elanga and Aaron Ramsdale, while a deal for Malick Thiaw is close to being completed.\nDavid Ornstein\nWhat we\u2019re hearing about Baleba\nManchester United are continuing to explore whether a move for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba can be agreed this summer.\nThe talks, taking place via intermediaries on United\u2019s behalf, have so far been to assess his willingness to join and the salary required, plus Brighton\u2019s potential valuation.\nBrighton do not intend to sell the 21-year-old in this market, preferring to keep him for at least another season, and have not indicated a price so far. But United are determined to reshape Ruben Amorim\u2019s squad as much as possible in his first summer transfer window, and adding a top-level No 6 has been central to the club\u2019s plans.\nBaleba heads their list of targets, having impressed greatly during his two campaigns in the Premier League. He also has seven caps for the Cameroon national team.\nCompetition in 2026 is set to be fierce, so United are studying the parameters of a deal now, in case it is viable and Brighton\u2019s resolve can be put to the test. Equally, United will hope Brighton consider whether now might be the best time to cash in, given the inherent insecurities of football.\nBaleba \u2014 whose contract runs until 2028 with an option to extend by a further 12 months \u2014 is keen on the possibility of a switch to United, and personal terms would not be a problem. A number of United players have been in contact with Baleba about a transfer to Old Trafford, explaining the current landscape and ambitions.\nThe cost of any transaction would be a significant hurdle to overcome, though, and for this reason, some at United remain sceptical about the chances of an agreement being reached. In 2023, Brighton sold Moises Caicedo to Chelsea for \u00a3100million rising to \u00a3115m, and Baleba is regarded in a similar category.\nAdvertisement\nAnother point of reference may be Joao Pedro, who Brighton recently sold to Chelsea for \u00a360m. Joao Pedro was omitted for the final two games of last season after a training-ground altercation with Jan Paul van Hecke.\nUnited are not expected to submit a bid for Baleba unless they believe there is a chance of success, with indirect conversations ongoing. Their signings so far have come in at the \u00a360million to \u00a370m range.\nUnited do need sales to balance the books after committing to more than \u00a3200m on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund are available and could raise significant funds.\nGiving United a degree of flexibility on cash is an extension to their revolving credit facility, plus sell-on clauses being realised for Anthony Elanga and Alvaro Carreras primarily, as well as Marcus Rashford\u2019s salary being off the wage bill.\nFurthermore, United included a significant sell-on clause in the deal agreed with Marseille for Mason Greenwood, who has attracted interest this window.\nShould United need, they can make sales in January and up to June 30 next summer to comply with PSR regulations for 2025-26.\nLaurie Whitwell and David Ornstein\nWhat could Baleba bring to United?\nSifting through Baleba\u2019s profile below \u2014 comparing his attributes with other midfielders across Europe\u2019s top five leagues \u2014 it is clear how much he loves to stick a foot in and get involved in Brighton\u2019s defensive work.\nNot only is he high-volume in those actions (Front-foot defending, 88 out of 99), but he will come out of his challenges on top more often than not (Tackle success, 88 out of 99). Catching opponents on the blindside and snatching the ball away from them is a skill Baleba has honed very well in the past 18 months.\nAdd Baleba\u2019s rarity as a left-footed central midfielder and there are few players with his profile in the market.\nAccording to SkillCorner, Baleba\u2019s ability to retain possession under pressure was among the best in Europe\u2019s top five leagues when compared with fellow under-23 midfielders, highlighting just how mature he is in looking after the ball in central areas.\nGiven his athleticism, Baleba\u2019s ability to wriggle out of trouble by moving dynamically with the ball at his feet is widely known among the Brighton fanbase, with a driving run that can move his side from deeper build-up areas to the middle third in a single breath.\nMark Carey and Liam Tharme\nWhat else we\u2019re hearing\n- Liverpool are interested in Parma centre-back Giovanni Leoni. They are trying to persuade the defender to move to Anfield this summer, but accept that convincing him to leave Italy will be highly challenging. No clubs in Italy can afford him at this moment in time, with Milan going for Genoa\u2019s Koni De Winter as a result. The 18-year-old is highly rated and played 17 games for Parma in Serie A last season. Leoni has been capped seven times at Under-19 level by Italy. David Ornstein, James Horncastle and James Pearce\n- Gianluigi Donnarumma is willing to leave Paris Saint-Germain \u2014 but only for the right club and at the right moment. The goalkeeper is in the final year of his contract, and sources close to the player have indicated they expect him to leave. PSG sources seem accepting of the idea of losing him and say they offered the goalkeeper a new contract on improved terms, but this was turned down. But he will not be forced out or made to accept an offer that he does not want. James Horncastle and Mario Cortegana\n- Everton have agreed a deal to take Jack Grealish on loan from Manchester City. The deal still needs to be finalised but a medical was scheduled for Monday for the England international. An option to buy in the region of \u00a350milllion will be included. David Ornstein and Gregg Evans\n- Chelsea forward Christopher Nkunku would be open to a return to RB Leipzig this summer if his former club\u2019s interest in a potential move advances. Nkunku has been the subject of enquiries from clubs in Germany, England and Italy this summer. Leipzig are among a number of sides interested in the 27-year-old, but have some financial reservations about the logistics of a potential deal given their need to keep their wage bill lower this season, having failed to secure European football for the 2025-26 campaign. Sebastian Stafford-Bloor\n- Al Nassr have reached an agreement in principle with Bayern Munich for Kingsley Coman. The deal for the winger is set to be between \u20ac25m and \u20ac30m. Coman will be Al Nassr\u2019s fifth permanent transfer of the summer, most recently securing the signing of centre-back Inigo Martinez from Barcelona for no fee. Meanwhile, Bayern have signed winger Luis Diaz from Liverpool on a \u20ac75million (\u00a365.6m; $88.1m) deal. Sebastian Stafford-Bloor\n- Nottingham Forest are close to a deal for Manchester City midfielder James McAtee. Nothing has been agreed at this stage but talks are moving in a positive direction. McAtee, 22, is available on a permanent transfer this summer and The Athletic reported in the DealSheet in July that he had attracted interest from England and Germany, with Forest among his admirers. Paul Taylor\n- Newcastle United are advancing in negotiations to loan Odysseas Vlachodimos to Sevilla for the 2025-26 campaign. The 31-year-old goalkeeper joined for \u00a320million from Nottingham Forest last summer, with Elliot Anderson moving in the opposite direction. Those deals came about due to Newcastle United\u2019s desperate need to comply with the Premier League\u2019s profit and sustainability rules (PSR) by June 30, 2024. Vlachodimos was not initially a target for Newcastle back then and does not feature in Eddie Howe\u2019s plans, having made a solitary substitute appearance against AFC Wimbledon in the Carabao Cup across 2024-25. Sevilla are looking to take Vlachodimos on a straight loan for the season, which does not contain an option or clause for the Spanish side to buy the Greece international, and Newcastle are set to pay the majority of his wages. Chris Waugh and Mario Cortegana\nHow much has each Premier League club spent so far this season?\nManchester United\u2019s signing of Benjamin Sesko over the weekend took their spend on transfer fees to just shy of \u00a3200m this summer and also elevated them as the highest spending Premier League club on a net basis. United have spent heavily on Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha without yet recouping a transfer fee in return; only Arsenal\u2019s \u00a3185.7m net spend comes close to that dispensed at Old Trafford so far this window.\nAdvertisement\nFor all the talk of Liverpool spending heavily \u2014 and they remain the highest spenders on a gross basis \u2014 five clubs have spent more on a net basis than their \u00a383.6m, per Transfermarkt. That cohort of five includes Sunderland, whose own summer splurging shows little sign of abating. They\u2019re expecting to complete the signing of Getafe centre-back Omar Alderete soon.\nLiverpool have offset their spending on new faces by selling well, with Darwin Nunez\u2019s departure for Saudi Arabia the latest example. The Anfield outfit have recouped nearly \u00a3170m in transfer fees this summer, a figure only usurped by perennial good sellers Chelsea. The latter are estimated to have now tipped over the \u00a3200m figure in sales, on the back of the departures of Lesley Ugochukwu and Armando Broja to newly promoted Burnley.\nIn turn, that put Burnley over the \u00a3100m barrier for new signings, making them one of eight Premier League clubs to hit nine-figures when it comes to transfer spending in the last couple of months.\nAt the other end of the scale, neither Crystal Palace nor Fulham are yet to spend much of anything, though nor have they been active sellers. Interestingly, the lowest spenders on a net basis are all clubs who competed to break into the top eight last season: Brighton & Hove Albion, Brentford, Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth have all taken in much more than they\u2019ve spent so far this summer.\nChris Weatherspoon\nArsenal\nWhat happened this week?\nArsenal announced a new five-year contract for Ethan Nwaneri. Securing Nwaneri\u2019s future is excellent news for the club. Nwaneri had fielded interest from elsewhere in the Premier League and abroad, but his preference was always to find an agreement with Arsenal.\nOther than that, it has been relatively quiet: with the bulk of Arsenal\u2019s incoming transfer business done, the focus has been on preparing the current players for the start of the new season.\nIt\u2019s under a week to the new season \u2014 do Arsenal look ready?\nThey had their best performance of pre-season against Athletic Club, running out 3-0 winners thanks to goals from Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz.\nIt was an encouraging display, with familiar defensive solidity coupled with dynamic attacking. Gabriel, Riccardo Calafiori, Jurrien Timber and Havertz are also fit again, just in time for the new season.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nAsked after the win over Athletic whether Arsenal will add to the six signings they have already made, manager Mikel Arteta said: \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens in terms of where the squad is in the next few weeks, but we are actively looking at options.\n\u201cThere are a few players that have to leave as well, so we\u2019ll be open to see what happens.\u201d\nIf Arsenal are to make another addition, it is likely to be in the attacking part of the pitch. Arsenal have been studying candidates to improve their left-wing options, but ideally, the club would like to make some sales before prioritising another arrival.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nSeveral players who spent last season out on loan \u2014 Fabio Vieira, Karl Hein, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Reiss Nelson \u2014 are available to leave the club before the transfer deadline on September 1. Vieira is the subject of talks between Arsenal and Stuttgart, while Fulham have held negotiations over Nelson\u2019s return. In both cases, Arsenal favour a permanent deal.\nOleksandr Zinchenko is also available to leave before the deadline, although the Ukraine international is considering seeing out the final year of his Arsenal contract and moving on a free transfer in 2026. Arsenal, naturally, would prefer a sale in this window.\nPolish international Jakub Kiwior is open to leaving for a club where he can be a regular starter. Arsenal are in no rush to sell, however, and none of the clubs tracking Kiwior have yet met their asking price.\nJames McNicholas\nChelsea\nWhat happened this week?\nChelsea\u2019s steady stream of outgoings gathered pace. Marc Guiu completed a season-long loan move to Sunderland, while Everton signed Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for \u00a325m.\nBurnley also finalised the purchases of two unwanted Chelsea players in midfielder Ugochukwu and home-grown striker Broja, raising significant funds.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea stepped up talks to prise out-of-favour Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho from Old Trafford.\nOn the pitch, Chelsea won both of their pre-season friendlies impressively against Bayer Leverkusen and Milan. The optimistic glow around Stamford Bridge was dimmed a little by the news that defender Levi Colwill tore his ACL in training at Cobham and is expected to miss most of the season after undergoing surgery.\nNicolas Jackson was also left out of Enzo Maresca\u2019s squad for both matches as Chelsea and the striker explore a possible transfer in the final weeks of the summer window.\nDoes signing a Colwill alternative now feel crucial?\nColwill was fundamental to Chelsea\u2019s biggest achievements last season, playing twice as many minutes as any of Maresca\u2019s other centre-backs. His influence was huge both in and out of possession, so losing him to such a serious injury on the eve of the new season is a real blow to their aspirations.\nBut there is no sense of panic at Stamford Bridge, and Chelsea feel no urgent need to delve into the summer transfer market to replace him.\nThis is precisely why you amass the level of depth that they have over the last two-and-a-half years; even with Colwill sidelined, Chelsea still have as many as 10 senior players competing for four defensive positions. Maresca trusts Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo, and Wesley Fofana is nearing a return to full fitness. Summer signing Jorrel Hato is equally capable of playing at centre-back or left-back.\nBenoit Badiashile was regarded as a close to equivalent talent to Colwill, with a very similar profile, when he was acquired from Monaco in January 2023. Josh Acheampong won the love of Maresca in last season\u2019s Conference League campaign and looks ready to shoulder greater responsibility.\nThen there is Aaron Anselmino, who specialised in playing as the middle of three defenders in possession at Boca Juniors and could be kept around this season if Maresca deems him ready.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea are confident in their alternative options, and Colwill\u2019s unfortunate injury could prove exactly the kind of opportunity that one of his team-mates has been waiting for.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nChelsea would still like to sign a winger and an attacking midfielder before the transfer window closes, and the names at the top of their wish list for each position are well known.\nGarnacho is the top choice for a right-footed left winger to compete with summer signing Jamie Gittens. Chelsea have stepped up talks in the wake of the Sesko deal and view the Argentine\u2019s situation at Old Trafford as an opportunity, but they are not inclined to simply meet Manchester United\u2019s valuation of the player.\nAs detailed by my colleague David Ornstein last week, Garnacho expects to join Chelsea and has ruled out all options other than moving to Stamford Bridge or staying at Old Trafford.\nAnother ongoing situation is that of Xavi Simons. Informal discussions have been held with Leipzig over a move for the Netherlands international, but no formal bid has been made. Chelsea also like Aston Villa\u2019s Morgan Rogers as a potential fit for the attacking-midfield role.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nSubstantial progress has been made in trimming Chelsea\u2019s player list, but there is more work to be done in the remainder of August.\nJackson and Christopher Nkunku were left out of Chelsea\u2019s pre-season friendlies against Leverkusen and Milan as they, their representatives and the club explore potential moves away.\nSenior sources at Stamford Bridge say that Jackson will be reintegrated into Maresca\u2019s squad after the deadline if no transfer materialises. Chelsea are not desperate to sell him but recognise that he may want to be the lead striker at another club, and are open to sanctioning a sale if the proposal satisfies all parties.\nAdvertisement\nThere is more confidence that Nkunku will depart; he is open to a return to Leipzig but is commanding interest from other Bundesliga sides as well as clubs in Italy and the Premier League.\nAt the other end of the pitch, Renato Veiga will not return to Chelsea\u2019s first team squad despite Colwill\u2019s injury and is expected to be sold for a substantial profit this summer.\nGarnacho\u2019s arrival would further limit Tyrique George\u2019s game time, and Chelsea will work with him and his representatives to find a club where he can play more regularly this season. That could be a loan or even a permanent sale if the proposal is right. A number of clubs in England and in Europe have expressed interest.\nChelsea are still working on the departures of Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka and Axel Disasi. Alfie Gilchrist is expected to be sold to a Championship club before the transfer deadline on September 1.\nLiam Twomey\nLiverpool\nWhat happened this week?\nLiverpool completed the sale of striker Darwin Nunez to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal for an initial fee of \u20ac53m. It brought to an end the erratic Uruguayan\u2019s three-year stay at Anfield. The Premier League champions believe that once achievable add-ons are triggered, the deal will ultimately be worth around \u20ac65m.\nYoung midfielder Tyler Morton joined French club Lyon in a \u20ac15m deal with Liverpool negotiating a 20 per cent sell-on clause.\nSenior Anfield figures dismissed reports that Liverpool were targeting PSG attacker Bradley Barcola. Liverpool believe bringing in a left-sided attacker with his profile would block the pathway for talented teenager Rio Ngumoha, who is now viewed as part of Arne Slot\u2019s senior squad after an impressive pre-season.\nDoes Nunez\u2019s exit free up funds for Isak?\nLiverpool had already bid \u00a3110m for Isak before selling Nunez, so it\u2019s not as if they have been relying on further outgoings to make their move for the Swedish striker.\nHowever, it certainly opens up a space in the squad and gives them more leeway financially. For all the talk about Liverpool\u2019s \u00a3300m spending spree so far this summer, sporting director Richard Hughes has also generated around \u00a3200m from sales when you include performance-related add-ons.\nAdvertisement\nLiverpool have the capacity to shatter the British transfer record for Isak without any concerns over PSR. But so far, there\u2019s no sign of Newcastle\u2019s \u2018not for sale\u2019 stance shifting. That\u2019s the reason why Liverpool have yet to table an improved bid for Isak.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nAs well as a centre-forward, Liverpool are also in the market for a centre-back, having yet to replace Jarell Quansah, who was sold to Bayer Leverkusen last month.\nWith Joe Gomez out with an Achilles injury, Slot only has two recognised senior centre-backs in Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate ahead of Friday\u2019s Premier League opener at home to Bournemouth.\nYoung Parma centre-back Giovanni Leoni is highly-regarded. Liverpool have also previously shown interest in Crystal Palace skipper Marc Guehi, who is down to the final year of his contract.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nHarvey Elliott has been attracting interest from Bundesliga outfit Leipzig, who view him as a potential replacement for Xavi Simons. Liverpool value Elliott at around \u00a350m.\nKostas Tsimikas was left out of Slot\u2019s squad for Sunday\u2019s Community Shield. Liverpool are open to sanctioning a permanent exit for the Greece international. Nottingham Forest are among the clubs to have shown interest.\nThe future of young winger Ben Doak is also unclear. Newly promoted Leeds United are one of several top-flight clubs keen on Doak, who is valued at around \u00a320m.\nLuca Stephenson is set to sign a new deal at Anfield and then head to Dundee United on a season-long loan.\nJames Pearce\nManchester United\nWhat happened this week?\nUnited sealed the transfer of Sesko, agreeing a fee with Leipzig of \u20ac76.5m plus \u20ac8.5m in add-ons. Sesko flew in on Thursday, completed his medical on Friday, signed his paperwork on Saturday and was presented to United fans on the pitch at Old Trafford ahead of the Fiorentina game.\nRasmus Hojlund was left as an unused substitute for United\u2019s final pre-season friendly, with Mason Mount preferred up front instead. Afterwards, Ruben Amorim said: \u201cIn some moments, I felt that we struggled without a reference as a striker. We have a new player, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nAmorim declining to use Hojlund in the match, then neglecting to mention him afterwards, is a sign of the club\u2019s intentions to sell him.\nWith Sesko in, will transfer business slow down?\nThat would be the logical assessment. But United are taking a bold approach to this window, the first under INEOS rule when the structure is established above a head coach of their choosing. Activity might even speed up.\nAmorim\u2019s desire to reshape his squad is clear, which is why United are exploring an ambitious move for Carlos Baleba. Talks continue on Brighton\u2019s willingness, or not, to entertain a sale. Amorim wants a dynamic No 6, who can stop attacks and link defence with the frontline.\nAdvertisement\nGoing the other way, bringing in money for Garnacho is a priority, and progress is being made on talks with Chelsea. Clubs such as AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund are taking a look at Hojlund, who at present insists he wants to stay and fight for his place.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nUnited remain in the market for a midfielder, with the pursuit of Baleba explained above. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants United to be capable of making a major impression this campaign, and signing a player of Baleba\u2019s quality would be expected to significantly aid those aims.\nThe goalkeeper position carries some intrigue, with United continuing to be linked with a new No 1. Donnarumma is the latest name, and he appears to be heading for the exit at PSG after they signed Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier.\nAt 23, Chevalier is three years younger than Donnarumma, who has not agreed to a new contract. His current terms expire in 2026. United\u2019s stance on goalkeepers \u2014 since Aston Villa rejected their loan offer for Emiliano Martinez \u2014 is that a signing could only happen if Andre Onana departs, and there are no signs of that at present.\nOnana is hoping to be fit for the opening game of the Premier League against Arsenal on Sunday. A move for Donnarumma is not expected to materialise.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAs well as Garnacho and Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.\nHarry Amass, who was left out of United\u2019s tour to the U.S. is attracting loan interest from several clubs from the Championship and Europe, with around 15 suitors in touch. Game time will be the main factor in selecting his club.\nLaurie Whitwell\nNewcastle United\nWhat happened this week?\nYou mean aside from Eddie Howe fielding an inordinate number of questions about Alexander Isak\u2019s future? (Apologies, but there will be more on Isak later.)\nWell, Sesko has become the latest player to turn down Newcastle in favour of a move elsewhere \u2014 an eventuality some inside St James\u2019 Park had feared from the start of that ambitious pursuit \u2014 while long-serving goalkeeper Martin Dubravka has joined Burnley permanently.\nAdvertisement\nMalick Thiaw, meanwhile, is close to being unveiled as the third senior signing of the summer, after Anthony Elanga and Aaron Ramsdale.\nThe 24-year-old Germany international centre-back underwent his medical on Monday, having flown to Tyneside on Sunday evening, and will join from Milan for an upfront fee of \u20ac35m alongside \u20ac5m in add-ons. Thiaw has been a long-term target, with Howe confirming that the defender was a player he admired during the summer of 2024, and his arrival means that Newcastle have finally reinforced at right-sided centre-back, something they have been aiming to do for three years.\nElsewhere, on the striker front, Newcastle remain in protracted talks to sign Yoane Wissa from Brentford, though substantive progress has yet to be made, while Porto\u2019s Samu Aghehowa is among the alternative centre-forwards the club have discussed internally.\nWhat is the priority with a week to go until the season?\nSomewhat perversely, despite the cloud of negativity which has understandably loomed over Newcastle\u2019s summer, their window may yet end with the squad being significantly strengthened in all the areas the club hoped to.\nThat remains a big if for now, however, given that goals are a massive concern and Isak was missing in action throughout the whole of Newcastle\u2019s (winless) pre-season friendly campaign. My colleague David Ornstein explained further on Isak\u2019s future above, and the striker\u2019s perspective, but it is clear that reintegrating him would be a huge task.\nHowe admitted on Friday that it is \u201cclear I can\u2019t involve\u201d Isak at the moment, while insisting that the striker \u201chas a future\u201d at St James\u2019. The head coach has managed the situation delicately, stressing that he can only work with players who \u201cwant\u201d to play for the club, and at the same time refusing to overtly criticise Isak.\nLiverpool have yet to return since seeing a \u00a3110m bid rejected at the start of this month, and Newcastle remain adamant, from the boardroom down, that Isak is not for sale. That message, which continues to be repeated, is only likely to soften if Newcastle sign two strikers and Liverpool offer a fee close to \u00a3150m.\nAdvertisement\nAs things stand, those two eventualities appear unlikely, which means the priority has to be on bringing in a replacement for Callum Wilson. Howe will also be hoping that he can use all of his man-management skills to coax Isak back around so that the Sweden international leads the line for the majority of the 2025-26 season, even if he is set to miss the start of the campaign. Whether or not that is possible remains to be seen.\nWissa would be the ideal replacement for Wilson, but Brentford will not sell until they sign a replacement and, even then, Newcastle have to agree a fee and will not overpay for a player who turns 29 next month. While Aghehowa has been watched and is liked, he is only 21, and a deal would be complicated and expensive. Wolverhampton Wanderers\u2019 Jorgen Strand Larsen has also been considered, though his club do not deem the striker to be for sale.\nNewcastle are actively pursuing alternatives in case the Wissa deal does not happen, though they are running out of time, and so Anthony Gordon is set to lead the line as a makeshift centre-forward against Aston Villa on Saturday.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nBeyond centre-forward, which is clearly their most pressing need, Howe ideally wants to sign another midfielder following Sean Longstaff\u2019s departure to Leeds United last month. Joe Willock is also suffering from a calf injury, which is set to keep him out for another month.\nAlthough Howe has an elite first-choice midfield of Joelinton, Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimaraes, and an exciting prospect as back-up in Lewis Miley, alongside Willock, the head coach likes to operate with six options, given he usually starts with three of them. Considering the additional demands of Champions League football, another midfielder is required.\nIdeally, an attacking midfielder in the No 8 mould would arrive. West Ham United\u2019s Lucas Paqueta is unlikely to be that addition, despite being linked, with Newcastle focusing on options elsewhere. As mentioned by David Ornstein, Newcastle are emerging as Jacob Ramsey\u2019s preferred destination.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nThere\u2019s a player whose name begins with \u201cI\u201d who you may have heard wants to leave, though Newcastle remain steadfast that Isak can and will be reintegrated, rather than join Liverpool.\nElsewhere, as The Athletic reported on Monday, Odysseas Vlachodimos is set to join Sevilla on a season-long loan. The Greece international made only one substitute appearance last season, and Newcastle are due to cover the majority of his wages. The framework of the deal being discussed does not include an option or obligation to buy and is just a straight loan.\nAdvertisement\nNewcastle would not stand in the way of full-backs Matt Targett or Harrison Ashby leaving.\nAs Isak\u2019s situation shows, Newcastle cannot take anything for granted, but they are determined to hold on to their other prize assets, Tonali, Guimaraes, Gordon and Tino Livramento.\nChris Waugh\nTottenham Hotspur\nWhat happened this week?\nThere were two big developments at Tottenham last week, both of them largely known in advance from the end of the Asia tour.\nFirst, Son Heung-min\u2019s departure was confirmed to LAFC in MLS after 10 years at Tottenham. He said some emotional goodbyes to the Spurs fans and is now already playing for his new club.\nSecond, the club confirmed the news that James Maddison ruptured his ACL and would need knee surgery. Beyond that, there have been no more arrivals since Joao Palhinha\u2019s loan from Bayern Munich was announced.\nThere have been other departures, specifically of young players going out on loan: Alfie Devine to Preston North End, Portsmouth for Yang Min-hyeok, Oxford United for Will Lankshear, Stoke City for Jamie Donley, Wycombe Wanderers for George Abbott and Notts County for Tyrese Hall.\nMikey Moore, who is on loan at Rangers, also signed a new long-term contract.\nSpurs travelled to Bayern Munich for a pre-season friendly on Thursday and lost 4-0.\nIs replacing Maddison now the priority?\nThomas Frank admitted in Munich last week that yes, Tottenham will be looking for players who can cover for Maddison following his knee injury. \u201cWe are definitely in the market in general,\u201d Frank said. \u201cOf course, when players get a long-term injury, we need to look into that.\u201d\nMaddison will miss much of this season after knee surgery, while Dejan Kulusevski, who had knee surgery of his own in May, will also miss the start of the season. \u201cOut for a long time\u201d is how Frank put it.\nAdvertisement\nSo Tottenham clearly need creative quality in attacking midfield before the start of the season. They have plenty of solidity in the middle of the pitch, especially after adding Palhinha this window.\nAnd they have plenty of pace in wide areas now, even more so after signing Mohammed Kudus from West Ham at the start of the window. But creativity in the No 10 role is the glaring issue with the squad.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nAttacking quality is the main focus at Spurs right now.\nThe Athletic reported on Monday morning that Spurs have approached Manchester City about signing Brazilian winger Savinho, discussing a package of roughly \u20ac50m for his signing. City, however, said that they do not want to sell Savinho and regard the matter as closed.\nTottenham are also big admirers of Nico Paz, the 20-year-old Argentina international currently at Como in Serie A. Como do not want to sell Paz either, and Real Madrid have the right to match any bid for Paz this summer.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nSpurs have now moved on most of their talented young players for loan spells, where they will play more football.\nThat means that the squad is starting to take shape for next season, although Dane Scarlett, who has been earmarked for a loan, is still there.\nThe final question relates to more experienced senior players, such as Yves Bissouma and Richarlison. If they go, then Spurs might have more space to bring more players in, but so far, nothing has happened.\nJack Pitt-Brooke\nWhy have some Premier League sides spent so little this summer?\nThe usual names dominate spending this summer, but it is worth a look at those occupying the other end of the scale.\nAt Crystal Palace, the \u00a32m signing of left-back Borna Sosa from Ajax comprises their only spending. Ten miles north west, purse strings have been even tighter: Fulham\u2019s only signing has been 34-year-old backup goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, arriving from Montpellier for less than \u00a3500,000.\nAdvertisement\nPalace\u2019s lack of spending looks hard to unravel from their recent ownership upheaval. For all the drama John Textor\u2019s presence brought to proceedings, he also brought plenty of funding; Palace\u2019s cash from its owners ticked up notably during his time, with \u00a330m or more pumped in in each of the past four seasons.\nThose Textor has left behind are hardly poor but Palace pre-Textor always had a focus on financial sustainability. Save for a \u00a324m injection in 2018-19 to help fund hefty transfer instalments, owner funding before his arrival was minimal, particularly by Premier League standards.\nPalace weren\u2019t in any danger of a profit and sustainability rules (PSR) breach this summer, but losses have leapt in recent years and are near \u00a3200m since the onset of the pandemic. Last season\u2019s sales of Michael Olise and Joachim Anderson brought in big money, but Palace boast neither spendthrift owners nor huge revenues.\nAt Fulham, Shahid Khan has spent lots during his 12 years at the helm, but the building of the new Riverside Stand has sapped resources. In four seasons from 2020-21 to 2023-24, Fulham spent \u00a3211m on infrastructure projects.\nKhan is hardly short, but Fulham need revenues to flow from that build for a couple of reasons. Like Palace, they were fine on PSR last year, but there\u2019s a looming threat. Fulham\u2019s 85 per cent wages-to-revenue ratio was the third highest in the Premier League in 2023-24 and, though the division will continue to operate a version of UEFA\u2019s \u2018squad cost\u2019 limits in shadow again this season, there\u2019s a need to have an eye on the future. Fulham\u2019s frugal summer is unlikely to be entirely agnostic of such considerations.\nWhile neither of those two have spent much, five others have sold more than they\u2019ve bought. Propping up the net spend table are Bournemouth, whose net \u00a370m income this summer is only set to increase with Illia Zabarnyi\u2019s big-money move to PSG confirmed today.\nOf those five clubs, four, including Bournemouth, finished between seventh and tenth last season. Nottingham Forest, Brighton and Brentford have all made net income of \u00a335m to \u00a340m this summer and, in the case of the latter two, successful player trading has been key to recent rises up the English pyramid.\nAdvertisement\nBrighton spent heavily last year but have returned to being bigger sellers than buyers. They, like those around them, essentially have to trade their way up the table, as they don\u2019t boast the big non-transfer revenues of some others.\nLast season\u2019s mid-table sides are generating plenty in sales this summer, but their ability to progress further will be dictated by how well they\u2019re able to reinvest it \u2014 especially at Bournemouth.\nChris Weatherspoon\nBarcelona\nWhat happened this week?\nBarcelona finished their pre-season with a 5-0 win against Serie A side Como to claim the Joan Gamper Trophy, with Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez scoring two goals apiece.\nThere have been plenty more off-pitch issues in the past week, though. Marc-Andre ter Stegen was stripped of his captaincy on Thursday after refusing to allow Barca to share his surgery reports with La Liga, with the club looking to use a rule regarding injured players to register a new signing under the league\u2019s salary limit regulations.\nIf La Liga\u2019s medical panel consider Ter Stegen\u2019s back injury to be long-term \u2014 i.e. it deems the German to be out for at least four months \u2014 Barca would be allowed to use the equivalent of a significant chunk of his salary to register one new player.\nThe 34-year-old took a step back a day later, posting a statement on social media in which he said he was keen to cooperate with the club and gave his consent for them to file his medical reports to La Liga. As soon as that happened, Barca released a new statement on Friday night, reinstating him as team captain.\nTer Stegen spoke to fans at the Estadi Johan Cruyff before the Joan Gamper game and said he was happy to leave his problems with the club behind.\nThere was also an unexpected move: Martinez left to join Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League. Al Nassr offered the 34-year-old centre-back a significant salary improvement, and Martinez left for free, per a \u2018gentleman\u2019s agreement\u2019 between player and club last summer when he had received another lucrative proposal from the Saudi Pro League.\nBarca agreed to show openness to let him go if a new offer came in this summer, as was the case here. Martinez did not feature in the final two games of their pre-season tour in South Korea with negotiations ongoing at the time.\nHow much of a financial boost is Martinez\u2019s exit?\nBarca sources say Martinez\u2019s exit takes off \u20ac14m from their wage bill for this season. But the Catalans will not be able to use all of it to register their new signings. As they are still spending above their salary limit, La Liga does not allow them to spend every euro of new income freely (the so-called 1:1 rule), so they can only use 60 per cent of the salary space freed up by Martinez for new signings.\nAdvertisement\nThe club admit that it will not be enough to get all the new registrations done. Barca are still waiting for money from the VIP seating sale they agreed in January to be approved by their auditors and counted as part of their budget.\nBarca believe they should be in a strong position once that is approved, but there is no indication this will happen before the end of the week, with the first game of the season against Real Mallorca on Saturday.\nFor now, new signings Joan Garcia, Marcus Rashford and Wojciech Szczesny (following his short-term deal last season) are not registered, and therefore cannot play in that game. Fellow new arrival Roony Bardghji isn\u2019t either, but he could be approved as a reserve team player. Club sources say left-back Gerard Martin also needs to be registered as part of the first team after being promoted from the second team, Barca Atletic, last season.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nHansi Flick said after the Como win that he does not expect the club to make any signings to replace Martinez. \u201cI will speak with Deco when he\u2019s around here, but for now I don\u2019t think any new signing will come in,\u201d he told Catalan television station TV3.\nBarca are not actively working on more signings as they believe all positions are well-covered. In Martinez\u2019s absence, players such as Ronald Araujo and Andreas Christensen are expected to step up and fill the gap.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nGoalkeeper Inaki Pena has been on the list of potential departures since the start of pre-season. The 26-year-old is expected to leave, with all parties involved agreeing it is the best solution for him.\nBarca sources and voices within the player\u2019s camp say there have been approaches from multiple clubs, including Como and Celta Vigo. But Barca are hesitant to let him go before they register their new goalkeeper Garcia, who signed from local rivals Espanyol earlier this summer.\nAdvertisement\nAs things stand, Pena is the only first-team \u2019keeper registered for Barca in La Liga \u2014 and therefore the only one who could play on Saturday. Club sources expect to make progress with Pena\u2019s exit as soon as there is progress with registrations.\nThe club have also allowed 19-year-old right-back Hector Fort to look for more playing time elsewhere. They are open to letting him go on loan or move permanently, but would look to keep a buy-back clause. Jules Kounde and Eric Garcia are ahead of Fort in the pecking order.\nAnd finally there is Oriol Romeu \u2014 yes, he is still a Barca player. They signed him in 2023, and he is entering the final year of his contract. The club plan to agree to a contract termination with him and he is in talks with other teams, including Girona \u2014 who Barca signed him from, and where he spent last season on loan.\nPol Ballus\nReal Madrid\nWhat happened this week?\nThe main news was academy graduate Gonzalo Garcia\u2019s renewal until 2030, making him a first-team player. The Athletic reported in the previous edition of The Transfer DealSheet that his agent was in talks with the club over the extension.\nThe club have rewarded the 21-year-old striker for his impressive performances at the Club World Cup. He arrived at that tournament with plans to leave in search of more playing time \u2014 with Getafe then very well positioned to sign him \u2014 but ended it as top scorer with four goals and an assist in six games.\nXabi Alonso\u2019s confidence in Gonzalo was a key factor in the decision, especially given doubts about his playing time with Endrick coming back from injury. The young Brazilian has been handed Madrid\u2019s iconic No 9 shirt, as first revealed by The Athletic, despite reports suggesting it would go to Gonzalo.\nGonzalo will wear 16, while summer signing Franco Mastantuono will be given the only remaining number, 25. The Argentine, who was signed from River Plate in June for around \u20ac63.2m, is expected to be officially unveiled on Thursday and will take the final spot in Madrid\u2019s 25-man La Liga squad.\nReinier Jesus\u2019 exit to Atletico Mineiro on a free transfer was also officially announced. The 23-year-old Brazilian midfielder left without having made his first-team debut after Madrid paid Flamengo \u20ac30m for him in 2020. The Spanish club retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause.\nWhy does Alonso\u2019s opinion of the squad\u2019s readiness differ from the club\u2019s?\nFirstly, because coaches generally always want more signings, while the board, who are responsible for balancing the books, are more cautious.\nSenior Madrid sources say that each position is covered by two players, all 25 places in the team\u2019s La Liga squad are filled and that nobody wants to leave. Alonso understands the situation but would ideally like more reinforcements.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nNone actively. If there are no further exits \u2014 and no player has indicated a desire to leave at this point \u2014 there is no room for new arrivals.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nFor now, nobody has expressed an interest in leaving.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the squad is closed yet,\u201d one anonymous player told The Athletic, saying that with every position filled, some players will barely be given any playing time.\nPeople at the club are keen to see David Alaba or Ferland Mendy leave, but are pessimistic about their chances of offloading them.\nAlonso and his staff would also welcome departures if it would help bring in new signings. Rodrygo is not expected to be a key player this season under the coach and the club\u2019s plans, with Premier League clubs interested in him.\nSome at Madrid believe a lack of playing time for certain players at the start of the season could lead to some movement, but that is just a feeling behind the scenes at the club.\nMario Cortegana\nWould a Premier League side benefit from signing Rodrygo this summer?\nIn Real Madrid\u2019s star-studded attack, Brazilian winger Rodrygo can often feel like the forgotten man. With the club now open to selling him, it seems he\u2019s not at the forefront of Alonso\u2019s mind either.\nWhile he hasn\u2019t always matched the ludicrously high standards set by Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior, that shouldn\u2019t obscure the fact that he is a hugely talented player in his own right.\nRodrygo\u2019s attacking numbers last season \u2014 six goals and five assists \u2014 don\u2019t leap off the page. But that was partly due to the more selfless role he played under Carlo Ancelotti. Shunted to the right to make room for Mbappe, he gave up his most prolific position on the left for the good of the team.\nHis versatility has been invaluable for Real Madrid, filling in across the width of the pitch, and on occasion even playing centre forward. It speaks to the multi-faceted nature of his game that he remains effective wherever deployed.\nRodrygo is a skilful ball carrier \u2014 ranking 12th in La Liga last season for successful take-ons per 90 \u2014 and he drives his team upfield with invention. His relentless work off the ball allows his more illustrious team-mates to conserve energy for decisive moments in attack.\nThere are few attacking talents as well-rounded as Rodrygo at the sharp end of the game. Real Madrid might be about to offer up one of the bargains of the summer.\nConor O\u2019Neill\n(Top image \u2014 Illustration: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; Mike Hewitt, George Wood / Getty Images)"
