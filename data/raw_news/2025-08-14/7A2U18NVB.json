  "title": "Judge blocks Trump administration from withholding grants in lawsuit Nashville joined",
  "description": "Nashville is party to another successful lawsuit against the Trump admin, alleging federal agencies imposed political conditions on grant funds.",
  "content": "\u2022 The most recent ruling halts federal agencies from withholding grant funds if cities don't implement the Trump administration's policy agenda.\n\u2022 This is the third lawsuit against the Trump administration that Nashville has joined this year.\n\nA U.S. District Court judge has ruled in favor of dozens of local governments and agencies, including Nashville, who in May sued several Trump administration officials and federal agencies alleging they were imposing political conditions on grant funds that had already been appropriated by Congress.\n\nOn Aug. 12, Senior U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a preliminary injunction in the case, effectively halting nearly a dozen agencies from withholding billions in federal grants if those cities didn\u2019t implement the Trump administration\u2019s policy agenda \u2014 including not using those funds to promote gender ideology, illegal immigration or diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, according to the suit.\n\nIn her opinion, Rothstein writes that it\u2019s Congress, not the president, that has the authority to make judgments about how to allocate federal funding.\n\n\u201cYet that is precisely what the plaintiffs in this case allege the current administration has attempted to override,\u201d Rothstein\u2019s ruling reads. \u201cThey contend that the Trump administration unlawfully seeks to impose hotly contested political conditions on funds that Congress has already appropriated \u2014 substituting the executive\u2019s preferences for the will of Congress, in clear defiance of constitutional limits.\u201d\n\nThe Tennessean reached out to Nashville's Law Department for comment, but it hasn't responded as of 4 p.m. Aug. 14.\n\nSeveral rulings in the case extend injunction to more cities, agencies\n\nThis is just the latest in a string of successful rulings for the plaintiffs in the case, in part because they\u2019ve submitted several amended complaints adding more cities, counties and agencies to the list so they\u2019ll receive the same injunction.\n\nWhen it was first filed May 2, the suit included cities like San Francisco, Boston and New York. Nashville joined the group in a May 21 amended filing, and dozens more came on board then and in the most recent filing from July 10.\n\nAll told, the now-sizable group contends that more than $12 billion in collective funding is under threat. For Nashville that includes $289,354 in grants through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, designed to help individuals and families experiencing homelessness move into transitional and permanent housing, and a combined $23 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from the legal filings exactly how Nashville\u2019s grant awards wouldn\u2019t have complied with the president\u2019s funding conditions. But the suit does include examples from other jurisdictions \u2014 like Petaluma, California, where HUD threatened to disapprove the community\u2019s action plan for funds because it includes references to equity, environmental justice, transgender or gender non-conforming individuals and undocumented individuals.\n\nEach amended filing has added several more federal agencies and their appointed heads as defendants, as well. Beyond the two affecting Nashville, the list now includes agencies like the Federal Highway Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNashville, Trump admin no strangers to courtroom in 2025\n\nThis is just the latest in a string of several lawsuits against the Trump administration that include Nashville as a plaintiff.\n\nThe first foray was in late March, when Nashville signed on to a suit led by the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Public Rights Project to halt the federal funding freeze.\n\nAbout two months later, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must reinstate the grants reflected in that lawsuit, which had been appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\nAnd in late April, Nashville joined three other local governments and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to sue Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over sweeping public health funding cuts. For Nashville, the cuts affected funding from the CDC\u2019s Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity program and an Immunization and Vaccines for Children grant, first awarded during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThat effort, too, was successful, as U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper ruled on June 17 that the Trump administration couldn\u2019t claw back millions in public health funding \u2014 but only from the local jurisdictions reflected in the suit, and not nationwide as the suit also requested.\n\nAustin Hornbostel is the Metro reporter for The Tennessean.

That roadway isn't far from Murfreesboro Pike, which already carries a high volume of traffic through the area.\nResidents of the neighborhood like Mitchell Miller who spoke during the meeting's general public comment period noted that opposition had mounted to include signatures from roughly 1,400 Nashvillians calling on Benton to hit the brakes on the bill.\nThose commenters also lauded Benton for listening to his constituents and taking steps to address road safety first before proceeding with the bill.\n\"Councilman Benton has listened, and he has promised us that he will not allow further development on this road until the city can keep us safe where we live under the existing law,\" Miller said. \"We appreciate that, and we hope the council will continue to act in that manner and be as responsive to constituents as Mr. Benton is being today.\"\nFrom here, it's not clear when it could return to a Council agenda for consideration \u2014 but when it does, it will be on its third and final reading, meaning it'll need only one more affirmative vote from council members for approval.\nAustin Hornbostel is the Metro reporter for The Tennessean.

      "text": "Nashville transit plan clears final legal hurdle as TN Supreme Court rejects opposition's appeal\n- The court ruled unanimously to reject the appeal, bringing an end to a legal challenge that's been underway since the beginning of 2025.\n- Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell is celebrating the ruling as a win for the plan.\nThe road ahead for Nashville\u2019s Choose How You Move transportation improvement program is as clear as ever \u2014 the Tennessee Supreme Court has rejected a final appeal from the opposition group that\u2019s been seeking to reverse the referendum overwhelmingly approved by voters in late 2024.\nThe court\u2019s ruling was unanimous, according to court documents. It\u2019s the last in a string of legal wins for the transit plan, which has been challenged in the courtroom since the start of the year. Former Metro Council member Emily Evans and her opposition group, the Committee to Stop an UnFair Tax, have been attempting to block the plan from taking effect.\nThe plan made it through its first trial in Davidson County Chancery Court untouched, just weeks before the city began collecting on the referendum\u2019s half-cent sales tax. Evans and the group did notch a more favorable ruling after advancing to the Tennessee Court of Appeals, which nixed part of the plan calling for the acquisition of land for affordable housing and parks using funds raised through the surcharge. Even with the Supreme Court rejection, the appeals court ruling stands.\nThe funds involved only amount to about 1% of the plan's total surcharge revenue, judges at the appeals court said. Metro Legal Director Wally Dietz has said the affected parts of the plan can be financed from \"non-transit funds.\"\nNashville Mayor Freddie O\u2019Connell is celebrating the latest ruling as another win for his plan, which cruised to passage with 66% of the vote.\n\u201cNashvillians overwhelmingly told us \u2014 \u2018We want a better transportation future,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Connell said in a statement to The Tennessean on Aug. 11. \u201cToday, I\u2019m pleased with the court\u2019s decision and am excited about the progress we\u2019re already making to bring better sidewalks, signals, service and safety to communities across the county.\u201d\nWhile the litigation has been underway, Choose How You Move-funded projects have continued to move forward. Sabrina Sussman, the chief program officer overseeing the plan, has said Nashvillians can expect to see work continue to add 86 miles of new and upgraded sidewalks and nearly 600 smart traffic signals through the fall.\nAustin Hornbostel is the Metro reporter for The Tennessean.

Metro included those funds in its Transportation Improvement Program budget for this fiscal year. And the East Nashville Spokes project was incorporated into the larger Choose How You Move transit plan but, with funds frozen, has \u201clanguished in uncertainty.\u201d\nLike Nashville, cities such as Baltimore, Maryland, and Madison, Wisconsin, have also been impacted by the federal funding freeze. The suit states it\u2019s caused disruptions to a training program preparing young adults for jobs in the water and solid waste industries in Baltimore and to a project to improve housing affordability through home energy upgrades in Madison.\nMetro Director of Law Wally Dietz is one of several representatives quoted in a Southern Environmental Law Center news release about the lawsuit. In the release, Dietz said the suit asks the federal grant funding approved by Congress and awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation be delivered to Nashville \u201cas promised.\u201d\n\u201cFor more than 200 years, local, state and federal governments have reliably worked together to implement programs that benefit people all over America,\u201d Dietz said. \u201cMetro Nashville filed this suit because the constitutional separation of powers must be maintained. No president, much less a non-federal employee at a fictional agency, has the authority to freeze funds appropriated by Congress.\u201d\nAustin Hornbostel is the Metro reporter for The Tennessean.

      "text": "The Nations neighbors divided over plans to add new homes\n- The plan would rezone about 300 acres worth of properties in the neighborhood, many to a zoning category allowing up to 40 housing units per acre.\n- Supporters lauded the proposal for making housing more affordable by allowing more options, while opponents knocked a \"rushed\" planning process that many said they weren't able to engage with.\n- Council members considered \u2014 and ultimately tabled \u2014 a motion to defer the bill after many opponents called for more time to address their concerns.\nNashville residents in The Nations are divided over a proposal to rezone about 300 acres to allow more housing.\nThat was the case, at least, at the Aug. 5 Metro Nashville Council meeting, when nearly 60 people weighed in on the bill as part of a public hearing.\nAfter nearly two hours of comments council members voted 26-7 to advance the bill, which was on its second of three readings, to be considered for one last hurdle at the group\u2019s next meeting. Council members Joy Kimbrough, Jeff Eslick, Thom Druffel, Bob Nash, Tasha Ellis, John Rutherford and Joy Styles voted against the bill. Four council members \u2014 Jennifer Gamble, Jennifer Webb, David Benton and Antoinette Lee \u2014 abstained.\nSupporters called the plan a blueprint for Nashville\u2019s other council districts to follow in addressing Nashville\u2019s housing shortage, which recent planning studies have noted will require 90,000 more housing units over the next decade to keep up with demand. But opponents argued the plan is far too sweeping and drastic \u2014 and that much of the neighborhood has not had the time or ability to communicate their concerns.\nHere\u2019s what else Nashvillians and council members said about the plan.\nNeighbors object to more housing\nThe plan aims to rezone those 300 acres, largely consisting of residential properties, to a zoning category allowing up to 40 housing units per acre. District 20 Council Member Rollin Horton, who is the bill\u2019s sponsor and represents The Nations, has told The Tennessean the average lot size in the neighborhood is a tenth of an acre. That would equate to a maximum of four housing units, proportional to the size of those lots.\nA group of about 30 Nashvillians still expressed concern about the new zoning category leading to development not on a smaller scale but on a staggering one.\nThat was just one of a myriad of concerns \u2014 some said it would worsen gentrification, displace low-income residents and exacerbate existing infrastructure issues. Others said they opposed the plan because it doesn\u2019t mandate affordable housing units in new developments or guarantee walkability. Others still said allowing greater housing density would mean more traffic and more flooding.\nBut the loudest objection was to what some neighbors called a \u201crushed,\u201d \u201cflawed\u201d and \u201cincomplete\u201d public process. Though Horton said he had meetings with the Nations Neighborhood Association during the past 18 months, many opponents said that group included only a small share of neighbors and called for council members to defer the bill to give time for more people to provide feedback.\nOne of those calls came from former Council member Duane Dominy, who represented District 28 from 2007 to 2015.\n\u201cA deferral on this grants the opportunity to develop the public sentiment, and a re-referral to the Planning Commission allows whatever amendments are done for this plan to be reconsidered, and I respectfully request that that\u2019s what be done,\u201d Dominy said.\nSupporters, meanwhile, lauded what Horton calls \u201cThe Nations Neighborhood Plan\u201d for allowing additional housing options, which they said are part of the puzzle in making housing more affordable. They also said the plan will not worsen but improve the neighborhood\u2019s tree canopy \u2014 it would nearly triple The Nations\u2019 tree density requirements \u2014 and flooding issues by, for the first time, capping the percentage of surfaces like pavement that prevent stormwater infiltration.\nSome showed support for several other allowances and restrictions in the plan. The zoning change would be to a type that prevents the development of new short-term rentals, for example, and the new set of development standards would allow property owners to add detached accessory dwelling units throughout the neighborhood.\nNashville council members debate pros, cons of more homes\nSeveral council members heeded community member calls to consider a deferral. District 32 Council Member Joy Styles was the first, calling for a six-meeting deferral. That motion was eventually tabled, and subsequent motions to defer for a shorter timeframe from Council members Jennifer Gamble and Jeff Eslick weren\u2019t taken up for being too similar.\n\u201cWe do need more housing, but do we need more housing against the will of people that moved into neighborhoods for specific reasons?\u201d Styles said. \u201cWe need to figure out where we\u2019re putting our density. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want density, but it needs to be in an appropriate place. And why are we going to sit here tonight and say that all of these constituents are wrong?\u201d\nBut ultimately, a large majority of council members backed moving the bill on in the process. Those who voiced that support during council discussion included District 14 Council Member Jordan Huffman, who said the plan was a \"proactive solution for smart growth,\" and District 30 Council Member Sandra Sepulveda, who said it takes more people to speed up the process of improving infrastructure.\n\"We need housing, period,\" Huffman said. \"Nashville's in a housing crisis. We can't keep saying that we support affordable and attainable housing, and then block every tool that makes it possible.\"\nHorton has already suggested that there will be some changes by the group\u2019s next meeting. He said he\u2019s planning for amendments that address some concerns neighbors flagged during the public hearing, specifically regarding what some called a \u201cdeveloper bonus\u201d allowing extra height over the maximum for some buildings.\nAustin Hornbostel is the Metro reporter for The Tennessean.

      "text": "Judge rules Trump administration must restore grants to Nashville, other cities\n- Nashville joined five other cities and about a dozen nonprofits to sue the Trump administration in late March, aiming to halt the administration's funding freeze.\n- The May 19 ruling in U.S. District Court prohibits federal officials from freezing or terminating most of the grants in the lawsuit, including a combined $14 million awarded to Nashville.\nA federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must reinstate grants awarded to several American cities, including Nashville.\nNashville was one of six cities that joined with nearly a dozen nonprofits, led by the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Public Rights Project, to file a lawsuit in late March aiming to halt the Trump administration's funding freeze.\nIn a May 19 ruling, U.S. District Judge Richard Mark Gergel prohibited federal officials from freezing or terminating a majority of the grants reflected in the lawsuit and ordered the funding to be restored.\nEach plaintiff in the suit was awarded funding under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and other federal statutes. For Nashville, that included a combined $14 million in funding for the \u201cElectrify Music City\u201d project, which would upgrade and expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and the \u201cEast Nashville Spokes\u201d project to help fund a transit connection project, including protected bike lanes and pedestrian improvements.\nHere's what else to know about the ruling, which the Southern Environmental Law Center says is one of the first final judgments in a case challenging the administration's actions.\nNashville legal director: 'Only the courts can protect the rule of law'\nGergel issued what's known as a permanent injunction in the case, meaning that the court's decision was final. Failure to comply with an injunction can result in a party being held in contempt of court, but permanent injunctions may also be appealed. As part of the ruling, the Trump administration must confirm it's compliance within a week.\nNashville Director of Law Wally Dietz told The Tennessean that the ruling was the product of \"excellent legal work\" from the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Public Rights Project and Metro Nashville attorneys Courtney Mohan and Lora Fox.\n\"The president's administration exceeded its constitutional authority when it rescinded these grants,\" Dietz said. \"Only the courts can protect the rule of law.\"\nAccording to the ruling, the Trump administration conceded that its decision to cancel grant funding based on executive orders violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how federal agencies can develop and issue regulations.\nThat ruling applies only to 32 of the 38 grants in the suit that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The other six, per the ruling, were funded by general appropriations to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, rather than through an act of Congress.\nNashville is still waiting for a ruling in its second lawsuit against the Trump administration, filed in late April over recent public health funding cuts that the city argues are unconstitutional.\nAustin Hornbostel is the Metro reporter for The Tennessean.

      "text": "Nashville mayor presses Musk's Boring Co. with safety questions on Music City Loop plan\n- An email from Dave Rosenberg, the director of legislative affairs for the mayor's office, lists dozens of questions about the underground tunnel project announced on July 28.\n- About a third of the questions on that list address safety concerns or seek clarification about how first responders would respond to incidents inside the tunnel system.\n- Other questions seek clarify on infrastructure considerations, including how The Boring Company plans to address the challenge of drilling through the hard limestone bedrock underneath the city.\nHow many questions is Nashville Mayor Freddie O\u2019Connell\u2019s office asking about the Music City Loop project? As it turns out, quite a few.\nThe mayor's office submitted dozens of questions \u2014 like the total cost, who will own the tunnel long-term and what the environmental review process might entail \u2014 to Elon Musk's Boring Co., according to an email from Dave Rosenberg, the mayor's director of legislative affairs.\nThe email was sent to Metro Nashville Council members and Vice Mayor Angie Henderson on Aug. 5 and shared with The Tennessean a day later.\nRosenberg\u2019s message notes that interest from the company apparently was not initially focused on connecting downtown Nashville with Nashville International Airport but on the still-developing East Bank instead.\n\u201cWe first heard informal chatter about Boring considering a tunnel on the East Bank last spring, but, like many speculative ideas that cross the mayor\u2019s desk, it came and went without follow-up or signs of a serious proposal,\u201d Rosenberg\u2019s email states.\nCompany officials and state leaders like Gov. Bill Lee announced the tunnel project plans on July 28 to connect Nashville's airport with downtown. However, Metro Nashville leaders were not involved in the announcement.\nState officials approved a free lease July 31 for The Boring Co. to do construction staging on a 0.8-acre section of the Tennessee State Capitol parking lot until after the tunnel is complete next year.\nMeanwhile, questions from the mayor's office include: Who will be responsible for responding to crashes that take place within the tunnel system? How will construction impact above-ground efforts to improve public transit as part of Nashville\u2019s Choose How You Move program?\nWill The Boring Co.'s Nashville tunnel be safe?\nOf the 79 bullet-pointed questions listed in Rosenberg\u2019s email, a third of them address safety or logistics.\nOne question asks how emergency vehicles will access the tunnel during and after construction. It states the Boring Co. tunnel project in Las Vegas provided ATVs outfitted by the local fire department to access the tunnel with all necessary rescue equipment.\nAnother questions the safety of the width of the Las Vegas tunnel, which is not much larger than the Tesla cars that use it, and how emergency personnel will reach the people inside vehicles.\nStill, other questions on the list make it clear that the city does not yet know who exactly will be expected to respond in such cases.\nOne asks who will be responsible for managing security for tunnel access. Another wonders whether the Metro Nashville Police Department or the Tennessee Highway Patrol will be responsible for responding to traffic crashes. Several questions seek more detail on emergency contingencies if the tunnel needs to be shut down, including in the wake of roadway homicides, shootings and fatalities.\nFurther safety questions include whether 9-1-1 calls could be placed clearly from underground, or whether the tunnel will support radio communications between first responders and surface-level dispatchers. Also, where would smoke and hazardous gas vent if a vehicle battery ignites while within it? How will they ensure pedestrians don\u2019t access the tunnel?\nNashville mayor seeks answers on Music City Loop plan: Rain? Permitting? Public input?\nAnother group of questions on the list seeks answers to questions of infrastructure and exactly which local agencies The Boring Company is coordinating with.\nOne of them, for example, claims the Las Vegas tunnel isn\u2019t built to drain rainwater \u2014 leaving rainfall from either end to flow freely into either end and potentially shut down operations. The mayor\u2019s office is asking how that issue will be mitigated in Nashville, which is already prone to flooding.\nOther questions ask who will permit the project, and who's responsible for reviewing construction plans. There\u2019s also a question asking if the community will be provided with an opportunity to provide input on any phases of the design and construction process.\nMany of the questions center around construction. One asks what happens if the project starts and is abandoned, and another seeks clarity about the proposed diameter and depth of the underground tunnel system.\nThere\u2019s also a question about how the company plans to address challenges like existing underground infrastructure and drilling through the limestone underneath the city. Hard bedrock has also been cited as a concern for past Nashville tunnel proposals. Boring Co. CEO Steve Davis said the challenge is \u201can engineering problem that\u2019s fairly straightforward to solve.\u201d\nSeveral questions ask about how below-ground work will affect above-ground infrastructure \u2014 like roads, transit routes, and public and private parking. One of them asks exactly where within downtown Nashville the company anticipates it will site its subterranean station.\nSome of the questions related to surface-level work are about projects included in the Choose How You Move plan like planned improvements along Murfreesboro Pike, which runs between the airport and downtown, or how the project will minimize disruptions to a planned public transit center in the SoBro neighborhood.\nThere\u2019s also a question of whether the project will account for ongoing Tennessee Department of Transportation work to implement choice lanes along the I-24 corridor.\nAustin Hornbostel is the Metro reporter for The Tennessean.

      "text": "Nashville sues RFK Jr. and HHS over 'devastating' public health funding cuts\n- Nashville lost millions in previously guaranteed grant funds after federal authorities slashed $11 billion in public health funding.\n- Nashville's lawsuit argues the funds were authorized by Congress, and the abrupt and unilateral cuts illegally circumvented the congressional process.\nNashville has sued Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over recent \"devastating\" public health funding cuts the city argues are unconstitutional.\nThe lawsuit alleges the sweeping, unilateral nature of the abrupt cuts were illegal and lack Congressional approval, despite the fact the funds had previously been reviewed and approved by Congress.\n\u201cSecretary Kennedy and HHS have exceeded their constitutional authority,\" Metro's Legal Director Wally Dietz said in a statement to The Tennessean. \"It does not matter if these grants do not fit with the new President\u2019s views. They were authorized by Congress and the funds were appropriated by Congress. If the new federal government wishes to change these grants, they must go to Congress to change the law. We do not have a king.\u201d\nKennedy happened to be in Nashville on April 24, the day the lawsuit was filed, speaking about his recovery from addiction at a convention.\nNashville joined three other local governments and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in filing the lawsuit in a Washington D.C. federal court. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in addition to its director, are also named plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit seeks to reverse the HHS decision and reinstate the grant programs.\nOn March 23, HHS abruptly razed $11 billion in public health funding as part of the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, which aims to cut down government spending.\nThe Trump administration has characterized the funds as COVID-era funding that should be sunset. But the grants supported broader public health initiatives beyond the pandemic, and Nashville's lawsuit argues Congress had repeatedly reviewed and renewed some of the grants well after the height of the pandemic.\nThe Tennessee Department of Health, through which the majority of the grant money flows to Tennessee communities, has refused to answer repeated inquiries about how much money the state stands to lose and what public health programs the funds support. State officials have claimed the cuts will not impact services to Tennesseans, though a DOGE database revealed the state stands to lose grants totaling $224 million in the cuts.\n\"Nothing in the Constitution empowers agencies\u2014or the President\u2014to usurp Congress\u2019s exclusive power of the purse and refuse to spend appropriated funds for the purposes Congress specified,\" the lawsuit states. \"Second, Defendants\u2019 actions violate Congress\u2019s appropriation statutes, which make no mention of termination upon the conclusion of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Indeed, Congress\u2019s actions after the emergency was declared over indicate that Congress did not want the funding to end in the way Defendants terminated it.\"\nNashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell in early April said there could be direct impacts at the Metro Health Department, highlighting a program that helps expectant and young mothers and an HIV/AIDS intervention program.\nAt his weekly media roundtable April 25, O\u2019Connell addressed those impacts further, noting that the grants also covered public health initiatives like lab testing for infectious diseases.\n\u201cIf the HHS program termination continues, we will have to curtail vaccinations for children (and) access to lab testing for infectious disease \u2014 in fact, some Nashvillians might never get test results from tests they\u2019ve already taken from a lab because of this action,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\nThe lawsuit cites cuts to a child vaccination program and states Nashville Public Health lost funding for 16 positions, including six new jobs it was hiring for a homeless services program that has now been shuttered. Nashville had to lay off three employees.\nMetro has already taken legal action against the Trump administration. In March, Nashville signed on to a lawsuit seeking to halt the Trump administration\u2019s federal funding freeze on Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act grants."

      "text": "Nashville Mayor O'Connell navigates rocky second year: Federal clashes, state tension\n- O'Connell's first year was marked by a series of accomplishments, highlighted by his Choose How You Move plan, while 2025 has been filled with more negative scrutiny of Nashville.\n- Tennessee lawmakers on both sides of the aisle may disagree on policy, but both describe a rocky relationship between Nashville and the state.\n- O'Connell acknowledged external pressures, but said his office is more focused on meeting the needs of Nashvillians in ways both big and small.\nNashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell was conspicuously absent when plans to build a 10-mile tunnel under his city were announced by Elon Musk's Boring Co. and state leaders on July 28.\nIn a sense, the moment was emblematic of his second year in office. As polarizing cultural battles and high-stakes political clashes have unfolded around him, O'Connell has largely kept a low profile. The opening half of O\u2019Connell\u2019s first term has been a tale of two very different years \u2014 one colored by significant early achievements and the other marred by disputes with President Donald Trump's administration and Republican state leaders that have brought intense scrutiny.\nTensions with the White House over federal funding cuts grew this year. In May and June, a sweeping nationwide immigration crackdown led to the arrests of hundreds in Nashville, further straining relations. During a Nashville visit in July, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem criticized O'Connell for releasing communications to the public that contained the names of immigration officials involved in local detentions.\nAll the while, an already strained relationship between Democrat-led Nashville and Tennessee's Republican leadership has simmered under the surface.\nBut to the mayor, that's mostly political noise. The work his office is doing \u2014 both visible and not \u2014 to drive progress in Nashville is more important.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, there have been external pressures,\u201d O\u2019Connell told The Tennessean. \"But I think we intentionally seek to avoid opportunities for distraction and stay focused on those baseline priorities that we got from our transition committees. The ways those have factored into the major initiatives of East Bank, transit, now the Housing Strategy and building a budget that, I hope, can give Nashvillians confidence for the rest of this term.\u201d\nWhen it comes to the relationship between Nashville and the state, politicians on both sides of the aisle can at least agree on one thing: it\u2019s rocky.\n\u201cYou\u2019re either wanting to improve the city and the state or you\u2019re not,\u201d Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, told The Tennessean. \u201cSometimes you do have to put politics aside. It seems like Metro is maybe not doing that to the degree that they should be.\u201d\nRep. Aftyn Behn, D-Nashville, said she can empathize with service-driven elected officials like O'Connell. But she also had a critique for the mayor: We're in a \u201cfrothing\u201d and \u201crelentless\u201d political landscape that requires more pushback, and making an effort to \u201cplay nice\u201d hasn\u2019t helped.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d Behn said. \u201cI feel a lot of sympathy for Freddie. He wanted to be a good government bureaucrat and pick up trash and have a few more buses running. That is not the moment we\u2019re operating in.\u201d\nNashville's 10th mayor navigates highs, lows\nIt didn\u2019t take long after O\u2019Connell started his term on Sept. 30, 2024, for him to make a good first impression. He\u2019d won handily in the runoff to become Nashville\u2019s 10th mayor and, within months, was tasked with being a source of stability in the wake of devastating storms and tornadoes that swept through Middle Tennessee in December.\nStability was something many Nashvillians had likely been craving. Over the preceding decade, Nashville went through four mayors \u2014 O\u2019Connell becoming the fifth in that span \u2014 and had been embroiled in tension with state lawmakers on the other side of the political spectrum.\nBy the second half of June 2024, O\u2019Connell was celebrating the unanimous passage of the city budget. Weeks later, the mayor and investment partners launched the $75 million Nashville Catalyst Fund, offering flexible loans to affordable housing developers.\nBut perhaps the biggest victory of them all was still to come. In November, Davidson County voters overwhelmingly approved O\u2019Connell\u2019s $3.1 billion Choose How You Move transportation improvement plan.\nO\u2019Connell rode all of that momentum to high approval ratings in Vanderbilt University polling \u2014 71% in 2024 and 67% in 2025. Editors at The Tennessean even selected him as Tennessean of the Year for 2024.\nIt\u2019s been a different story this year.\nA record surge in countywide property values meant that, despite O'Connell touting the second budget of his term as having the lowest property tax rate in Nashville\u2019s history, the spike in assessments translated into higher tax bills \u2014 and mounting frustration \u2014 for many homeowners.\nPolitical tensions flared again with the recent announcement that The Boring Co. struck a deal with state leaders to construct an underground Tesla highway from Nashville International Airport to the Tennessee State Capitol and Music City Center in downtown Nashville.\nThen there\u2019s the ongoing legal battle concerning a state law, passed in 2023, that would cut the size of the 40-member Metro Nashville Council in half. The state is also seeking to legally take control of Nashville airport's governing board.\nThe most high-profile clash of 2025 has played out in the wake of a May U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Nashville that, by late June, had resulted in hundreds of arrests.\nEarly in his term, O\u2019Connell sped up reporting requirements for city departments communicating with federal immigration officials. That move drew national attention when a public spreadsheet briefly revealed agent names. That triggered a Congressional investigation and backlash from Trump administration figures including Noem and Tom Homan.\nNashville's mayor wants 'customer-focused government'\nO'Connell has said little about the year's political turbulence, offering only sparse public remarks on the Boring Co. tunnel project and rarely criticizing state or federal leaders unless Nashville is directly affected.\nInstead, he's concentrated on running a \u201ccustomer-focused government.\u201d He said that means meeting the needs of Nashvillians in all the small ways as well, like digging into Metro Parks\u2019 backlog of deferred maintenance projects or delivering reliable service on everything from trash collection to pothole repair.\nThe throughline from his mayoral campaign, O\u2019Connell said, was to be ready to work on day one. It was that preparedness that made it possible to tackle significant projects like Choose How You Move and development on Nashville\u2019s East Bank in the first calendar year of his term, he said. O\u2019Connell has also recently highlighted \"historic gains\u201d in school performance and a year-over-year decline in crime.\n\u201cThis is a process of continuous improvement,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cI would say our goal is to make sure Nashvillians understand what local government is doing, why we\u2019re doing it and that we\u2019re trying to get better every day at doing it.\u201d\nLarger-scale projects are part of the puzzle in making that happen. O\u2019Connell said he believes one of the eventual payoffs from Choose How You Move will be lowering the household cost of transportation for Nashvillians. The Unified Housing Strategy positions the mayor\u2019s office to work \u201caggressively\u201d toward bending the curve on housing costs, he said.\nBut no matter the scale, O\u2019Connell said another part of the job is elevating city programs, from the Metro Action Commission to the city\u2019s parks and libraries. He said he sees the results firsthand while out in the community, where residents often tell him they appreciate the work being done.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anything that Metro\u2019s doing to be a best-kept secret \u2014 we want it to be visible,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\nWhat is the future for Tennessee, Nashville relationship?\nIt remains to be seen whether O'Connell's administration will improve relations with state leaders. The city-state divide peaked in 2022, after Metro Nashville Council members voted to block the 2024 Republican National Convention.\n\"You had Democrats saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want the RNC here,'\" Sexton said. \u201cThe fascinating thing is you talk to the Republicans and they\u2019re like 'We\u2019re happy to have the RNC or the DNC or both.\u2019 It seems like the far-left has decided that they don\u2019t want anything that\u2019s associated with a Republican, like it\u2019s bad for them or something.\"\nThe state followed the move by seeking to take control of influential Nashville governing bodies. An appeal is pending in a legal case state leaders brought to take control of the Metro Nashville Airport Authority.\nBehn said the \u201cfraught\u201d relationship with the state doesn\u2019t just extend to Nashville but to all cities in Tennessee.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this inherent paternalism that exists from the state to its municipalities,\u201d Behn said. \u201cOnce I kind of understood that framework \u2014 not that I think it\u2019s right \u2014 it helped me understand, legally, why there is so much undermining of the municipality.\u201d\nSexton pointed to recent successful state-Metro partnerships like the new Nissan Stadium and the $1.2 billion Oracle Corp. development deal as examples of putting politics aside to do what\u2019s best for everyone.\n\u201cLook, hopefully there\u2019s a way back, you know?\u201d Sexton said. \u201cThe issue with the prior administration was there was a lot of good deals, but when you make a comment and you have handshakes behind closed doors and then when it comes out in public you go the opposite way, it does hurt the next relationship. That\u2019s what happens over time.\u201d\nBehn, meanwhile, is predicting challengers to O'Connell in the next mayoral election. But she said most Democratic lawmakers aren't meeting the moment and likely won't find success without becoming more nimble and buying into a \"mass reorientation.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you think you\u2019re going to do better?\u201d Behn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the circumstances in which we find ourselves, and we have a failing country.\u201d\nAustin Hornbostel is the Metro reporter for The Tennessean.
