  "content": "Rep. (D-TX) issued a fiery takedown of the GOP's scheme to rig the 2026 primary . Crockett joined \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\" on Monday afternoon after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott appeared on the show. Crockett responded to many of the claims Abbott made, including about whether Texas's efforts to redraw its electoral map are about improving voter choice or silencing votes from communities of color. \"The only way they can make sure that they win, because they have failed policies, is by making sure they can cheat their way,\" Crockett said. \"And while they're cheating their way, the only way they can do that is if they also, at the same time, violate the Constitution as well as the Voting Rights Act.\" Abbott has said a recent decision gave the to redraw its maps before the end of the decade. Several other -controlled states, like Florida, Indiana, and Missouri, are considering redrawing their maps as well. It appears one way the GOP is planning to win the election is by suppressing votes from communities of color, Crockett argued. \"We're talking about them going after people like Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) in South Carolina; we're talking about them going after Rep. Andre Carson (D-IN) in Indiana; we're talking about them going after [Rep. Emanuel] Cleaver (D-MO) in Missouri; we're talking about them coming after Rep. Emilia Sykes (D-OH) in Ohio,\" Crockett said. \"We're talking about them coming for three of the four Black representatives that we currently have in the state of Texas, so don't tell me it's not about race!\" Crockett added.",

      "text": "Supreme Court just 'buried' a 'cryptic order' putting 'nail in coffin' of key law: expert\nThe Supreme Court recently signaled what could be the end of the Voting Rights Act, according to one expert.\nJames Sample, a professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University, appeared on MSNBC on Saturday to discuss Texas GOP \"re-redistricting,\" and other key topics. Earlier in the interview, Sample said the current war over gerrymandering in Texas, California, and other states is the result of Chief Justice John Roberts' Supreme Court.\nAfter that, one of the hosts noted another case that could have \"major impacts.\"\nSample responded, \"So, Louisiana is one of the states that in which there is gerrymandering and redistricting in order to have majority minority districts, the idea being under the Voting Rights Act, there are states like Louisiana where a third of the population is Black. But without majority minority districts, the black community ends up getting next to nothing by way of representation and perhaps even nothing.\"\nHe continued, saying, \"So, in 2020, in the Census, Louisiana ended up with two seats that were majority minority districts. The case is called Louisiana v. Callais, which was before the court last term and was held over by the court for this October.\"\n\"The court on Friday night (when do you want to bury a story?) released a very cryptic order in which it said very discreetly, \"Is a majority minority district inconsistent with the Constitution?\" he added. \"Which is in essence a declaration that the court is ready to put the final nail in the coffin of the Voting Rights Act. That Louisiana case could well be that final nail.\""

      "text": "This is the utterly chilling reason Republicans act like elections don't matter\nIf you consume mainstream news, you might think the Republicans are in trouble ahead of next year\u2019s congressional elections. In a recent report by CNN, for instance, Republican Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska is met with a barrage of boos and jeers at a town hall.\nThey should be in trouble. Though the president\u2019s policy agenda is dramatically unpopular, Flood and the Republicans have gone along with him. Donald Trump\u2019s net approval is now -15 percent, according to the latest numbers by The Economist, with 55 percent disapproving. Gallup\u2019s are worse. His rating among independent voters is 29 percent.\nYou\u2019d think a congressman like Flood, who represents a district evenly split, would at the very least pretend to be contrite, knowing that being on the good side of voters is the key to remaining in office. You\u2019d think he would behave like he knows he\u2019s in trouble.\nBut he\u2019s not. In that CNN report, Flood gives the impression that the opinions of his constituents, whose outrage is abundantly clear, are immaterial to his goal of staying in power \u2014 which is to say, he\u2019s behaving as if he has no fear of democracy holding him accountable.\nIn that, he\u2019s following the president\u2019s lead. In a recent CNBC interview, as Joe Walsh put it, Trump said he \u201cwon the 2020 election (he didn\u2019t). He has a 71 percent approval rating (he doesn\u2019t). The jobs numbers were rigged (they weren\u2019t). I could say something funny here, but I won\u2019t. It\u2019s just so damn dangerous to have him in the White House.\u201d\nIn the same interview, Trump said he would \u201cprobably not\u201d run for office again, understanding full well that the Constitution limits presidents to two terms, whether or not those terms are consecutive.\nWalsh is often right, but here he\u2019s doubly so. It\u2019s so damn dangerous when a president and his party act like democracy doesn\u2019t matter.\nIn 2009, after they passed the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama and the Democrats faced the prospect of a wipeout in the following year\u2019s midterms. The law started out unpopular and grew more unpopular by the day. But they didn\u2019t try to change the rules of democracy to avoid the consequences of their choices, even though the consequences were catastrophic. The Democrats lost 63 seats in the House and six in the Senate. Obama\u2019s presidency never recovered.\nTrump and the Republicans are trying to change the rules of democracy to avoid the consequences of their choices. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one source of disapproval, like the ACA used to be for the Democrats. Instead, public ire seems to have multiple layers, with the deepest being the gigantic sales tax, in the form of tariffs, that the president has unilaterally imposed on everyone. And Trump knows it. That\u2019s why, in anticipation of a wipeout, he asked legislators in Texas to redraw its congressional districts to give his party five more seats.\nThis should be damning. And the Republicans should be running from the idea, in the same way that some Democrats ran from Obamacare. But most are doubling down.\nTexas is going to try gerrymandering its districts to give Trump the advantage, as likely will any state controlled by the GOP that has at least one big blue city in it. (Perhaps this is why Mike Flood can shout down constituents with impunity. Nebraska Republicans could choose to redraw his district to ensure reelection.)\nBut the Republicans are doing more than changing the rules of democracy. They are creating the conditions for criminalizing it.\nDemocratic legislators in Texas left the state to deny a quorum for Republican efforts to redraw its congressional districts. The state\u2019s attorney general declared the move illegal. The state\u2019s governor ordered state law enforcement agencies to arrest and return them. Texas has no jurisdiction in Illinois, where some Texas Democrats decamped, but that didn\u2019t stop vigilantes from issuing bomb threats.\nThis is in addition to the Justice Department opening an investigation into alleged tampering of the 2016 election by Obama and his administration. (The allegations are completely imaginary.) There is, moreover, the fact that two Democrats have been arrested and are pending trial; two Democrats were manhandled and arrested; one Democrat was assassinated; not to mention the president ordering the (short-lived) military occupation of the city of Los Angeles. More recently, three House Democrats were \u201cin essence, incarcerated,\u201d after a masked ICE agent locked them in a room at a detention center.\nThe goal is silencing dissent, and elected Democrats are not the only targets. All of us are. Even as Trump and the GOP do things that make people angry \u2014 like taking away their food money, taking away their vaccines, taking away their jobs, all while forcing them to pay more and more for the essentials of life \u2014 people can\u2019t vent their anger.\nThe heart of democracy is our ability to petition the government for a redress of grievances. But the Republicans are creating conditions nationally, after having done so locally, in which that\u2019s not possible.\nThey are either gerrymandering voters out of existence, their judges are narrowing the right to vote to the point of extinction, or they are preparing to prosecute people for their opinions. At the rate we\u2019re going, it won\u2019t be long before being a liberal is a criminal offense.\nThe only Republicans acting rationally are those who represent districts in blue states.\n\u201cWhat Texas is doing is wrong and I\u2019m opposed to it,\u201d New York Rep. Mike Lawler told Politico, adding that \u201che\u2019s sponsoring a bill with fellow blue state Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley of California that would ban gerrymandering nationwide.\u201d\nBut they are only acting rationally because their party cannot change the rules of democracy to avoid being held accountable by their constituents for their choices. Blue states like New York and California are now considering redrawing their congressional maps in reaction to potential moves by Texas, Florida and others to do the same.\nIn other words, blue-state Republicans have an immediate incentive to behave themselves while the rest of the GOP, including its leader, does not.\nThat fact alone should be damning."

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) who was asked, as an attorney, about the FBI reportedly getting involved in tracking the lawmakers down.\nAppearing with MSNBC host Ali Velshi on Saturday, she was asked, \"Quick question for you: because you're a lawyer, why would [FBI director] Kash Patel take [Texas Republican] John Cornyn's phone call about getting the FBI to round up people? I don't know what the crime is.\"\n\"There is no crime, you already know this,\" the Texas Democrat replied. \"And just so people understand, even the warrants that they put out for them, they are signed by the speaker of the [Texas] House. I mean, this is not a law, a law enforcement official. This is not a judge. This is not a prosecutor. This is no one whomsoever would normally sign off on a warrant.\"\n\"And that is because it is not a criminal warrant,\" she elaborated. \"This is only giving license to someone who is found within the state of Texas, to then grab them and take them back to the [legislature] chamber. If they take them anywhere other than the chamber, then they are looking at a civil rights violation because they have not broken any laws.\"\n\"So this is just a matter of a civil situation and frankly, this is a family situation as far as i'm concerned, because basically, the family known as the legislators in the Texas House have decided that they don't want to come to the table and have a conversation about doing right by Texas,\" she added. \"They have decided that they would steamroll and disrespect their colleagues as well as their constituents in this moment, so that they can appease the mad king.\"\nYou can watch below or at the link.\n- YouTube youtu.be"

Mike Rounds (R-SD) stated, \"You have to have a reason to do it. It\u2019s not easy to do, so you have to have a purpose for doing it in the first place.\u201d\nAnother lawmaker, who asked to remain anonymous, cast doubt on getting a second bill passed so soon after the previous one barely passed.\n\u201cWithout the pressure, I don\u2019t see how you get it done. I don\u2019t think I see what the pressure is here,\" they said.\nSen.

They can do things with 51 votes anyway, most of what we have to do requires 60. And that means that senators, if you have a desire to actually legislate, need to find ways to legislate \u2014 and reconciliation is damaging to that relationship.\u201d\nThe report notes that some Republican House members, who are on their summer break and still dealing with fallout from the recently passed bill which polls showed were highly unpopular with voters, aren't completely on board with another battle.\nAs one pointed out, \u201cWe did so much in the first.
