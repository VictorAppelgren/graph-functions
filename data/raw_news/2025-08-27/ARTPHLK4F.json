  "description": "Acer's Swift 16 AI blends a slim, stylish design with a brilliant OLED display and reliable all-day battery life.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nAcer's Swift 16 AI is a thin and light laptop with a gorgeous OLED display, nice full-sized keyboard, and Intel Core Ultra 7 or 9 \"Lunar Lake\" processor starting at $1,200: a competitive price for a device that feels more premium than you'd expect.\n\nI've been commuting with the Swift 16 AI for the past month, and it's become a surprise favorite of the year. It stands out as a great-value ultraportable that's as versatile as it is capable and has fantastic battery life.\n\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\n\nThe Acer Swift 16 AI features a minimalist physical build, with an all-over, metallic matte black coating that looks a lot like the LG Gram Pro 16. Its full-sized keyboard and generous selection of I/O make it practical for a variety of uses, and the physical form is sleek and well-designed.\n\nThe configuration I tested had an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and a 1TB SSD -- a flexible loadout that can do a little bit of everything. It's particularly well-suited as a work device with Wi-Fi 7 and a responsive, very comfortable keyboard with a slight upward tilt thanks to Acer's hinge design.\n\nI was happy to see that both USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 4, which is great for folks who want their external monitors. Otherwise, you also get an HDMI port that supports up to 8K resolution. The webcam is also surprisingly good, with 1440p resolution for a crisp image during video calls.\n\nThe glossy, 3K OLED display at 120Hz is one of the laptop's strongest features. It's a crisp and vibrant image that looks fantastic whether you're gaming, editing video, or just working in productivity software. Despite its very thin clamshell design, I experienced very little screen wobble -- one of the first things I look for when I see a display this thin.\n\nYou can also get some surprisingly good gaming performance out of this laptop with the Intel Arc GPU, as long as you're not pushing the limits on top-tier titles. I ran a handful of my usual Steam titles, and although it's not a gaming laptop, it feels competitive and responsive, only stuttering with texture shaders turned up to max.\n\nAlso: I tested HP's first-gen EliteBook X, and it's a powerhouse at the office (and $500 off)\n\nThe only thing is that the display is incredibly glossy -- we're talking near-mirror status. You will need to adjust it if you're in an office or somewhere with overhead lighting, something I found myself doing rather frequently. If you're sitting with your back to a bright window, it becomes borderline unusable.\n\nThat said, the display looks fantastic otherwise, so I'd still recommend this laptop to most users unless you're specifically looking for a device to use outdoors or are not a fan of a glossy display.\n\nAnother critique I have of this laptop (which is an inevitable result of its price point) is its speaker system, which is not great. While it's true that laptop speakers are infamously lacking in bass and depth, this one takes that reputation and runs with it.\n\nUsually, I would say this is a trade-off I don't mind, but it's a bit of a bummer that the sound is so shallow when the gaming performance is so good. If you're someone who always has a pair of headphones on, however, this won't be an issue.\n\nUltimately, the Acer Swift 16 AI's strengths outweigh its drawbacks. When it comes to everyday use, the performance is there, and as a portable 16-inch laptop, it's well-designed and easy to commute with.\n\nThe battery is also a banger. The laptop has a very thin form factor, but still manages to fit in a large 20Wh battery with a 65-watt charge. Depending on how you use it, you can get multiple days of use on one charge, and it ranks up there with other efficient devices I've tested this year such as the Asus Zenbook A14, Microsoft's Surface Laptop, and the Dell XPS 13 with the Snapdragon X Elite chip.\n\nDuring our standard video playback test, I got nearly 18 hours of video playback on one charge. When it comes to using this laptop for work, you'll easily last through the work day and into the next, unless you're pushing it with more demanding workloads. Like all of the other Lunar Lake-powered devices I've tested this year, power drain drops to a trickle when it's not in use.\n\nAlso: Sony's newest headphones are for WH-1000XM6 fans who love to game - and I can attest to that\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 chip generates little to no heat during everyday use, but pushing it with heavier task loads and plugging in the charger will result in temperature increases.\n\nNotably, the charging process seems to be hotter during the first 30 minutes, or below 30%, then tapers down to a much cooler temperature at higher battery percentages. Also, when you start or stop charging, the laptop emits a chirp. All that said, it charges very fast and can approach 100% in about an hour in Balanced Mode.\n\nBeyond gaming, this laptop makes for a competent laptop for creatives with its fast refresh rate and lovely display. The 16GB of RAM might limit high-end workloads with large video files or 4K rendering, but it's otherwise a joy to work on.\n\nComparing this laptop to some peers, we see very close (with one identical) benchmarking scores to Dell's XPS 13 with the same Intel Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" chip.\n\nThe Acer Swift 16 AI is a fantastic value and a sleeper hit from Acer's lineup. The bottom line here is that for around $1,250, you're getting a 16-inch OLED display at 120Hz and 3K resolution, a sleek, minimalist build, full suite of I/O, and a marathon battery. Those elements alone work together to make a practical, capable main driver that can do a bit of everything.\n\nAs a work laptop, it feels premium and powerful, despite the subpar speakers, which is a tradeoff I'm willing to take.\n\nAlso: I found the ultimate MacBook Air alternative for Windows users - and it's priced well\n\nWhy the Acer Swift 16 AI gets an Editors' Choice award\n\nWe've awarded the Acer Swift 16 AI our Editors' Choice award primarily for its features, hardware, and build quality relative to price. The \"Lunar Lake\" Intel Core Ultra 7 processor future-proofs this laptop with commendable performance, and its physical build feels more premium than its price point would suggest.\n\nUltimately, it's an excellent choice for anyone wanting a gorgeous display paired with fantastic battery life. Starting at $1,250, it's already a value, and if you can catch it on sale, it's even better.",

TCL's Nxtpaper technology offers a paper-like screen that's made for tired eyes like mine. The TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G is the company's affordable attempt at relieving some of the stress that comes from modern smartphone screens.\nAlso: Changing this Android setting instantly doubled my phone speed (Samsung and Google models included)\nIt's a unique trick for a very inexpensive smartphone that needs to be seen to be understood. While far from perfect, and definitely a device built to a price, it brings a differentiator that will matter for some users looking to give their eyes a rest while they scroll or read.\nA unique multi-faceted display\nThe display is what immediately sets the 60XE apart. TCL's Nxtpaper 3.0 matte coating gives the glass an undeniably unique finish that I quite like. On-screen content looks a bit like E-ink depending on the mode the phone is in, but underneath that hazy layer is a standard 1080p, 120Hz LCD panel.\nThe coating addresses a slew of common downsides of modern displays. It reduces blue light, cuts reflections to nearly nothing, and even eliminates most fingerprints. There's also a nice texture that feels a bit like paper, which is a nice departure from a sea of glossy, reflective displays.\nBeneath the power and volume buttons is a physical Nxtpaper Key, a plastic switch that feels a bit cheaper than I'd like. Flipping the switch offers up a menu of distinct modes that change how the display operates.\nTCL clearly wants users to notice and appreciate this feature because every toggle results in a five-second full-screen animation complete with an obnoxious serenade. I made sure to set my volume to mute so I could avoid the theatrical effect.\nEach mode provides its own twist on usability and comfort. Color Paper Mode, my favorite, mutes the colors while retaining a standard Android interface that's easier on the eyes for all-day use. I even enjoyed watching YouTube videos in this mode, though everything feels a bit flatter than my eyes are used to.\nInk Paper Mode goes one step further, stripping color from icons and text for a no-frills grayscale approach, while still delivering the full unencumbered Android experience. Max Ink Mode is the most dramatic change, stripping all color while also limiting apps to a small subset of essentials and suspending certain background processes.\nAlso: iOS 26 envy? 5 iPhone features you can already use on your Android (Samsung included)\nThe result is an ultra-minimal, battery-saving mode that can last more than a week on a single charge. I enjoyed this mode for reading ebooks and could see it as a great solution for users looking to cut back on smartphone use entirely.\nThe display does come with a major caveat. On the brightest days, the matte finish would all but wash out on-screen content, often making it unusable in direct sunlight. If you spend time outside reading or working, you'll be looking for shade like I was.\nPerformance and battery\nPerformance is modest but serviceable, with a MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor inside paired with 8GB of RAM. In use, this is not a phone for hardcore users who push their devices to the limit. I noticed many actions have a slight delay attached to them. Launching the camera often takes a few seconds to negotiate.\nGeneral tasks like web browsing, email, and messaging are responsive enough to keep me happy, but things never felt snappy.\nOn the software front, the 60 XE runs Android 15, with a promise from TCL of just one upgrade to Android 16 and two years of security patches. As someone who always decries the poor state of Android OS update promises, this is a weak point, and TCL needs to step up its game. Anyone hoping to get long-term value should consider other options.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nI found battery life to be a highlight, which isn't that surprising given the 5,010mAh battery hidden inside. I routinely made it through the day with around 20-30% capacity to spare at bedtime. Wired charging tops out at a slow 18 watts, so quick daytime top-ups will take some time, but it's fine for plugging in overnight.\nFor the truly battery paranoid, there's the Max Ink Mode that considerably jumps battery life to more than a week if you are willing to cut down on much of what the phone is capable of.\nStay for the display, but not the camera\nThe plastic marble-like backplate surrounds a large circular camera array that's hard to miss and perhaps even more premium-looking than its price point. One pet peeve of mine is an off-center camera module, and this phone has a notable wobble when placed on a tabletop as a result.\nThe camera system itself is one area where the low-end cutbacks really show. The main sensor does its best outdoors in very bright conditions and needs a lot of light to help shots taken indoors. The camera performance is mediocre with soft output that lacks punch and definition most of the time.\nLow-light conditions easily demonstrate the camera system's baseline capability, and the ultrawide lens often results in grainy images. The 32MP front camera works, but that's about it. Let's just say that this is not the phone for the discerning camera buff.\nZDNET's buying advice\nWhat the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G offers is a key standout feature: a unique matte display. At $250, the 60XE offers something that you really can't find anywhere else, in this price category and beyond, and the benefits of that might matter a lot for certain users. For everyone else, consider phones like the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which offers better imaging, better speed, and its signature modular design approach.\nFollow my latest tech reviews and projects across social media.

I'm pretty familiar with the Stealth line, having reviewed several models in the past. This version doesn't reinvent the wheel. In fact, it shares many similarities with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, to its benefit and to a fault.\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\nFirst off: on the surface, I genuinely can't tell the difference between this model and the previous generation. The Stealth 16 measures 14\"x 10.22\"x 0.85\" inches -- the exact same dimensions as the A16. It even weighs the same at 4.63 pounds.\nWhat's funny is I used to think that was really heavy, but after carrying around chunky laptops, MSI's device feels lightweight. Even with the power adapter, I didn't mind carrying it around town. By the way, I factor that adapter into the overall weight because you will need it on hand. More on that later.\nBringing back the classics\nA few other great design elements make their triumphant return. Going down the list, you have a full-size gaming keyboard. Each button has a 1.5mm travel distance, ensuring a comfortable typing feel. Six surround sound speakers are located at either end below the keyboard for immersive audio.\nOne of my favorite moments testing this laptop came from listening to \"Doomsday\" by MF Doom. The lyrical flow from Doom sounded crystal clear and powerful through the laptop's speakers, filling my entire room with his supervillainy.\nAbove the keyboard is the 16-inch OLED display. At QuadHD+ (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) resolution, it's not quite 4K, but it's close enough -- the screen still delivers impressive visual output. Colors are vibrant, the high resolution delivers detailed images, and the 240Hz refresh rate ensures smooth on-screen motion.\nPower boost\nOne of my favorite things about MSI laptops is how easy it is to tweak their performance. On many Windows 11 laptops, all you can really do is change the Power mode in the Settings, but MSI Center, its internal settings program is actually pretty robust. Here, you can adjust the computer's output on the fly. For example, enabling Extreme Performance and Discrete Graphics Mode delivers the best hardware results.\nAlso: I tested Dell's XPS successor, and it beat my $3,000 Windows laptop in almost every way\nInside my review unit was an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. It's a pretty good configuration, if I say so myself, and it shows in the performance numbers.\nBelow is a list comparing MSI's Stealth 16 with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI Plus, and the Dell Premium 16. You'll notice that the newer model has better raw processing and rendering power than the others, indicating it excels at handling heavy workloads and rendering complex 3D graphics.\nThere is a bit of a gap between the Stealth 16 and the A16 on PCMark 10, suggesting that the older model has better general performance; it's able to hop between web pages and apps without much issue. However, I didn't experience any slowdown. This laptop ran great everywhere.\nPCMark 10 | Geekbench 6 | Cinebench 2024 | Cinebench R23 | |\nMSI Stealth 16 AI | 7,693 | 15,883 | 1,129 | 21,656 |\nMSI Stealth A16 AI+ | 7,913 | 14,196 | N/A | 18,336 |\nDell Premium 16 | 6,865 | 14,763 | 726 | 17,522 |\nHaving Dell's machine may seem random, but you need to understand that the Stealth 16 isn't just a solid gaming computer. It's also a powerful graphic design laptop, too. For testing, I installed Blender, a free 3D creation app, and edited images on Pixlr. I'm not much of an artist, but I did manage to create and render simple scenes starring Blender's complex monkey model.\nI had a similar experience with Pixlr, as I was able to edit 4K photographs without any major hiccups. The entire process went smoothly. MSI's laptop is a powerhouse in almost every sense of the word.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for a week, and it makes even the XPS feel outdated\nAs powerful as the laptop may be, it has its limits. I ran multiple 4K YouTube livestreams as part of my usual 50-tab Chrome browser test. Everything ran fine when there were only three livestreams, although once I hit six, I noticed a slowdown. Livestreams were slow to load. It took a few seconds before the Stealth 16 could play the video as normal.\nStaying cool\nHeavy workloads do cause the Stealth 16 to heat up a bit, but high temperatures were never an issue. Heat vents are strategically placed above the keyboard, on the side of the laptop, and on the bottom, so your hands are never at risk of touching a hot keyboard. In fact, the keys stayed nice and cool the entire time. Unfortunately, this means you can't place the computer on your lap; otherwise, your legs will be blasted by hot air.\nThis ability to stay cool under duress is thanks to the Cooler Boost 5 cooling system, which consists of two large fans and five heat pipes directing hot air out through the vents. This system is also on the vastly more powerful MSI Raider 18 HX.\nUnsurprisingly, MSI's Stealth 16 is not designed to be away from its charger for long. You can push its endurance by enabling ECO-Silent and Integrated Graphics Mode in the MSI Center app, and Best Power Efficiency in Windows, but even then, it will last around six hours on a single charge, depending on what you're doing.\nLike many gaming laptops with this kind of hardware, it may have power, but it lacks in stamina. For that reason, I'd suggest this for users who don't need an all-day battery kind of laptop, but are fine with a few hour stints throughout the day.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe MSI Stealth 16 AI is on sale at Best Buy for $2,030, which is a good price for a laptop with this kind of hardware. I recommend this device to anyone looking for an affordable gaming laptop that can also be used as a work machine. If you like this laptop but want to save some cash, its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, is very similar and still relevant in 2025, retailing for $1,800.\nIf you want a more powerful graphic design computer, I suggest the Alienware 18 Area-51. It is a much more powerful gaming laptop that leaves every laptop I mentioned so far in the dust. I think it's one of the best for the year. It is, however, very expensive; my review unit cost $3,200."

The first laptop from this series I've tested is the 14-inch HP EliteBook X G1a, an impressive enterprise laptop with a lot to like, but a few considerations that make it unique.\nThis is a business laptop aimed at professionals, and it aims to combine the connectivity of a ThinkPad, the sleek form factor of a MacBook, and HP's signature minimalist, if non-descript, design.\nAlso: Why my favorite MacBook Pro alternative is this Windows laptop with a striking design\nThere are a few configurations of this laptop, the most premium featuring an AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor -- one of the most cutting-edge chips on the market right now -- and an OLED display, but the one I tested had the AMD Ryzen AI 7 Pro 360 processor, 32GB of RAM, and a 14-inch matte WUXGA IPS display.\nOn the surface, it's minimalist and rather corporate-looking, with a matte WUXGA display and an abundant selection of ports. It passes the one-finger test and opens up to a rather standard display with 400 nits of brightness, 60Hz refresh rate, and a compact and efficient keyboard.\nOne of its best features is the keyboard. It's utterly silent, with a snappy tactile feel and a key travel distance that (almost) feels mechanical. The keys are spacious and smooth, and the backlighting is effective and well-designed. Similarly, the trackpad is responsive and premium, even if the clicks feel a little on the \"heavy\" side.\nI do wish it had a haptic trackpad, however, as it would go a long way toward making it more premium, especially as a device geared toward a sophisticated demographic: business leaders and tech experts. When you consider the price of this laptop, it seems like a missed opportunity.\nDuring my testing, I found this laptop really enjoyable to use for long days at work, and a big part of that was due to its well-designed ergonomics. Unlike other machines, which require the user to adjust to bold or unorthodox design choices, the EliteBook X G1a fits like a familiar glove right off the bat, making it a solid long-day-at-work type of laptop.\nAlso: The best 15-inch laptops of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nIf the keyboard and trackpad contribute to an enjoyable physical form, the abundant I/O selection solidifies its practicality. You've got an HDMI, three USB-C (one Thunderbolt 4 on each side -- thank you), a USB-A port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a Kensington lock slot. This is, in my opinion, one of the best combinations of ports you can ask for in 2025; the only thing that would make it better would be an SD card reader.\nIt can certainly pivot to creative tasks, as well, as video editing in industry-standard programs like Da Vinci Resolve was a breeze. By the same token, gaming on this laptop is possible, but I wouldn't recommend this as a dedicated gaming machine with the 60Hz display and its heat dissipation (more on that later).\nWhile testing, I encountered a hiccup when connecting to an external monitor with the Thunderbolt 4 port. Both displays would flicker and restart intermittently, even after driver and Windows updates.\nIssues like this can result from any number of things, including problems with the operating system, hardware, or even the USB-C cord itself, so I don't necessarily fault the EliteBook. However, this was the first time it happened to me after using dozens of laptops with that connection and monitor.\nAlso: I finally solved the toughest question about buying laptops - here's my expert guide\nA busy workday prevented me from troubleshooting for an extended period of time, but this is where the generous port selection came in clutch, allowing me to simply swap to an HDMI connection. It's a perfect example of where redundant I/O access can solve tech problems, especially in the work setting.\nIn terms of performance, the EliteBook X G1a is fast and responsive, with benchmarking numbers that back its claim of being a powerful enterprise machine.\nOne thing I noticed during testing the EliteBook X G1a, however, was that it ran a bit hotter than other laptops in its class, kicking on the fans during sustained workloads in High Performance mode. When it's not being pushed, however, it's silent and cool, leading me to believe there's simply a threshold here with the hardware. At no point did I see any evidence of throttling, however.\nContinuing its specialization in the professional sphere, the EliteBook X G1a features a 74.5Whr battery, which is on the large size for a laptop of this size, earning it just over 11 hours during our standard battery test. This is good, sure, but it didn't quite translate to the spectacular duration I was expecting. Particularly when you compare this to competitors.\nAlso: Is a refurbished MacBook viable in 2025? I did the math, and here's my expert advice\nIt's about the same amount of time we got when testing the MacBook Pro M4, although that laptop is cheaper and, not to mention, a MacBook. Conversely, HP's own OmniBook X 14 with the Snapdragon X Elite was an absolute marathon machine, earning over 20 hours.\nOf course, the hardware on the OmniBook is a bit more modest, but its 65Wh battery overperforms in a way that can't be ignored. As I spent more time with this laptop, however, I came to understand its intended use case as a device that trades in the ultrathin and light form factor for raw power, making it a durable, reliable workhorse.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThere is no shortage of thin and light laptops with marathon batteries. The HP EliteBook X G1a is, comparatively, more focused on providing reliable muscle during working hours. The beefy hardware takes full advantage of the large battery, the abundant ports keep your options open, and the comfortable keyboard acts as an ergonomic command center so you can hunker down and get work done.\nHowever, all that hardware can run warm when it's pushed, and this is not a cheap laptop. If you're looking for a 14-inch device that's fully committed to the enterprise use case, it's a solid option, but keep in mind that it's quite specialized for that role.\nIf you're looking for a similar laptop for a little less, I recommend the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 -- another workhorse laptop with lots of connectivity and the same processor around the $1,500 mark."

The latest addition: the XPS 13 (9345): an ultraportable Copilot+ PC with a future-forward design and cutting-edge hardware.\nDell has released multiple models in its Latitude and Inspiron lines, but only bestowed the 13-inch XPS model with the new ARM-compatible Snapdragon X Elite processor. The company called it out as a unique device in Dell's catalog, despite all the different configurations the line offers.\nArmed with the same high-end Snapdragon processor as Samsung's Galaxy Book 4 Edge, this 13-inch, 2.6-pound laptop is a performance powerhouse in a sleek and well-designed form factor with all the hallmarks of XPS's design: the invisible trackpad, the zero-lattice keyboard, and the brilliant display.\nYou also wouldn't be the first to mistake this laptop for a 13-inch MacBook Air upon first glance, especially when it's closed. The graphite colorway and minimalist USB-C ports take more than just a page from Apple's design book. If, however, opening up the clamshell to reveal its iconic keyboard doesn't dispel any doubt about its identity, the black-and-gold Snapdragon logo below the keyboard will.\nI recently went hands-on with Dell's XPS 13 for a few weeks, and I enjoyed using it. In fact, I'm inclined to say that this is one of the best 13-inch laptops I've tested this year, although it's hard to commit to that statement given that the Snapdragon X Elite chips are still in the early adoption phase.\nAlso: My favorite ultraportable laptop makes the ThinkPad and MacBook Air feel underwhelming\nThe Snapdragon processor gives this laptop some impressive raw performance, for sure. In my benchmarking, the Dell XPS 13 showed off its multitasking horsepower by running productivity apps and visual tasks with the dual-core boost on board the X1E-80 processor, something the other chips don't have.\nBoot times move at warp speed, and browsing behavior feels snappy and responsive. When paired with the brilliant tandem OLED display, it feels like a true high-end productivity device.\nCopilot + PC | Cinebench Multi-Core | Geekbench Multi-Core |\nSamsung Galaxy Book 4 Edge | 860 | 15,672 |\nDell XPS 13 | 977 | 14,687 |\nLenovo Yoga Slim 7x | 1,004 | 13,677 |\nAsus Vivobook S 15 | 969 | 14,384 |\nHP Omnibook X 14 | 470 | 13,160 |\nUnfortunately, all that power is held back by potential emulation issues in Windows' Prism program, or even with some commonly-used apps that are still not fully optimized for Windows on Arm. This is something we've been talking about with all the new Copilot+ PCs we've tested this year, and the XPS 13 is not immune to the issue.\nI ran DaVinci Resolve on this laptop and found it performed about the same as other Snapdragon PCs: fine, but the performance still doesn't compare to something like a MacBook Pro. It's the same story with Adobe's suite of creator apps, despite the company's statements committing to optimizing for ARM in the immediate future.\nThe display is, unsurprisingly, one of the best parts of this laptop. The 13.4-inch screen comes as either a non-touch full-HD, or a touch-enabled 3K tandem OLED, and both look gorgeous. Colors are crisp with Dolby Vision and 100% DCI-P3 color support, and the matte display effectively mitigates glare.\nThere are, however, some quirks with the configurations. The FHD display, for example, is slightly brighter at 500 nits and comes with a faster 120Hz refresh rate than the OLED display, which maxes out at 400 nits and 60Hz, respectively. For a price jump of $400 for the OLED, I would expect to see some slightly higher-end specs.\nAlso: I recommend this high-end laptop to creative pros over MacBooks - and it's on sale at Best Buy\nThe battery life on this machine is, like all the other Copilot+ PCs, very good. Dell has a handful of different performance modes that will affect the battery life, and of course, the OLED screen is going to be a lot more power-hungry than the FHD, but overall, it's impressive. In our testing, we got over 17 hours of battery life running a livestream video over Wi-Fi.\nWhen it comes to everyday moderate use between home and the office, I got well over 20 hours before the battery tapered off. If you use your laptop solely for work-related tasks that don't require a huge processing demand, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect three or more workdays in one charge.\nRegarding the illuminated touch Function row, I'm (still) not a fan. I discussed this in my review of Dell's XPS 14, and my opinion hasn't really changed.\nYes, it looks good, and I get the idea: using the same physical space for double the amount of keys. Still, in all my time with the XPS 13, I never quite got used to having keys I use frequently (Home, End, Del, Insert) untethered from physical keys and relegated to a capacitive LED.\nAlso: The Lenovo ThinkPad I recommend to most professionals is also one of the most affordable\nAlso, I wouldn't recommend this laptop as a dedicated gaming machine, even if it certainly can run games. Ask a gamer if they'd use a computer with LED lights for keys, though.\nLike any design decision, this one comes with tradeoffs.\nThe lack of robust port connectivity is also going to be a dealbreaker for some people. Dell seems to have doubled down on its decision to keep things as minimal as possible, offering just two USB-C ports on this laptop. Additionally, they aren't Thunderbolts with the Snapdragon configuration.\nThey do support DisplayPort, and there's one on each side, so... there's that. If you want to do even the most basic connections on this laptop, you'll be carrying around a dock.\nAlso: I recommend this 2-in-1 laptop to both creatives and professionals - and it's on sale right now\nThe Copilot+ XPS 13 is new, but it doesn't replace the Intel laptop. In fact, we went hands-on with that version back in May, and had a lot of the same praises and critiques as we do now. The fact is that there's a case to be made for both versions, especially since the configurations and price points are similar.\nSo, which is better? Well, it depends on what you're looking for. A simplified way to look at it is:\nDell XPS 13 with the Snapdragon X Elite:\n- Pro: Way better battery\n- Pro: Overall faster speeds\n- Pro: Made for AI\n- Con: Some programs don't run smoothly or at all\nDell XPS 13 Intel Core Ultra 7 155H:\n- Pro: Thunderbolt USB-C ports\n- Pro: You don't have to contend with app integration issues\n- Con: Runs hotter, dies faster\nIn the end, both are solid choices, but the battery life on the unit with the Snapdragon is impossible to ignore. That, and the fact that this is a forward-looking device with AI functionality.\nZDNET's buying advice\nDell's XPS 13 embodies the ultraportable, fast, cool, and efficient laptop experience all Copilot+ PCs seek to deliver. It features a bold design that you either love or you don't, but you have to give Dell credit for sticking to its vision. The minimalist approach isn't for everyone, and users who need lots of connectivity won't have much use for the spare port selection.\nI'd recommend this laptop to freelancers, remote and hybrid workers, and anyone who needs battery life that extends multiple days. There's an argument to be made for preferring the Intel version of this year's XPS 13, or the similarly-priced, similarly-sized Lenovo Slim 7x, which features a similar build but more utilitarian design approach."

Both are several hundred dollars off the regular prices.\nIt's been a big year for Microsoft. All eyes have been on Windows with the release of the new Copilot AI feature, followed by a new line of laptops running on Snapdragon's ARM-compatible chip architecture and a barrage of new, hyped-up AI features. Naturally, some were welcomed, while others\u2026 did not go as planned (and continue to pose questions).\nAlso: Microsoft's 12-inch Surface Pro improves on its best traits - and it's already on sale\nAt the center of all this are Microsoft's two flagship devices, both of which are innovative and fun to use: the Microsoft Surface Laptop, and the Surface Pro, a tablet/laptop hybrid. ZDNET's Kerry Wan went hands-on with the Surface Laptop, but I wanted to take a closer look at this laptop after the dust had settled on the first round of Copilot+ PCs.\nThe first thing I noticed about the Surface Laptop is its sleek, lightweight design, which would be exceedingly reminiscent of a MacBook if not for the cool blue color. There's something very neutral -- non-descript, even -- about the Surface Laptop, even while retaining a unique silhouette. Minimal? Doesn't sound particularly Microsoft, does it? And yet, here we are.\nAvailable in a 13.8- and 15-inch form factor, the Surface's aluminum body comes in a few unique colorways. It sports a bright, 120Hz HDR touchscreen display, basic port selection, and, most importantly, the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor.\nAlso: My new favorite PC accessory lets me stay productive when traveling for work\nThe display looks great, although an OLED would have really been the cherry on top for this flagship device. I understand Microsoft's design choice here, though: make a good-looking HDR display with a fast refresh rate that looks an OLED but requires half the power. It makes sense.\nRegarding the processor, we've discussed the pros and cons of ARM architecture in Windows all year, and the bottom line remains: it's still in its early stages, so there is a potential for compatibility hiccups with certain apps, games, and accessories.\nWindows (mostly) does a good job of emulating programs via Prism, but issues can arise. I can say, however, that lots of progress has been made in the few months since the Snapdragon laptops have been on the market, particularly with creativity apps.\nAlso: The best laptops of 2025: I've tested dozens of laptops and these are the best ones\nEarlier this summer, I remember struggling through Adobe Premiere on some of the brand-new Copilot+ PCs, but only a few months later, things seem to be more optimized. Running through some video editing software in Adobe and DaVinci Resolve on the Surface wasn't 100% flawless, but it was smooth enough to be considered ready to go for creators. In fact, it performed a little better on this machine for me than on other, higher-priced models.\nThe Snapdragon X Elite on the Surface feels well-optimized. In our benchmarking of the device, we got numbers comparable to other Copilot+ PCs around the same price point, namely the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x and the Dell XPS 13.\nThis chip is what powers this laptop's snappy performance and impressive battery life, and also what sets it apart from previous versions in the Surface line (which had rather mixed reviews), and other Copilot+ PCs.\nThis is a laptop that feels fast and light and multitasks with ease across the Windows ecosystem. Web browsing with dozens of tabs, while connected to an external monitor feels responsive and smooth, a must for me to be considered a main driver.\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your Windows 11 PC (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)\nThe touchpad is efficient, if on the sensitive side, but well-placed. The port selection is average, with two USB-Cs, a USB-A, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Unfortunately, Microsoft chose to keep its proprietary charging port instead of a standard USB-C, which would have given the laptop even more utility.\nThe keyboard is very satisfying to type on, with well-textured and responsive keys that match the device's color scheme. If there's any laptop where the Windows Copilot key would make sense, it'd be on this laptop. The Snapdragon X Elite's integrated NPU allows for seamless interaction with the on-device AI that powers features accessible via the Copilot key, your voice, and the taskbar.\nI have been integrating Copilot into my workflow as I learn more about how to use it effectively, and on a device like the Surface, it feels handy and efficient. I've been using it to summarize the latest emails from specific contacts, and it's particularly practical because of its speed and accuracy in this task.\nAlso: This affordable Lenovo ThinkPad rivals laptops twice the price - and now it's even cheaper\nThe Surface's battery life has been fantastic, too. I get over 15 hours of use from a single charge, and it has yet to fully deplete to zero by the time I call a benchmarking test.\nThe combination of smart design with meaningful trade-offs is what gives this laptop its marathon battery life, and opens it up for a variety of use cases from a creator or productivity perspective. Basically, this is a laptop you can work remotely with for the whole day without a charger.\nZDNET's buying advice\nI mentioned this before, but the direction that Microsoft took with this laptop is, well, rather uncharacteristic. The 2024 Microsoft Surface Laptop is light, airy, and brings some fun to the Copilot+ line. I would have loved to see this laptop with an OLED display, but the one we get instead is still quite nice, especially with this fantastic battery life.\nThe Surface Laptop is a flagship mid-range device that's well-rounded enough to take on a variety of roles. Despite a few trade-offs, it's everything it should be for the price."

The 16GB configuration is also on sale for $997, which is a whopping $500 off.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The LG Gram Pro 16 2-in-1 32GB configuration is on sale at Amazon for $1,699.\n- It's sleek and smooth, with a gorgeous display and respectable performance.\n- The thin form factor results in some tradeoffs; namely that it runs hot and the speakers aren't great.\nThe LG Gram Pro 16 2-in-1 is an impressive laptop. It currently holds the Guinness record for being the lightest 16-inch 2-in-1 in the world, a fact that an LG representative proudly told me during the product's unveiling earlier this year (and one that my colleague Kerry Wan and I promptly verified by weighing it ourselves). At 3.04 pounds (1.377 kg), it's certainly light, but that's not the only thing going for it.\nAlso: I found a creator's laptop that competes with the MacBook Pro (and more affordable)\nThis is a capable laptop with a gorgeous OLED display and a solid suite of hardware designed to nail that first impression. Its ultra-thin body, vibrant display, and dark black chassis make for a striking visual silhouette.\nUnder the hood, the Gram Pro 16 2-in-1 comes with an Intel Core Ultra 7 (Series 2) processor, and up to 32GB of RAM with 2TB of storage, a commendable hardware package that contributes to this laptop's snappy performance.\nI used this laptop as my primary driver for a week, and can say that I was definitely impressed with how well it performs. Running two displays is a breeze, as is having dozens of browser tabs open alongside a handful of open apps. This is a laptop to consider for anyone looking for an ultraportable to handle photo or video editing in the field.\nAlso: I found a creator's laptop that competes with the MacBook Pro (and more affordable)\nThe 16-inch OLED display is crisp and silky smooth, with a variable 120Hz refresh rate. This high refresh rate on a 400-nit brightness screen results in incredibly vibrant visual media, accounting for 100% of the RBG color scale, 94% of the Adobe RBG scale, and 100% of the P3 color gamut.\nI popped the Gram Pro 2-in-1 into tent mode and fired up some streaming apps, and the video looked great, especially at this brightness. The high refresh rate also has positive effects for creators. Besides video and photo editing, if you use the accompanying stylus in tablet mode, the result is a responsive and natural experience.\nThe stylus feels nice and tactical as a three-sided pencil. It sticks to the side of the laptop via a magnetic connector, but only one of the stylus' three sides is magnetic, resulting in a mini-game of rotating the stylus on the side of the laptop until it clicks into place. Given that it charges wirelessly (and quite fast), I have no complaints.\nAlso: The 7 tech gadgets I couldn't live without in 2024\nThe laptop's physical body is constructed with an incredibly lightweight nano-magnesium alloy, resulting in a sturdy, matte metallic finish. The keyboard is crisp and tactical, with a 1.5mm key travel distance and very cool backlighting that illuminates only the letters and numbers on the keys, not the keys themselves.\nThe trackpad, although unassuming looking, is well-designed. Let me be clear: I am absolutely not a trackpad lover. Most of the time, I hook up a mouse even before I turn my laptop on, but this one is an exception. It's just the right size, responsive, and has a slick, light feel to it that requires very little physical input relative to its usability on the screen.\nThat said, although the matte black finish looks great, it's absolute fingerprint city. I do not eat around my computers, and I'm conscious of putting dirty hands on a keyboard, and still, this thing shows every single smudge and point of contact. I realize there's little to be done about this, but personally, it's just not something I enjoy looking at.\nMoving to the rest of the laptop's physical form: you have a standard selection of ports here, with two USB-C ports on one side, an HDMI port, and two USB-A ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the other. The laptop's speakers are downward-firing, which doesn't help the fact that the incredibly thin body results in rather low peak volume. Expectations for laptop audio are typically not sky-high, and these aren't ones to write home about.\nAlso: This Lenovo laptop solved my biggest issue with photo organization (even for iPhone users)\nThe other tradeoff for this laptop's thin design is its cooling efficiency. This laptop runs hot under a heavy load, and warm under normal use. The down-firing heat exhaust fan means you will feel it on the keyboard if you're doing something processor intensive, and will absolutely blast your legs if you work with your computer on your lap.\nAgain, there's not much to be done about this, as the ultra-thin design means you trade real estate for a more elaborate cooling system or robust fans. It's simply part of the overall cost of achieving this level of lightweight design.\nIndeed, this is not a laptop made to be pushed to the brink of its capabilities. Performance will be scaled back due to heat throttling if it exceeds a certain threshold, while other laptops with more intensive cooling systems might have more contingencies for dealing with the higher temperatures.\nFor most users, this is not much of an issue, but during exceptionally heavy loads, performance may dip, as it did for me, in particular, while running high-end benchmarking tests.\nFinally, the battery life on this machine was about what you'd expect from a 2-in-1 with an OLED screen. This is a laptop that can last a full day of work, but only barely. Depending on how hard you're pushing it, expect to see 7 to 8 hours on a single charge. I got around that during my testing.\nZDNET's buying advice\nIn a market of dozens of 2-in-1 laptops that were released this year, the LG Gram Pro 16 2-in-1 is one of the more expensive options, but it's absolutely worth it for consumers that want to hit high marks on the trifecta of laptop features: ultraportability, a gorgeous OLED display, and strong performance. There are some tradeoffs with its extremely lightweight design, but for the majority of users, the pros outweigh the cons.\nIf you're looking for more budget-friendly options, the Acer Swift Edge 16 features the same sized OLED screen and weighs slightly more at 2.73 pounds, but will only cost you $1,300."

Sony engineers worked with e-sports organization Fnatic to develop the H9 II, resulting in a handful of quality-of-life features that gamers will appreciate. This includes button placement, fit, and my personal favorite feature -- the detachable mic.\nAlso: The best headphones and earbuds of 2025\nThe H9 II takes a precise approach to audio, with 360 spatial sound that communicates subtle effects like footsteps behind you and directional movement, for some pretty impressive immersion.\nThe 30mm drivers here are the same as Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, so you're getting rich audio as a baseline, with some EQ presets designed specifically for effects you'll encounter in FPSs, like footsteps, gunshots, and directional sound effects.\nNotably, however, they're smaller than the 40mm drivers in the H9, supporting Sony's goal here in allowing for clearer, more detailed sound. We're talking rustling leaves, gentle breezes, and of course, gunfire with precise locationality.\nEnvironment plays a big role in how well you can hear all of these things, of course. You can't exactly hear the footsteps of the player stalking behind you with barking dogs in the background. Luckily, the headphones' noise canceling works very well, reinforced by the gentle, but complete, seal offered by the earpads.\nNoise cancellation can be toggled with the button on the left between ambient, ANC on, or off. While on, it succeeds at blocking out your environment to dramatic effect.\nThere's other ways to play, though, as any gamer can attest to. Personally, I swap between gaming with ANC on, to swapping to ambient mode and keeping the game's audio to my external speakers. That way, I can relegate voice comms to the headset.\nLuckily, you don't need to do a whole lot of tinkering to get good performance out of these headphones. Their lightweight fit and balanced sound profile makes for solid performance straight out of the box, with additional EQ adjustments acting as a bonus.\nAlso: I wore the best headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, and Sonos: Here's how the AirPods Max wins\nI tried the H9 II in a variety of games, and found the headphones' spatial sound to be very nice. Sound effects that are far off are well telegraphed, with subtle directional effects that, as designed, are even more noticeable in quiet environments with less audio clutter.\nIn terms of comfort, lightweight is the key word here, as the whole headset weighs about 273 grams (0.6 pounds) with a comfortable fit that's both sealed off but comfortable enough to wear for extended sessions.\nThe adjustable headband on the H9 II is made with a braided cloth material that's exceedingly light yet sturdy. The engineering here is a massive improvement over the previous model's thick and clunky padded headband.\nThe headset connects via a USB-C dongle that utilizes a 2.4GHz connection and LE Audio and Bluetooth for multi-point connectivity, while all of the most common settings are accessible via physical buttons on the headphones. This includes the mic mute, ANC on or off, game/chat mode, and the Bluetooth pairing button.\nAlso: Should you buy a handheld PC? This Lenovo model running SteamOS made my decision easy\nThe mute button is especially handy, as it's a toggle switch that's extended when muted, and flush with the headphones when open. Located on the top of the left ear, it gives you one-handed access to quickly mute or speak. If you're ever unsure, there's a red LED at the tip that lights up when you're muted.\nThe power button is on the front of the right side -- a harder to reach spot designed to avoid the accidental tap, but the ANC/Bluetooth buttons are easily mixed up. Looking at the headset for labels may or may not be of help, as the print above the buttons (on the headset with the black colorway) is so tiny and so dark, I had to put my iPhone's flashlight on it to see.\nThis leads me to my other complaint about the headset: the black matte texture is an absolute fingerprint magnet. I've been using these headphones for a week, and they look like I've had them for far longer than that. Granted, wiping them down with a cloth solves this problem, but I definitely would have opted for a different color or finish.\nThe H9 II is also quite good as an all-around pair of headphones away from the console. With the detachable mic, they become regular headphones with sound quality you'd expect from a mid- to upper-tier pair of headphones. In fact, they're louder than my everyday carry pair of JBLs and actually feel great at the gym (yes, I went running with them, and they felt great).\nAlso: I wore the best headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, and Sonos: Here's how the AirPods Max wins\nThe headset's support for multi-point connectivity is a nice plus that allows for connection with multiple devices at the same time. This means when you're deep in the game, you can still hear incoming calls or texts through the headset, preventing important missed calls because you were too busy exploding spaceships.\nTaking calls with the headset is also a surprisingly good user experience. The sound quality is good, and callers said my voice came through loud and clear.\nSo, let's talk battery life. Sony advertises an average of 30 hours of battery life, which is actually less than the 32 average on the H9 but still good for a gaming headset. During my testing, I found that you'll get quite a bit less than this if you use the ANC.\nAlso: This MSI handheld could replace my gaming laptop, and not just for its more portable design\nThat being said, the headset charges fast. Sony says that five minutes of charge time will give you up to three hours of use, which equates to roughly 30% battery in less than 10 minutes. Once you're around 20% juice, the headphones will notify you with a \"Battery low\" notification.\nLuckily, the USB-C to USB-A cord that comes with the headphones is extra long, so if you do need to plug in during a gaming session, it's hardly an issue.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Sony InZone H9 II are a great pair of gaming headphones, and I'd recommend them to anyone who appreciates refined, precise audio effects just as much as booming explosions and gunfire. The 360-degree spatial sound is very immersive, especially for FPS games, and the directional effects really do come alive.\nHowever, the headphones' lightweight form and propensity to be a fingerprint magnet don't do much to exude a \"premium\" aesthetic. Luckily, the white colorway eliminates this problem, but then, white tech is its own challenge in longevity. These are gaming headphones, after all, but for the retail price of $349, these details matter.\nAll in all, the audio wins out, especially since you can detach the mic and have a banger pair of headphones for everyday use."

I broke it down for Windows and Mac users\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- RAM is an important hardware resource that allows a computer to perform optimally and at fast speeds.\n- Escalating computing demands have made 16GB of RAM the new standard for PCs and laptops if they are to continue performing at their best.\n- Even then, 16GB of memory may not be enough for certain users, so it's important to know when to upgrade.\nI used to struggle when shopping for a new computer. Over time, I learned to narrow things down to what I call the \"performance trifecta\" -- three main components you should be mindful of when buying a laptop or desktop: processor, storage drive, and RAM. The first two are pretty easy to figure out. A good processor ensures that a computer performs well, and a lot of local storage means you'll have plenty of room for all your files.\nAlso: One of the best work laptops I've tested has MacBook written all over it (but it's even better)\nMemory is a component I don't think many people fully understand or pay attention to (I was certainly a part of this group). RAM, or random access memory, is essentially a computer's short-term memory. Instead of saving data directly onto an SSD, the computer stores files temporarily in the RAM for quick access. That way, the device won't need to use its storage to open a document or software resources, ensuring fast performance.\nThere's a lot of information and differing opinions regarding RAM and how much you need on your computer. Should you opt for the laptop with the 32GB LPDDR5X RAM, or will 16GB be enough? I'm here to cut through all the fog and provide easy-to-understand advice on the amount of memory you should get.\nHow much RAM do you need in 2025?\nThe short answer: it depends on the operating system. For Windows machines, 16GB of RAM has become the operational minimum on new consumer laptops. Modern workloads have ramped up to such a degree that less RAM on a Windows device is fine, but it will limit you to everyday tasks like writing emails, internet browsing or watching YouTube videos.\nBut let's be real here: the average worker is probably running dozens of tabs in their browser, a handful of apps in the background, and (possibly) generative AI, all of which demand memory power. In that sense, most people using their Windows laptops for work will want at least 16GB (for a value-driven, future-proof option) for a smooth user experience.\nAlso: Why I highly recommend the M4 MacBook Air to most people (and now it's on sale)\nWhen it comes to MacBooks, things are a little bit different. Because Apple's machines are so optimized to handle daily workflows, 8GB of RAM goes a bit further than a stock laptop running Windows. In fact, it wasn't until only recently that Apple made 16GB the starting point with the new MacBook Air M4.\nMacBooks with 8GB are still solid machines for daily use, while more powerful models like the MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max offer substantial power with 24GB, 36GB, or more, making them some of the most powerful laptops on the market (and some of the priciest).\nBesides just Windows and Macs, Chromebooks are a third category of consumer laptops that have seen a spike in popularity over the last few years due to their average lower price and lightweight operating system: ChromeOS.\nBecause ChromeOS is so streamlined, Chomebooks can get along just fine with 8GB or even less, making them great machines for handling the basics like working out of the browser and having your Google Suite at your fingertips with snappy performance and a low price. The trade-off, however, is that you'll have less access to apps you'd otherwise find on Windows.\nAlso: Is a refurbished MacBook viable in 2025? I did the math, and here's my expert advice\nAll in all, it's true to say that the more memory you have, the better your computer should perform. But having too much RAM can also be a poor return on investment because you end up spending money on a resource that you hardly ever use to its fullest extent. It's like owning a big house but only using a few of the rooms.\nWhen buying a new laptop, I just recommend having a clear understanding of what you want to use it for -- that way you can make a realistic expectation about how much RAM you need.\nWhat does DDR5 mean?\nSometimes, when shopping for a computer, you'll see the letters \"DDR\" followed by a number. This is an acronym that stands for \"double data rate.\" Without getting too deep into the weeds, DDR is a type of technology that improves the data transfer speed from RAM to other components, such as the processor. There have been five main DDR generations so far, with the latest and fastest standard being DDR5.\nAlso: I found the 5 best laptop sales - just in time for back to school\nSimilar to 16GB of memory, DDR technology has effectively become the new standard for RAM as users demand faster speeds. There are also variations of the technology. A notable version is LPDDR5X, which stands for low-power double data rate 5X, a more energy-efficient version of DDR5 designed specifically for mobile devices.\nDon't expect DDR6 RAM to be released for a computer near you anytime soon. We saw the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) announce the release of LPDDR6 back in early July. The JEDEC is the organization that established DDR as a standard for computers. The technology is available for manufacturers to implement in their devices, but whether or not it'll happen -- or how soon -- is yet to be seen.\nWant more laptop advice? Add ZDNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nWhen should you upgrade?\n16GB is fine for most cases, although if you're a gamer or creative professional, you should consider opting for 32GB of RAM. More RAM will ensure that the games you play and the video-editing apps you use for work operate more smoothly. I have that amount for my personal computer, and I'm very happy with that setup because I don't just write.\nI also play games on my desktop, edit photographs and videos, and run virtual machines, among other things. It's a heavy workload that requires the correct amount of resources to operate; even then, I am considering upgrading my PC to have more. It's not uncommon for me to see my workload take up over 70% of my computer's total RAM.\nAlso: The best mini PCs you can buy\nI consider anything above 32GB of memory excessive unless you're a specific type of user. If you're editing 8K videos or running heavy apps simultaneously, then you'll probably need 48GB or 64GB of RAM. A good laptop that can deliver would be something like the M4 MacBook Pro or the Dell Premium 16. These are solid, top-of-the-line machines capable of tackling tough workloads.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I choose to make my main computer, as I want to ensure the devices I use can handle my day-to-day tasks. I'm on my computer all day, practically every day of the week.\nAlso: I tested several AIO computers in 2025, and these are the best for your office setup\nI'm also at a point where I've tried just about every type of laptop on the market. I know which features and specs you should look out for when purchasing a new computer -- and which ones are not worth your time.\nThe advice I have given is not a set of hard and fast rules. I just aim to provide a foundation of what you should look for in a laptop. What is best for you depends on your unique needs."

Marketed as a dependable companion for busy students and professionals alike, this device backs up those promises with a lengthy battery, a sharp display, and a lightweight design.\nI spent a couple of weeks with this sleek laptop, and came away impressed by how well it's performed. But it's not just about the hardware, it's the overall user experience. I'd even say that Apple users looking for a MacBook-like experience on Windows should check out the OmniBook 5.\nA familiar aesthetic\nFirst off, at a glance, the OmniBook 5 looks very much like a MacBook itself. From the bright silver colorway to the contrasting gray chiclet-style keys, to the vibrant, 2K display, there is definitely some resemblance here. What surprised me, though, was just how lightweight it was. At 2.84 pounds, lifting the OmniBook feels like lifting a paper notebook.\nLike the MacBook Air, it has only a few ports. On one side, you'll find a pair of 10Gbps Thunderbolt 4 ports, and on the other, a USB-A next to a headphone jack. If you want more, you'll have to supplement the device with a laptop docking station.\nAlso: The best HP laptops you can buy\nThe OmniBook's speakers are located at the front of the laptop, right under the wrist rest. Not the most ideal location, but at least they're powerful. Thanks to HP Audio Boost, audio output is rich, and songs enveloped me in a bubble of sound. Woofers inside HP's laptop provide a nice, punchy bass that can be felt at the bottom of the computer.\nTyping on the keyboard felt quite nice. Each key has a good amount of responsiveness, and thanks to the rubbery caps, they're quiet, too. I'm also pleased to announce that the OmniBook 5 passes the one-finger test. It stays firmly planted while you raise the lid.\nMy review unit's screen was a 2K (1,900 x 1,200 pixels) OLED with a maximum brightness of 300 nits and support for 95% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. A display like this delivers a vibrant visual output that is simply full of life.\nThe one downside is that I didn't like how glossy it is. Even if you crank up the brightness to its maximum setting, it can be hard to see the screen clearly because of how much light it reflects. This is compounded with the inky black OLED.\nLightweight power\nBecause the HP OmniBook 5 is a ARM-compatible laptop, benchmarking can be a little tricky as some of my usual tests didn't work. Under the hood is a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus chipset, 32GB of RAM, and a Qualcomm Adreno X1-45 graphics card. Seeing 32GB of memory in this small laptop surprised me as I was expecting the usual 16GB of RAM.\nYou can get it in a 16GB configuration, by the way, and it's quite a bit cheaper. That version of the HP OmniBook 5 is available at Best Buy for $549.\nAlso: Why my favorite MacBook Pro alternative is this Windows laptop with a striking design\nThe 32GB version, however, is a bit more powerful, and will be able to handle ever-increasing software demands. Having that amount allows the OmniBook to perform quite decently. Below is a chart comparing HP's device to the M4 MacBook Air and the Asus Zenbook A14, a laptop that is similar in form and function.\nYou'll notice that it outperformed the Zenbook in Geekbench, suggesting above-average processing power, although it falls behind Apple's latest MacBook Air with the M4 chip. The OmniBook sits somewhere in between the two. However, the numbers show it falling behind in Cinebench 24, which suggests it'll have some difficulty tackling heavy workloads like rendering high-resolution videos or 3D models.\nDuring my testing, I didn't encounter any major issues with the OmniBook 5. It performed quite well as a work machine. For example, I edited some high-resolution photographs while running several 1440p YouTube livestreams, 10 looping GIFs, and multiple Amazon listings on Chrome. It all performed amicably.\nDuring everyday use, there weren't any slowdowns, and I was able to complete my photo editing just fine. For the second test, I turned up the dial by running 50 Chrome tabs, one of which streamed \"Breaking Bad\" on Netflix.\nI also interacted with HP's AI Companion assistant, and not once were my conversations with the AI assistant interrupted. I was able to freely ask it for advice on how to improve my cardio workouts, and which running shoes to buy without skipping a beat. There was some slowdown with Chrome, but that was more of an issue of the browser having a hard time running 50+ tabs.\nAlso: I always install these 5 free apps on every Windows PC - here's why they're essential\nI am worried that not every Windows app will work on this system. Remember, this is a Windows ARM-compatible computer, and not everything will be fully optimized, but things have come a long way since these processors were released last year. I didn't experience any major issues with any of the third-party apps like Google Chrome, Steam, and Discord. There could always be that odd app out that isn't compatible, though, so be mindful of that.\nZDNET's buying advice\nHP has many different configurations of the OmniBook 5. Currently, the 32GB configuration of the HP OmniBook 5 with the 2K OLED touchscreen is available on HP's website for $899.\nIf you don't need such a powerful device and are looking for something a bit more affordable, Best Buy has the 16GB configuration for $549. A very competitive price for an OLED and 512GB SSD.\nUnsurprisingly, Apple's M4 MacBook Air is a solid alternative to the OmniBook 5 and is currently $100 cheaper. If you prefer to stay on Windows 11, another PC I'd recommend is the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus, which is on sale at Best Buy for 42% off."

It goes without saying that this TV is a beast -- an expensive one. And the Bravia 5 is not even considered the company's flagship model (you can look to the Bravia 8 II and Bravia 9 for that). But this TV is impressive, and after testing it for a week, I'll explain why.\nAlso: You should turn off this default TV setting ASAP - and why even experts recommend it\nThe Bravia 5 is a Google TV, so setting up the UI was fairly easy using the remote and the Google Home app on my phone. But be prepared for a series of screens requiring you to check boxes for privacy disclaimers. The era of streaming content has become very complicated.\nOtherwise, the interface is intuitive, offering quick access to a vast selection of streaming services, apps, and voice control capabilities via Google Assistant. The personalization features are also a plus for helping you discover new content.\nThis behemoth of a display comes with a relatively small remote control. It's slender and lightweight, and if you have fat fingers like me, you might accidentally press enter when you meant to press a navigation button.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated feature that can revitalize an old system for free\nI appreciate the downsizing of remotes across most brands these days. Yet despite all the streamlining, Sony (and most others) insist on including dedicated app buttons. You know, for Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and whatever other platforms the manufacturer contracts with. These buttons take up a lot of real estate and make the remote seem almost \"disposable\" because brands get bought, sold, and sometimes change names.\nFor example, I have a Roku TV with a Vudu button. Who or what is Vudu? That platform still exists, but it's now known as Fandango Media (a joint venture between NBC Universal and Warner Bros.).\nI don't mean to make an example of Sony; its engineers are simply abiding by the current trend. Yet, I haven't met anyone who says they use these dedicated app buttons. When you have a smartly designed home screen, you don't need them.\nThat is one of my two peevish critiques of the Sony Bravia 5. Second is the fact that this remote is not backlit. Come on, Sony. If I'm buying a $6,000 TV, I envision a home cinema experience in the dark (just like in a movie theatre). This means I don't want to turn on my phone to aim a light source at the \"magic wand\" just so I can pause the thing when my DoorDash order arrives. To me, backlighting on remotes seems like a simple ask for anything above a budget model television.\nApologies for my digressionary rant on remote control design. Despite these minor gripes, it became clear to me that the Bravia 5 has plenty to shout about.\nAlso: The next big HDMI leap has arrived - how the 2.2 standard is shaking things up\nFor one thing, Sony's prowess in display technology is impressive. Its proprietary Cognitive Processor XR upscales images beautifully, ensuring motion is slippery smooth with minimal blur. From fast-paced action scenes in the 2023 Mission: Impossible rendition to 2025 NBA highlights, the Bravia 5 delivered 4K resolution with exceptional clarity, vibrant colors, and impressive contrast. HDR content truly pops, showcasing deep blacks and brilliant highlights.\nWhile 4K content looks phenomenal, lower-resolution content (like older cable broadcasts) tends to reveal imperfections more noticeably on such a large screen, even with the XR processor's excellent upscaling.\nThe Sony Bravia 5 can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate with VRR and ALLM enabled, which means the TV dynamically adjusts to match the frame rate of the content being displayed. This is especially good news for gamers. With those kinds of specs, playing Fortnite on a display of this size is an electrifying experience. The Bravia 5 showed no sign of screen tearing, with exquisitely responsive gameplay.\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nAlready impressed by the images on this behemoth TV, I ran a few tests at the lab for dirty screen effect, burn-in, and blooming. I clocked no degradation, even close to the edges. The color test was consistent; the subtitle test yielded no visible blooming, and the scrolling text motion was liquid.\nHaving said that, viewing the Bravia 5 from side angles was not the best. It's fair to assume that, with the same build and technology in a smaller Bravia 5, this would also be the case. With a 98-inch screen, though, you probably won't get many complaints from someone sitting on the far edge of your couch. And while Sony TVs generally handle reflections well, a screen this large can still be susceptible to glare in brightly lit rooms, so strategic placement and light control are important factors. (You might consider getting some blackout curtains.)\nAlso: I changed 12 settings on my Apple TV to instantly improve the performance\nThis Mini LED TV bears a peak brightness of around 800 nits. That isn't eye-popping OLED-level brightness, but in a dark room, you might want to lower the brightness on a Bravia 5 to prevent eye strain. Trust me, the TV is plenty bright, and it can accommodate seating from any conceivable home theater.\nWhat about sound? The Sony Bravia 5 uses Sony's Acoustic Multi-Audio system, and it's worth some praise. It combines two down-firing X-Balanced speakers for bass and midrange with a pair of Sound Positioning tweeters on the top corners of the back panel to handle mids and highs. The result is a well-balanced listening experience, with clear dialogue and vocals complemented by ambient effects that fill the space nicely.\nFor the ultimate audio experience, though, the Sony Bravia 5 could use a companion soundbar to round things out. Again, if you're investing this much in a giant screen, then your budget might not be too far stretched to install a comprehensive surround sound system as well.\nAlso: This is the soundbar I recommend for deeply immersive audio - and now it's $300 off\nThe Bravia 5 has an impressive array of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 on the wireless side, and several physical ports. I really like how Sony included an infographic panel (of sorts) right next to each port to make it clear which cables go where. It comes with four HDMI ports -- one of them eARC (for that soundbar you should buy), another being 4K at 120Hz (for your online gaming needs).\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe 98-inch Sony Bravia 5 is a formidable piece of home entertainment technology. Its stunning picture quality, immersive scale, and excellent smart features make it a dream display for any cinephile or gaming enthusiast.\nGrand proportions notwithstanding, Sony's quality will shine through on any smaller-sized Bravia 5 screen. This one runs for about $5,999, whereas you can get an 85-inch Bravia 5 for less than half that price or a 75-inch for one-third the cost.\nEven if it's not about the money, not every home can accommodate a colossal 98-inch panel. So, if your home's parameters aren't suitable for something this big, you'll arguably be getting a better value by downsizing a step or two on screen size.\nIf you have the budget and space, the Bravia 5 delivers on its promise of a magnificent viewing experience. And if you're seeking the ultimate home cinema experience, pair this TV with a high-end soundbar to match the visual grandeur with equally powerful and nuanced audio.\nBest test deals of the week\nHow we test TVs\nWhile testing and researching the TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:\n- Price: Not all budgets are created equal. And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV.\n- Screen size: The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space.\n- Picture and audio quality: A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. The best TVs we test have often been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.\nFor a more detailed look, check out our extensive TV testing methodology."

The electronics have improved, but the basic act of operating a digital camera has remained mostly the same. Cameras are a gaggle of buttons that are a cryptic arrangement to anyone but the initiated.\nThe real innovation in the picture-taking experience has been the smartphone, which has made picture-taking an always-available tool for documenting everything with relative ease.\nThere is still an audience, however, for innovation beyond what smartphones offer. Young consumers keep buying digital cameras, and a new generation is always interested to learn more about photography as an art.\nAlso: The best vlogging cameras of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nInto the void steps lens and camera maker Sigma Corp., based in Kanagawa, Japan, just outside Tokyo. The company this spring introduced a radical redesign of the digital camera's basic mode of use.\nThe Sigma BF, as it's called, reduces the mass of buttons to a small set of touch-sensitive controls. All the functions of digital photography are still there to be experimented with and exploited -- shutter speed, lens aperture, or \"f-stop,\" and \"ISO,\" the level of light that can be recovered from a scene -- but they are under your command in a radically simplified user interface.\nI've been testing the BF for some weeks now, and I'm smitten with the changes. The hardware's design is beautiful, and the new user interface is very thoughtful. The name \"BF\" stands for \"beautiful foolishness,\" and you could say this kind of redesign is crazy, but I love it.\nA camera for a new age of photographers\nSigma, a sixty-three-year-old company, makes most of its money from lenses for all camera brands. As a result, its cameras have tended to be somewhat experimental, never selling in the same volume as Sony, Canon, or Nikon. That means that the company takes chances. Often, the results are wild and beautiful.\nThe BF is really meant for a new age of prosumers who want to up their game in photography. At a retail price of $2,199, the price is not insignificant, but it is on the low end for what you'd pay for a very good 35mm digital camera these days. Lenses, which have to be bought separately, run from about $600 for a fixed focal length \"prime\" lens to $1,300 or more for zoom lenses. The BF uses what's called an \"L-mount,\" which means you're not limited to Sigma's lenses; it's also compatible with lenses from Leica, Panasonic, Samyang, and Sirui.\nAlso: Eufy's latest security camera has AI-powered color night vision - and no monthly fees\nThe premise of stepping up your game from the smartphone camera is pretty simple, to my mind: You will never, ever, get as good a picture with any smartphone camera as you will with a camera that has a real lens. The lens is the key. The optics are just so superior to the optics on a smartphone.\nI tested the BF with a 50mm prime lens from Sigma, the same kind I already use for most of my photography.\nNo matter what you are photographing, there are immediate benefits to using a real camera versus a smartphone camera.\nOne benefit is the detail you get. Here's a picture of a butterfly landing on some vegetation in a vivarium. When cropping the image to see the butterfly up close, you'll get a level of detail that is clean rather than the murky detail you get even with a smartphone's optical zoom:\n(None of these photos have been edited. They are all straight out of the camera. In some cases, the file size has been compressed to accommodate the publishing system.)\nNot only detail but also control of the depth of field via the aperture dial on the lens provides control over the selective blurring of objects, the \"bokeh.\"\nSmartphones will give you fake bokeh that is generated in software rather than the actual bending of the light via the lens elements. Rarely will fake bokeh give you a really complex, thrilling effect where both foreground and background elements are selectively blurred, leading to a more sophisticated image, such as this cypress I snapped in New York's Central Park:\nAnd even when fake bokeh works, I don't think you'll achieve the almost holographic, floating beauty you get with a real lens while preserving all the detail of the foreground subject, as with this thistle:\nThe second advantage is that a real lens will give you more real proportions than a smartphone lens that has a lot of barrel distortion. Like a building architectural shot or this bank vault:\nYou can get a nice, crisp skyline shot at twilight as the light changes:\nA swing to simplicity\nWhere the BF departs from other cameras is in the simplicity of design and user interface.\nThe hardware is, very simply, a solid shell milled from a block of aluminum and then filled with electronics. It's a gorgeous manufactured object with a super solid feel. (Sigma cameras always feel super solid, but this is on a new level.)\nThe BF's body is one of the lightest full-frame mirrorless cameras on the market, at just under a pound, compared to devices such as the Sony a7 IV, which weighs nearly a pound and a half.\nFor non-camera users, the weight of any real camera is something of a surprise compared to a smartphone such as an Apple iPhone Pro, which weighs half a pound. Holding 15 ounces worth of an unfamiliar object prompted some people to whom I handed the BF to remark, \"It's so heavy!\"\nAlso: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nThe total weight of the camera is the combination of the 15 ounces and the 12 ounces of the 50mm Sigma lens. That kind of heft is typical of full-frame lenses because they have a lot of glass inside them. (And this particular Sigma lens is not very heavy as 50-millimeter lenses go.)\nThe real adjustment for a novice photographer is getting used to the balance of weight between camera and lens versus carrying a slab of a smartphone with uniform weight distribution.\nThe camera comes in two finishes, a striking silver color and a deep black. I chose to try the black as I like to use the camera often in discreet settings such as a jazz club, so I wanted something less flashy than the silver.\nThe sensor is a full-frame, 35mm Sony chip with just under 25 megapixels, less than the 60 megapixels in some 35mm cameras. Despite a lower pixel count, I found the sensor produced rich detail, certainly enough for Instagram pictures and possibly good enough for wall-sized prints depending on the exposure. Sony is a very reliable name for sensors, so it makes sense for Sigma to go with the market leader.\nImages are stored in the internal 230-gigabyte flash memory, which I found to be more than enough for my purposes. I usually offloaded the pictures onto my iPad or MacBook after each photo-taking session via USB-C and then cleared the BF's memory.\nAlso: Why the best fix for headless server frustration might be a little box named Comet\nOn the software side, the radical simplification of the user interface is striking -- it's even something of a revelation.\nI've been a user of Sigma cameras for over a decade, my main camera these days being the Sigma fp-L, a 60-megapixel model introduced a couple of years ago. I love that camera, but I would be very happy to see the changes in the BF user interface become standard on Sigma cameras going forward.\nThe main innovation is removing a lot of shooting information from the LCD screen. Instead of seeing the aperture or shutter speed and other settings constantly on the display, each setting on the BF occupies a separate, tiny LCD -- it's called a \"status monitor\" though I tend to think of it as simply a \"mini-LCD\" -- to the right of the main display.\nA click wheel just below the mini-LCD, formally called the \"dial pad,\" reminiscent of the first Apple iPod's click wheel, lets you rotate through the values of shutter speed, etc. The changing values are displayed on the mini-LCD as you do so, and you click the center button of the click wheel to select the setting you want.\nThere's also a touch-sensitive playback button, so you can peek at what you just snapped with a soft touch, and a touch-sensitive menu button, which is a quick way to peek at the camera's settings. And a power button at the bottom of all this, of course.\nThe effect is that the main display screen is a pristine window into what you're capturing in the real world, while the mini-LCD and the click-wheel are your controls. It's a nice division that elegantly separates the gaze from the adjustments.\nThe main LCD is a 2.1 megapixel model and is terrifically responsive for things such as selecting the focus area by tapping with your finger, or using pinch and swipe when looking through the photos you've taken.\nAlso: Stanford's holographic AI glasses are coming for your clunky VR headset\nIf you half-press the shutter button, the display momentarily shows the key settings before you fully commit to the shutter release. If you press on the center button of the click-wheel, or dial pad, extra settings come up for the function that's in focus, such as shutter speed.\nStreet photography delight\nThe BF's light weight and simplified user interface made for nice street photography, one of my favorite pastimes.\nI tended to carry the camera at my waist in one hand, holding onto the lens, sometimes with the camera body flipped upside-down, with my pinky finger on the shutter button. That way, I achieved a kind of nonchalant pose that did not draw attention to my picture-taking.\nAlso: I used Google's photo-to-video AI tool on my selfie - and it made me do the tango\nSometimes, I looked at the LCD to see what I was snapping, but oftentimes, I just took a picture in the general direction to see what chance would produce.\nThe autofocus function of the BF was super fast, notably faster than the response time of the fp-L, probably because of the BF's lower-megapixel-count sensor. That made for excellent motion capture, such as this basketball game:\nOne of the BF's shortcomings is having an electronic shutter: Instead of mechanical blades opening and closing, the sensor chip controls in software when the exposure happens. The common knock against an electronic shutter is that it can lead to blurring of fast motion. In the case of the basketball game, in late afternoon daylight, I saw no issue.\nAnother potential drawback is that indoors, in artificial light, the electronic shutter can produce dark bands across the image if the shutter speed is too fast. That can require you to take the picture at a slower shutter speed. In practice, I found it not to be much of a problem.\nImproved electronics\nIn addition to autofocus speed, Sigma has done a very good job with the BF's low-light support, which was already quite good on the fp-L.\nOne of my favorite low-light picture tests is a diorama in the North American mammals hall of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. This is one of the darkest exhibits in the museum, and it's challenging to photograph if you don't have the camera resting on a tripod to allow for a long exposure.\nAlso: Why ads are coming to your favorite AI bots and you've only got yourself to blame\nTwo taxidermy wolves run on a painted landscape of the Michigan countryside. To the naked eye, the diorama is very, very dark because it is meant to suggest nighttime on the prairie. Here's what it typically looks like, taken with minimal low-light support by the BF:\nMost museum visitors who view the diorama turn on their smartphone camera's flash to take a souvenir shot. But, to my mind, flooding the scene with flash spoils the effect.\nInstead, I cranked up the BF to its highest ISO setting, 102,400 -- fairly high up there for any digital camera. The result is that the wolves emerge in beautiful detail from the darkness -- not as sharp or clean as if the scene were well-lighted, but that's the point:\nIn practice, the BF does a very nice job in darkly lit spaces where you might actually want a picture, such as a jazz club.\nWhen set on a tripod with professional lighting and a backdrop, the BF is also excellent for formal portraits, far better than what you'll get using a smartphone camera for your headshots.\nEven without using a macro lens, the 50mm will allow you to get pretty good closeup shots of something like your favorite toy, from a minimum distance of 18 inches, which you can then crop and still have lots of vivid detail.\nOf course, you could also add a macro lens to the BF and get even closer.\nA gentle introduction to pro features\nSigma has simplified some of the functions for newbies so that the same technical effects are present but in a more inviting fashion. For example, on the Sigma fp-L, a separate button is for \"tone control\" that lets you adjust the light across the scene by degrees for shadows and highlights to make a scene have more or less contrast.\nOn the BF, there's no button for tone control, but when selecting colors with the click-wheel, you can bump up or down values of \"highlight,\" \"shadow,\" and \"fade,\" to alter the degrees of lights and darks. That works in both still images and videos.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nThere's also an option called \"look effect,\" where you can dial up or down how vivid or how flat a given color filter is, which is a nice, obvious way to understand making your pictures or videos more striking or more sedate.\nIn practice, the BF does a great job with tone and exposure on automatic. A street scene at sunset, for example, nicely balances the vivid highlights of the sky with the street detail without blown highlights or detail lost in the shadows.\nWhen you review photos, the main LCD display gives you all the information on the tone adjustments you made, which is helpful for determining what works and what doesn't.\nSome things that are typically buried in sub-menus on digital cameras are brought forward in the BF's UI.\nSo, for example, when filming a movie, you have the option to turn on \"constant AF,\" which does a better job of grabbing hold of a new subject entering the frame. That is now an option from the click-wheel rather than being buried as a sub-menu option.\nOf course, there are trade-offs to simplicity. Other functions that were accessed directly via dedicated buttons on digital cameras become things you have to hunt for.\nFor example, auto-exposure lock forces the camera to keep the amount of light in the scene the same as you move it, rather than altering the exposure. This allows you to find the right balance of light and dark and hold onto it while you shift your focus.\nAlso: The 10 apps I can't live or work without - on Windows, Mac, and mobile\nOn the fp-L, auto-exposure lock has its own button. In the BF, you have to move the click wheel to the exposure section of the menus and then turn on auto-exposure lock by tapping on the icon. This extra step is fine if you don't use auto-exposure lock much.\nAnother example is a feature of most digital cameras called fill light, the ability to lighten up dark parts of a picture. On most cameras, you have an option to turn on the fill light while you're taking pictures. On the BF, fill light is something you adjust after the fact by editing the DNG, \"digital negative,\" or \"RAW,\" image in the camera.\nSigma's suggestion overall is to use color and filter adjustments to achieve a similar effect to fill light. In other words, the user interface consolidates traditional operations such as fill light and auto-exposure lock into a simpler set of choices that can be more centrally manipulated.\nAnd some things are just different. On the fp-L, and most cameras, when recording a video, you can take a still image as you're recording. On the BF, if you want a still image as well, you do it when replaying the video, by selecting \"save as JPEG.\"\nHow it performs with video\nSpeaking of video, I found the results were very satisfying. You can take 6K video (6,016 x 3,384) that looks great even without electronic stabilization turned on.\nI took this shot of a woman having her personal photo shoot in front of the Plaza Hotel. Although it's jerky and not cinematic, it was a wonderful spontaneous moment in great quality:\nWhen you turn on the electronic stabilization feature, video is reduced from 6K to \"ultra-high-def\" (3,840 x 2,160) because the camera needs to crop each frame to line up frames and make the shakiness disappear.\nIn a low-light setting, such as this video at Small's jazz club in Greenwich Village, I thought it produced a wonderful-looking film without a tripod.\nHere's where we see an example of the click-wheel at its best. I had the fun of rotating through the different color filters to change up the color from moment to moment while filming, something I would never do when color choices are a single button.\nAlthough my use of the feature is rather gimmicky here, I can see all kinds of possibilities with the click wheel, enabling new ways of controlling the camera during filming.\nLike all cameras, the sound you record with the built-in microphone video is never as good as if you had a dedicated mic attached, especially for something like music. But I thought the result here was very good in a space with challenging acoustics.\nAlso: This hidden Pixel camera setting gave my photos the pop they've been missing\nEven in low light, using the camera hand-held, you can get a nice video like this one taken in a darkened tango hall. In a dark place like a dance hall, with swaying bodies moving to and fro, with the camera in your hand and no stabilization turned on, it can be challenging to capture motion in a way that's satisfying. I love what the BF did with the color and the lights in this scene while managing to shift autofocus from one couple to the next:\nBattery life\nBattery life was fine for my purposes. I got as much as six hours of shooting on a single charge, including intermittent shooting and periods of intense activity. That meant in some cases over 500 exposures in DNG+JPEG format. That's better than the official specification by Sigma for approximately 260 images on a charge. Of course, your results may vary.\nIn my experience, plugging the BF into an iPad via USB-C for forty minutes will charge the camera from zero back to a third of its battery life. You can also bring along a spare battery and swap it in via the latched compartment on the bottom of the BF.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe complaints I've seen about the Sigma BF from seasoned photographers seem to be mostly about the reduction of controls to the click wheel and the mini-LCD. Consolidating controls in that way, they argue, robs the pro photographer of their muscle memory. Some pros also wish the touch screen did more to control the functions rather than just serving as a very good display.\nAlso: I tried Google's new agentic IDE, and it blows away the popular VS Code - here's how\nIn essence, pros have a hard time adjusting to a radically simplified UI. It's a fair point of view, but this is something of a Steve Jobs moment. You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette, and you may have to break habits to reinvent how photography is done.\nI think the BF is a terrific option for a beginning photographer or even an experienced pro. The touch-screen display is intuitive in a smartphone age, the electronics are just as fast as you'd expect based on smartphone picture-taking, and the output is very Instagram-worthy.\nAnd your envious friends will immediately want to know, What is that wild-looking camera you've got?"

That's a $400 discount on one of the best laptops we've tested this year.\nWhen Asus officially announced the Zenbook A14 at CES this year, I wasn't the only one to be low-key enamored with it. It's a great laptop in its own right, but it stands out as a successful balancing act between performance and affordability while hitting all the right notes that consumers care about.\nMade of Asus' proprietary ceraluminum material, the Zenbook A14 almost feels like a prototype model that's empty inside, as it's exceedingly light at just 2.1 pounds (for reference, the 13-inch MacBook Air is 2.7 pounds). When you set it down, the device opens easily with the lift of a single finger, revealing the brilliant OLED display.\nAlso: This 16-inch Acer is a full-package value pick I'd happily replace my main laptop with\nAsus committed to a neutral-forward aesthetic with the A14. The brand messaging features muted tones and quiet, sophisticated imagery punctuated by natural motifs, which work to form a cohesive identity.\nThis aesthetic highlights Asus' determination to deliver a cohesive brand message while balancing innovation and cost. For example, the display on the Zenbook A14 looks good right out of the box. It's bright, crisp, and efficient. But closer inspection reveals that it's not as premium a display as you'd find on, say, Asus' ProArt P16.\nThe display is framed by plastic bezels carefully designed not to look cheap, but again\u2026 this isn't the ProArt. Additionally, the panel over the FHD display has some slight warping that can give a funhouse mirror effect when you catch your reflection on the glossy surface.\nOnce the display is turned on, however, whatever jumpscare you just saw is quickly forgotten, as it delivers a brilliant image: contrast is crisp, colors are vivid, and it's bright, at 600 nits and a full HD+ (1920 x 1200) resolution that pairs well with the speedy performance.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for a week, and it makes even the XPS feel outdated\nSpeaking of performance, let's discuss the tech that powers this device. Asus again focused on balance, pairing the base-level Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor with the 32GB RAM configuration and the slightly faster Snapdragon X Plus with the lower-end, 16GB RAM configuration.\nThis balancing act results in a slightly unintuitive pricing structure: the laptop with the higher-end processor is cheaper ($999) as it comes with half the memory (which is what you're really paying for). The version with more RAM and the lower-end Snapdragon X processor starts at $1,099.\nThe difference between the two processors is ultimately not that massive, both are eight-core chips, but the Snapdragon X chip is limited to 3.0 GHz clock speed, putting a performance cap on this laptop.\nThat cap is fine because this device isn't made to tackle intensive workloads. It's for the modern professional who lives in the cloud, works remotely, and values a nice display.\nAlso: The hybrid Windows laptop I recommend most for work travel also has an OLED display\nThat being said, the performance is solid. It's a fast laptop: it boots quickly, loads apps swiftly, and navigates the web without lag. It runs silent and cool, generating almost no heat -- even with the slim form factor.\nIn our benchmarking tests, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processor performed better than I expected against more premium devices with Intel's Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" chip, particularly in its higher-end sibling, the Zenbook S14, and Dell's XPS 13 in multi-core performance. The processor even surpassed the latter in single-core performance.\nComparing this laptop's numbers to HP's OmniBook X with the Snapdragon X Elite, for example, suggests the device is outclassed at the higher end of performance but is highly optimized for everyday tasks and able to deliver a faster, more efficient experience in those use cases.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nZenbook A14 (Snapdragon X) | 541 | 2133 | 10624 |\nZenbook S 14 (Intel Lunar Lake) | 481 | 2748 | 11050 |\nDell XPS 13 (Intel Lunar Lake) | 552 | 2743 | 11005 |\nHP Omnibook X (Snapdragon X Elite) | 470 | 2326 | 13160 |\nThe laptop's strong performance is allied to an enjoyable physical form factor. The keyboard is fantastic -- it's one of the most comfortable laptop keyboards I've used. I make this claim without exaggeration and note its success isn't due to anything particularly expensive or high-end. Asus just hit the mark when balancing design and cost.\nAlso: I recommend this Asus laptop to creative professionals and business users alike. Here's why\nThe keys are smooth and matte, with a slick texture that borders on ASMR. I also love how the laptop's ceramic body is fingerprint-resistant and easy to clean, even when splashed in the kitchen or coffee shop.\nFor remote or hybrid workers who move from place to place, the laptop also features the right number of ports (an HDMI, two USB-Cs, and one USB-A) to handle whatever accessories you carry in tow or to charge the battery. I'm (sort of) kidding, but that leads me to my last point.\nHands down, the best part of this laptop is the outstanding battery life. Asus advertises up to 32 hours on a single charge. Although that's the top end of the estimation, it's not far off from what you can expect with everyday use. During my testing, a day's work in the office didn't take me down past 50%.\nThe Snapdragon X processor reduces power consumption to a trickle when it's not in use. If you do need juice, the A14 charges quickly, reaching close to 75% after just an hour of charging. This capability translates to a laptop that can last a couple of days' work on one charge, even if that includes multiple video calls.\nAlso: I'm a Windows user, but the MacBook Air M4 could be my new primary laptop at this price\nI'll also mention a few of the drawbacks of this laptop (but there aren't many). The first is that the Qualcomm Adreno GPU on this system is not designed for high-end gaming. Sure, it can certainly handle casual games. But this isn't a device made for the latest FPS.\nAlso, the display, while it looks great, is still capped at a 60Hz refresh rate, which keeps the battery (and price point) low but further limits any aspirations of high-end gaming. Ultimately, while the Zenbook A14 is competitively priced, this is not a $1,500 laptop.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Zenbook A14 has a coherent identity: it's a lightweight, aesthetic machine for the modern professional, effortlessly mobile in both form factor and battery life, but trades some raw power for all that endurance. That being said, the Snapdragon X processor punches well above its weight and competes handily with chips that are, on paper, more powerful.\nBecause of its cohesive identity, how well it balances innovation and value, and the hardware performance, the Zenbook A14 is one of the best laptops I've reviewed in the past year and one I'd strongly recommend as long as its strengths align with your needs.\nTo top it all off, the starting price of $999, when not on sale, is fairly competitive -- if Asus succeeds in selling this laptop's brand story in a way that positions it as an alternative to other ultraportable, such as Apple's MacBook Air.\nWhy the Asus Zenbook A14 gets an Editors' Choice award\nWe awarded the Asus Zenbook A14 an Editors' Choice because it combines a sleek, ultraportable form factor with a balanced design and approachable price point. This laptop looks as good as it performs and balances the right amount of hardware for the everyday user looking for a versatile laptop for work and play. For this set of use cases, it's the best in its class.\nThis story was originally published on February 14, 2025, and was updated on July 31, 2025, to reflect the new Best Buy deal and the latest relevant internal links."
