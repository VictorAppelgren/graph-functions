  "title": "Today's Job Hunt is a Brutal Slog. Here's How That Could Affect Your Hiring Process",
  "description": "As fewer jobs are being created, competition for each open role is stepping up. The application process can be hugely frustrating.",
  "content": "As fewer jobs are being created, competition for each open role is stepping up. The application process can be hugely frustrating.\n\nWe all know that the rigmarole of applying for a new job is both time consuming and emotionally complex. But a new report shows that the process is becoming all but impossible for many job seekers in the U.S. Online resume building service Zety surveyed nearly 1,000 American workers who\u2019d experienced a layoff inside the last two years, and found that over half of these people had submitted over 50 applications to suitable companies before landing a new job.\n\nThat sounds pretty bad, but the next statistic may unsettle you: one in five of the people Zety surveyed said they\u2019d submitted over 100 applications, CNBC reports. This implies an all but continuous cycle of searching for a job, filling out applications, sending them off, and then rinse and repeat \u2014 tailoring what each application says to meet each employer\u2019s unique needs. Meanwhile, over 30 percent of survey respondents said they\u2019d been unemployed for over 90 days before finding a new job, which happened despite the fact that one in three people began looking for new work immediately, and over three in four of them began searching inside a month of being laid off. Five percent of the respondents said they were without work for over a year. Zety\u2019s data also show that when they were looking for new work, transitions between different types of career were unusual \u2014 some 85 percent of people who found new work did so inside the same industry they\u2019d been laid off from. And in terms of barriers to finding a new job, nearly six in 10 respondents said that the prospect of lower salaries was the biggest challenge. Other top issues included a lack of clarity in job listings, a slow interview and application process, fierce competition for the same role, \u201cghosting\u201d by recruiters, and explaining a layoff during interviews.\n\nAnecdotally, this data resonates with other reports about the state of the job market. The New York Times, for instance, reported this week on the dismal state of job creation in New York City. The report noted that hiring had fallen off significantly in the first half of 2025, with just 956 private sector jobs added\u2014the \u201cslowest growth in payrolls outside a recession in decades.\u201d Last year, 66,000 additional people were hired, but the slowdown is a result of some companies slowing hiring even as other sectors, such as finance or hospitality, are actually shedding workers. Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, told the paper that \u201cNew York is a leading indicator, and the flattening of employment is now showing up nationally.\u201d The Times pointed out that the city\u2019s unemployment rate of 4.7 percent is \u201chigher than both the state and the national average,\u201d and it\u2019s skewed worse for \u201csome segments of the city\u2019s population, especially young workers.\u201d\n\nThat last point is supported by other recent news, including data showing that the AI revolution is already putting some male Gen-Zers staff out of work, as companies choose to use AI tools instead of employing humans for entry-level tasks. This is because men are overrepresented in some sectors of the market where AI is being deployed, compared to the way women are overrepresented in other sectors like healthcare or hospitality, where AI can\u2019t yet replace people. Why should you care about this, unless you\u2019re actually looking for a new job? Because all of this may reflect on two things: the state of the economy and, separately, how your company carries out its own recruitment process. A stagnant jobs market could combine with other warnings to indicate an incoming recession, which would affect many parts of your business from prices to banking and even the cost of borrowing money.\n\nMeanwhile, if you\u2019re looking for new staff you may find the job market flooded \u2014 which means your recruitment process could see many more people applying for an open role. Vetting large numbers of candidates will cost you more time and money, but there is an upside: with more people in the job pool, there may be more qualified applicants who could be an ideal fit.",

      "text": "Amidst a challenging job market, a new report from Zety found that American workers are struggling to land new jobs after a layoff.\nZety, a career and resume platform, surveyed almost 1,000 Americans who have experienced a layoff in the past two years.\nAccording to the report, 53% of laid-off workers submitted more than 50 applications before landing a new role, and 1 in 5 submitted over 100 applications.\nAdditionally, over 30% of laid-off workers were unemployed for over 90 days before securing a new job, even though 76% of workers began their job search less than a month after being laid off.\nAccording to Jasmine Escalera, a career expert at Zety and the author of the report, the data aligns with what she's been hearing from job seekers and seeing on social media.\n\"We know that it's a challenging and tough job market, and we've been hearing for a while that many job seekers are having a hard time landing positions,\" Escalera says. \"We've been seeing professionals post about applying to sometimes hundreds of jobs before they actually land one.\"\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest report, U.S. employers added just 73,000 jobs in July \u2013 a sharp decrease from last July's total of 114,000 jobs.\nMoreover, U.S. employers announced over 62,000 job cuts in the month of July, a 140% increase from last year, according to outplacement services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\nFrom a job seeker's perspective, the Zety report's findings should \"validate your experience\" of struggling to find a new position, Escalera says.\n\"Now, does that make the experience okay? Of course not,\" she continues. \"But job seekers can maybe breathe a little bit of a sigh of relief and say, 'OK, it really isn't just me.'\"\nA \"recipe for disaster\"\nAccording to Zety's report, workers currently face a number of obstacles in the job search, including vague job listings, slow application and interview timelines, increased competition for the same roles and being \"ghosted\" during the process.\nA primary concern is that companies are offering lower salaries, Escalera says.\n\"It's a company market right now,\" she says. \"Companies have the upper hand, which is unfortunate, and I think they're using that to their advantage by lowering salaries.\"\nHelp us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals\nMeanwhile, the report found that 62% of laid-off workers are dipping into their savings and emergency funds to tide them over until their next job, while 54% rely on credit cards or loans. Almost 1 in 10 laid-off workers are using government aid like SNAP to stay afloat.\nThese conditions create \"a recipe for disaster\" for workers, Escalera says, with long-term consequences for their financial stability.\n\"We're dealing with a job seeker who's likely stressed because they've been laid off, maybe a little bit desperate, feeling the financial insecurity and instability \u2014 and then finally, they land a job, and that job isn't even paying them market value,\" she says.\nEven after finding another job, their anxiety lingers: 62% of workers reported feeling very concerned that a potential recession could affect their new role.\n\"It's kind of a traumatic experience for a career professional to be laid off, especially if you didn't know it was coming,\" Escalera says.\nTop tips for job seekers\nMost job seekers are using the right tactics to secure a new role, Escalera says, but it's difficult to stand out in the current market.\n\"The basic things that we used to tell job seekers to do, all job seekers are doing,\" she says.\nThough you may feel reluctant to bring up your layoff in job applications, Escalera recommends being open about your current employment situation. According to the report, 94% of laid-off job seekers included a cover letter addressing their layoff.\n\"There is no such thing as a linear career, and so there is no reason to shy away from talking about a layoff,\" she says.\nIf you've been unemployed for several months, explaining your situation to hiring managers will help clarify the gap on your resume, Escalera says. It also gives you an opportunity to mention any programs, certificates or skills you've been working on in the interim.\nRight now, networking should be \"top of mind,\" according to Escalera: \"My advice for anyone in this job market right now is really focus on human to human interactions.\"\nYou can also find support from other job seekers, \"especially if you happen to be caught in a wave of layoffs,\" Escalera says.\n\"Being with other job seekers who are also going through it will help you validate your experiences, get the support you need, hear about what other people are doing in their job search and give you some new and fresh ideas,\" she says.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?
