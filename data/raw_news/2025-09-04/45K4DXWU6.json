  "title": "Aukey\u2019s new wireless charger gives you more freedom through the power of the orbs",
  "description": "Wireless charging with more freedom.",
  "content": "is a senior reporter who\u2019s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.\n\nAukey has announced a new modular charging solution called the MagFusion Ark. It combines a base station featuring up to three Qi2.2 charging pads with spherical power banks that each have their own Qi2.2-compatible pads. The spheres support passthrough charging and can wirelessly charge another device while they\u2019re on the base station, but they can also be removed and used as standalone wireless chargers powered by either their 6,700mAh battery or a USB-C port.\n\nPricing will be announced closer to the MagFusion Ark\u2019s release in Q1 of 2026, but it will be available in three different configurations: a bundle that includes a base with three pads and three spheres, as well as one- and two-pad bases with the spheres sold separately. The Ark is entirely Qi2.2-compatible, and both the base and spheres will wirelessly charge Qi2.2 devices at rates up to 25W.\n\nOn battery power alone, the number of times that the spheres can be used to fully recharge a device like a smartphone will depend on the capacity and health of that device\u2019s own battery. But given the battery in the spheres is also used to power a cooling fan, you can probably expect to get at least one full smartphone charge out of them, or a handful of top-ups.\n\nEach sphere also features a 30W USB-C port. You can use it to maximize the sphere\u2019s battery capacity by sidestepping the inefficiencies of wireless charging, charge devices that aren\u2019t Qi2-compatible, or even keep the sphere plugged in to use as a charging stand. You can also charge two devices simultaneously from each sphere \u2014 one from the USB-C port and one from the Qi2 pad\u2014 but wireless charging rates drop to 15W while the USB-C port\u2019s output drops to 20W.\n\nAlthough Aukey says the MagFusion Ark offers a \u201ctotal of six charging points,\u201d you\u2019ll only be able to wirelessly charge three devices at a time on the base station, excluding the spheres. When the spheres are each being used independently to charge other devices, that then frees up the pads on the base for other devices. That\u2019s a bit limiting given the relatively large footprint of the Ark\u2019s base, but the added flexibility of being able to grab one of the spherical chargers and use it anywhere in your home could be worth the tradeoff.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",
