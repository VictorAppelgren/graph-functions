  "title": "Do Wall Street Analysts Like Accenture Stock?",
  "description": "Accenture has significantly underperformed the broader market and the tech sector over the past year, and analysts have turned more cautious on the stock\u2019s prospects.",
  "content": "Valued at $149.8 billion by market cap, Dublin, Ireland-based Accenture plc (ACN) is a global leader in professional services. Accenture partners with top businesses, governments, and organizations worldwide to enhance their digital foundations, optimize operations, accelerate revenue growth, and improve public services.\n\nAccenture has significantly underperformed the broader market over the past year. ACN stock has plunged 24.5% over the past 52 weeks and 32.2% on a YTD basis, compared to the S&P 500 Index\u2019s ($SPX) 19.3% gains over the past year and 8.4% returns in 2025.\n\u2022 Tesla Is Axing Its Dojo Supercomputer Plans. What Does That Mean for TSLA Stock Here?\n\u2022 Should You Buy the Post-Preliminary Earnings Plunge in C3.ai Stock?\n\u2022 Stop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief \u2013 your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nNarrowing the focus, Accenture has also underperformed the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund\u2019s (XLK) 28.4% gains over the past year and 13.6% surge in 2025.\n\nAccenture stock has remained under pressure in recent months. Its stock prices dropped 6.9% in a single trading session following the release of its Q3 results on Jun. 20. The company\u2019s topline for the quarter increased by a notable 7.7% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, beating Street estimates by 2.6%. Further, growth in earnings and a drop in outstanding shares due to share buybacks led to an impressive 14.8% growth in EPS to $3.49, surpassing the consensus estimates by 5.8%. Moreover, the company also raised its lower band of full-year revenue growth guidance from the prior range of 5% - 6% to 6% - 7% (in local currency).\n\nHowever, Accenture\u2019s new bookings at the end of Q3 stood at $19.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year in USD terms and down 7% in local currency. This dented investor confidence and led to a selloff.\n\nFor the full fiscal 2025, ending in August, analysts expect ACN to deliver an EPS of $12.88, up 7.8% year-over-year. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. While it surpassed the Street\u2019s bottom-line estimates thrice over the past four quarters, it missed the projections on one other occasion.\n\nThe stock has a consensus \u201cModerate Buy\u201d rating overall. Of the 23 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 15 \u201cStrong Buys,\u201d one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and seven \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is notably less optimistic than two months ago, when the stock had a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating overall, with 16 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d recommendations on it.",
