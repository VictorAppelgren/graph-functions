  "content": "0954 ET - The Pro Farmer Crop Tour finishes with yields for fields surveyed in Iowa and southern Minnesota released last night. Iowa posted increased yields for both corn and soybeans, reporting an average corn yield of 198.43 bushels an acre, up from 192.79 bpa in 2024. Iowa soybean pod counts averaged 1384.38 pods per a 3x3 foot square, up 5.5% increase from the previous year. Minnesota posted a solid bounceback from its troubled output last year, with the corn yield projected at 202.86 bpa -- up significantly from 164.9 bpa last year and a 3-year average of 178.88 bpa. Soybean pod count for a 3x3 square was 1247.86 pods, up over 20% from the previous year. Pro Farmer will release its final tallies this afternoon. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)\n\n0930 ET - Grain futures are mixed as markets await the final report from the Pro Farmer Tour. Corn fields in Iowa had big yields, although signs of tip back and disease kept showing. In Minnesota, corn yield was the best in more than two decades, AgResource says in a report. AgResource also says that rumors about potential Chinese buying of U.S. soybeans are supporting the grain's price. Wheat, meanwhile, remains sluggish amid lukewarm demand. On the CBOT, soybeans and corn are up slightly, while wheat inches lower. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)\n\n1204 GMT - The EU's framework trade deal with the U.S. is partially positive but leaves steel and aluminum heavily taxed, creating uncertainty, says the European Steel Association, also known as Eurofer. Most EU products face a 15% U.S. import tariff but steel, aluminum and their derivatives are still hit with a 50% tariff until a legally binding agreement is reached, Eurofer says. To protect domestic steel producers from excess steel being dumped onto the market by other countries, the EU and the U.S. need to coordinate so both sides can defend their markets without undermining each other, Eurofer director Axel Eggert says. (maitane.sardon@wsj.com)\n\n1019 GMT - Palm oil prices closed higher, tracking gains on the soybean oil market, says David Ng, trader at Kuala Lumpur-based Iceberg X. Recent strength seen in export performance also lifted market sentiment, he adds. Ng sees support for crude palm oil futures at 4,500 ringgit a ton and resistance at 4,680 ringgit a ton. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives November contract rose 71 ringgit to close at 4,531 ringgit a ton. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)\n\n0855 GMT - European natural-gas prices rise as expectations of a Russia-Ukraine cease-fire wane and supply squeezes loom. The benchmark Dutch TTF contract trades 0.8% higher to 33.45 euros a megawatt hour and is on track for a 4.1% weekly gain, entirely recovering from last week's losses. Gas prices had dropped to their lowest level in more than a year ahead of the summit between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in mid-August, though the negotiations ended without any concrete agreements. Attention is now increasingly turning to maintenance work in Norway, which will lower Norwegian gas flows to Europe, ING analysts say in a note. European Union gas storage is close to 75% full at the moment, lagging the five-year average of 82% and well below last year's 91%, analysts add. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)\n\n0752 GMT - Oil prices rise on fading optimism for a near-term cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine. Brent crude is up 0.3% at $67.85 a barrel, while WTI is up 0.35% at $63.74 a barrel. Oil prices are set to end the week higher as initial enthusiasm for peace talks starts to fall, ING analysts say in a note. A summit between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is proving difficult to set up, while discussions around potential security guarantees are facing obstacles, ING says. Russia, for example, is suggesting that it should be part of any security guarantees for Ukraine, analysts note. The less likely a cease-fire looks, the more likely the risk of tougher sanctions on Russia and therefore higher oil prices, ING says. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)\n\n0250 GMT - Palm oil gains in early Asian trade on solid sentiment, supported by robust demand expectations, AmInvestment Bank says in a note. Demand is likely to strengthen with India's coming festival season adding further buying interest, it says. August output was also only slightly higher. AmInvestment Bank expects CPO futures to find support at 4,475 ringgit a ton and face resistance at 4,561 ringgit a ton. The Bursa Malaysia Derivatives contract for October delivery is 47 ringgit higher at 4,507 ringgit a ton. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)\n\n0248 GMT - Iron ore prices are lower amid weak fundamentals. The market doesn't have high expectations for stronger demand in the long term, Baocheng Futures analysts write in a note. Supply remains at a high level compared with previous years, especially from overseas miners, they say. The higher supply and weaker demand are weighing on iron ore prices, they add. The most actively traded January iron ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange is 0.8% lower at CNY769.5 a ton. (jiahui.huang@wsj.com; @ivy_jiahuihuang)\n\n0200 GMT - Aluminum is steady in the Asian session, with the three-month LME contract flat at $2,585.50 a ton. The base metal continues to shrug off concerns of rising supply, says ANZ Research analysts in a note. Indonesia has a growing pipeline of aluminum projects with policy measures such as export bans being used to incentivize new investments in refineries and smelters. This could deliver a five-fold increase in aluminum output, they say. That said, Indonesia's aluminum industry isn't likely to develop to a point where it dominates the market over nickel, they reckon, citing smaller bauxite reserves and slower growth in aluminum demand. \"Despite the uncertain economic backdrop, the aluminium market is expected to tighten in 2026, as supply growth moderates,\" they add.(megan.cheah@wsj.com)",
