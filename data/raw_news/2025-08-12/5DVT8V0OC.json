  "content": "The Fund invests in a globally diversified and actively managed portfolio (the \u201cPortfolio\u201d) consisting primarily of dividend-paying securities of power and infrastructure companies whose assets, products and services Brompton believes are facilitating the multi-decade transition toward decarbonization and environmental sustainability. The Portfolio may include investments in companies operating in the areas of renewable power (wind, solar, hydroelectric), green transportation (electric vehicles, energy transportation and storage, railroads, carbon capture), energy efficiency (smart grids, smart meters, building efficiency), and communications (communication networks, 5G wireless technology), among others.\n\nSince inception on May 21, 2021 to July 31, 2025, the Class A Share has delivered a 14.0% per annum return, outperforming the S&P Global Infrastructure Total Return Index and the MSCI World Total Return Index by 4.3% per annum and 3.8% per annum, respectively. ( 2 ) Since inception to July 31, 2025, Class A shareholders have received cash distributions of $3.45 per share. Class A shareholders also have the option to reinvest their cash distributions in a dividend reinvestment plan which is commission free to participants.\n\nTORONTO, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (TSX: PWI, PWI.PR.A) Sustainable Power & Infrastructure Split Corp. (the \u201cFund\u201d) is pleased to announce that the board of directors of the Fund has approved an extension of the maturity date of the class A shares (the \u201cClass A Shares\u201d) and preferred shares (the \u201cPreferred Shares\u201d) of the Fund. The current maturity date of May 29, 2026 will be extended for an additional term of approximately 5 years to May 29, 2031. The Preferred Share dividend rate for the extended term will be announced at least 60 days prior to the current May 29, 2026 maturity date and will be based on market yields for preferred shares with similar terms at that time. The term extension allows Class A shareholders to continue their investment with an attractive distribution rate of 10.2% based on the August 11, 2025 closing price, and the opportunity for capital appreciation. (1) The extension of the term of the Fund is not a taxable event and enables shareholders to defer potential capital gains tax liability that would have otherwise been realized on redemption of Class A Shares or Preferred Shares at the end of the term, until such time that shares are disposed of by shareholders.\n\nFounded in 2000, Brompton is an experienced investment fund manager with income and growth focused investment solutions including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other Toronto Stock Exchange (\u201cTSX\u201d) traded investment funds. For further information, please contact your investment advisor, call Brompton\u2019s investor relations line at 416-642-6000 (toll-free at 1-866-642-6001), email info@bromptongroup.com or visit our website at www.bromptongroup.com.\n\n(1) No distributions will be paid on the Class A Shares if (i) the distributions payable on the Preferred Shares are in arrears, or (ii) in respect of a cash distribution, after the payment of a cash distribution by the Company the NAV per Unit would be less than $15.00.\n\nReturns are for the periods ended July 31, 2025 and are unaudited. Inception date May 21, 2021. The table shows the Fund\u2019s compound return on a Class A share and Preferred share for each period indicated, compared with the S&P Global Infrastructure Total Return Index (\u201cInfrastructure Index\u201d), and the MSCI World Index (the \u201cMSCI Index\u201d) (together the \u201cIndices\u201d).The Infrastructure Index tracks 75 companies from around the world, chosen to represent the listed infrastructure industry and related operations. The index includes three distinct infrastructure clusters: energy, transportation and utilities. The MSCI Index captures large- and mid-cap representation across 23 developed markets countries and covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each country. The Fund is actively managed; therefore, its performance is not expected to mirror that of the Indices, which have more diversified portfolios and include a substantially larger number of companies. Furthermore, the Indices\u2019 performance is calculated without the deduction of management fees, fund expenses and trading commissions, whereas the performance of the Fund is calculated after deducting such fees and expenses. Additionally, the performance of the Fund\u2019s Class A shares is impacted by the leverage provided by the Fund\u2019s Preferred shares. The performance information shown is based on net asset value per Class A share, or the redemption price per Preferred share and assumes that cash distributions made by the Fund during the periods shown were reinvested at net asset value per Class A share, or the redemption price per Preferred share in additional Class A shares and Preferred shares of the Fund. Past performance does not necessarily indicate how the Fund will perform in the future.\n\nCertain information contained herein (the \u201cInformation\u201d) is sourced from/copyright of MSCI Inc., MSCI ESG Research LLC, or their affiliates (\u201cMSCI\u201d), or information providers (together the \u201cMSCI Parties\u201d) and may have been used to calculate scores, signals, or other indicators.

If the shares are purchased or sold on an exchange, investors may pay more than the current net asset value when buying shares of the investment fund and may receive less than the current net asset value when selling them.\n\nThere are ongoing fees and expenses associated with owning shares of an investment fund. An investment fund must prepare disclosure documents that contain key information about the fund. You can find more detailed information about the Fund in the public filings available at www.sedarplus.ca.
