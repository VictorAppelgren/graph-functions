      "rationale": "The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) end is a specific policy change that may influence Charter Communications’ revenue and the broader broadband sector, but it is a one‑off event with limited centrality and a slow, indirect impact on markets. It does not constitute a structural macro anchor or a high‑frequency driver, so it is best classified as a low‑importance supporting signal (importance level 4)."
