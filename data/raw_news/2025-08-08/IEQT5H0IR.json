  "title": "Shane Van Gisbergen Extends NASCAR Stay With Trackhouse Racing Deal",
  "description": "Shane Van Gisbergen turned a surprise debut win into a career that\u2019s seems to be only getting started.",
  "content": "In NASCAR news that would be shocking if it didn\u2019t happen, Trackhouse Racing announced a contract extension with Shane van Gisbergen Friday.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a one-off dip-your-toes in the NASCAR waters deal, it\u2019s a multiyear contract extension meaning the likable New Zealander isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. It all started with a one-off race with Trackhouse\u2019s Project91 in 2023 that ended with SVG in victory lane and set him on a course to race in NASCAR.\n\n\"I feel like Trackhouse Racing is my home,\" said the 36-year-old Van Gisbergen, who's been proclaimed the greatest NASCAR road racer in history in some circles.\n\n\"Trackhouse gave me the opportunity to race at Chicago in 2023. That was just a one-race deal, and everything that has happened since then is because of the chance Justin (Marks, Trackhouse founder and owner) took on me. The men and women at Trackhouse have helped me feel at home in this new challenge, and I've been loving every minute of it. We still have a lot of work to do, but I couldn't be happier.\"\n\nThe team couldn\u2019t be happier either. After all, the former Australian Supercars champion became the first driver since Johnny Rutherford in 1963 to win his first Cup Series start.\n\nBut that win in Chicago was only just the start. After a year spent under a development contract with Trackhouse, he raced full-time with Kaulig Racing in the Xfinity Series in 2024. He did make 12 Cup series starts in 2024, but Trackhouse made room for him adding a third fulltime slot on their team, and he\u2019s rewarded them handsomely.\n\nSince that Chicago win in 2023 he\u2019s added three more victories, all of those coming this year in his first full time Cup season with the Trackhouse. He won the inaugural Mexico City race, the Chicago Street Race again and at Sonoma. He also grabbed a Xfinity Series victory at the Chicago Street Race, driving for JR Motorsports.\n\nThose Cup wins pushed his career total to four victories in just 37 career races. That makes him the quickest driver to score three wins in NASCAR\u2019s modern era. And if you\u2019re wondering who holds the record for most road course wins in Cup history\u2026 well, he\u2019s got that too.\n\nWith all that what NASCAR team in their right mind wouldn\u2019t want someone of SVG\u2019s caliber signed for many more years. After all there aren\u2019t many drivers capable of doing what he\u2019s done: fly halfway across the planet, learn a completely different type of racing, and still make seasoned veterans look like they\u2019ve left the parking brake on.\n\n\"We are getting to watch one of the superstars of racing,\" said team owner Justin Marks. \"What we are asking him to do carries a high degree of difficulty. He's moved to the other side of the world, learned a new form of racing and at times dominated the competition. He's one of the greatest.\"\n\nSo SVG is here to say. He\u2019s going to be celebrating wins, kicking signed rugby balls into the stands for many years to come and keeping competitors worried on every road course on the schedule.",

      "text": "Once upon a time, 48 months ago, a little LLC with just $500 in the bank imagined shaking up the NASCAR world. Fast forward to Saturday at Daytona, and that dream is not just alive\u2014it\u2019s roaring. Trackhouse Racing, the team that\u2019s been punching above its weight since inception, announced that they\u2019re adding a third team. And to make things even more exciting, they\u2019ve tapped Shane van Gisbergen\u2014yes, the Aussie who stormed into NASCAR just two years ago\u2014to be their latest full-time driver.\nSince their formation Trackhouse teams have won seven races, one of those victories coming with the newest full-time driver: Shane van Gisbergen. For team owner Justin Marks, this expansion wasn\u2019t just a happy accident\u2014it was always part of the master plan.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that three teams is a really strong number of teams to have in this sport,\u201d Marks said. \u201cIt just gives you 33% more of an opportunity on the racetrack every weekend. Frankly, it\u2019s four-car teams are reserved for really, really big companies in this sport, and it\u2019s tough to make four cars work.\n\u201cI think three was kind of always sort of the number for us from day one if things went our way and we could grow from one car to two, that three was kind of the goal. An opportunity be able to come up to expand to a third car for this year, so we took it.\u201d\nThe journey to a fulltime spot in NASCAR\u2019s top tier series for van Gisbergen actually began in a Trackhouse car as part of Trackhouse Racing Project 91 a part time effort that fields one-off entries featuring star drivers from other racing disciplines including 2007 Formula One World Champion Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. And van Gisbergen who will now realize his dream of racing fulltime in the top racing series in America. He will now approach 2025 and his spot on the full-time stage with a mix of pressure, motivation, anxiety, and excitement.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s why we do it,\u201d the driver known as simply SVG explained. \u201cThose feels are good things because it means you care so much about it, right? All this year, I\u2019ve been nervous getting in the car. Anxious. How it\u2019s going to go. How am I going to be? That\u2019s an awesome feeling and something I haven\u2019t had for a few years, so it\u2019s been really cool. It\u2019s cool to be energized like that. Of course there\u2019s going to be pressure. The Cup Series is pretty cutthroat as we\u2019ve seen. A lot of guys, it\u2019s pretty hard to make it. I just have to keep learning, do the best I can, and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nA multi-time Supercars champion, van Gisbergen has been racing in the NASCAR Xfinity series for Kaulig Racing this season and has two wins in that series including adding another trophy from the Chicago Street course in July. Even he admits though he is still on a learning curve.\nAnd the biggest challenge?\n\u201cTurning left,\u201d he quips with a grin. Adding that NASCAR isn\u2019t just about going fast in circles; it\u2019s a sport full of variables\u2014weather changes, rubber build-up, and the chaotic ballet of superspeedway racing. Even the best, like Kyle Larson, can go from first to 20th in a heartbeat. It\u2019s all about instincts, and SVG is still honing his.\n\u201cYou can prep all you want, but it\u2019s having those instincts in how to react and having the best way to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery race, I\u2019m learning something.\u201d\nTrackhouse Racing has secured a Charter for their new team, NASCAR\u2019s equivalent of a Golden Ticket, guaranteeing entry into every Cup Series points race on the schedule. They\u2019ve also locked in sponsorship, details of which will be announced later.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things falling in line,\u201d Marks said. \u201cWe had to take advantage of that opportunity when it was here before we lost it. It wasn\u2019t really that difficult of a decision.\u201d\nSVG\u2019s new ride will sport the No. 88\u2014yes, that No. 88. The one made famous by Dale Earnhardt Jr. during his time at Hendrick Motorsports. Marks didn\u2019t just slap a sticker on the car, though; he made sure to get the blessing of NASCAR royalty.\n\u201cWe talked to Dale Jr., and he was proud to see the number in good hands,\u201d Marks said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s about legacy.\u201d\nIn just a year and a half, SVG has gone from a virtual unknown in NASCAR to a future Cup driver, and Trackhouse has gone from a startup to a serious contender. \u201cIt\u2019s a really cool team to be a part of,\u201d SVG said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work ahead, but I\u2019m pumped for the challenge.\u201d\nTrackhouse Racing may have started with $500, but they\u2019ll soon be a three-car juggernaut, ready to make even more noise in 2025. And with SVG behind the wheel of the No. 88, the sky could very well be the limit."

      "text": "Shane van Gisbergen is finally here. In America that is. The Australian Supercar champion has made the move to the United States and he along with his wife now reside in the heart of NASCAR country, Mooresville, North Carolina.\nThe New Zealand native left the comfort of his old life in Australia to race in NASCAR on a fulltime basis. This year he will get to race on all types of tracks, many of them ovals where he has little experience racing on having raced on only one oval, that in the Truck series race last year at Indianapolis Raceway Park.\nHe said he\u2019s ready to gain more experience, especially at the intermediate tracks, two in particular.\n\u201cYou know, everyone's talking about Vegas, turn one, and two how hard that's going to be for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Darlington; probably those are the ones I'm most excited about.\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m here for a challenge and I'm sure those tracks are going to be very difficult\u2026 I just want to get out there and feel what everyone's saying, how bad and tough it is, so it'll be interesting.\u201d\nWhile he will be racing on different styles of tracks, he will also need to adjust to different ways of dealing with his sponsors. And though he has only been through one full NASCAR Cup race weekend in America, he can already notice differences when it comes to sponsor commitments. When it came to sponsor commitments for an event in Australia it involved a great deal more.\n\u201cLike, we go to the track on a Tuesday,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we're doing promotions all week and yeah, it's different.\n\u201cWhereas here you seem to do less, but you do more. You do bigger appearances, and it means much more, you know, you meet people\u2026It seems to have much more meaning and productiveness so it's different but very good here.\u201d\nAnother difference he\u2019s seen so far is with the media here in the States.\n\u201cThe questions are better,\u201d he said chucking. When asked what the questions were over there he added laughing, \u201cIt\u2019s the same shi-t every time.\u201d\nOf course, the biggest adjustment he\u2019s had to make so far is moving permanently to America, and particularly North Carolina. He\u2019s already noticed a great deal of differences between Australia and the U.S.\n\u201cThe freaking cold,\u201d he said laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s been a shock coming from summer. I\u2019ve never really lived in a place this cold.\u201d\nSaturday when he met with media at the National Motorsports Press Association\u2019s annual convention in Charlotte where the high temperature was in the low 20s Saturday. In Australia it\u2019s currently the middle of summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice otherwise, the weather\u2019s been awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of cool places to go training, running, trail running and stuff.\u201d\nHe said that while the food here will take a bit of getting used to, he hasn\u2019t really missed any food from Australia, or New Zealand.\n\u201cYou can get most things here,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything you get there\u2019s a lot of; you just got to be disciplined I guess.\u201d\nSoon the NASCAR season will be underway starting with the biggest race of the season the Daytona 500. Shane van Gisbergen won\u2019t be racing in the 500 on Sunday February 18, but he will be racing in the ARCA series and the Xfinity series in the days leading up to it. That Sunday he will be just a spectator in person for the first time. He, like many in New Zealand and Australia, has seen the race on TV.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the biggest NASCAR race to watch in that part of the world,\u201d he said adding with a smile. \u201cUntil Chicago last year.\u201d\nLast season van Gisbergen won the NASCAR Cup series inaugural race on the streets of Chicago in his first Cup series start. For many drivers a win in your first race might have them setting their expectations high. That\u2019s not the case for the newest resident of Mooresville.\n\u201cI don't I never go racing with expectations,\u201d van Gisbergen said. \u201cI don't know where I'm going to fit in or where I'm going to place you know.\n\u201cJust do my best and believe in my abilities.\u201d"

Two days prior he raced in the NASCAR Truck series at Indianapolis Raceway Park where he made his paved oval career debut. He kept a lead lap position until the final few laps, finishing 18th.\nShortly after returning to Australia, van Gisbergen and his Supercars team revealed that they would separate at the end of the season freeing van Gisbergen to come to America.\nTrackhouse said the development program will include races in 2024 for van Gisbergen in NASCAR\u2019s Cup, Xfinity and Craftsman Truck Series plus some late model and other races.\n\u201cThis is going to be a tremendous challenge for Shane but he is a tremendous driver as we have all seen,\u201d said Trackhouse Racing co-owner Justin Marks. \u201cNext year will be about getting him acclimated to oval track racing, superspeedways, 1.5-mile tracks and everything he has never experienced in his career. It\u2019s obviously going to be a learning process, but we think Shane will perform quite well.\u201d\nIn a Supercars career that started in 2007, to date van Gisbergen has won 80 races in 501 starts along with 47 pole positions making him the fourth most successful driver in series history. He also won the Bathurst 1000 in 2020 and 2022. He won his first Supercars championship in 2016 and the 2021 and 2022 titles.\n\u201cThis announcement means so many things to me,\u201d van Gisbergen said.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what I have achieved here in Australia, but I\u2019m excited by this new chapter in my career and the opportunities that it brings.\n\u201cI\u2019m so thankful to everyone who has played a role in my career so far, especially Triple Eight Race Engineering, and looking forward to finishing our year with a few more highlights.\n\u201cIt is time for a new challenge and this adventure into NASCAR will be the biggest challenge of my career and one I\u2019m really looking forward to. I want to thank Justin Marks (Trackhouse founder and owner) and everyone at Trackhouse Racing who have taken a chance on me and given me this opportunity. I\u2019m excited to get to America and getting the season started.\u201d"
