  "content": "> > THIS IS \"BALANCE OF POWER,\" LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. > > THE WORLD\u2019S TWO BIGGEST ECONOMIES TRY TO HAMMER OUT A DEAL. WELCOME TO THE MONDAY EDITION. TEAMS FROM THE U.S. AND CHINA MEET IN LONDON AS WE SPEAK. FOR THE LATEST ROUND, I\u2019M JOE MATHI OH U ALONGSIDE KAILEY LEINZ. IT WON\u2019T LIKELY SPELL THE END EVERY END OF TARIFFS, BUT THE S & P 500 IS FLOATING ABOVE 6,000, JUST LIKE LIBERATION DAY NEVER HAPPENED. KAILEY: THE OPTIMISM MAY NOT BE ABOUT THE LEVELS OF TARIFFS AS IT IS ABOUT EXPORT CONTROLS AND THE EXPORT, SPECIFICALLY FROM CHINA TO THE U.S. OF CRITICAL MINERALS. THAT REALLY SEEMS TO BE THE FOCUS OF CONVERSATION, AS THERE\u2019S BEEN REPORTING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GIVING SOME LEEWAY TO HIS NEGOTIATORS LOOSEN UP THE EXPORT CONTROLS THE U.S. HAS IN PLACE WHEN IT HAS BEEN TRYING TO RESTRICT CHINESE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. JOE . I\u2019LL BE CURIOUS TO SEE HOW FAR THIS GOES. WE\u2019RE NOT TALKING ABOUT HIGH-TECH NVIDIA CHIPS, THOSE THAT ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO A.I. BUT APPARENTLY WE HAVE BEEN TURNING THE SCREWS ON SOME LOWER LEVEL TECHNOLOGIES THAT CHINA WANTS TO GET ITS HANDS ON. KEVIN TODAY DESCRIBING THIS MEETING AS ESSENTIALLY A HANDSHAKE TO CODIFY WHAT\u2019S ALREADY BEEN AGREED UPON, BUT WE\u2019LL FIND OUT FROM ANNMARIE HORDERN. KAILEY: WE\u2019RE FOLLOWING ANOTHER STORY, AND THAT IS THE DEPLOYMENT OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN CALIFORNIA, AS WE\u2019VE SEEN SOME, AT TIMES, VIOLENT RIOTS TAKING PLACE FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS AFTER ICE RAIDS STARTED. PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SPEAKING TO REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE JUST MOMENTS AGO, SUGGESTING THAT AFTER THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR, GAVIN NEWSOM, WHO DID NOT WANT THE NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYED THREATENED OR DARED TOM HOMAN TO ARREST HIM SPECIFICALLY, THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WOULD DO IT IF HE WERE IN CHARGE. JOE: PRETTY WILD MOMENT AS THE GOVERNOR MUCH CALIFORNIA CALLED THE BORDER CZAR A TOUGH GUY. WE\u2019LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AS WE MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH THE DAY. KAILEY: WE ARE WATCHING WHAT HAPPENS AS WE MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH THE TRADING DAY. CHARLIE: HERE\u2019S WHAT\u2019S GOING ON IN LONDON TO LOS ANGELES. WE GOT YOU COVERED HERE AT BLOOMBERG. ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON WWDC, THE BIG APPLE EVENT JUST GETTING UNDERWAY. TIM COOK NOW TAKING THE STAGE. APPLE SHARES RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE TRADING HIGHER, UP BY ABOUT .4%. U.S. STOCKS HIGHER ACROSS WITH THE BOARD WITH THE S & P UP 15, 6,015, UP BY .3%. WE\u2019VE GOT THE DOW UP 41 NOW, UP .1%. THE NASDAQ EXPOSIT INDEX HIGHER BY 90, UP .5%. 10-YEAR CURRENTLY YIELDING 4.47%. THE TWO-YEAR, 3.99%. ALL OF THIS AHEAD OF THE KEY INFLATION READING ON WEDNESDAY. SPOT GOLD IS ADVANCING $27 AN OUNCE, $33.37, UP .8%. AND WEST TEXAS IMMEDIATE CRUDE, $64.90 A BARREL, UP BY .5%. BBITCOIN IS UP TODAY. WARNER BROTHERS DISCOVERY SAYS IT WILL SEPARATE THE COMPANY INTO TWO PUBLICLY TRADED BUSINESSES, SPLITTING ITS SCREENING AND STUDIOS BUSINESS, AND ITS TV NETWORKS OPERATIONS BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR. THE STREAMING AND STUDIOS COMPANY WILL INCLUDE WARNER BROTHERS TELEVISION, WARNER BROTHERS MOTION PICTURE GROUP, D.C. STUDIOS, HBO, AND HBO MAX, AND IT WILL BE RUN BY THE C.E.O. THE NEW GLOBAL NETWORKS BUSINESS WILL INCLUDE ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS, AND DOZENS OF OTHER CABLE TV BRANDS, SUCH AS CNN, TNT, AND TBS. FOR RIGHT NOW, SHARES OF WARNER BROTHERS DISCOVERY, THEY\u2019RE UP BY 1.2%. AGAIN, RECAPPING, STOCKS HIGHER. S & P HIGHER BY 16 NOW, UP .3%. FOR ON DEMAND NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, SUBSCRIBE TO BLOOMBERG NEWS NOW WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR PODCASTS. BACK WE GO TO WASHINGTON, \"BALANCE OF POWER,\" KICKING OFF A NEW WEEK, THE MONDAY EDITION. KAILEY: CHARLIE PELLET, THANK YOU SO MUCH. VERY HAPPY MONDAY TO YOU. AS WE KICK OFF THE NEW WEEK, OUR EYES ARE ON LONDON. THE U.S. AND CHINA REMEMBERING THAT AN AGREEMENT WAS STRUCK IN GENEVA LAST MONTH, TO LOWER TARIFFS FOR 9 0E DAYS. BUT IT WAS FUZZY AS TO WHAT ELSE WAS PART OF THE AGREEMENT, SPECIFICALLY WHAT CHINA WAS COMMITTING TO IN UNRESTRICTING EXPORTS OF CRITICAL MINERALS TO THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT XI JINPING ON THE PHONE LAST WEEK TO TRY TO CLEAR THAT UP, AND, OF COURSE, THEY\u2019RE WORKING ON HAMMERING OUT THE FINE DETAILS AS WE SPEAK. THE PRINCIPALS RIGHT NOW AT THIS HOUR, JOE, STILL GATHERED IN LONDON. JOE: THAT WAS A PERFECT SETUP, AND ANNMARIE HORDERN IS HERE, OUTSIDE THE MEETING. ANNMARIE, HOW IS IT GOING INSIDE? ANNMARIE: THEY JUST ARRIVED FIVE HOURS AGO, AND THEY ARE STILL AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. ABOUT HALF-HOUR AGO, WE SAW FOOD DELIVERY BEING BROUGHT IN. SO THEY PLAN, I THINK, ON SPENDING A FEW MORE HOURS HERE IN LONDON, JUST PAST 6:00 P.M. SO THESE TALKS ARE INTO TOMORROW. WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM EARLIER, THE N.E.C. DIRECTOR, KEVIN HAS THE, TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CONTOURS OF THIS DEAL, EASING EXPORT CONTROLS THE UNITED STATES HAS IN PLACE FOR SEMICONDUCTORS GOING TO CHINA. AND THEN ON THE CHINESE SIDE, THE U.S. WANTS TO SEE MORE LICENSES WHEN IT COMES TO AIR EARTHS AND MAGNETS. THEY WANT TO SEE AN ADVANCED PACE THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD AGREED UPON IN GENEVA. THE ISSUE IS WHAT ARE THE RED LINES FOR BOTH OF THESE AND HES? FOR CHINA, IT\u2019S CLEARLY GETTING THEIR HANDS ON THESE ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTORS, BUT HOW FAR IS THE UNITED STATES WILLING TO GO? ARE THEY WILLING TO USE POTENTIALLY THE AGE 20 NVIDIA CHIPS AS A NEGOTIATING CHIP? WHEN IT COMES TO CHINA, HOW QUICKLY ARE THEY REALLY GOING TO RAMP UP THE RARE EARTHS? WE ARE JUST FOUR WEEKS OUT FROM WHEN THESE TWO DELEGATIONS MET IN GENEVA. IT JUST SHOWS YOU HOW DIFFICULT TRADE NEGOTIATIONS ARE AND REMINDS US ALL OF HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR THE PURCHASING AGREEMENT IN TRUMP\u2019S FIRST ADMINISTRATION THAT TRADEWAR STARTED IN 2018 AND A DEAL WASN\u2019T IN PLACE UNTIL 2020. KAILEY: WHEN WE CONSIDER WHO IS IN THE ROOM TODAY, OBVIOUSLY SCOTT BESSENT, HOWARD LUTNICK ARE THERE, VERY HIGH-LEVEL TALKS ARE TAKING PLACE. BUT IT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP COMMUNICATING DIRECTLY WITH XI JINPING BY PHONE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ASSUMING OFFICE FOR HIS SECOND TERM THAT GOT OUR ATTENTION. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR A FACE TO FACE MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS? ANNMARIE: THAT PHONE CALL DEFINITELY BROKE THE ICE. REMEMBER, SECRETARY BESSENT, AFTER THE GENEVA TALKS A FEW WEEKS AFTER, SAID HE FELT LIKE NEGOTIATIONS WERE STALLING. THERE WAS A PHONE CALL, AND THAT REALLY LED TO THE PATH TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION TODAY IN LONDON. ON THAT PHONE CALL, THOUGH, THE TWO LEADERS DID DISCUSS VISITING EACH OTHER. SO PRESIDENT XI JINPING INVITED PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE FIRST LADY TO CHINA, AND THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP RECIPROCATED AS WELL. SO POTENTIALLY THAT COULD BE A DELIVERABLE OR SOMETHING THAT AD MINIMUM IS DISCUSSED AT THIS MEETING. ALSO, KAILEY, IT\u2019S A GREAT POINT TO MENTION THAT COMMERCE SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK IS HERE. HE WAS NOT THERE IN GENEVA. HE\u2019S AN ADDITION TO THIS MEETING, AND I THINK THAT BASICALLY TELLS EVERYONE MAYBE WE DON\u2019T KNOW HOW FAR THE U.S. IS WILLING TO GO, BUT EASING OF EXPORT CONTROLS IS ON THE TABLE. JOE: FASCINATING STUFF, ANNMARIE. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST, WE\u2019RE STILL BITING AROUND THE EDGES OF A MUCH LARGER POTENTIAL DEAL HERE WHEN IT COMES TO TARIFFS. AND I KNOW WE\u2019RE LOOKING AT A DEADLINE IN AUGUST ON THAT. WOULD IT BE A WIN FOR THIS TO RESOLVE TO ANOTHER GREATER MEETING ABOUT RECIPROCAL TARIFFS AGAINST CHINA? ANNMARIE: I THINK THEY WOULD LOVE TO WRAP THIS UP BEFORE AUGUST, BECAUSE THEY\u2019RE ALSO DEALING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. THE ISSUE IS, THESE ARE JUST TWO ISSUES AT THE HEART OF A VERY BIGGER DEAL. WHEN I SPOKE TO THE TREASURY SECRETARY WEEKS AGO, HE HAD TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY DON\u2019T WANT TO DECOUPLE FROM CHINA. THERE IS A GRAND DEAL TO BE HAD. OF COURSE, THE ISSUE IS EACH COUNTRY HAS RED LINES. THE OTHER COUNTRY IS TRYING TO GET PAST THE RED LINES. AND THE PROBLEM IS, IF YOU\u2019RE IN THE UNITED STATES AND YOU CARE ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS, THERE\u2019S A POTENTIAL LIMIT THAT YOU\u2019RE WILLING TO GO AND GIVE TO CHINA. AND CHINA IS GOING TO USE WHAT THEIR LEVERAGE IS, SAY IN THIS INSTANCE, RARE EARTHS. SO THIS GOES BEYOND JUST TRADE. THIS HAS TO DO WITH NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES AS WELL. TO THINK THEY CAN GET THIS DONE IN AUGUST IS OPTIMISTIC, GIVEN THE FACT WHAT WE SAW FROM A PURCHASING AGREEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, BY AND LARGE, TOOK OVER A YEAR DURING TRUMP\u2019S FIRST ADMINISTRATION. KAILEY: BLOOMBERG\u2019S ANNMARIE HORDERN, LIVE IN LONDON ON THE SCENE FOR THESE TALKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WANT TO GET MORE CONTEXT AND ANALYSIS NOW AS WE TURN TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY PRACTICE GROUP LEAD AT RILEY AND WAYNE AND FROM THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION. WELCOME BACK TO \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" AS WE CONSIDER WHAT THE U.S. MAY BE WILLING TO GIVE HERE IN THESE TALKS WITH CHINA TAKING PLACE TODAY, A ROLLING BACK OF EXPORT CONTROLS THAT HAVE BONE CONCERTED PARTED OF AN EFFORT FOR THE U.S. TO RESTRAIN CHINA\u2019S TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. WHERE DO YOU EXPECT THE LINE TO BE DRAWN? ARE WE REALLY ABOUT TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO THINGS THAT CAN HELP THEM DEVELOP THE ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTORS THAT WE HAVE BEEN PURPOSEFULLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY CANNOT DO SUCCESSFULLY? > > YEAH, KAILEY, JOE, GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. LOOK, THIS IS AN INPOLITICALLY COMPLEX ISSUE. IT UNDERSCORES A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BECOME SO DEPENDENT ON ELEMENTS LIKE CRITICAL MINERALS AND PERMANENT MAGNETS WE NEED FOR OUR COMMERCIAL SECTOR, OUR DEFENSE SECTOR, SO MUCH SO THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO GIVE UP A REALLY IMPORTANT NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN, INCLUDING DUAL USE ITEMS. I REALLY WANT TO STRESS THE DEFINITION OF DUAL USE. DUAL USE ITEMS IS THAT CHINA IS SEEKING TO US RELAX OUR EXPORT CONTROLS ON ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF A.I. CHIPS, AEROSPACE ENGINE TECHNOLOGY. AND THESE ARE DUAL USE, BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY HAVE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS, BUT THEY HAVE ENORMOUS MILITARY APPLICATIONS, SO MUCH SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO RESTRICT THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS SCENARIO WHERE BECAUSE OF OUR IMPORT VULNERABILITIES, WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME OF OUR CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO TRY TO KEEP THE WALL UP AS MUCH AS THEY CAN AND NOT GIVE IN TO SOME OF THE CHINA DEMANDS, BUT THE CHINESE ARE GOING TO DOUBLE DOWN. IT\u2019S GOING TO BE TARIFF REDUCTION, EXPORT CONTROL, RELAXATION, AND THEN POTENTIALLY SOMETHING ABOUT TAIWAN AS CHINA HAS SIGNALED IN THE PAST. JOE: THIS IS WHERE I START TO GET A BIT CONFUSED. IT\u2019S GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK. IF THIS IS, IN FACT, A NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN, WHY IS IT ON THE BARGAINING TABLE? > > YOU KNOW, THAT\u2019S REALLY BECAUSE WE ARE DEPENDENT ON CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAINS FROM CHINA THAT ARE ALSO IMPACTING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS. RARE EARTH THAT YOU ALL WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, PERMANENT MAGNETS, AGAIN, THESE ARE THINGS THAT CHINA CONTROLS EXCLUSIVELY, THE SUPPLY CHAIN, AND I THINK SOME FOLKS ADMINISTRATION BELIEVE IN ORDER TO GET OUR DEFENSE SECTOR UP AND RUNNING, THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR UP AND RUNNING WITH THESE MAGNETS WE NEED, WE\u2019RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE SOME THINGS UP. THE OTHER INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS THAT MAKES IT EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED IS OUR IMPORT DEPENDENCE IS JUST GOODS FROM CHINA. WHAT CHINA IS SEEKING FROM US IS THE KNOW-HOW AND TECHNOLOGY. THAT KNOW-HOW AND TECHNOLOGY THAT I HOPE WE DON\u2019T GIVE UP TO CHINA, AND WE MAN OUR EXPORT CONTROLS, THAT\u2019S LONG LASTING. ONCE YOU TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY TO CHINA, IT\u2019S GONE. BUT CHINA CAN ALWAYS TURN AROUND AND STOP THE EXPORTS OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED, THE MAGNETS, THE PHARMACEUTICALS, AND THAT\u2019S WHAT I\u2019M CONCERNED ABOUT. EVEN IF THERE\u2019S A HANDSHAKE DEAL, EVEN DESPITE CHINA\u2019S HISTORY OF NOT ADMIRING TO DEALS, THEY CAN TURN AROUND TOMORROW AND BLOCK OUR ACCESS VERSUS US HAVING GIVEN UP TECHNOLOGY THAT NOW CHINA CAN KEEP FOREVER. KAILEY: IF ONE COULD LISTEN TO YOU AND THINK THAT CHINA IS ACTUALLY THE ONE WITH ALL THE LEVERAGE HERE, IF THEY HAVE A CHOKE HOLD ON THIS MARKET THAT WE NEED FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY, IF IT\u2019S THEM THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO TURN IT ON AND OFF LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH, WHAT CHANCE DOES THE U.S. REALLY HAVE? > > I THINK THE U.S., IF THEY REALLY WANT TO PLAY IT STRONGLY, THEY CAN. IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR, WE KNOW THE KNOW-HOW TO MAKE THE DRUGS. I DON\u2019T THINK WE\u2019RE AS VULNERABLE AS SOME MAY THINK WE ARE. IN TERMS OF MAGNETS, LET\u2019S REMEMBER, WOVE HUGE MAGNETS SUPPLY CHAIN THAT\u2019S GROWING. WE HAVE RAREETHS IN CALIFORNIA AND CANADA, AND A NUMBER OF PRODUCERS ARE GROWING. BUT LET\u2019S ALSO REMEMBER, WE CAN RE-USE MAGNETS. WE CAN TAKE MAGNETS OUT OF PHONED, AUTOS, OUT OF DEFENSE EQUIPMENT, AND BARELY, JUST BASICALLY REMAGNETTIZE THEM AND REUSE THEM. THE REASON I SAY IS BECAUSE, SURE, IT TAKES TIME TO SCALE WHAT WE\u2019RE DOING IN OUR OWN DOMESTIC SUPPLY KLAIN, BUT WE CAN REUSE WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE, AND THAT GIVES US SO MUCH LEVERAGE TO STAY STRONG, TO GIVE IN TO CHINA, BECAUSE WE\u2019RE NOT AS DEPENDENT AS THE CHINESE LIKE TO THINK WE ARE. JOE: SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME TO SHORT MAGNETS. I WONDER HOW LONG JENSEN WANG WILL INFLUENCE THIS OVER SEMICONDUCTORS. HE\u2019S GOT THE PRESIDENT\u2019S EAR. WE KNOW THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. HE\u2019S BEEN TO THE WHITE HOUSE. AND HE TALKED A LOT, JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, ABOUT HOW THESE BUILDING BLOCKS FORAY SHOULD, IN FACT, BE BASED ON AMERICAN SYSTEMS, EVEN IF IT\u2019S A.I. COMPANIES IN CHINA DOING THE WORK, THAT THE AMERICAN BUILDING BLOCKS SHOULD BE IN PLACE. IF THAT\u2019S THE CASE, WE\u2019RE ABOUT TO SEE A LOOSENING OF EXPORT CONTROLS FOR THE BETTER, CORRECT? > > WELL, WE\u2019RE IN A SITUATION WHERE SO MANY OF OUR COMPANIES ARE NOW JUST DEVELOPING AND HAVE BEEN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SO MUCH REVENUE FROM CHINA, THAT CUTTING OFF ACCESS TO THAT MARKET CAN BE PRETTY MUCH SHORT TERM IN THEIR VIEW CATASTROPHIC FOR THEM. AT THE SAME TIME, AGAIN, THEY\u2019RE ASKING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE THE EXPORTS OF DUAL-USE ITEMS THAT ARE AIDING AND ABETTING CHINESE MILITARY, EVEN IF WE IN THE UNITED STATES BUILT MASSIVE DATA CENTERS IN CHINA, THE CHINESE ARE USING THOSE DATA CENTERS FORAY CAPABILITIES THAT AUGMENT THEIR MILITARY. IF YOU BUILD IT IN CHINA, YOU HAVE TO TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY TO CHINA. TO ME, IT\u2019S A HIGH-RISK PROPOSITION THAT WE\u2019LL CONTINUE TO TRANSFER ALL OF OUR TECHNOLOGY TO CHINA, WHICH CHINA DOUBLES DOWN, POURS MONEY INTO IT, AND MORE PEOPLE AND RESOURCES. WE SAW WHAT HAPPENS WITH DEEP SEEK. WE SAW WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS. CHINA HAS ACCELERATED ITS GROWTH IN TECHNOLOGY, FROM VIRTUALLY BEING A REALLY SORT OF DEVELOPING COUNTRY, NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED AT ALL, SO THE TECHNOLOGICAL POWER HOUSE IT IS TODAY, AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE\u2019VE BEEN TRANSFERRING OUR TECHNOLOGY. I THINK IT\u2019S REALLY TIME FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO, ONE, TAKE A SECOND LOOK AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO GIVE UP MORE, AND TWO, REMEMBER THAT WE\u2019RE NOT AS DEPENDENT AS SOME THINK WE ARE. KAILEY: WHEN WE CONSIDER THE TIME HERE FOR THESE VERY COMPLEX ISSUES TO BE FULLY WORKED OUT, I DON\u2019T KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU AND THERE TO BE FIRM, TANGIBLE OUTCOMES OF THIS MEETING IN GENEVA. BUT KNOWING WE ARE AGAINST A DEADLINE IN AUGUST HERE OF THIS 90-DAY WINDOW IN WHICH TARIFF LEVELS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE ASTRONOMICAL HIGHS WITH WHICH THEY WERE, IS THAT ENOUGH TIME FOR THE U.S. AND CHINA TO REALLY GET INTO THE NUANCES OF ALL OF THIS DIFFERENT POLICY? ARE WE JUST GOING TO KEEP BUYING OURSELVES MORE AND MORE EXTENSIONS? > > YOU KNOW, I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE\u2019LL GET OUT, THEY\u2019RE GOING TO LEAF WITH A HANDSHAKE DEAL IS VERY LIKELY. I THINK WE\u2019RE GOING TO END UP USING SOME OF OUR EXPERT CONTROLS, MAYBE ON CHIPS, TO TECHNOLOGY, THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENGINES THAT WE\u2019VE RECENTLY PROHIBITED THE EXPORTS TO CHINA. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? CHINA IS BASICALLY GOING TO BE FINE, YOU CAN HAVE MORE MAGNET LITTLE. BUT CHINA IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW OUR MILITARY SECTOR TO HAVE THESE MAGNETS FOR OUR DEFENSE AND WEAPONS SYSTEM. WHAT GOOD IS A HANDSHAKE DEAL WHEN WE HAVE A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA THAT SYSTEMATICALLY BREAKS DEALS? ITS CYBERSECURITY DEAL IN 2015, PHASE ONE DEAL, THE GENEVA DEAL. SO, YES, I THINK FROM CHINA\u2019S PERSPECTIVE, IT\u2019S GOING TO GIVE IN AFTER A LITTLE BIT OF ACTING TOUGH. IT WILL GIVE IN A LITTLE BIT. IT WILL STAY FINE, I\u2019M GOING LICENSE THESE THINGS TO YOU. WE\u2019RE GOING TO REDUCE OUR EXPORT CONTROLS, AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT WITHIN A MONTH WE\u2019RE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES IN A VERY SIMILAR SITUATION, NOT GETTING THE THINGS WE NEED FROM CHINA. AND THEN IT\u2019S GOING TO BE A REALLY TOUGH CALL FOR WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO DO NEXT. JOE: SOUNDS LIKE RECIPROCAL TARIFFS ARE NOT GOING AWAY ANY TIME SOON. > > I THINK THAT THEY\u2019RE GOING TO STAY. AND LOOK, THEY WERE HAVING A REAL DIRE IMPACT ON THE CHINESE ECONOMY WHEN THEY WERE IN THE HIGH DOUBLE DIGITS AND TRIPLE DIGITS. AND I THINK THAT IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REALLY WANTED TO BRING CHINA TO ITS KNEES, THEY COULD HAVE KEPT THE TARIFFS ON FOR SLIGHTEDLY LONGER. OF COURSE, THAT ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACTED AMERICAN INDUSTRY. I THINK WE\u2019RE GOING TO BE DOING THE SONG AND DANCE FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS AHEAD, UNTIL ONE OF THE COUNTRIES CAPITULATES. JOE: GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK. OUR NATIONAL SECURITY PRACTICE GROUP LEADER, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR INDUSTRY ANALYSIS AT THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION. ALWAYS A GREAT CONVERSATION. KAILEY, WE\u2019LL FIND OUT MAYBE BY THE END OF THE DAY IF WE GET A READOUT FROM EITHER TEAM WHAT HAPPENED, BUT ANNMARIE SAYS THEY\u2019RE BRINGING IN TAKEOUT. THIS MAY NOT END SOON. KAILEY: THAT\u2019S NEVER A GOOD SIGN IF YOU\u2019RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO WRAP UP QUICKLY, WHEN THEY BRING THE EXTRA NOURISHMENT IN. WE\u2019LL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU UPDATED ON WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING THERE AND IN LOS ANGELES. THAT\u2019S WHERE WE TURN TO NEXT, AS WE EXAMINER PRESIDENT TRUMP DEPLOYING THE NATIONAL GUARD WITHOUT THE SAY-SO CALIFORNIA\u2019S GOVERNOR. THAT\u2019S NEXT HERE ON BLOOMBERG TV. \u266a JOE: IT IS 1:21 ON WALL STREET. WE CHECK MARKETS ALL DAY LONG. APPLE SHARES JUST TURNING NEGATIVE. TIM COOK SPEAKING AT WWDC. WE\u2019VE GOT APPLE UNVEILING A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM INTERFACE CALLED LIQUID GLASS. THIS IS THE WORLDWIDE DEVELOPERS CONFERENCE, CALLING IT THE COMPANY\u2019S BROADEST DESIGN UPDATE EVER. THE COMPANY ALSO CONFIRMING PLANS TO OPEN UP ITS A.I. MODELS TO OUTSIDE CREATORS. BUT BOTTOM LINE, APPLE SHARES ARE NOW TRADING LOWER, GIVING UP EARLIER GAINS, DOWN NOW BY 1.1%. ED LUDLOW WILL HAVE MORE COMING UP IN JUST A MOMENT RIGHT HERE ON \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" AGAIN, APPLE RIGHT NOW DOWN 1.1%. THIS ON A DAY WHEN STOCKS ARE ADVANCING. THE S & P UP 13, UP .2%. THE DOW UP 61, UP .1%. AND NASDAQ HIGHER BY .4%. BLOOMBERG MAG7 INDEX HOLDING ON TO A GAIN OF .5%, WITH THE 10-YEAR AT 4.47%. SPOT GOLD, $33.35 AN OUNCE. AND WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CRUDE UP .4%, $64.85 A BARREL. STOCKS HIGHER. APPLE LOWER. APPLE DOWN 1.3%. \"BALANCE OF POWER\" CONTINUES RIGHT NEW. BACK WE GO TO WASHINGTON, ONCE AGAIN, YOUR HOSTS, JOE MATHIEU, KAILEY LEINZ. KAILEY: CHARLIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. CHECKING ON THE MARKETS FROM NEW YORK. MEANTIME, WE\u2019RE CHECKING ON ALL THINGS POLITICS AND POLICY FOR YOU FROM HERE IN WASHINGTON. A LOT OF THAT CONVERSATION TODAY CENTERS AROUND WHAT\u2019S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA, WHERE THE GOVERNOR, GAVIN NEWSOM, HAS THREATENED TO SUE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE WEEKEND DEPLOYMENT OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS. THE FEDERALIZATION OF THE NATIONAL GUARD, PRESIDENT TRUMP DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THE STATE\u2019S GOVERNOR. THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE PROTESTS THAT WERE SEEN GETTING VIOLENT OVER THE WEEKEND IN AND AROUND LOS ANGELES OVER ICE RAIDS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME, JOE, WE HAVE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN 60 YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS IN 1965, WHEN L.B.J. DEPLOYED NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN ORDER TO PROTECT CIVIL RIGHTS PROTESTERS. JOE: AND A VERY, VERY DIFFERENT SCENARIO. GAVIN NEWSOM WRITING ON X, WE DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM UNTIL TRUMP GOT INVOLVED. HE CALLS IT A SERIOUS BREECH OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY, INFLAMING TENSIONS, WHILE PULLING RESOURCES FROM WHERE THEY\u2019RE ACTUALLY NEEDED. PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A FEW REMARKS, BUT THEN TOOK TO TRUTH SOCIAL, BEGINNING WITH, WE MADE A GREAT DECISION IN SENDING THE NATIONAL GUARD TO THE RIOTS IN CALIFORNIA. HE SAYS IF WE HAD NOT DONE SO, LOS ANGELES WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY OBLITERATED. REMEMBER, THIS WAS ICE -- ISOLATED TO A FAIRLY SMALL PART OF TOWN. OUR DEMOCRATIC ANALYST, BLOOMBERG POLITICS CONTRIBUTOR IS WITH US. AND REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST LISA MILLER, FORMER R.N.C. COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND HOST OF THE FRIDAY REPORTER PODCAST. LISA, IS DONALD TRUMP RIGHT? WE MADE A GREAT DECISION IN SENDING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD TO DEAL WITH THIS? > > YOU KNOW, JOE, IT\u2019S INCONSISTENT WITH THE WAY REPUBLICANS HAVE ALWAYS OPERATED, RIGHT? THEY\u2019VE ALWAYS ALLOWED THE GOVERNORS TO BE THE SENIOR EXECUTIVES IN THEIR STATE, AND ULTIMATELY THAT\u2019S WHAT IT\u2019S SUPPOSED TO BE. THAT\u2019S HOW IT\u2019S SUPPOSED TO WORK. SO THE FACT THAT HE WENT OVER GAVIN NEWSOM\u2019S HEAD AND MADE THAT DECISION REALLY SHOWED HE\u2019S PLAYED POLITICS HERE. NOW, THERE\u2019S PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE POINTS OF VIEW ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNOR HAS HANDLED THESE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT WE RARELY EVER SEEN, AS YOU SAID, IT WAS L.B.J. THAT DID THIS, HOWEVER MANY YEARS AGO, AND SO THIS ALONE HAS ME CONCERNED TO SOME DEGREE, BECAUSE IT IS CONSISTENT WITH TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN POLICY AND THE WAY THAT WE\u2019VE OPERATED PREVIOUSLY, AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT IT NOW HAS AMERICANS PITTED AGAINST AMERICANS IN A TIME WHEN THAT IS THE LAST THING WE NEED TO SEE HAPPENING HERE. SO I DON\u2019T KNOW. I THINK L.A. HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS AS IT IS. THE FIRES WERE JUST A MINUTE AGO. AND HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH THE PRESIDENT STEPPING INTO STATE POLITICS AT A TIME WHEN, I DON\u2019T KNOW, TO ME, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A LITTLE BIT, I DON\u2019T KNOW, WRONG PATH FOR ME, IN MY POINTED OF VIEW. KAILEY: WHEN WE CONSIDER THE WAY IN WHICH THIS CHANGES THE ADMINISTRATION\u2019S MESSAGING, WE GO FROM TALKING ABOUT TRUMP\u2019S FALLOUT WITH ELON MUSK AND ALL OF THE KIND OF SOCIAL MEDIA-DRIVEN FRENZY AROUND THAT, TO SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY WANTS TO BE TALKING ABOUT, CRIME AND IMMIGRATION. DOES THIS NOT WORK FOR HIM IN CHANGING THE NARRATIVE? IS THAT NOT WHAT HE\u2019S TRYING TO SEIZE ON? > > ABSOLUTELY IT WORKS FOR HIM. AND THAT\u2019S WHY WE\u2019VE SEEN HIM ALL WEEKEND, TRUTH AGO WAY ABOUT THIS. OF COURSE, ANYBODY WHO FOLLOWS HIM ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO THIS. HE SAID HE WILL PUT IN THE NATIONAL GUARD, CALL THEM OUT, REGARDLESS WHETHER HE\u2019S ASKED. HE EVEN TALKED ABOUT SENDING IN TROOPS. NOBODY SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THAT HAPPENS. IT\u2019S NOT JUST GOING TO HAPPEN IN L.A. IT WILL BE CHICAGO. IT WILL BE NEW YORK CITY. BUT LET\u2019S NOT FORGET WHAT UNDERGIRDS THIS. STEPHEN MILLER IN MAY, HIS ADVISOR, WENT TO ICE AND SAID UNLESS YOU GET TO A QUOTA OF 3,000 A DAY OF PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DEPORT, WE WILL START FIRING PEOPLE IN ICE. AND WHAT THAT HAS MEANT IS THAT ICE HAS HAD TO GO FOR WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT. IT IS FAR EASIER TO CATCH PEOPLE WHO ARE LAW-ABIDING, GOING FOR CHECK-INS, WHO HAVE ANKLE MONITORS ON, WHO HAVE ALERTED THE GOVERNMENT TO WHERE THEY ARE, RATHER THAN GOING FOR CRIMINALS, WHO ARE HIDING AND TAKES MORE RESOURCES TO CATCH. SO ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS DONALD TRUMP NEEDS TO ANSWER IS WHY, AFTER SAYING REPEATEDLY THEY WOULD GO AFTER CRIMINALS, ISN\u2019T HE DOING THAT, AND IS HE GOING AFTER PEOPLE\u2019S WORKERS, FRIENDS, FAMILIES, AND NEIGHBORS? THAT\u2019S WHAT SET OFF THE DEMONSTRATIONS IN L.A., AND THAT\u2019S WHAT\u2019S GOING TO CONTINUE AS THEY STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP WITH THIS QUOTA THAT MILLER HAS SET. JOE: PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ASKED JOE: BEN TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT THE IDEA OF HAVING THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA ARRESTED. GAVIN NEWSOM -- THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED, SHOULD HE DO IT? DONALD TRUMP \"I WOULD DO IT IF I WERE TOM. GAVIN LIKES THE PUBLICITY.\" WHAT WOULD BE THE MOVE -- WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULT OF A MOVE LIKE THAT? LISA: THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE HAPPY TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF DEBATES AND DECISION -- AND DISCUSSIONS AND OFFER UP THESE DISTRACTIONS. YOUR POINT IS GOOD. HE WANTED BUT DOES RUSSIAN CENTERED AROUND -- HE WANTED THE DISCUSSION AROUND CRIME AND IMMIGRATION. THIS IS CONCERNING AND I THINK JEANNIE IS RIGHT, IT SHOULD SEND A MESSAGE TO A LOT OF OTHER BIG CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT THEY NEED TO BE MINDFUL THAT THIS COULD BE COMING FOR THEM NEXT. KAILEY: AND OF COURSE THIS ISN'T HAPPENING IN THE VACUUM BUT IT IS HAPPENING GETTING BACK TO THE FEUD WITH ELON MUSK, THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO GET HIS BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL THROUGH CONGRESS. AND WHITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE QUICK TO POINT OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA TODAY THAT THE BILL PROVIDES FUNDING FOR 10,000 NEW ICE PERSONNEL, 3000 NEW BORDER PATROL AGENTS. IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN CALIFORNIA MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE PRESIDENT TO MAKE A CASE THAT THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO GET THIS THROUGH QUICKLY? > > I'M HAPPY YOU RAISED THIS BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO. TO USE THESE PICTURES AND THEY ARE HORRENDOUS AND DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS NEED TO SPEAK OUT VEHEMENTLY AGAINST THEM BUT HE WANTS TO USE THESE PICTURES TO SAY THIS IS A KEY REASON THAT SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES ON THE GOP SIDE SHOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL. HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT AN INSURRECTION AND A CRISIS AND WE DO HAVE AN IMMIGRATION CRISIS AND HAVE FOR DECADES. HE WANTS TO USE THESE PICTURES SEND INSECURITY TO GIVE REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS A COVERED ATOLL THEIR CONSTITUENTS, THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN THIS BILL YOU DON'T LIKE I KNOW BUT WE HAD TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE WERE IN A CRISIS. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE USING AND IT IS A WAY TO TURN THE PAGE FROM THE DEFICIT AND THE CUTS TO SPENDING AND THE THINGS NEEDED FOR THE MOST NEEDY AMONG US AND A FOCUS ON A CRISIS AND GET THE BILL THROUGH. JOE: IT WOULD BE A NEW LEVEL TO SEE NOT NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS BUT MEMBERS OF THE MARINE CORPS. PETE HEGSETH ISSUING A STATEMENT SAYING THAT IF VIOLENCE CONTINUES ACTIVE DUTY MARINES FROM CAMP PENDLETON WILL ALSO BE MOBILIZED AND THEY ARE ON HIGH ALERT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF ALERT THAT REFERS TO IN A CASE LIKE THIS BUT -- BUT APPARENTLY 500 MARINES HAVE BEEN YOUR MARKED BY THE DEFENSE SECRETARY. YOU DON'T BELIEVE HE WOULD DO THAT, DO YOU? LISA: I THINK ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. I THINK THIS IS A TIME THAT THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS EMPOWERED AND THEY SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW AN EXAMPLE TO SHOW HOW THE FEDERAL FORCE CAN MAKE CHANGES IN THE STATES. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT ACCORDING TO JEANNIE'S POINT. THIS IS THE DIRECTION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS POINTING TOWARDS AND IT IS ONE THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED AND IT WILL SET THE COURSE FOR ACTION IN A LOT OF OTHER STATES AND CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. KAILEY: LISA AND JEANNIE, OUR POLITICAL PANEL ON \"BALANCE OF POWER\" ON THIS MONDAY AS WE WATCH A FOURTH DAY OF TENSIONS IN L.A. WE ARE ALSO WATCHING IN CALIFORNIA -- 350 MILES NORTH OF LOS ANGELES IN CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE IS THE APPLE WORLDWIDE DEVELOPERS CONFERENCE. THE PRESENTATION OF THE NEW STUFF GOT GOING EARLIER THIS HOUR AND SHARES ARE FALLING. DOWN ABOUT 1.6%. LET'S GO OUT TO CUPERTINO WHERE WE FIND ED LUDLOW WHO IS JOINING US NOW ON \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" WHAT ARE WE LEARNING AT THIS CONFERENCE? > > THIS IS A SELL THE NEWS MOMENT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STOCK. BUT WE ARE GETTING FROM APPLE IS WHAT WE REPORTED. IT CENTERS AROUND THE REDESIGN OF THE OS INTERFACE CALLED LIQUID GLASS. APPLE HOPES TO MAKE ALL OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEMS IN LINE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND REFLECT SOME THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE WITH VISION PRO, THE AUGMENTED HEADSETS. SELL THE NEWS ALSO IN THAT EARLIER IN THE PRESENTATION WHAT APPLE SAID WAS THEY WILL BE TALKING ABOUT SIRI, PARTICULARLY THE CONSUMER FACING ELEMENT OF APPLE INTELLIGENCE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE YEAR INDICATING THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING OF SUBSTANCE TO SAY TODAY. WE READ ON THE BLOOMBERG THAT YEAR TO DATE THIS STOCK IS DOWN 18% BUT HAS LARGELY TRADED ON TRADE AND TARIFF RISK AND NOT THE AI STORIES. THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF DISAPPOINTMENT THAT WE DID NOT GET MORE. THIS IS THE DEVELOPERS CONFERENCE. APPLE SAID IT WOULD ALLOW THE DEVELOPERS TO BUILD THEIR SOFTWARE IN THE APPLICATIONS ON TOP OF LLM'S. THAT IS A BIG STEP WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE HISTORY OF THE COMPANY AND THE ROLE OF DEVELOPERS IN THE VALUE-ADDED. JOE: I DO FIND IT FASCINATING THAT APPLE IS FREQUENTLY PUNISHED FOR A LACK OF IN THE CASE OF TODAY A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT AI BUT THE STOCK IS REWARDED WHEN PEOPLE START TO FREAK OUT ABOUT A POTENTIAL DOWNTURN IN THE AI SPEND AND THEY SEE APPLE BEING ON A SAFE ISLAND. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE COMPANY'S APPROACH TO AI RIGHT NOW? ED: IT IS INTERESTING. BLOOMBERG TERMINAL LETS YOU LOOK BACK AT PERIODS IN HISTORY. APPLE HAS AN ENTRENCHED MARKET POSITION AND A STRONG BALANCE SHEET. A LOT OF TIME INVESTORS ARE SANGUINE ABOUT THE DIRECTION THEY ARE GOING. INNOVATIONS ARE DRIVEN BY DIFFERENT THINGS AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH AI. IT IS A BIG FACTOR IN HOW YOU DECIDE WHAT LAPTOP OR PHONE YOU WILL HAVE. YOU CAN USE IT ON YOUR IPHONE OR YOUR MACBOOK AND APPLE THEREFORE ON THE SERVICES SIDE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEM IS GETTING SQUEEZED OUT OF ITS OWN GAME BECAUSE OF THE OFFERINGS. HENCE, SELL THE NEWS TODAY BUT ALSO DISAPPOINTMENTS. JOE: ALWAYS GREAT TO SPEND TIME WITH ED LUDLOW AND HE WILL BE BACK AS THE HEADLINES FLY ON BLOOMBERG NEWS DAILY. ED LUDLOW. I'M JOE MATHIEU ALONGSIDE KAILEY LEINZ IN WASHINGTON AND WE WILL BIG MORE INTO THE LEGAL BASIS OF WHAT WE SAW TAKE DAYS THAT TAKE PLACE IN L.A. \u266a CHARLIE: WE DO CHECK MARKETS ALL DAY LONG HERE AT BLOOMBERG. AN UPDATE FOR STOCKS. APPLE SHARES CONTINUED TO DECLINE. DOWN 1.2%. APPLE FALLING WHILE IT'S AI FOCUSED EVENT IS UNDERWAY AT HEADQUARTERS. APPLE SAYING THAT THE APPLE INTELLIGENCE MODELS ARE COMING FOR DEVELOPERS BUT APPLE RIGHT NOW IS DOWN 1.1%. THE S & P HIGHER BY 17 CURIE CLOSE TO SESSION HIGHS. THE DOW HAS A GAIN OF .2%. THE NASDAQ UP .4%. THE NASDAQ 100 INDEX UP .4%. IN THE RUSSELL 2000 .9%. THE TWO YEAR, THREE POINT 99%. OLD IS UP .7%. AND WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE CRUDE IS $65 EVEN. BALANCE OF POWER CONTINUES RIGHT NOW AND BACK WE GO TO WASHINGTON WITH YOUR HOST JOE MATHIEU AND KAILEY LEINZ. JOE: CHARLIE PELLETT LIVE FROM NEW YORK. WITH US HERE ON \"BALANCE OF POWER\" FROM WASHINGTON COVERING POLITICS AND THE LATEST WE HAVE HEARD FROM WHITE HOUSE AND WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE PROTESTS AND THE VIOLENCE WITH POLICE AND THE DOUGH APPOINTMENT OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS BY THE PRESIDENT SAYING THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA. TAKING TO TRUTH SOCIAL, WE MADE A GREAT DECISION. GAVIN NEWSOM THE GOVERNOR SEES IT DIFFERENTLY AND IS THREATENING TO SUE DONALD TRUMP FOR GOING AROUND HIM AS THE EXECUTIVE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP IN A FASCINATING INTERVIEW EARLIER TODAY WITH ANDREW CUOMO NOW RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY. HE SPENT SOME TIME WITH BLOOMBERG'S TOM KEENE ON BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING ON BLOOMBERG RADIO. > > THIS GETS INTO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S STRATEGY, I BELIEVE. LOOK, FIRST OF ALL ON THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE HE WAS CLEAR IN HIS CAMPAIGN. HE BELIEVES THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WORKS FOR HIM. DURING THE CAMPAIGN HE SAID HE WOULD REPORT CRIMINALS --DEPORT DANGEROUS CRIMINALS. AND NOW WE ARE DEPORTING SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS AND DISRUPTING FAMILIES AND WE ARE DEPORTING PEOPLE THAT SHOULD NOT BE DEPORTED. SO THAT IS A CHANGE. THIS ISSUE WORKS FOR THE PRESIDENT POLITICALLY. THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO VERY GOOD, AND I WORKED WITH THE PRESIDENT IN THE FIRST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WORKED WITH EUPHEMISM, WE HAD A LOT OF CONTROVERSY. BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT TEMPO FOR HIM. WAYNE GRETZKY, SKATE TO WHERE THE PUCK IS GOING TO BE AND NOT WHERE IT WAS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO ADJUST. THEY ARE SKATING TO WHERE THE PUCK WAS. THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE IN SOME WAYS IS A DISTRACTION FROM WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY DOING WITH CITIES WHICH IS CUTTING THE BUDGET IN A WAY THAT IS SO DRAMATIC THAT YOU COULD REALLY CAUSE MAJOR DIFFICULTIES FOR URBAN AREAS. > > PRO TIP -- WHEN YOU ARE CALLING -- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOCKEY, YOU DON'T GO TALKING ABOUT WAYNE GRETZKY. ROBERT WRITING IN AMERICAN PROSPECT SAYS DID CUOMO PEAK TOO SOON? YOU HAVE THE TENSIONS OF THE PRIMARY. IS THE PRESENT MAYOR IN THE BACK POCKET OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? AND IF WE GET L.A. HERE, CAN YOU IMAGINE IT? I WILL LET YOU PICK THE GEOGRAPHY, BUT THE PRESENT MAYOR OF NEW YORK, CAN HE PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF THIS CITY GIVEN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT AFTER WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN L.A.? > > SHORT ANSWER, NO. LET'S REMEMBER HOW EXTRAORDINARY THESE ISSUES ARE, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN L.A. THIS IS THE REVERSE OF WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS. NORMALLY IT IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT MAKES THE DECISION ON HOW TO HANDLE AN EMERGENCY AND CALLS ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO, A MAYOR OR GOVERNOR WOULD CALL ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SAY, I NEED HELP, PLEASE SEND THE NATIONAL GUARD WERE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL HELP. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN A TIME WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAS SENT IN FEDERAL TROOPS THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO LIKE THE 60'S -- YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE 60'S AND PRESIDENT WALLACE. IT IS HOW FAR YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK. THIS IS TRUMP BEING TRUMP. TRUMP ON THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AND MUSCLE -- THESE CITIES AND DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE FILLED WITH ILLEGALS AND I'M GOING TO COME IN AND COME IN HOT AND HEAVY. HE STARTED IN L.A. IT WILL HAPPEN IN NEW YORK. HE KNOWS THE FORMULA, RIGHT? IT HAPPENED IN NEW JERSEY. > > IS HIS FORMULA TO GO AFTER YOU? > > HIS FORMULA IS TO CREATE CHAOS IN THE CITIES AND HE IS THE VOICE OF LAW AND ORDER. AND YOU KNOW CITIES, ALL OF THOSE DEMOCRATS AND THAT IS WHERE THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE AND HE IS GOING TO COME IN AND CLEAN UP. THE FLIPSIDE IS -- OK, CREATE CHAOS IN L.A., NEW YORK, CHICAGO, PRETTY SOON YOU CREATE CHAOS IN THE NATION AND THAT IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY. JOE: THE VIEW FROM ANDREW CUOMO SPEAKING WITH TOM KEENE EARLIER TODAY. THERE IS THE LEGAL SIDE OF THIS AND THE POLITICAL SIDE OF THIS. WE WANT TO GET AT THE LEGAL ASPECT BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS SEIZING ON TITLE X. IT IS A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS FOR THE FEDERAL DEPLOYMENT OF NATIONAL GUARD FORCES IF THERE IS A DANGER OF REBELLION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES. KAILEY: IT ALSO STATES THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY CALL IN THE NATIONAL GUARD IN ANY STATE TO RAPPEL AN INVASION, SUPPRESS THE INVASION OR EXECUTE THE LAWS. THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA, GAVIN NEWSOM, DOESN'T AGREE THE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET WHICH IS WHY HE IS THREATENING TO SUE THE ADMINISTRATION. BUT WE WANT TO GET THE TAKE FROM A LEGAL EXPERT, CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER. THE FOUNDER OF THE LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. AS WE UNDERSTAND THE LEGALESE WHICH YOU CAN INTERPRET BETTER THAN I, DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE GROUNDS TO SEND IN THOSE TROOPS YESTERDAY? > > HE DID NOT. THIS IS NOT AN INSURRECTION OR ANYTHING LIKE A TRUE REBELLION. THE INSTANCE WHERE IT HAPPENED BEFORE WAS IN 1965 WHEN THE PRESIDENT SENT IN THE NATIONAL GUARD TO ALABAMA BECAUSE GOVERNOR GEORGE WALLACE MADE IT CLEAR HE WAS GOING TO ALLOW THE ATTACK OF CIVIL RIGHTS PEACEFUL PROTESTERS AND IT WAS A TRULY DANGEROUS SITUATION. IT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED AND NOTHING HERE IS IN COMPARISON. KAILEY: IF I COULD JUMP IN, IF SOMEONE LOOKS AT THE VIDEOS OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN'S ANGELES AND SEEN SOME OF THE PROTESTERS THROWING ROCKS AT POLICE OFFICERS, WHY WOULD THAT NOT CONSTITUTE A REBELLION AGAINST AUTHORITY? > > A BUNCH OF KIDS THROWING ROCKS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REBELLION. WHEN PROTESTS GO BAD, THEY HAVE SELECTIVE POLICING PROSECUTION AND THEY GOT THE KIDS OR OLDER ADULTS COMMITTING VIOLENT ACTS LIKE THAT AND THEY ARREST THEM ALLOWING THE PEACEFUL PROTEST TO GO FORWARD. LOCAL POLICE WERE HANDLING THE SITUATION JUST FINE UNTIL DONALD TRUMP PUT THE NATIONAL GUARD IN THERE. THE NATIONAL GUARD -- HE IN A SENSE NATIONALIZED THE NATIONAL GUARD USING TITLE X. AND I DON'T THINK THE AUTHORITY EXTENDS. AND IF I MAY, THE SHOCKING HYPOCRISY IS WHEN JANUARY 6 HAPPENED WHICH WAS A CLEAR ATTACK OF VIOLENT PEOPLE WITH ARMS ON THE CAPITAL, HE SAT ON HIS HANDS AND DID NOTHING. AND YET WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS PROTESTING HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY, NOW HE SENDS IN THE NATIONAL GUARD? THAT IS THE SHOCKING HYPOCRISY GOING ON HERE. JOE: GAVIN NEWSOM IS THREATENING TO SUE AND I EXPECT THAT WILL HAPPEN AT SOME POINT WHEN WE ACTUALLY SEE THE COURT DOCUMENTS AND WE WILL LET EVERYBODY KNOW. THE PRESIDENT ON THE OTHER HAND IS THREATENING OR SUGGESTING IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO ARREST THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. TOM HOMAN, THE BORDER CZAR, SUGGESTED AS MUCH AND GAVIN NEWSOM RESPONDED IN A REMARKABLE MOMENT ON CABLE NEWS LAST NIGHT. > > HE HAS A TOUGH GUY. HE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND ME. YOU KNOW WHAT? LAY YOUR HANDS OFF FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRLS TRYING TO GET EDUCATED. LAY YOUR HANDS OFF THESE POOR PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO LIVE THEIR LIVES, PAYING THEIR TAXES. THEY HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 10 YEARS. COME AFTER ME AND ARREST ME AND LET'S GET IT OVER WITH. JOE: COME AFTER ME AND ARREST ME. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD TAKE THE GOVERNOR'S CASE BUT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE THE GROUNDS TO DO THIS? > > I WOULD TAKE THE GOVERNOR'S CASE IN A HEARTBEAT. I WOULD THINK ABOUT TAKING IT PRO BONO. IT IS AN IMPORTANT CASE AND HE HAS GOOD GROUNDS TO SAY THAT WHAT THIS IS IS A VIOLATION OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY. IT TENDS TO BE THE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS THAT TALK ABOUT THE VALUE OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY WITH FEDERAL OVERREACH AND THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF FEDERAL OVERREACH. WHEN YOU COMPARE THIS TO 1965, THERE WAS A NATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT DEVELOPED BY 1965 THAT SEGREGATION AND RACIAL INJUSTICE WAS A NATIONAL PROBLEM THAT PRESIDENT JOHNSON NEEDED TO INTERVENE ON. THERE IS NOT A NATIONAL CONSENSUS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S POLICIES. HE DOES NOT HAVE A MANDATE. HE DID NOT EVEN WIN A MAJORITY, 51%. HE WON 40 WERE NOT -- 49.3%. THIS IS THE KEY DIFFERENCE ON WHAT GAVIN NEWSOM IS BASING HIS STATEMENT ON. KAILEY: WHEN WE CONSIDER THE PRESIDENT STILL BELIEVES THIS IS A WINNING ISSUE FOR HIM AND HE HAS FAR GREATER APPROVAL ON CRIME AND IMMIGRATION THAN OTHERS, IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS CONTINUES TO ESCALATE AND HOW IT PLAYS POLITICALLY? AS WELL AS THE LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AROUND ESCALATION. PETE HEGSETH SUGGESTING HE WOULD DEPLOY ACTIVE-DUTY MARINES FROM CAMP RANDALL 10. -- CAMP PENDLETON. CAN HE USE THE SAME JUSTIFICATION? IS THERE SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU WOULD EXPECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO TURN? > > THE ANSWER IS NO. THE ACT OF 1878 WHICH SPECIFICALLY SAYS YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE U.S. MILITARY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ROLE. THAT WAS A STATUE THAT ENDED RECONSTRUCTION. THE SOUTHERN STATES WANTED THAT STATUE PASSED. IT IS A WHOLLY DIFFERENT THING WHEN YOU HAVE ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY BEING PROPOSED VERSUS THE NATIONAL GUARD WHICH IS TECHNICALLY STILL UNDER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT FUND THE NATIONAL GUARD. THEY ARE OFTEN INCORPORATED INTO THE FEDERAL IN TIMES OF WAR BUT THAT IS NOT THIS. IT IS ALL THIS KIND OF MAKING A BIG SHOW. AND BY THE WAY, THE SHOW IS NECESSARY FOR DONALD TRUMP. IF YOU LOOK AT HIS ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION, HE IS FAILING. HIS NUMBERS OF DEPORTATION ARE WAY LOWER THAN WHAT JOE BIDEN'S NUMBERS SHOWED. THERE IS ALL THIS ENERGY BEING SPENT ON OTHER THINGS BUT HE IS NOT DOING THE JOB HE PROMISED AMERICAN PEOPLE HE WOULD DO. JOE: THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT SPREADS TO OTHER CITIES OR CONTINUES IN LOS ANGELES. GOD KNOWS THESE THINGS CAN CARRY MOMENTUM. WE HEARD EARLIER ANDREW CUOMO REACTING TO THE IDEA OF THESE THINGS TAKING PLACE ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK OR CHICAGO. IF WE ARE IN FOR A SUMMER LIKE THAT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS AND MARINES, IT HAS TO BE THE TROOPS THAT WOULD ADJUDICATE A FINISH, CORRECT? > > THE EXAMPLES YOU JUST GAVE, I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF THIS HAPPENS IN A SO-CALLED RED STATE. DONALD TRUMP IS DOING THIS ONLY IN THE SO-CALLED BLUE STATE. THIS IS SELECTIVE. THIS IS A WAY TO MAKE POLITICAL POINTS AND ATTACK POLITICAL ENEMIES AND ATTACK POLITICAL GROUPS THAT DON'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP. IT IS NOT ABOUT HIS ENFORCING IMMIGRATION LAW BUT ABOUT HIM BEING ON A NATIONAL REALITY SHOW AND THAT IS HOW HE THINGS HE WILL STAY IN POWER. JOE: I SUSPECT WE CAN TALK AGAIN ABOUT THIS BEFORE IT IS OVER. ROBERT, CONSTITUTIONAL OR YOUR BASED -- CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER. I'M JOE MATHIEU ALONGSIDE KAILEY LEINZ IN WASHINGTON. WE HAVE THE MATTER OF THE PROTESTS IN L.A. AS WELL AS TRADE TALKS UNDERWAY BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. HAPPENING IN LONDON. WE HOPE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS WHEN WE RECONVENE AT 5:00. KAILEY: THE PRINCIPLES INCLUDING SCOTT BESSENT, HOWARD LUTNICK AND AN OFFICIAL FROM CHINA ARE STILL IN THE ROOM TRYING TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT ON EXPORT CONTROLS ON DATA AND ON RARE MINERALS.",
