  "content": "Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will measure success at their summit in Alaska very differently, even as both leaders are already looking toward a second meeting. The US president sees any kind of ceasefire in Ukraine as a key objective of the talks. For the Russian leader, getting face time with Trump on American soil without having made any concessions on the war is already a win.\n\u2022 The US-Canadian Road Safety Gap Is Getting Wider\n\u2022 Festivals and Parades Are Canceled Amid US Immigration Anxiety\n\u2022 To Head Off Severe Storm Surges, Nova Scotia Invests in \u2018Living Shorelines\u2019\n\u2022 Princeton Plans New Budget Cuts as Pressure From Trump Builds Those are the contrasting stakes as both leaders head to Anchorage for their first summit since 2018 in Helsinki. The imbalance points to the perils and opportunities for Trump, who has long cast himself as the only one who can end the war. Putin has little incentive to stop the fighting as Russia\u2019s military slowly grinds out gains in Ukraine, but can ill afford to alienate a president with whom he\u2019s long cultivated a relationship. En route to Anchorage on Friday morning, Trump didn\u2019t rule out that Ukraine might get some form of security guarantees from western nations, or that it might have to agree to swap land with Russia. But he said it wasn\u2019t his place to decide. \u201cI\u2019ve got to let Ukraine make that decision,\u201d Trump said of the idea of the two countries trading land. \u201cAnd I think they\u2019ll make a proper decision. But I\u2019m not here to negotiate for Ukraine. I\u2019m here to get them at the table.\u201d By invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin began Europe\u2019s biggest war for 80 years and became an international pariah. The summit with Trump helps him to chip away at the isolation the US and its Group of Seven allies have sought to impose on the Russian leader over his aggression. Even more symbolically potent is the decision to host the encounter at a military base, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, in the US. By that metric, Putin has scored a victory simply by showing up. The meeting also marks a repudiation of former President Joe Biden\u2019s approach of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\u201d a mantra that made sure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy always had a seat at the table. \u201cRussia wants to continue to pursue its objectives, which are to dramatically weaken Ukraine and essentially undermine its independence and sovereignty,\u201d Richard Haass, a former senior State Department official, said in an interview. \u201cSo Russia sees negotiations not as an alternative to that, but as a means toward that end.\u201d\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin are set to have a historic summit in Alaska where they will try to make progress on ending the war in Ukraine. Bloomberg\u2019s Annmarie Hordern reports on what\u2019s at stake.Source: Bloomberg The perils for Trump account for the White House\u2019s strategy of tamping down expectations for the meeting. Trump described it as a \u201cfeel-out meeting,\u201d a message reinforced by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who called the summit \u201ca listening exercise for the president.\u201d Trump is already looking ahead to a potential second summit that would include Zelenskiy \u2014 and perhaps European leaders \u2014 which he anticipated would be \u201cmore productive than the first.\u201d The Kremlin, anticipating that move, has invited Trump to come to Russia next. It\u2019s a far cry from Trump\u2019s boasts on the campaign trail that he could end the war within a day of taking office. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that a breakthrough was only possible with involvement of Trump and Putin. The new framing gives Trump room to maneuver during the actual meeting, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. That will allow him to make decisions in the moment as he relies on his instincts, which aligns with his preference for personal diplomacy over traditional bureaucratic deliberations. In one optimistic scenario, the two leaders could leave Alaska with an agreement to halt the fighting \u2014 at least temporarily or partially, for instance by agreeing to pause Russian air attacks. Trump could boost Putin\u2019s proposal to take Ukrainian territory that his forces have captured. Or they could come away with nothing at all, something Trump was happy to accept after he walked out of talks with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un in 2019. Trump said in an interview with Bret Baier on Friday that if the meeting does not go well, \u201cI would walk,\u201d according to Fox News. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to work out very well and if it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to head back home real fast,\u201d he told Baier. For his part, Putin is eager to widen cracks between the US and Europe while seeking relief from sanctions that have crippled Russia\u2019s economic growth. The list of attendees reflects the importance both sides attach to the meeting. Trump will be joined by Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, as well as his CIA director, John Ratcliffe. There\u2019s a concern among governments in Europe that rather than focus on Ukraine\u2019s interests, the meeting could pivot to improving the US-Russia economic relationship. That might provide Putin a lifeline to continue the war, according to a European diplomat who asked not to be identified without authorization to speak to publicly. \u201cOnce he gets into the room with Vladimir Putin, and Putin is able to make his case, I think he will be malleable, and the inclination will be to get along with Putin,\u201d Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI think a lot of the goodwill and agreement with the Europeans may very well go right out the door.\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One he belived Putin would also include economic officials in his delegation. \u201cI noticed he\u2019s bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that\u2019s good I like that because they want to do business,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not doing business until we get the war settled.\u201d Putin brings his longtime foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as his defense and finance ministers. That suggests Russia wants to discuss the potential for increased economic cooperation \u2014 an idea that appeals to Trump. Trump and Putin are expected to speak alone ahead of a lunch with their delegations and a joint press conference is planned afterward. That raises the specter of a repeat of the now-infamous news conference in Helsinki where Trump publicly sided with Putin in rejecting US intelligence assessments that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\n\u2022 Americans Are Getting Priced Out of Homeownership at Record Rates\n\u2022 What Declining Cardboard Box Sales Tell Us About the US Economy\n\u2022 Dubai\u2019s Housing Boom Is Stoking Fears of Another Crash\n\u2022 Twitter\u2019s Ex-CEO Is Moving Past His Elon Musk Drama and Starting an AI Company",
