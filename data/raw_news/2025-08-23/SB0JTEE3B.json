  "description": "Nvidia's a terrific company, but it faces near-term challenges in China -- and there's a terribly high price tag on Nvidia stock.",
  "content": "\u2022 Nvidia reports Q2 earnings on Aug. 27 after close of trading.\n\u2022 Most of Wall Street expects strong sales and earnings growth, and says you should buy Nvidia stock.\n\u2022 Two analysts in particular are not quite so sure you should.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia \u203a In just a little under one week, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will report its earnings for Q2 2025. For the most part, analysts are optimistic about the report, due out after the close of trading on Aug. 27. Consensus forecasts have the semiconductor company growing earnings 48.5% year over year, to $1.01 per share, as insatiable demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips drives a near-53% rise in revenue to almost $46 billion. That's a lot of money Nvidia will be raking in for a single quarter. This is one of the primary reasons why a staggering 58 analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence give Nvidia stock either a \"buy\" or an \"outperform,\" or an equivalent rating -- versus only one single analyst who says \"sell.\" One reason why two analysts are worried about Nvidia And yet, not everything's unicorns and rainbows for Nvidia stock. As the final countdown to earnings day begins, two separate Wall Street analysts chimed in Wednesday morning to raise reservations about Nvidia stock and the challenges that lie ahead for it. First up was Deutsche Bank, where analyst Ross Seymore set a price target of $155 that implies the stock could fall 12% over the next 12 months. Ordinarily, the prospect of a 12% near-term loss in a stock would inspire an analyst to recommend selling that stock. But perhaps fearing to deviate too far from the herd on this popular AI stock, Seymore only reiterated a \"hold\" rating on Nvidia. (Seymore is still one of only a half-dozen analysts with neutral ratings on Nvidia). No matter. Whether any one analyst thinks Nvidia is a \"buy\" or just a \"hold\" probably shouldn't concern us as much as why he rates the stock as he does. And in Seymore's case, the answer couldn't be clearer: Writing on StreetInsider.com on Wednesday, Seymore warns that U.S. trade restrictions on semiconductor exports to China will cost Nvidia about $8 billion in \"foregone\" revenue in Q2. True, a resumption of shipments upon receiving export licenses from the Trump administration should help rectify this situation by Q3. But there's a cost to that solution -- specifically, the Trump Administration's requirement that, to obtain export licenses, Nvidia must fork over 15% of any revenue it generates in China to the IRS.\n\nWith China accounting for roughly $17 billion of Nvidia's revenue over the last 12 months, that could amount to a $2.6 billion drag on Nvidia's profits over the next 12 months. Investment bank KeyBanc shares Deutsche Bank's concerns about Nvidia and China. On the one hand, KeyBanc anticipates Nvidia could book $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue from selling H20 and B40 chips in China next quarter. On the other hand, the banker believes this revenue is unreliable and dependent upon the receipt of export licenses from Washington. For this reason, KeyBanc warns Nvidia may \"exclude direct revenue from China\" when giving revenue guidance next week, potentially creating a kind of guidance miss that could send Nvidia shares lower. KeyBanc also cites the \"potential 15% tax on AI exports\" from the U.S. side as a risk, and adds that \"pressure from the [Chinese] government for its AI providers to use domestic AI chips\" could dampen Nvidia's China revenues even further -- adding a third risk that Deutsche didn't mention! Now, I hope I haven't painted too bleak a picture for you here. Fact is, despite his reservations, Deutsche analyst Seymore still expects Nvidia to report a \"typical\" earnings beat next week, exceeding the company's $45 billion revenue forecast by about $2 billion. Blackwell revenue is ramping, says Seymore, more than doubling sequentially between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, to $24 billion. With the prospect of an imminent earnings beat, it makes sense that Seymore would hesitate to recommend selling Nvidia stock -- even if he does feel it's a bit overpriced. Furthermore, KeyBanc agrees that Blackwell production is ramping, and a new Blackwell Ultra (B300) chip is on the way, potentially boosting revenue even more in Q3. For these and other reasons, KeyBanc not only still rates Nvidia stock \"overweight\" (i.e., buy). KeyBanc actually raised its price target on the stock to $215 on Wednesday. So, is Nvidia stock a buy or not? That's the real question, isn't it? Wall Street's confident Nvidia will \"beat\" on Q2 next week. It's just worried that Nvidia will \"miss\" on guidance for Q3. Longer-term, though, is Nvidia stock a buy or isn't it? Here's how I look at it, and I'll keep this really simple: Valued at 4.28 trillion dollars, earning nearly $77 billion in annual profit, and backing that up with roughly $72 billion in annual free cash flow, Nvidia stock costs about 55 times trailing earnings and about 59 times free cash flow. For Nvidia stock to be a clear-cut buy, I'd want to see the stock growing earnings at least 50% annually over the next five years. The best that Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to do, however, is 30% annual growth -- even with nine out of 10 analysts polled saying Nvidia stock is a buy. The math here isn't hard. Nvidia stock is not a buy at this price -- but it might be if it sells off after earnings. Should you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

      "text": "Semiconductor stocks are shares of companies that produce the microchips and electronic components used in everything from smartphones to cars.\nThey are part of the technology sector but are also manufacturing businesses, which means their businesses are cyclical, like any industrial business.\nSemiconductor\nPicking top-performing semiconductor stocks in the industry can be tricky, and their performance is highly volatile since sales volumes ebb and flow.\nBut the semiconductor sector is growing rapidly as the world rapidly embraces its critical role in artificial intelligence (AI) development and applications.\nSome of the best-performing stocks throughout 2023-25, like Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%), have hailed from the semiconductor industry.\nDifferent types of semiconductor stocks\nDifferent types of semiconductor stocks\nThe Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), a system used by investors and index providers to categorize public companies by sector and industry group, places semiconductor stocks under the information technology sector. Within this sector, GICS breaks down semiconductor-related firms into two main categories.\nSemiconductor equipment\nThese companies provide the tools, machines, and services required to manufacture chips. This includes firms that make lithography systems, wafer inspection tools, or etching equipment used by chipmakers. These companies tend to be critical suppliers for the production process, but don\u2019t produce chips themselves.\nSemiconductor companies\nThese are the ones that actually design and manufacture the chips that power computers, smartphones, cars, appliances, and more. These chips can range from basic memory to high-performance processors or specialized sensors.\nOther classification methods\nBeyond this GICS classification, semiconductor stocks can also be sorted by geography, such as U.S.-based versus international companies, or by business model.\nSome are fabless, meaning they design chips but outsource the manufacturing to third-party foundries. Others operate fabs, or fabrication plants, and handle the manufacturing process in-house.\nEach of these distinctions can affect how the company earns revenue, manages costs, and scales operations.\nTrends\nWhat trends drive semiconductor stocks?\nComputer chips have many uses, but up-and-coming semiconductor companies will likely focus on two areas of growth in the decade ahead:\n1. The Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data with each other.\nThis technology is set to revolutionize various industries by enabling smarter homes, cities, and consumer goods.\nSemiconductors are crucial in IoT devices since they provide the processing power and connectivity needed for these devices to function.\nAs IoT applications expand, the demand for advanced, energy-efficient chips that can handle the diverse and high-volume data processing requirements will surge.\nEmerging semiconductor companies focusing on IoT will need to innovate to create smaller, more efficient, and more powerful chips to meet the evolving needs of this market.\n2. Generative AI\nGenerative AI, which includes technologies like machine learning and neural networks, is another significant growth driver for semiconductor companies.\nThese AI systems require immense computational power to process complex algorithms and vast amounts of data.\nAs generative AI becomes more integrated into applications such as search engines, autonomous vehicles, and advanced robotics, the demand for high-performance chips will increase.\nSemiconductor companies that develop graphics processing units (GPUs) and other specialized AI hardware are poised to benefit immensely from this trend. Innovations in chip architecture to improve speed, efficiency, and processing capabilities will be essential to support the growing AI industry.\nAnother important long-term catalyst to watch in the U.S. is the CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in August 2022. The legislation was designed to significantly bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research via billions in funding and significant tax credits.\nSemiconductor stocks\nBest semiconductor stocks to buy in 2025\nHere are two top picks for semiconductor industry secular growth trends:\n1. Qualcomm\nQualcomm (QCOM 2.53%) is the longtime leader in mobile chip design. Historically, Qualcomm has been a key Apple (AAPL 1.21%) supplier, having profited from the smartphone boom and Apple's ecosystem over the past decade.\nRecently launched flagship Android devices powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 are seeing strong demand globally, especially in China.\nIn premium and high-tier smartphones, Qualcomm's Snapdragon Mobile platforms are also enabling generative AI capabilities.\nToday, Qualcomm has also pivoted to a strong automotive focus via its Snapdragon X platforms. These platforms aim to transform vehicles with advanced connectivity and autonomous driving features.\nIn the PC market, Qualcomm has expanded its computer portfolio with the Snapdragon X Plus Platform, tailored towards upcoming launches of next-generation AI PCs.\n2. Nvidia\nNvidia (NVDA 1.65%) has positioned itself as the platform for all types of AI, largely thanks to its portfolio and the powerful H100 Tensor Core GPU, putting it in a leading position to pursue new markets and expand revenue.\nIn 2024, Nvidia clocked new revenue records, driven largely by growth in their data center segment, which CEO Jensen Huang terms \"AI factories.\"\nHuang believes AI is increasingly becoming a commodity, and these AI factories are pivotal in accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference. They are essential for consumer internet companies, automotive industries, healthcare sectors, and many other fields that require complex infrastructure to run their models on.\nBeyond their GPUs and data centers, Nvidia also offers a variety of platforms to cater to the evolving AI landscape. Blackwell, for instance, is designed for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI. Spectrum-X is a new market offering aimed at scaling AI to Ethernet-only data centers.\nAdditionally, Nvidia's NIM (Nvidia Infrastructure Management) is a software solution that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI capable of running on CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) everywhere.\nCUDA is Nvidia's parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model, which allows developers to utilize Nvidia GPUs for general-purpose processing (an approach known as GPGPU, general purpose computing on graphics processing units).\nSemiconductor ETFs\nBest semiconductor ETFs to buy right now\nIf you prefer not to pick single stocks, you can also buy a semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ETF) to gain exposure to the overall sector\nTwo top semiconductor ETFs in terms of overall assets under management (AUM) are:\n1. iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX 2.78%) tracks 30 market cap-weighted U.S. semiconductor stocks via the NYSE Semiconductor index. This ETF sported more than $13 billion in assets under management (AUM) in mid-2025, charging a 0.35% expense ratio.\n2. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH 2.15%) tracks 25 market cap-weighted, U.S.-listed semiconductor stocks via the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 index. It had more than $26 billion in assets in mid-2025 and charged a 0.35% expense ratio.\nKey factors\nKey factors to understand before investing in semiconductors\nWhen looking for the best chipmakers and long-term undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy, consider these four key factors before you buy:\n1. Sustainable revenue growth\nCompanies that gradually increase their sales over time are the best investments, but overall revenue growth matters even more for semiconductor stocks.\nRevenue\nMany companies in this sector struggle to cope with the industry's cyclical nature. Hardware, such as PC and laptop chips, tends to become a commodity as the years progress and more advanced chips come out. If a new market is growing quickly, other chipmakers might pile on with similar products. Supply swells, prices fall, and individual company sales decline.\nIf a semiconductor chip company isn't constantly innovating and finding new outlets or developing a robust pipeline for its hardware tech, weathering the cycle can be unsustainable.\nThat being said, some chip designers are able to protect their work with patents that are not easy to replicate by other means. This can create a type of competitive moat for the company's long-term growth, although it doesn't completely prevent up-and-down sales cycles.\n2. Above-average profit margins\nSales need to translate to profits. Companies that cannot control their expenses have low profit margins, and companies with high profit margins have a greater ability to reinvest in research and improve their operations. High gross profit, operating profit, and free cash flow generation are also positive indicators that the company is operating efficiently.\nBecause of the very high amount of expense needed to get into the semiconductor business, established companies tend to be able to ramp up profit margins as revenue increases over time.\n3. Attractive returns on invested capital\nA company's return on invested capital (ROIC) indicates how well it's able to generate profit from the cash it raises via debt and equity it receives. A high ROIC means the company is likely innovating strategically, improving operations to increase efficiency, and targeting secular growth trends with new chip designs.\n4. Strong balance sheet\nSemiconductors are arguably the most complex things ever developed by humankind. Manufacturing chips is very expensive, so it's especially important to understand how semiconductor companies obtain the necessary financial resources to expand.\nFor example, take chip manufacturers such as the world's largest, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.49%). For a chip business, the company has above-average debt compared to its revenue. However, it also has more cash and investments than it does debt, which signifies a healthy and profitable business that has no problems getting funding.\nA company's balance sheet that has more cash than debt and low debt relative to operating profit is a key element to watch. Plenty of cash relative to debt means that a company is well positioned to pay interest and principal payments, even in a pinch. It can also mean the return of excess cash in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.\nRelated investing topics\nFAQ\nFAQ: Best semiconductor investments\nWhat stock is the best for semiconductors?\nThe best stock depends on your investment objectives and risk tolerance, but Nvidia was one of the best-performing and largest semiconductor stocks in 2025.\nWhat is the best chip stock to buy?\nThe best chip stock depends on your targeted market (e.g., smartphones, PCs, data centers, gaming, etc.). For general exposure, a large company like Nvidia will provide broad coverage.\nAre semiconductors a good investment?\nSemiconductors can be a good investment, offering strong returns but also experiencing high volatility. This year has shown their potential for significant gains, but it's important to remember that they are highly cyclical. Investing in semiconductors requires a willingness to handle these fluctuations.\nWhere can I buy semiconductor stocks?\nYou can buy semiconductor stocks on most major exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. These stocks are available for purchase through most brokerage apps.\nWhy are semiconductor stocks going up?\nSemiconductor stocks are rising due to a mix of sector-specific tailwinds and broader economic trends. On the industry side, strong demand for high-performance computing and increased investment in AI infrastructure have all played a role. At the macro level, easing interest rate concerns and improving global growth expectations have also helped lift investor sentiment toward cyclical tech stocks like semiconductors.\nWhat are the top semiconductor companies?\nThe three most prominent semiconductor companies are Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML). Together, they represent the design, production, and tooling ecosystem. Nvidia designs the most in-demand AI chips on the market. TSMC is the leading third-party chip fabricator. ASML builds the advanced lithography machines required to produce cutting-edge chips.\nWhich semiconductor stock is undervalued?\nWhich semiconductor stock is undervalued depends on how you define value, but one notable candidate is Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), a memory chip manufacturer that produces DRAM components used in servers, PCs, and smartphones. As of July 2025, Micron was trading at 10.02x forward earnings, well below the 33.47x forward earnings multiple of the iShares Semiconductor ETF, suggesting the stock may offer relative value within the sector."

      "text": "Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) and fellow graphics processing unit (GPU) maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from sales of their respective artificial intelligence (AI) data center chips designed for the China market in exchange for obtaining export licenses for these chips, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the story on Sunday night.\nThe 15% AI chip revenue deal\nThe U.S. Commerce Department began issuing export licenses for Nvidia's H20 chip and AMD's MI308 chip on Friday, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Friday.\nNvidia provided a statement to the FT after it broke the government deal story on Sunday night that included the following: \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.\"\nBackground on Nvidia's H20 chip\nNvidia had designed the H20 AI-enabling GPU specifically for the Chinese market after earlier U.S. export controls, enacted under the administration of President Joe Biden, meant it couldn't sell its more advanced data center AI chips to China.\nIn mid-April, the Trump administration expanded the restrictions to include the H20. Nvidia immediately halted its sales and took a charge of $4.5 billion on its Q1 results for H20 inventory and purchase commitments.\nThen in mid-July, Nvidia emailed investors who subscribe to the company's news and said it was \"filing applications to sell the Nvidia H20 GPU again. The U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon.\"\nAt the time, there was no mention of giving the government a 15% cut of H20 revenue as a condition for obtaining export licenses.\nHow will Nvidia's revenue be affected by this deal?\nWe can get an estimate as to how this deal will affect Nvidia's financial results by looking at the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended on April 27.\nIn that quarter, Nvidia sold $4.6 billion in H20 chips to China prior to the start of the export controls in mid-April. It said it was unable to ship $2.5 billion in H20 chips that it had already produced due to the export controls. So, had the restrictions not existed, Nvidia would have sold $7.1 billion in H20 chips to China customers in Q1. This amounts to 15.2% of $46.6 billion, which is what its total revenue would have been, absent the export controls.\nOver 15% of its total revenue is significant, so you can see the importance of Nvidia's China data center business.\nFor its fiscal Q2 (which ended July 27), investors should expect Nvidia to report no sales of its H20 chip, because the export restrictions were in place the entire quarter. However, H20 sales should fully rebound in fiscal Q3 (late July to late October).\nWhen Nvidia provided Q2 guidance, it estimated that it would lose about $8 billion in H20 chip sales due to the export controls. So, keeping with roughly the same sequential quarter growth, let's assume Q3 H20 sales will be about $9 billion. In this case, Nvidia would pay the U.S. government $1.35 billion, which is 15% of $9 billion.\nWhile $1.35 billion seems like a huge number, it's only a small percentage of Nvidia's overall quarterly revenue. In Q1, Nvidia's total revenue was $44.1 billion -- and it would have been $46.6 billion, had it not \"lost\" sales of $2.5 billion due to the export restrictions. That $1.35 billion is only 2.9% of $46.6 billion. But the actual Q3 percentage will be smaller because Nvidia's revenue will be higher in Q3 than Q1.\nA revenue loss of somewhere between 2% to 3% of total sales is a very minor speed bump. Moreover, it's a much better situation than having no H20 sales.\nHow will Nvidia's profitability be affected by this deal?\nGiving the government a 15% cut of H20 sales revenue should also negatively affect Nvidia's bottom line. But it should be an extremely minor dent, because Nvidia's data center platform is amazingly profitable. On that note, Nvidia overall is amazingly profitable.\nNvidia doesn't break out its profitability by platform, so we'll have to use its overall numbers. In Q1, Nvidia's adjusted gross margin (gross profit divided by revenue) absent the $4.5 billion H20-related charge was 71.3%. The company provided its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) absent the charge, so I could calculate adjusted net income absent the charge and then from that calculate adjusted net profit margin (net income divided by revenue) absent the charge -- which would have been 56.1%.\nIn other words, Nvidia converts more than half of its revenue into adjusted profits in a typical quarter, which is just phenomenal. It can easily absorb slightly less profitability on its H20 chips, which, again, account for roughly 15% of its total revenue in a typical quarter.\nIn short, Nvidia stock's strong upward trajectory should not be hurt by the company having to give the government a slice of its H20 sales."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "In just a little under one week, Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) will report its earnings for Q2 2025.\nFor the most part, analysts are optimistic about the report, due out after the close of trading on Aug. 27. Consensus forecasts have the semiconductor company growing earnings 48.5% year over year, to $1.01 per share, as insatiable demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips drives a near-53% rise in revenue to almost $46 billion.\nThat's a lot of money Nvidia will be raking in for a single quarter. This is one of the primary reasons why a staggering 58 analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence give Nvidia stock either a \"buy\" or an \"outperform,\" or an equivalent rating -- versus only one single analyst who says \"sell.\"\nOne reason why two analysts are worried about Nvidia\nAnd yet, not everything's unicorns and rainbows for Nvidia stock. As the final countdown to earnings day begins, two separate Wall Street analysts chimed in Wednesday morning to raise reservations about Nvidia stock and the challenges that lie ahead for it.\nFirst up was Deutsche Bank, where analyst Ross Seymore set a price target of $155 that implies the stock could fall 12% over the next 12 months. Ordinarily, the prospect of a 12% near-term loss in a stock would inspire an analyst to recommend selling that stock. But perhaps fearing to deviate too far from the herd on this popular AI stock, Seymore only reiterated a \"hold\" rating on Nvidia. (Seymore is still one of only a half-dozen analysts with neutral ratings on Nvidia).\nNo matter. Whether any one analyst thinks Nvidia is a \"buy\" or just a \"hold\" probably shouldn't concern us as much as why he rates the stock as he does. And in Seymore's case, the answer couldn't be clearer:\nWriting on StreetInsider.com on Wednesday, Seymore warns that U.S. trade restrictions on semiconductor exports to China will cost Nvidia about $8 billion in \"foregone\" revenue in Q2. True, a resumption of shipments upon receiving export licenses from the Trump administration should help rectify this situation by Q3. But there's a cost to that solution -- specifically, the Trump Administration's requirement that, to obtain export licenses, Nvidia must fork over 15% of any revenue it generates in China to the IRS.\nWith China accounting for roughly $17 billion of Nvidia's revenue over the last 12 months, that could amount to a $2.6 billion drag on Nvidia's profits over the next 12 months.\nKeyBanc chimes in\nInvestment bank KeyBanc shares Deutsche Bank's concerns about Nvidia and China. On the one hand, KeyBanc anticipates Nvidia could book $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue from selling H20 and B40 chips in China next quarter. On the other hand, the banker believes this revenue is unreliable and dependent upon the receipt of export licenses from Washington.\nFor this reason, KeyBanc warns Nvidia may \"exclude direct revenue from China\" when giving revenue guidance next week, potentially creating a kind of guidance miss that could send Nvidia shares lower.\nKeyBanc also cites the \"potential 15% tax on AI exports\" from the U.S. side as a risk, and adds that \"pressure from the [Chinese] government for its AI providers to use domestic AI chips\" could dampen Nvidia's China revenues even further -- adding a third risk that Deutsche didn't mention!\nFinally, some good news\nNow, I hope I haven't painted too bleak a picture for you here. Fact is, despite his reservations, Deutsche analyst Seymore still expects Nvidia to report a \"typical\" earnings beat next week, exceeding the company's $45 billion revenue forecast by about $2 billion. Blackwell revenue is ramping, says Seymore, more than doubling sequentially between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, to $24 billion.\nWith the prospect of an imminent earnings beat, it makes sense that Seymore would hesitate to recommend selling Nvidia stock -- even if he does feel it's a bit overpriced.\nFurthermore, KeyBanc agrees that Blackwell production is ramping, and a new Blackwell Ultra (B300) chip is on the way, potentially boosting revenue even more in Q3. For these and other reasons, KeyBanc not only still rates Nvidia stock \"overweight\" (i.e., buy). KeyBanc actually raised its price target on the stock to $215 on Wednesday.\nSo, is Nvidia stock a buy or not?\nThat's the real question, isn't it? Wall Street's confident Nvidia will \"beat\" on Q2 next week. It's just worried that Nvidia will \"miss\" on guidance for Q3. Longer-term, though, is Nvidia stock a buy or isn't it?\nHere's how I look at it, and I'll keep this really simple:\nValued at 4.28 trillion dollars, earning nearly $77 billion in annual profit, and backing that up with roughly $72 billion in annual free cash flow, Nvidia stock costs about 55 times trailing earnings and about 59 times free cash flow. For Nvidia stock to be a clear-cut buy, I'd want to see the stock growing earnings at least 50% annually over the next five years.\nThe best that Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to do, however, is 30% annual growth -- even with nine out of 10 analysts polled saying Nvidia stock is a buy.\nThe math here isn't hard. Nvidia stock is not a buy at this price -- but it might be if it sells off after earnings."
