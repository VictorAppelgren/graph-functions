  "content": "HONG KONG, Aug. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI) concluded its Summer Internship Programme on 15 August. A total of 38 interns from top-tier universities worldwide, selected from 2,500 applicants, have successfully completed an enriching eight-week work experience.\n\n\"At ASTRI, we are committed to nurturing young talent and driving innovation forward,\" said Ir Dr Ted Suen, Chief Executive Officer of ASTRI. \"I'm delighted to see how the internship programme has inspired these bright minds to embark on their innovation and technology (I&T) journey in this vibrant city after graduation.\"\n\nDuring the programme, ASTRI's talent acquisition team organised a series of events, including a CTO Dialogue, two \"Tech Talk\" seminars, a presentation skill training workshop, company visits and networking sessions. These activities offered interns valuable exposures to industry experts and insights into Hong Kong's I&T ecosystem.\n\nVisits to organisations such as Bank of China (Hong Kong), Cyberport, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, IBM and HKSTP Experience Centre provided a comprehensive understanding of the industry landscape.\n\nFunded by the STEM Internship Scheme under the Innovation and Technology Fund of the Innovation and Technology Commission, the programme paired interns with senior researchers to work on hands-on research and development (R&D) projects. These projects spanned diverse areas, including AI-powered solutions, digital health, FinTech, green technologies, robotics and more.\n\nDarshbir Singh Kohli developed a real-time monitoring system to track environmental conditions and optimises inverter efficiency. His projects contribute to the development of a solar-powered bi-directional DC-AC inverter and EV charging station, advancing smarter energy management and sustainability.\n\nA first-year engineering student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Darshbir shared, \"I felt deeply motivated knowing that my work could make a tangible impact on improving the environment and achieving carbon neutrality.\"\n\nRussell Lam, a second-year life science student at the University of Toronto, contributed to the development of an electronic nose system to classify food waste based on gas profiles. He conducted rough trials, determined the concentration range for spoilage gases, and experimented with flow and diffusion sensor systems.",
