  "title": "49ers practice report: List of the walking wounded continues to grow",
  "description": "For one reason or another, nearly two dozen banged-up players sat out the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 shorter-than-usual practice on Monday afternoon.",
  "content": "More than a dozen players didn\u2019t practice Monday, not including those listed on the active physically unable to perform, non-football injury and injured reserve lists.\n\nIn all, the 49ers went without 23 players for a relatively short noon session that ended shy of an hour and a half (most training camp practices have lasted two hours). It isn\u2019t the most encouraging sign for a franchise fresh off of an injury-riddled 6-11 season.\n\nHead coach Kyle Shanahan spoke after Saturday\u2019s preseason opener of the roster challenges his team faces ahead of Thursday\u2019s joint practice with the Raiders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely getting hard,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s real important that we get two good practices in Monday and Tuesday so hopefully we\u2019re in a better spot Thursday when we go against the Raiders.\u201d\n\nThere was no offensive line-defensive line, wide receiver-cornerback 1-on-1 period. And the second- and third-team offensive and defensive units atypically meshed due to the vast personnel hits \u2014 underlined by light workouts off to the side for wide receiver Jauan Jennings (calf), rookie nickel back Upton Stout (calf) and running back Isaac Guerendo (shoulder).\n\nA shred of good news for the 49ers: Offensive tackle Andre Dillard (ankle) was activated from PUP and among those who returned to action, in addition to safety Ji\u2019Ayir Brown (ankle) and defensive tackle Evan Anderson (groin). Rookie safety Marques Sigle (knee bruise) and linebacker Tatum Bethune (ankle) \u2014 who both suffered minor injuries in Saturday \u2014 did not miss a beat.",
