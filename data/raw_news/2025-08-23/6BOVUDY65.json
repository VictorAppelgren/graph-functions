  "title": "Judges Cannot Agree On How Much Trump\u2019s Fraud Should Cost Him. Here's Why",
  "description": "It\u2019s difficult to measure the impact of lies. Just ask the justice who called out Trump for fraud Thursday, while handing him a $500 million gift.",
  "content": "udges in two courts have now found that the president of the United States took part in a yearslong fraud that deceived financial institutions about his net worth. They differed, however, on how much Trump should pay as a penalty. Judge Arthur Engoron concluded in February last year that Trump owed about a half-billion dollars. Appellate justice Peter Moulton, in an opinion issued Thursday, threw out that penalty, dropping the figure to zero.\n\nNeither did much math to arrive at those numbers.\n\nThe trial judge, Engoron, attempted to gauge how much Trump\u2019s lies saved the now-president in interest on his loans. But he relied on a sloppy calculation. Michiel McCarty, an investment banker that the State of New York called to testify, noted that Trump secured lower interest rates after offering personal guarantees on loans. McCarty then compared those rates to higher ones lenders told Trump he would pay if he did not personally guarantee his loans. He used the difference to estimate the amount of interest Trump saved across four loans spanning 10 years, getting $168 million.\n\nThat calculation, however, rested on a faulty premise. Trump did not have to lie about his net worth to give banks a personal guarantee, and therefore secure cheap rates. He lied not just of necessity but also out of habit. Lying is what he does, especially when talking about the size of his fortune. To more accurately calculate how much Trump\u2019s dishonesty saved him, someone would have had to calculate how much Trump\u2019s interest rate if would have changed if he offered a personal guarantee but told the truth about his net worth.\n\nIt\u2019s little surprise that the attorney general, angling for a big decision, took a more aggressive approach. Trump\u2019s team, meanwhile, pretended that their client\u2019s misrepresentations did not matter because his lenders got repaid. A former managing director for Trump\u2019s longtime lender, Deutsche Bank, refuted that idea on the witness stand: \u201cJust getting repaid on the principal,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cdoesn\u2019t address at all whether we got properly recompensed for the risk we were taking.\u201d Put another way, Trump\u2019s lenders might have charged more interest if they fully understood the extent of his deception. Seeking to account for the damage, and without a decent estimate from Trump\u2019s team, Engoron accepted the expert\u2019s flawed math. In doing so, the judge overestimated the amount of money Trump\u2019s lies saved him\u2014and therefore the amount Trump needed to pay back. With interest, the total from the interest savings amounted to more than $240 million.\n\nIn addition, Engoron ordered Trump to repay about $200 million based upon the sale of two properties, a hotel in Washington, D.C. and a golf course in New York. The Trump Organization included puffed-up net worth figures on documents connected to both projects. But if Trump had done those deals without lying to anyone, he still would have received roughly $200 million from selling the assets at sky-high prices during the post-Covid property boom.\n\nRather than try to pinpoint how much the lies benefitted Trump, Engoron ran with the questionable assumption that Trump could not have completed the deals at all without lying about his net worth. He ordered Trump to hand over all gains to the state. The total payments and interest eventually added up to an estimated $517 million penalty\u2014or disgorgement, as the lower court referred to it.\n\nTrump\u2019s team appealed immediately and received a new ruling Thursday. Justice Moulton spent much of his 122-page opinion explaining the many ways he agreed with Engoron, concurring with \u201cfindings of illegality\u201d and citing \u201cample bases to find that defendants would continue to engage in fraudulent and illegal activity.\u201d\n\nThen came the math. Moulton concluded that it was unclear how much Trump\u2019s net worth lies had to do with the profits he made selling properties in D.C. and New York, so he wiped out that roughly $200 million portion of the penalty. As for the savings in interest, which accounted for most of the money in question, Moulton only briefly addressed the issue. He offered no alternative number, pointing to the difficulty of calculating a proper sum in a footnote. Then, abruptly, he declared, \u201cFor the foregoing reasons, we vacate the portions of the Posttrial Order directing disgorgement in its entirety.\u201d\n\nThe lower court accepted flawed math. The higher court basically did none. \u201cTOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case!\u201d the president posted on Truth Social. \u201cEverything I did was absolutely CORRECT and, even, PERFECT.\u201d\n\nNevermind that the ruling, despite letting Trump off the hook financially, offered a damning assessment of his behavior. Why start telling the truth if previous lies cost you nothing?",

The article explains how Engoron\u2019s math overestimated the benefits of Trump\u2019s lies and how Moulton dismissed the penalty due to uncertainty about the connection between the lies and the profits.
