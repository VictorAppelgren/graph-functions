  "title": "This Common Investing Trap Messes With Your Mind-Here's How to Break Free",
  "description": "Market dips can feel more powerful than months of investing. Here\u2019s why that happens\u2014and how dollar-cost averaging can help you stay steady and build wealth.",
  "content": "If a 10% market drop makes you anxious enough to question whether your steady investing has been worth it, you\u2019re not alone. For many long-term investors, market volatility can feel disproportionately painful, creating an emotional imbalance that may lead to poor decisions like panic selling or market timing.\n\nPsychologists call this loss aversion\u2014we feel the sting of losses more than the joy of gains. Add in recency bias, and sudden dips can overshadow years of progress. But understanding these tendencies isn\u2019t just academic; it can protect your portfolio. By shifting your mindset, embracing volatility through tools like dollar-cost averaging, and automating your contributions, you can stop fearing downturns and start using them to your advantage.\n\n\n\nWhy Your Brain Tricks You Into Fearing Market Drops More Than Missing Contributions\n\nHuman psychology isn\u2019t built for the stock market. \u201cLosses scream; gains whisper,\u201d says Marcus Holzberg, a certified financial planner at Holzberg Wealth Management. \u201cYou can save for years, only to have one bad month make you question everything.\u201d\n\nThat sense of imbalance is rooted in loss aversion, a behavioral bias that makes the pain of losses feel about twice as intense as the pleasure of gains. Combine that with recency bias\u2014the tendency to put more weight on recent events\u2014and even a small dip can feel catastrophic.\n\nSamantha Mockford, associate wealth advisor at Citrine Capital, puts it plainly: \u201cRegular contributions are mindless\u2014sometimes we forget we\u2019re making them\u2014but a sharp market downturn is occasional enough to be memorable.\u201d\n\nEven seasoned savers fall into this trap. \u201cOur brains are wired to overreact to short-term losses,\u201d says James Smith, co-founder at Vitality Wealth. A 10% drop in the market, which tends to happen about once every 30 months, \u201ccan feel like a major setback even though it\u2019s just a blip in the long run,\u201d he adds. In fact, the market has historically recovered from these types of corrections within an average of eight months.\n\nHow Dollar-Cost Averaging Turns Volatility Into Your Advantage\n\nInstead of fearing volatility, many investors could benefit from reframing it as an opportunity. Dollar-cost averaging\u2014a strategy where you invest the same amount on a regular basis\u2014naturally encourages buying more shares when prices fall and fewer when they rise, Mockford points out, calling it \u201ca great tool to help investors effortlessly \u2018buy low.\u2019\u201d\n\nSmith doubles down on that point, saying: \u201cEvery market dip gives your automatic contributions a chance to buy in at lower prices. That\u2019s the power of dollar-cost averaging\u2014turning volatility into opportunity.\u201d But for it to work, you need a plan and discipline. That includes \u201ca diversified portfolio that aligns with your goals,\u201d he adds, and resisting the urge to act on fear.\n\nTo reduce emotional reactivity, Mockford even recommends limiting your exposure to daily account balances. \u201cIf you are someone whose emotions are attached to your investments\u2019 performance that day, then do yourself a favor and don\u2019t auto-fill your login credentials,\u201d she says. \u201cAppropriately invested assets are like a Crock-Pot\u2014the less you peek, the better.\u201d\n\nMarket swings feel bigger than contributions because our brains are built to fear losses and fixate on the short term. But with a sound plan, consistent investing, and a few mindset shifts, you can turn that volatility into a long-term advantage. As Holzberg puts it: \u201cShort-term pain during market swings doesn\u2019t change long-term goals.\u201d",

      "text": "Even as algorithms process market information at lightning speed, one stubborn reality remains: markets are made up of humans with all their psychological quirks and flaws. While efficient market theorists argue that all known information is instantly priced into investments, the consistent success of investors like Warren Buffett suggests otherwise. The gap between theory and reality lies in our behavioral biases\u2014the emotional and cognitive shortcuts that lead us to make irrational financial decisions.\n\"If you are presenting people with information, be aware of what happens to human behavior when you don't provide context,\" George M. Blount, a financial therapist and founder of Balance Financial, told Investopedia. These innate biases don't just affect novice investors\u2014they influence professionals with decades of experience, often without their awareness. Understanding these psychological blind spots is the first step toward making smarter investment choices and avoiding costly mistakes. Here are four of the most common biases undermining your portfolio, and how to overcome them.\nKey Takeaways\n- Behavioral finance argues that real people do not behave like the rational actors predicted by mainstream economic theories and the efficient markets hypothesis.\n- Traders and investors tend to suffer from overconfidence, regret, attention deficits, and trend chasing, each of which can lead to suboptimal decisions and reduce returns.\n- Here, we describe four common behavioral biases and provide practical advice for avoiding these mistakes.\n1. Overconfidence\nOverconfidence has two components: overconfidence in the quality of your information, and your ability to act on said information at the right time for maximum gain. Studies show that overconfident traders trade more frequently and fail to appropriately diversify their portfolios.\nA classic study analyzed trades from 10,000 clients at a large discount brokerage firm to determine whether frequent trading leads to higher returns. After removing tax-loss trades and others to meet liquidity needs, the study found that the purchased stocks underperformed the sold stocks by 5% over one year and 8.6% over two years. In other words, the more active the retail investor, the less money they make.\nThese results have been replicated in multiple markets. The authors concluded that traders are \"basically paying fees to lose money.\"\nHow To Avoid This Bias\nTrade less and invest more. Understand that by entering into trading activities, you're trading against computers, institutional investors, and others around the world with better data and more information than you have. The odds are overwhelmingly in their favor. By increasing your time frame, mirroring indexes, and taking advantage of dividends, you will likely build wealth over time. Resist the urge to believe that your information and intuition are better than others in the market.\n2. Regret\nYou were confident that a particular stock was value-priced and had minimal downside potential. You put the trade on, but it worked against you. Still feeling like you were right, you didn't sell when the loss was small. You let it go because no loss is a loss as long as you don't sell the position. It continued to go against you, but you didn't sell until the stock lost a majority of its value.\nAs humans, we try to avoid the feeling of regret as much as possible, and often we will go to great lengths, sometimes illogical lengths, to avoid having to own the feeling of regret. By not selling the position and locking in a loss, a trader doesn't have to deal with regret. Research shows that traders were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to sell a winning position too early and a losing position too late, all to avoid the regret of losing gains or losing the original cost basis.\nHow To Avoid This Bias\nSet trading rules that never change. For example, if a stock trade loses a certain percentage of its value, exit the position. If the stock rises above a certain level, set a trailing stop that will lock in gains if the trade loses a certain amount of gains. Make these levels unbreakable rules and don't trade on emotion.\n3. Limited Attention Span\nThere are thousands of stocks to choose from, but the individual investor has neither the time nor the desire to research each. Humans are constrained by what economist and psychologist Herbert Simon called \"bounded rationality.\" This theory states that humans will make decisions based on the limited knowledge they can accumulate. Instead of making the most efficient decision, they'll make the most satisfactory decision.\nBecause of these limitations, investors tend to consider only stocks that come to their attention through websites, financial media, friends, family, or other sources outside of their own research. For example, if a specific biotech stock gains Food and Drug Administration approval for a blockbuster drug, the move to the upside could be magnified because the reported news catches the eye of investors. Smaller news about the same stock may cause a small market reaction because it doesn't reach the media.\nHow To Avoid This Bias\nRecognize that the media has an effect on your trading activities. Learning to research and evaluate stocks that are both well-known and \"off the beaten path\" might reveal lucrative trades that you would have never found if you waited for them to come to you. Don't let the media noise impact your decisions. Instead, use the media as one data point among many.\n4. Chasing Trends\nThis is arguably the strongest trading bias. Researchers in behavioral finance found that 39% of all new money committed to mutual funds went into the 10% of funds with the best performance the prior year. Although financial products often include the disclaimer that \"past performance is not indicative of future results,\" retail traders still believe they can predict the future by studying the past.\nHumans have an extraordinary talent for detecting patterns, and when they find them, they believe in their validity. When they find a pattern, they act on it, but often, that pattern is already priced in. Even if a pattern is found, the market is far more random than most traders care to admit. One study found that investors who weighed their decisions on past performance were often the poorest performing when compared to others.\nHow To Avoid This Bias\nIf you identify a trend, it's likely that the market identified and exploited it long before you. You run the risk of buying at the highs\u2014a trade put on just in time to watch the stock retreat in value. If you want to exploit market inefficiency, take the Warren Buffett approach: buy when others are fearful and sell when they're confident. Following the herd rarely produces large-scale gains.\nWhat Is Regret Aversion?\nRegret aversion is when a person wastes time, energy, or money in order to avoid feeling regret over an initial decision that can exceed the value of the investment. One example is buying a bad car, then spending more money on repairs than the original cost of the car, rather than admit that a mistake was made and that you should have just bought a different car.\nHow Can I Tell If I Am Overconfident?\nIf you are asking this question, you may already be subject to overconfidence. Feeling that you know more than others or than you actually do is a crucial mistake made by people, from novices to experts alike. As part of human nature, it is safe to assume that you may exhibit overconfidence in some aspects of decision-making.\nWhat Can I Do to Avoid Chasing Trends?\nHerding behavior and market psychology are difficult to detach from as human beings. A good way to avoid trend chasing is to create an objective and unbiased strategy and then stick with it no matter what. Set your exit criteria ahead of time and do not deviate. Passive indexing or contrarian strategies can also be used to avoid this bias.\nThe Bottom Line\nDo you see a bit of yourself in any of these biases? If you do, understand that the best way to avoid the pitfalls of human emotion is to have trading rules. Those might include selling if a stock drops more than a certain percentage, not buying a stock after it rises a certain percentage, and not selling a position until a certain amount of time has elapsed. You can't avoid all behavioral biases, but you can minimize the effect on your trading activities."

      "text": "Investing in stocks can be a powerful way to grow your wealth over time. It involves buying shares in a company with the hope that the company will grow and perform well in the stock market for the long term, resulting in gains on your investment.\nIt's important to start by setting clear investment goals, determining how much you can invest, and how much risk you can tolerate. Then, pick a broker that matches your trading style, fund your account, and buy stocks.\nThis beginner\u2019s guide explains the essential steps to invest in stocks, whether you have thousands set aside or can invest a more modest $25 a week.\nKey Takeaways\n- Open an online brokerage account with a platform that best aligns with your goals and skill level.\n- Investing in stocks and letting your money work for you is one way to grow your wealth.\n- Investing involves a chance of losses. However, there are ways to lower your risk, though you can't eliminate it altogether.\n- New investors have never had so many resources for expert advice.\n- Following these seven essential steps, you\u2019ll learn how to set clear investment goals, choose the right stocks, and understand the basics of stock investing.\nRelated Stories\nHow To Start Investing in Stocks in Just 7 Steps\nInvesting in stocks involves purchasing shares of ownership in a public company in the hopes of seeing the company perform well in the stock market, leading to a share price increase that makes your investment more valuable.\nInvesting in stocks can lead to positive financial returns if you own a stock that grows in value over time. But you also face the risk of losing money if a share price falls over time.\nStep 1: Set Clear Investment Goals\nBegin by specifying your financial objectives. Clear goals will guide your investment decisions and help you stay focused. Consider both short-term and long-term goals, as they will affect your investment strategy.\nYou might have short-term goals like saving for a home or a vacation or have long-term objectives like securing a comfortable retirement or funding a child\u2019s education. Your objectives depend on your life stage and ambitions. Younger investors tend to focus more on growth and long-term wealth accumulation, while those closer to retirement typically prefer generating income and capital preservation. The more precise you are, the better.\nTips for Setting Investment Goals:\n- Be specific about your objectives: Instead of vague goals like \u201csave for retirement,\u201d aim for specific targets like \u201caccumulate $500,000 in my retirement fund by age 50.\u201d\n- Determine your investment horizon: Assess how long you have to achieve each goal. Longer time horizons often allow for more aggressive investment strategies, while shorter ones may require more conservative approaches. The longer you give yourself, the less conservative you'll need to be early on.\n- Evaluate your finances: Be realistic about how much you can put toward your investment goals, considering your savings, regular income, and any other financial resources.\n- Rank your goals: Most of us balance several goals at once, and we have to prioritize saving for a home down payment, paying for a wedding next year, or preparing for retirement based on urgency and importance. For example, saving for a down payment on a house might take precedence over planning a vacation.\n- Adapt as life changes: The phrase financial planning is best taken as a verb, not a noun. It's an ongoing process that should evolve with your needs and aspirations. You might get married, have children, or move across the country. Regularly review and adjust your goals as your life circumstances change.\nThe first step in any venture is the biggest, but by setting clear and precise investment goals, you'll lay a strong foundation for building your investments. This clarity will help you navigate the stock market with confidence and purpose.\nStep 2: Determine How Much You Can Afford To Invest\nPinpointing how much money you can afford to put in stocks requires a clear-eyed assessment of your finances. This step helps ensure that you are investing responsibly without endangering your financial stability.\nTips for Determining Your Investment Amount:\n- Review your income sources: Begin by listing all your sources of income. Check if your employer offers investment options with tax benefits or matching funds to amplify your investments.\n- Establish an emergency fund: Ensure you have a solid financial foundation before investing. Solid does not mean perfect. This fund should cover a few months' worth of major expenses, such as mortgage or rent payments and other essential bills.\n- Pay off high-interest debts: Financial planners typically recommend paying down high-interest debts, such as credit card balances. The returns from investing in stocks are unlikely to outweigh the costs of high interest accumulating on these debts. Thus, scrutinize each of your debts similarly, weighing the interest payments against potential investment returns. Likely, your debts will have to come first.\n- Create a budget: Based on your financial assessment, decide how much money you can comfortably invest in stocks. You also want to know if you're starting with a lump sum or smaller amounts put in over time. Your budget should ensure that you are not dipping into funds you need for expenses.\nDon't worry if your funds are less than you would wish. You wouldn't berate yourself for not being ready for a race on your first day of training; so, too, with investing. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and the journey is still ahead.\nTwo crucial points:\n- Only invest money you can afford to lose.\n- Never put yourself in a financially vulnerable position for the sake of investing.\nTaking these seriously is what separates investing from gambling.\nStep 3: Determine Your Risk Tolerance and Investing Style\nUnderstanding your risk tolerance is a cornerstone of investing. It helps you align your comfort level with the inherent uncertainties of the stock market and financial goals.\nTips for Assessing Your Risk Tolerance\n- Self-assessment: Reflect on your comfort level with the ups and downs of the stock market. Are you willing to accept higher risks for potentially greater returns, or do you prefer stability even if that means potentially less in the end?\n- Consider your time horizon: Your risk tolerance often depends on your investment timeline. Longer horizons allow for more risk since you have time to recover from potential losses. Shorter timelines typically require more conservative investments.\n- Gauge your financial cushion: Assess your finances, including your savings, emergency fund, and other investments. A solid financial cushion can help you take on more risk.\n- Align investments with risk levels: Choose stocks and other investments that align with your risk tolerance. Examples:\n- Lower risk: Dividend stocks and bonds.\n- Moderate risk: Midcap and large-capitalization stocks, index funds, and exchange-traded funds.\n- High risk: Small-cap stocks, growth stocks, and sector-specific investments.\n- Adjust over time: Your risk tolerance may change as your finances and goals evolve. Regularly reassess your risk tolerance and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\nBy accurately determining your risk tolerance, you can build a portfolio that reflects your financial goals and personal comfort level, helping you navigate the stock market with more peace of mind.\nTips for Identifying Your Investing Style:\nWhether you prefer a hands-on approach or a more passive strategy, understanding your investing style helps you choose the right investment methods and tools. Everyone has a different relationship with money. Some prefer an active role, meticulously poring over every last cell on their portfolio's spreadsheets, while others opt for a set-it-and-forget-it approach. They trust their investments will grow over time if they just leave them alone.\nYour style might evolve, but you'll need to start somewhere, even if your choice isn't set in stone.\nBegin with a self-reflection on whether you enjoy researching and analyzing stocks or prefer a more detached approach. Here are your main choices:\n1. Do-It-Yourself (DIY) investing: If you grasp how stocks work and have the confidence to head out with minimal guidance into the market, managing the trades yourself is one option. Even DIY, there are more and less active approaches:\n- Active: You utilize the tools offered by your brokerage platform to research and access various investments, including stocks, bonds, and other assets, and trade as you wish. You'll set your goals and choose when to buy and sell.\n- Passive: You use your brokerage account to buy shares in index ETFs and mutual funds. You still control which funds you purchase, but fund managers do the trading for you.\n2. Professional guidance: For those who prefer a more personal approach and want an experienced broker or financial advisor to guide their investments is often considered an invaluable resource. These financial professionals tailor their advice to your life experiences and goals, help you decide among the most promising stock choices, monitor your portfolio, and collaborate with you when things need changing.\n3. Automated guidance: Those seeking a tailored approach without human involvement may want to consider a robo-advisor. These platforms are popular choices. The best platform equips its account holders with sophisticated tools and assessments to create unique portfolios based on individual needs and goals.\nStep 4. Choose an Investment Account\nYou've figured out your goals, the risk you can tolerate, and how active an investor you want to be. Now, it's time to choose the type of account you'll use. Each has its own features, benefits, and drawbacks. In addition, the type of account you choose can greatly impact your tax situation, investment options, and overall strategy. You'll need to compare different brokers to find the investment account right for you.\nTips for Choosing Your Investment Account\n1. Understand the different account types: In the table below, we've listed the differences between regular brokerage accounts, retirement accounts, and managed accounts. You'll want to choose one that'll work for you. We also list special accounts for education and health savings.\n2. Consider the tax implications:\n- Taxable accounts: These are the most common if you're trading online. Brokerage accounts don\u2019t offer tax benefits, but there are no restrictions on contributions or withdrawals.\n- Tax-deferred accounts: Contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s cut taxable income, and taxes are deferred until you withdraw the money.\n- Tax-free accounts: Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are funded with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.\nCompare Investment Accounts\n| Account Type | Description | Tax Implications | Key Features |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Brokerage Accounts | Standard accounts for buying and selling a wide range of investments; can be individual or joint (shared). The basic type is a cash account: you buy securities using only the money in your account. There are also margin accounts for experienced investors who borrow to buy additional stock. | No tax advantages; capital gains and dividends are taxable. | Full control over investments, flexible funding, and withdrawal options. |\n| Managed Accounts | Accounts managed by professional advisors on your behalf. | No tax advantages; capital gains and dividends are taxable. | Professional management, personalized investment strategies, typically higher fees. |\n| Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) Accounts | Accounts that automatically reinvest dividends into additional shares of the stock. | Dividends are taxable when received. | Automatic reinvestment, compounding growth, usually no transaction fees. |\n| Retirement Accounts | Accounts for long-term retirement savings with tax advantages. | Depends on the account type; generally tax-deferred or tax-free growth. | Contribution limits, potential employer matching, penalties for early withdrawal. |\n| - 401(k), 403(b), 457 Plans | Employer-sponsored retirement accounts. Take advantage of any matching funds if offered. | Contributions reduce taxable income; tax-deferred growth. | Potential employer matching (401[k] and 403[b]); no early withdrawal penalties for 457 plans; contribution limits. |\n| - Traditional IRAs | Individual retirement accounts with tax-deductible contributions. | Contributions reduce taxable income; tax-deferred growth. | Annual contribution limits; penalties for early withdrawal before age 59.5. |\n| - Roth IRAs | Individual retirement accounts are funded with after-tax dollars. | Tax-free growth; tax-free withdrawals in retirement. | Annual contribution limits; no required minimum distributions; penalties for early withdrawal of earnings. |\n| - Roth 401(k) Plans | Employer-sponsored retirement accounts with after-tax contributions. | Tax-free growth; tax-free withdrawals in retirement. | Potential employer matching; contribution limits; penalties for early withdrawal before age 59.5. |\n| Education Savings Accounts (529 Plans) | Accounts to save for education expenses. | Contributions are not federally tax-deductible; tax-free growth. | Used for education expenses; states tax benefits in some cases; no federal contribution limits. |\n| Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) | Accounts for medical expenses with triple tax advantages: tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified expenses. | Contributions reduce taxable income; tax-free growth and withdrawals. | High-deductible health plan required; contribution limits; funds roll over year to year. |\n3. Evaluate your investment goals: Match your investment account type with your goals. For long-term retirement savings, consider tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals or flexible investing, a standard brokerage account might be better.\n4. Scrutinize account fees, commissions, and minimums:\n- Trading commissions: These are fees brokers charge when you buy or sell securities. Many brokers now offer commission-free trades for particular investments, such as stocks and ETFs.\n- Account maintenance fees: Some brokerage accounts may charge annual or monthly maintenance fees, which depend on the account type and balance.\n- Inactivity fees: Brokers may charge fees if your account has little or no trading activity over a certain period.\n- Subscription-based models: As Generation Zers and Millennials take up a larger share of the investment space, financial advisors, planners, and brokers are adjusting. Instead of paying per transaction or for specific services, you pay a flat monthly or annual fee. Your subscription may include commission-free trades, access to research tools, and other premium support. Robo-advisors are often accompanied by a subscription model.\n- Account minimums: Momentous changes in recent years have resulted from immense competition among brokerages. Many online brokers have eliminated account minimums, making it easier for more investors to get started. If you have just a few dollars to invest, you can open a brokerage account and begin trading stocks.\n5. Check for added features: Some accounts offer additional features such as automatic contributions, access to financial advisors, educational resources, and more. Select an account that provides the features that fit your preferences.\n- Research and analysis: Choose a broker with robust research tools, market analysis, and educational resources to help you make informed decisions.\n- User-friendly trading platform: It shouldn't be glitchy or too difficult for you to use. It's best if it has real-time quotes, sophisticated charting tools, and mobile access.\n- Customer service: Look for brokers that offer several customer support options, including phone, email, live chat, and in-person support if needed.\n- Reputation and security: Avoid any platform that is not regulated by authorities like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Also, check that the broker employs strong security measures, such as encryption and two-factor authentication, to protect your personal and financial information.\n6. Pick your broker: Brokers are full-service, discount, or robo-advisory. A good broker will offer the tools, resources, and support you need to make informed investment decisions and manage your portfolio effectively.\n- Full-service brokers: These pack an array of financial services into one offering, including financial advice for retirement, healthcare, and educational products. They might craft financial plans to help you save for college, prepare for retirement, navigate estate transitions, and tackle other major life events. This personalized service explains their typically higher fees\u2014usually a percentage of your transaction values and assets under management. Some firms bill a yearly membership fee. To access these services, you'll typically need to invest at least $25,000, and they have traditionally catered to high-net-worth individuals.\n- Discount brokers: These have much lower, if any, thresholds for access but have a typically more streamlined service that allows you to place individual trades (often for low or no commissions per trade). Most have educational materials on their sites and mobile apps. However, they may have other requirements and fees. Be sure to check on both and review our Best Online Brokers for Beginners.\n- Robo-advisors: For an automated solution, robo-advisors save money and take little effort on your part. If you select one, you won't be alone. They tend to offer fewer trading options and lack the personal approach to financial planning that's often best for long-term investing. Want to know more? See our Best Robo-Advisors.\nStep 5: Fund Your Stock Account\nBy this step, you've picked a broker that aligns with your investment goals and preferences or is simply the most convenient. You've also decided whether you're opening a cash account, which requires you to pay for investments in full, or a margin account, which lets you borrow when purchasing securities.\nOnce you've chosen a brokerage and account type, you'll open your account. This involves providing your personal information: Social Security number, address, employment details, and financial data. This shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes.\nNow you'll have to fund it. Here are tips for doing so:\nTips for Funding Your Stock Account\n1. Choose how you'll fund it:\n- Bank transfer: The most common method is to transfer funds directly from your bank account. This can be done via electronic funds transfer or wire transfer.\n- Check deposit: Some brokers allow you to mail a check to fund your account. This method can take longer, but is viable if you prefer not to use electronic transfers.\n- Transfer from another brokerage: If you have an existing brokerage account, you can transfer assets directly to your new account. This process, known as an ACATS transfer, is usually straightforward but may take a few days to complete and may even be associated with a fee.\n2. Set up automatic contributions: Dollar-cost averaging involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals over time, no matter what the market does. This cuts your risk of making bad decisions based on short-term market news. Most brokers let you customize the frequency and amount of your automatic contributions, making it easier to stay within your budget and keep on track with your investment goals.\n3. Start investing: Once you've verified the funds are in your account (don't worry: the brokerage won't let you trade otherwise), it's time to start choosing the stocks that best fit your investment goals.\nTip\nIf you plan to trade frequently, check out our list of brokers for cost-conscious traders.\nStep 6: Pick Your Stocks\nEven experienced investors grapple with choosing the best stocks. Beginners should look for stability, a strong track record, and the potential for steady growth. Resist the temptation to gamble on risky stocks, hoping for a quick windfall. Long-term investing is mostly slow and steady, not fast and rash.\nHere are the types of stocks more likely to be solid bets when starting off:\n- Blue chips: These are shares of large, well-established, and financially sound companies with a history of reliable performance. Examples include companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. They are typically industry leaders and offer stability during market fluctuations.\n- Dividend stocks: Companies that regularly pay dividends can be a good choice for beginners. Dividends give you a regular income, which can be reinvested to buy even more stock. See How to Buy Dividend Stocks to learn more.\n- Growth stocks: The greater the chances for outsized growth in a stock, the riskier investing in it will be. Beginners interested in growth stocks should target industries with long-term potential, such as technology.\n- Defensive stocks: These are in industries that tend to do well even during economic downturns, such as utilities, healthcare, and consumer goods. They will give you a buffer against market volatility as you start.\n- ETFs: Traded like stocks, these track market indexes like the S&P 500, and offer instant diversification, reducing the risk associated with individual stocks. As you gain experience, you can look at funds for sectors that pique your interest, themes that meet your investment goals, or funds pooling environmental, social, and governance stocks.\nIt's prudent to begin with a conservative approach, focusing on stocks or funds that offer stability and a good track record. This will give you confidence and returns to trade with as you advance in your investing knowledge.\nStep 7. Learn, Monitor, Review\nSuccessful investors discover tips and strategies each passing day. As the stock market changes, staying up to date, going back to Step 1, reviewing your goals, etc., will be key. Here are tips on learning about, monitoring, and reviewing your accounts with an eye toward your goals and risk tolerance.\nTips for Learning and Monitoring Your Stocks\n- Read widely and regularly: Read reputable financial news sites. Keep informed about the global economy, industry trends, and the companies you are invested in. Avoid sites and books promising easy returns or tricks, not tips, likely to redound to their benefit when you buy their courses or apps. Books on investment strategies, stock market fundamentals, and diversification are essential.\n- Use stock simulators: These are platforms that enable you to practice trading stocks risk-free using virtual money. They are excellent for applying investment theories and testing strategies without risk. Investopedia's simulator is entirely free to use.\n- Learn about diversification: Having taken your beginning steps here, you'll next want to spread your investments across diverse asset classes to cut down on risk and improve your potential for returns. When you're ready, we can help you learn how to diversify your portfolio beyond stocks.\nYou now need to monitor your stocks and other investments. Regular reviewing and staying informed will help you adjust when necessary to keep on track with your financial goals.\nBest Investments and Stocks for Beginners To Buy\nPicking the right stocks can overwhelm those starting to navigate the investing world\u2014you're starting with a blank slate, and the options are endless. Here are ideas that aren't only the best for beginners but are often the choice of the experts managing their own portfolios:\nIndex funds: These are not technically stocks but funds that trade shares like them. They are passively managed funds that track the performance of a particular market index, like the S&P 500, a collection of 500 major publicly traded American companies.\nThese might not come with the excitement of picking a stock and seeing it take off, but index funds take what would be impractical or too expensive for a beginner and let you invest in a whole pool of them. And they do well: According to the S&P Indices Versus Active score cards, a widely respected benchmark, about 90% of actively managed funds didn't match the returns of the S&P 500 over 10 and 15-year periods. This is simple but winning information: the most effortless route might be the most profitable.\nBlue chip stocks: Classic investing advice has been to buy shares of well-established, stable companies with a history of consistent growth and dividend payments. The blue chips\u2014named for the traditional color of the highest-value poker chips\u2014have strong brand recognition, a solid market position, and a track record of weathering economic downturns. Investing in them can provide you with stability and the potential for steady, long-term returns.\nExamples include Apple (AAPL), known for its ubiquitous technology products and loyal customer base; JP Morgan & Chase Co (JPM), the banking giant; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a healthcare giant that also owns manufacturers of many consumer goods; and Coca-Cola (KO), the soft drink maker that has distributed dividends each year since 1893.\nDividend aristocrats: Coca-Cola is not just a blue-chip stock, but it also belongs to a select group that has distributed and increased its dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. By investing in dividend aristocrats, beginners can benefit from the potential for rising income and the chance to reinvest the dividends for compound growth.\nExamples include ExxonMobil (XOM), one of the world's largest oil and gas companies with a history of solid cash generation; Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), the consumer products multinational; and Walmart (WMT), the retail behemoth.\nLow-volatility stocks: These companies' shares have historically had fewer price swings, providing more solidity to portfolios and, not for nothing, calm for investor heart rates. They often belong to \"defensive sectors\" (recession-proof parts of the economy) such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.\nExamples include companies we've mentioned already (Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, etc.), as well as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), Brystol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY), Duke Energy (DUK), and the Hershey Company (HSY), whose stability even during financial storms shows that the love of chocolate doesn't go away when the economy hits some bumps.\nQuality factor ETFs: These invest in companies with solid balance sheets, consistent growth in earnings, and other measures of good financial health. Quality factor ETFs take a rules-based approach to selecting stocks with low debt levels, stable earnings, and high returns.\nExample funds include the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, which holds large- and midcap U.S. stocks with solid quality characteristics, and the Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF, which focuses on high-quality stocks within the S&P 500 index.\nThe potential drawback for each of these investments is that you might not see the outsized growth that riskier stocks could provide. In addition, past performance does not determine future results. If you have limited funds, this could be unappealing: more modest returns won't seem to add much when you don't have much to begin with.\nHowever, reinvested dividends and compound growth add up. Investing is not gambling, and the reason to invest rather than go to a casino is that prudent, patient, and disciplined investing is how most investors get ahead.\nHow Much Money Do I Need To Start Investing in Stocks?\nThe amount needed depends on the brokerage firm and the investments you're interested in. Some online brokerages have no minimum deposit requirements, allowing you to start investing with a small amount of money. However, the price of individual stocks and the minimum investment for certain mutual funds or ETFs might require you to start with a high initial investment. That said, there are many brokerages and investment options now for those starting with less to invest than there were a decade or two ago.\nAre Stock Funds Good for Beginner Investors?\nStock funds, including mutual funds and ETFs that invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, are a good option for beginner investors. They offer diversification, which helps spread risk across different stocks, and are managed by professional fund managers. In addition, stock funds allow beginners to invest in a broad range of stocks with a single investment, making it easier to get started without having to pick individual stocks. While you watch your mutual fund or ETF investment over time, you will also gain experience about the ebb and flow of the stocks these funds hold, which will help you when investing later.\nWhat Are the Risks of Investing?\nInvesting is a commitment of resources now toward a future financial goal. There are many levels of risk, with certain asset classes and investment products inherently much riskier than others. It is always possible that the value of your investment will not increase over time. For this reason, a key consideration for investors is how to manage their risk to achieve their financial goals, whether short- or long-term.\nDo I Have To Live in the U.S. To Open a Brokerage Account?\nTo open a brokerage account, you don't have to live in the U.S. Many U.S. brokerage firms accept international clients. However, the application process and requirements will differ, including the need for additional documentation, such as proof of identity and residence. There are also some investments and services regulations curtailed for those who aren't U.S. citizens, but the experience is very similar. Most major online brokerages in the U.S. accept international clients.\nHow Do Commissions and Fees Work?\nSome brokers charge customers a commission for every trade. Due to commission costs, investors generally find it prudent to limit the total number of trades they make to avoid spending extra money on fees. Certain other types of investments, such as exchange-traded funds, may carry additional fees to cover fund management costs.\nThe Bottom Line\nBeginners can start investing in stocks with a relatively small amount of money. You'll have to do your homework to determine your investment goals, risk tolerance, and the costs of investing in stocks and mutual funds. You'll also need to research brokers and their fees to find the one that best fits your investment style and goals. Once you do, you\u2019ll be well-positioned to take advantage of the potential stocks have to reward you financially in the coming years."

      "text": "What Is Panic Selling?\nPanic selling is a widespread selloff of a stock, a sector, or an entire market due to fear, rumor, or overreaction rather than reasoned analysis.\nOften, panic selling is due to an outside event that is interpreted as a negative signal. This fear causes some investors to overreact and sell. The selling snowballs as the price drops, causing other investors to take action to prevent greater losses. That's known as a positive feedback loop.\nStock exchanges temporarily halt trading when panic selling reaches a specified level in an attempt to break this cycle of fear and selling.\nKey Takeaways\n- Panic selling is the sudden, widespread selling of one or many stocks based on fear rather than reasoned analysis.\n- Panics are often triggered by news events that shake investor confidence in a single stock or industry.\n- Most major stock exchanges use trading curbs and halts to limit panic selling.\n- Some traders try to identify the \"bottom\" and buy.\nUnderstanding Panic Selling\nPanic selling almost always builds until some investors start liquidating their holdings in hopes of getting out before prices decline further.\nPanic selling is often triggered by an event that decreases investor confidence in a stock or sector. This may be peculiar to a particular company or sector, such as a release of disappointing numbers on sales growth, revenue levels, or earnings. The initial selling is typically triggered by decreased strength in a company's fundamentals.\nThe situation can be amplified when the initial losses reach price points that trigger programmed trading from stop loss orders.\nA significant factor in panic selling can be earlier irrational exuberance. The exuberance can collapse abruptly at the slightest negative signal. Overreaction to news that may have only short-term affects is common.\nMost major stock exchanges use trading curbs and halts to limit panic selling. This allows people to cool off and digest the information. It also limits the downside losses an investor can incur in a single day and restores some degree of normalcy to the market.\nFinancial Market Sell-Offs\nSell-offs that fall short of a panic are a common occurrence in the financial markets. In a sell-off, a particular sector may see widespread selling due to the negative press from only a few companies. Or, the losses in value may be shrugged off as a necessary correction.\nSell-offs also occur broadly across the market when trends in various asset classes are reported. For example, higher yielding treasuries can lead to a sell-off in stocks.\nPost Panic Opportunities\nIn some cases, panic selling and broad market sell-offs can create buying opportunities. This is especially true when selling is caused by short-term indicators or uncertainty.\nThe financial markets are often extremely volatile and views on unfolding events can alter the outlook drastically from day to day.\nMany market traders watch for selling opportunities that may make the investment more attractive at its lower price. In technical analysis, the exhausted selling model is one technique traders can use to identify the price from which a reversal is likely.\nPrices inevitably go through a number of phases as they descend from panic selling, so this model relies on following a stock\u2019s downward trend and identifying the trough buying opportunity.\nWhat Are Some Examples of Panic Selling?\nPanic selling occurred during the market crash of 1929 that set off the Great Depression, again during the 2008 financial crisis preceding the Great Recession, and the Black Monday crash of 1987.\nDoes Panic Selling Always Occur When There Is Crisis?\nNot always. Many times, panic may set in initially, but the markets remain resilient. For instance, the tensions between the U.S. and China that started in 2019 could have deteriorated to a point that caused investors to flee markets en masse, resulting in a precipitous drop in global stock markets. The onset of the COVID19 pandemic in early 2020 also initially caused markets to crash before rallying back to new highs. Or, Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which had just a muted impact on the markets,\nAre Flash Crashed Panic Selling?\nWhile people may indeed panic when there is a flash crash, these sudden price drops are most often caused by algorithmic trading programs that automatically sell prices at progressively lower prices for one reason or another. Since computers do not have emotions like panic, it cannot be categorized as such.\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.

      "text": "It's essential for investors to manage the behavioral impulses that can come from following the market's ups and downs. Nevertheless, investors seem to have a knack for piling into investments at market tops and selling at the bottoms, whether due to fear of missing out (FOMO) or fear generally. Behavioral finance experts also point to a range of irrational patterns that traders can fall into.\nBelow, we'll describe the different kinds of investors you might be and then show you how to combat the patterns that lead to emotional investing.\nKey Takeaways\n- Investing based on emotion (greed or fear) is the main reason so many people buy at market tops and sell at bottoms.\n- Underestimating the risk associated with investing is one reason investors sometimes make bad decisions based on emotion.\n- During periods of market volatility and rising interest rates, investors often move funds from riskier stocks to lower-risk, fixed-rate securities.\n- Dollar-cost averaging and diversification are two approaches that investors can implement to make consistent decisions not driven by emotion.\n- Staying the course through short-term volatility is often the key to longer-term success as an investor.\nWhich Kind of Investor Are You?\nWe're all far more complicated than any personality test will reveal. Still, it's helpful to begin by asking what kind of investor we might be, since that will help us understand our emotional vulnerabilities when investing. Most investors exhibit traits from multiple categories, and your investing personality may evolve. But an honest self-assessment is a good place to begin:\n1. The Anxious Conservative\nThis investor prioritizes safety above all else. While prudence is valuable, too much fear can lead to missed opportunities and portfolios with returns that don't keep pace with inflation.\nConservative investors often sell at market bottoms out of panic and may wait too long to re-enter the market, missing the recovery phase where significant gains typically occur.\nSelf-sabotage correctives: Using automated investment plans that prevent you from attempting to time the market. Consider setting a rule to never sell more than a preset percentage of your portfolio during market downturns.\n2. The Overconfident Risk-Taker\nThese investors believe they can time the market or pick winning stocks consistently (few do). Overconfidence often leads to excessive trading, too much invested in high-risk assets, and avoiding any acknowledgment of past mistakes by concentrating only on \"wins.\" During bull markets, these investors might double down on risky positions, only to face devastating losses when markets correct.\nSelf-sabotage correctives: Put strict position-size rules in place\u2014e.g., no single position worth more than 5% of your portfolio\u2014and keep a detailed investment journal documenting your rationale for each decision. You should review this journal quarterly to assess your actual success rate.\n3. The Pack Follower\nEasily influenced by media hype and water cooler conversations, the pack followers chase whatever is the hot thing on Reddit right now\u2014cryptocurrency one year, tech stocks the next. This reactionary approach typically results in buying high and selling low, as these investors arrive late to trends and exit after significant corrections have already occurred.\nSelf-sabotage correctives: You might put in place a \"waiting period\" (e.g., 30 days) before allowing yourself to act on a new investment idea so your initial excitement about it has time to fade. You can also limit yourself to a fixed monthly investment no matter the market conditions\u2014which is called dollar-cost averaging (anyone putting a set amount of each paycheck into a retirement account is doing this). Below we compare this strategy to trying to time the market:\n4. The Perfectionist\nThese investors are paralyzed by the quest for the \"perfect\" investment or entry point, making the perfect the enemy of the good. They may keep too much cash on the sidelines waiting for an ideal moment that never comes, or sell winning positions too early for fear of giving back gains.\nThe perfectionist's emotional challenge is accepting that successful investing doesn't require perfection, just consistency.\nSelf-sabotage defense: Set clear trigger points for action (e.g., \"I will invest 20% of my available cash when the market drops 5%\") and use trailing stop-losses instead of trying to manually time exits. Being mostly right over time is still far better than being paralyzed by indecision. Below is a diagram for a trailing stop-loss, along with tabs for other kinds of orders that can help offset some of the hasty decisions that can lead to emotional investing.\n5. The Distracted Delegator\nThis investor knows they should pay attention to their portfolio, but finds financial matters either intimidating or boring. They might reactively follow recommendations without understanding them or leave accounts unmonitored for years. When market volatility eventually catches their attention, they're prone to making dramatic, emotionally-driven changes rather than thoughtful adjustments.\nSelf-sabotage defense: Consider working with a financial advisor or using a robo-advisor that provides guardrails to prevent letting your portfolio languish for too long. Schedule semiannual calendar reminders for portfolio reviews that include specific questions to answer, rather than just checking account balances.\nA good advisor (robotic or human) will help you do the work of rebalancing your portfolio, which the distracted delegator hasn't likely done in years:\nThe Psychology Behind Our Investment Decisions\nBehavioral finance, the study of psychological influences on investors and markets, provides some answers as to why many smart investors make calamitous decisions with their portfolios. Some key cognitive biases affecting our decision-making include the following:\nHow Your Personality Reacts to Market Cycles\nYour investor personality doesn't exist in a vacuum\u2014it interacts with market conditions to create predictable patterns of behavior. Here are some examples:\nBull Markets:\n- The over-confident risk taker becomes increasingly reckless, taking on excessive risk.\n- The pack follower frantically jumps between hot sectors, always arriving late as institutional investors and the \"smart money\" are taking their gains.\n- The perfectionist stands by, frustrated, watching others profit while awaiting the \"perfect\" entry.\nBear Markets:\n- The anxious conservative feels validated and may cash out completely, selling a discount and missing out on gains once the market goes back up.\n- The distracted delegator finally pays attention, often making panic-driven decisions.\nTip\nOne reason many investors fall into emotional investing is because they've lost sight of what their portfolio is ultimately for. \"I think a lot of people tend to equate their self worth with their income, or because of social media, which can pressure people to make it look like they're doing better than they are. And because of that, people feel bad,\" said Amy Morin, Verywell Mind\u2019s editor-in-chief.\nYour Personal Action Plan\nOnce you're aware of your tendencies, you'll want to work on a concrete plan. Here are some steps you might take to harness your investor personality rather than being controlled by it:\n- Identify your dominant investor type(s) from the personalities described earlier.\n- Implement counterbalancing strategies for your specific types. These targeted approaches will help neutralize your particular emotional vulnerabilities.\n- Create a written investment policy statement outlining your financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and the conditions under which you'll buy or sell investments.\n- Make yourself accountable by sharing your investment plan with a trusted friend, family member, or financial advisor who can help keep you on track during emotional market periods.\n- Schedule quarterly reviews focused on whether you're adhering to your plan, not on market performance.\nLong-Term Strategies for Outlasting Your Emotions\nWhile market emotions can feel overwhelming in the moment, the antidote is surprisingly straightforward: adopting a long-term investment approach. There's a salutary benefit: for many investors, this means gaining more by doing less.\nResearch consistently shows that investors who trade frequently underperform those who maintain a patient, methodical approach. Research in the Journal of Financial Issues, which analyzed 30 years of S&P 500 data, compared dollar-cost averaging against three different strategies for timing the market. The researchers found that dollar-cost averaging beat out these strategies\u2014and was outperformed only by a trading strategy meant to mimic having perfect foresight of market moves.\nDalbar's annual Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior report is well known for continually testing the average equity investor's returns versus the S&P 500 Index over the previous 20 years. In many years, the gap has been higher than 3%. In its 2025 report, Dalbar found the differences below, which would amount to about $130K less in your portfolio from emotional investing if you began the period with $100K.\nThree time-tested strategies help investors maintain a long-term perspective regardless of their personality type:\nDollar-Cost Averaging: Consistency Over Timing\nExperts say the key to successful dollar-cost averaging is unwavering consistency. Set the strategy and commit to it regardless of market headlines or short-term performance.\nThis approach works particularly well in 401(k) plans with employer matching, where fixed contributions from each paycheck create a disciplined investment pattern reinforced by employer contributions.\nTip\nThe most effective long-term strategies remove the need for frequent decisions. Automation\u2014whether through scheduled investments, target-date funds, or professionally managed accounts\u2014helps create a barrier between your emotions and your investment decisions.\nDiversification: Protection Through Variety\nDiversification\u2014spreading investments across different types of assets\u2014provides a time-honored defense against emotion-driven decisions. When your portfolio includes a variety of investments that don't all move in the same direction simultaneously, the emotional impact of any single market movement is reduced.\nTrue diversification extends beyond just holding different stocks. It means diversifying across these allocation types:\n- Different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, cash)\n- Various market sectors (technology, healthcare, consumer goods)\n- Geographic diversity (domestic and international markets)\n- Investment styles (growth, value, income)\n- A modest allocation to alternative investments (real estate, commodities)\nHow Do I Identify My Investor Personality Type?\nPay attention to your emotional reactions during significant market moves. Your thought patterns during both gains and losses reveal your type. Examining your past investment decisions is also telling\u2014look for recurring mistakes or emotional triggers.\nHow Can One Measure the Level of Fear or Greed in the Stock Market?\nThere are several market sentiment indicators one can look at, but the Cboe's VIX index specifically measures the implicit level of fear or greed in the market by looking at changes in the expectation of volatility of the S&P 500.\nHow Can I Make It Easier Not To Panic During Extreme Volatility?\nCreate a market volatility response plan before you need it. Write down specific actions you'll take at different market thresholds (e.g., \"If the market drops 10%, I'll rebalance but not sell\"). During periods of volatility, you might even limit how much you watch or read in the financial media to avoid panic-inducing headlines.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe most successful investors aren't necessarily the most knowledgeable\u2014they're often the most disciplined. By identifying your investor personality type and understanding how psychological biases affect your decisions, you can then use strategies that protect your portfolio from your emotions. Dollar-cost averaging, diversification, and automated investment plans can act as guardrails against the emotional reactions that lead most investors to buy high and sell low."

      "text": "Most new investors sabotage their own success before they even get started\u2014not through bad luck, but through predictable mistakes that you can easily avoid. Whether it's jumping into hot stock tips without research, putting off investing because retirement seems too far away, or forgetting that taxes and fees can silently erode your returns, these common pitfalls can cost you thousands of dollars and years of potential growth.\nBelow, we'll help you sidestep these traps.\nKey Takeaways\n- Make sure you identify your goals, timelines, and risk tolerance before investing so you avoid emotional decisions that hurt your returns.\n- A key mistake many make is not diversifying by putting their money into just a few stocks or other assets.\n- Newer investors often overlook expenses and taxes that'll become due later, which can cut their returns.\n1. Not Actually Investing\nIf you invest through a retirement plan at your workplace, your contributions are automatically invested. However, many people hesitate to get started and put it off, leaving their money in savings accounts that yield little in interest.\n\u201cYou need to pick the investments,\u201d Dinon Hughes, a certified financial planner (CFP) and partner at Nvest Financial, told Investopedia. Otherwise, your money probably will sit in cash, earning little. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this more times than I\u2019d care to share,\u201d he said.\nEspecially when you\u2019re young, retirement is far off, and you\u2019re juggling other expenses, it can be easy to put off saving and investing. However, \u201ca small amount makes a big difference long term,\u201d said Jack Heintzelman, director of wealth management at Boston Wealth Strategies.\nTip\nYou can't sidestep your emotions entirely, so many investors create systems that help them keep their investing decisions more rational when the markets get volatile. For example, you can set up automatic investments so you keep buying during market downturns. Others give themselves a waiting period\u201424 to 48 hours, for example\u2014before acting on any stock tip or investment idea to provide them with time for research and to avoid the emotion of the moment.\n2. Not Having an Investment Plan\nWithout an investment plan that identifies your goals, it\u2019s easy to overreact, invest reactively, or underestimate risk, said Nathan Sebesta, CFP and owner of Access Wealth Strategies. For example, investors acting without a plan may jump into investments that carry more risk than they can reasonably manage.\nConversely, investors who develop a plan that considers their objectives, timeline, risk tolerance, and their contribution amounts are better positioned to achieve many of their goals, said Mike Casey, CFP and president of American Executive Advisors.\n3. Letting Emotions Drive Your Investment Decisions\nWhen stock prices drop and news headlines scream about market crashes, it's natural to feel anxious and want to sell everything to cut your losses. \"It can feel uncomfortable,\u201d Casey said. But panic selling often happens at exactly the wrong time\u2014when prices are low and recovery is on the horizon.\nAnother emotional trap works in reverse during rising markets. When everyone around you is talking about their investment wins, or when a co-worker shares what seems like a can't-miss tip, the fear of missing out can push you to make hasty decisions. But Casey noted that acting without doing due diligence can mean buying a stock that\u2019s peaked and is about to decline, or one that doesn\u2019t fit your specific goals.\nRelated Stories\n4. Not Planning for Taxes\nTaxes can eat into your investing returns, but they're easy to forget as you worry about setting up your investment account. With a traditional 401(k) or individual retirement account (IRA), you get an immediate tax deduction for your contributions, and your investments grow tax-deferred until retirement. This means more of your money stays invested and compounds over time, rather than being siphoned off to pay annual taxes, Heintzelman said.\nRoth IRAs work differently but have their own advantages: You contribute after-tax dollars, but all future growth is tax-free. For younger investors, especially, this can result in decades of tax-free compounding that dramatically boosts long-term wealth.\n5. Not Diversifying\nSome investors buy stocks in a few well-known companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and hope for the best, said Luke Harder, a CFP at Claro Advisors. However, individual companies are exposed to risks, such as the emergence of new competitors that eventually hurt their business.\nThe easiest way to diversify is through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that automatically spread your money across hundreds or thousands of companies. Instead of trying to pick the next big winner, you're essentially betting on the market's long-term growth\u2014a much safer and historically reliable strategy for building wealth.\n6. Not Reviewing Fund Expenses\nWhile mutual funds, ETFs, and similar vehicles can help you diversify, it\u2019s important to check their expenses. \u201cThey can be very, very high,\u201d Harder said. Generally, an expense ratio of more than about 0.4% for a fund is getting expensive, he said.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe biggest investing mistake beginners make isn't picking the wrong stocks\u2014it's not getting started at all. Every day you delay investing is a day you miss out on compound growth that can't be recovered later. You can start now, even with a smaller investment of $50 or $100 per month. After that, there\u2019s no rush: Investing is a \u201cget rich slowly\u201d endeavor, Hughes said.\nTo get going, you'll want to create a clear plan with specific goals, diversify through low-cost index funds rather than trying to pick individual winners, and maximize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. By avoiding these common mistakes and staying focused on your long-term goals, you'll avoid letting emotions and fees sabotage your financial future."

      "text": "Most investors are aware that the market undergoes periods of both bull runs and downturns. So what happens during periods of extreme market volatility? Making the wrong moves could wipe out previous gains and more.\nBy using either non-directional or probability-based trading methods, investors may be able to protect their assets from potential losses and may be able to profit from rising volatility using certain strategies.\nKey Takeaways\n- In financial markets, volatility refers to the presence of extreme and rapid price swings.\n- Given increasing volatility, the possibility of losing some or all of an investment is known as risk.\n- Directional investing, a strategy practiced by most private investors, requires the markets to move consistently in the desired direction.\n- On the other hand, non-directional investing takes advantage of market inefficiencies and relative pricing discrepancies.\n- Volatility allows investors to reconsider their investment strategy.\nVolatility vs. Risk\nIt's important to understand the difference between volatility and risk before deciding on a trading method. Volatility in the financial markets is the quantification of the speed and magnitude of an asset's price swings. Any asset that sees its market price move over time, has some level of volatility. The greater the volatility, the larger and more frequent these swings are.\nRisk, on the other hand, is the possibility of losing some or all of an investment. There are several types of risk that can lead to a potential loss, including market risk (i.e., that prices will move against you).\nAs the volatility of the market increases, market risk also tends to increase. In response, there can be a marked increase in the volume of trades during these periods and a corresponding decrease in the holding periods of positions. In addition, hypersensitivity to news is often reflected in prices during times of extreme volatility as the market overreacts.\nThus, increased volatility can correspond with larger and more frequent downswings, which presents market risk for investors. Luckily, volatility can be hedged away to some degree. Moreover, there are ways to actually profit directly from volatility increases.\nHedging Against Volatility\nPerhaps the most important thing for most long-term investors is to hedge against downside losses when markets turn volatile. One way to do this, of course, is to sell shares or set stop-loss orders to automatically sell them when prices fall by a certain amount. This, however, can create taxable events and, moreover, removes the investments from one's portfolio. For a buy-and-hold investor, this is often not the best course of action.\nInstead, investors can buy protective put options on either the single stocks they hold or on a broader index such as the S&P 500 (e.g., via S&P 500 ETF options). A put option gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to sell shares of the underlying as a set price on or before the contract expires.\nSay that XYZ stock is trading at $100 per share and you wish to protect against losses beyond 20%. You can buy an 80 strike put, which grants the right to sell shares at $80, even if the market falls to, say, $50. This effectively sets a price floor.\nImportant\nNote that if the stock never falls to the strike price by its expiration, it will simply expire worthless and you would lose the premium paid for the put.\nTrading Volatility\nInvestors who wish to take a directional bet on volatility itself can trade ETFs or ETNs that track a volatility index. One such index is the Volatility Index (VIX) created by CBOE which tracks the volatility of the S&P 500 index. Also known as the \"fear index,\" the VIX (and related products) increase in value when volatility goes up.\nYou may also consider buying options contracts to profit from rising volatility in addition to hedging your downside. Options prices are closely linked to volatility and will increase along with volatility. Because volatile markets can lead to swings both upwards and downwards as prices gyrate, buying a straddle or a strangle are popular strategies. These both involve simultaneously buying a call and a put on the same underlying and for the same expiration. If prices move a great deal, either strategy can increase in value.\nWarning\nBecause of the way VIX exchange-traded products are constructed, they are not intended to be long-term investments. Rather, they are meant to make short-term bets on volatility changes.\nNon-Directional Investing\nMost investors engage in directional investing, which requires the markets to move consistently in one direction (which can be either up for longs or down for shorts). Market timers, long or short equity investors, and trend followers all rely on directional investing strategies. Times of increased volatility can result in a directionless or sideways market, repeatedly triggering stop losses. Gains earned over years can be eroded in a few days.\nNon-directional equity investors, on the other hand, attempt to take advantage of market inefficiencies and relative pricing discrepancies. Importantly, non-directional strategies are, as the name implies, indifferent to whether prices are rising or falling, and can therefore succeed in both bull and bear markets.\nEquity-Market-Neutral Strategy\nThe principle behind the equity-market-neutral strategy is that your gains will be more closely linked to the difference between the best and worst performers than the overall market performance\u2014and less susceptible to market volatility. This strategy involves buying relatively undervalued stocks and selling relatively overvalued stocks that are in the same industry sector or appear to be peer companies. It thus attempts to exploit differences in those stock prices by being long and short an equal amount in closely related stocks.\nHere is where stock pickers can shine because the ability to pick the right stock is just about all that matters with this strategy. The goal is to leverage differences in stock prices by being both long and short among stocks in the same sector, industry, nation, market cap, etc.\nBy focusing on pairs of stocks or just one sector and not the market as a whole, you emphasize movement within a category. Consequently, a loss on a short position can be quickly offset by a gain on a long one. The trick is to identify the standout and the underperforming stocks.\nTip\nVolatile markets make risk control measures such as stop losses even more important.\nMerger Arbitrage\nThe stocks of two companies involved in a potential merger or acquisition often react differently to the news of the impending action and try to take advantage of the shareholders' reaction. Often the acquirer's stock is discounted while the stock of the company to be acquired rises in anticipation of the buyout.\nA merger arbitrage strategy attempts to take advantage of the fact that the stocks combined generally trade at a discount to the post-merger price due to the risk that any merger could fall apart. Hoping that the merger will close, the investor simultaneously buys the target company's stock and shorts the acquiring company's stock.\nRelative Value Arbitrage\nThe relative value approach seeks out a correlation between securities and is typically used during a sideways market. What kinds of pairs are ideal? They are heavyweight stocks within the same industry that share a significant amount of trading history.\nOnce you've identified the similarities, it's time to wait for their paths to diverge. A divergence of 5% or larger lasting two days or more signals that you can open a position in both securities with the expectation they will eventually converge. You can long the undervalued security and short the overvalued one, and then close both positions once they converge.\nWhat Causes Market Volatility?\nIn general, market volatility increases when there is greater fear or more uncertainty among investors. Either can result from an economic downturn or in response to geopolitical events or disasters. For instance, market volatility rose due to the credit crisis in 2008-09 that led to the great recession. It also spiked when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\nWhat Investments Track the VIX Volatility Index?\nFutures on the VIX trade on the CBOE and are available to customers of some brokerages. For those who do not have access to futures, there are also ETFs and ETNs, including the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX), the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures ETN (VXZ), and the ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (VIXY).\nWhat Is Probability Based Investing?\nIn addition to hedging, one can also look to fundamental analysis to understand the risk of an individual stock. Even with liquid and pretty efficient markets these days, there are times when one or more key pieces of data about a company are not widely disseminated or when market participants interpret the same information differently. That can result temporarily in an inefficient stock price that's not reflected in its beta. Holders of that stock are thus implicitly taking on additional risk of which they are most likely unaware.\nProbability-based investing is one strategy that can be used to help determine whether this factor applies to a given stock or security. Investors who use this strategy will compare the company's future growth as anticipated by the market with the company\u2019s actual financial data, including current cash flow and historical growth. This comparison helps calculate the probability that the stock price is truly reflecting all pertinent data. Companies that stand up to the criteria of this analysis are therefore considered more likely to achieve the future growth level that the market perceives them to possess.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe first thing to do in a turbulent market is to step back and examine your purpose for investing. It's hard not to panic when the market goes down or to become an ostrich and do nothing, but neither furthers your goals. Market volatility offers more opportunities to profit in a short amount of time, but it also brings more risk."
