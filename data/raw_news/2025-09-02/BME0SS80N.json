  "content": "VIENNA \u2014 The United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog said Tuesday that its inspectors found traces of uranium at a site in Syria believed to be part of a clandestine nuclear program by the former government.\n\nSyria under former President Bashar Assad is believed to have operated an extensive undeclared nuclear program, which included an undeclared nuclear reactor built by North Korea in eastern Deir el-Zour province.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, previously told The Associated Press that some of Syria\u2019s activities \u201cwere, in the judgment of the agency, probably related to nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nLast year, IAEA inspectors visited and took environmental samples at \u201cthree locations that were allegedly functionally related\u201d to the Deir el-Zour site, and \u201canalysis revealed a significant number of anthropogenic natural uranium particles in samples taken at one of the three locations,\u201d IAEA spokesman Fredrik Dahl said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSome of these uranium particles are consistent with the conversion of uranium ore concentrate to uranium oxide,\u201d he said. This would be typical of a nuclear power reactor.\n\nGrossi reported these findings to the agency\u2019s board of directors Monday in a report on developments in Syria.\n\nThe Deir el-Zour site only became public knowledge after Israel - which is believed to be the Middle East\u2019s only state with nuclear weapons, although it has not declared its own program - launched airstrikes in 2007 destroying the facility. Syria later leveled the site and never responded fully to the IAEA\u2019s questions.\n\nAn IAEA team in visited some sites of interest last year while Assad was still in power. After Assad\u2019s fall, the new government led by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa agreed to cooperate with the agency and again provided inspectors access to the site where the uranium particles had been found.\n\nThey took more samples there and \u201cwill evaluate the results of all of the environmental samples taken at this location and the information acquired from the planned visit to the (Deir el-Zour) site, and may conduct follow-up activities, as necessary,\u201d Dahl said.\n\nIn an interview with the AP in June during a visit to Damascus, Grossi said al-Sharaa had expressed an interest in pursuing nuclear energy for Syria in the future.\n\nA number of other countries in the region are pursuing nuclear energy in some form. Grossi said Syria would most likely be looking into small modular reactors, which are cheaper and easier to deploy than traditional large ones.\n\nHe also said that IAEA is prepared to help Syria rebuild the radiotherapy, nuclear medicine and oncology infrastructure in a health system severely weakened by nearly 14 years of civil war.\n\nThe Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and Outrider Foundation.

  "summary": "The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has found traces of uranium at a site in Syria believed to be part of a clandestine nuclear program by the former government under former President Bashar Assad. The site, located in eastern Deir el-Zour province, was destroyed by Israel in 2007 after it launched airstrikes on it. The International Association of the United Nations (IAAEA) confirmed that some of Syria's activities were likely related to nuclear weapons. The new government led by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa provided inspectors access to the site where the uranium particles were found.
