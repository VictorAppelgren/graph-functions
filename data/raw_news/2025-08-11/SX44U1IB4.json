  "description": "The MacBook Air 13-inch with an M2 chip is now on sale for just $699 at Best Buy, an amazing deal.",
  "content": "Whether you\u2019re going back to college or just need a new MacBook, now seems to be the time to buy. Rare Apple deals are popping up everywhere as the school bells start to ring and shoppers are making tariff-affected decisions. Let\u2019s look at just one of these deals today, and a darn good one at that. Presently, you can get a 13-inch MacBook Air Laptop with an M2 chip for just $699. That\u2019s a new MacBook for under $700, and a savings of $100 off the usual $799. Tap the button below to see it yourself, or keep reading to remind yourself of the capabilities of the M2 chip, as well as see more about what the laptop is capable of in full.\n\nWhy you should buy the MacBook Air M2\n\nDespite what Apple may want you to think, it\u2019s the numbers that make up a laptop. This 13-inch MacBook Air M2 Laptop has 16GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage, and a battery life that goes up to 18 hours. All for less than $700 while this deal is on. Then there\u2019s the 2560 x 1664 resolution screen (which will look great on 13-inches), Thunderbolt ports, and even a (rare for Apple) headphone jack. Great, great, and great.\n\nClearly, this laptop has good stats. One thing that may worry you, however, is the fact that it has an M2 chip. The latest MacBooks have an M4 chip, after all. But is 2 really half of 4? Not necessarily. Beyond our Apple M2 chip explainer, which explains that the chip supports up to 24GB of RAM (among other stats), there\u2019s an incredibly great resource that compares the M2 vs the M3 chip. While there\u2019s a lot of nitty gritty, the key line is this: \u201cThere\u2019s much less of a difference between the M3 MacBook Air and the M2 MacBook Air than in the previous generation jump.\u201d You\u2019re still getting incredibly quality from the MacBook Air M2, beyond what numbers may suggest.\n\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip at $699 is undoubtedly a good deal. And, it\u2019s yours (along with the $100 in savings off of the usual $799 price) if you tap the button below. Alternatively, check out these other amazing laptop deals if you want to scout for something outside of the Apple ecosystem.",

      "text": "Despite being over two years old, Apple\u2019s MacBook Air M2 has remained one of the best laptops you can buy, as well as one of the best MacBooks. It\u2019s incredibly well-built, exuding an elegance that few other laptops can match. It\u2019s also plenty fast for productivity users, and its GPU is optimized for creators. Its keyboard, touchpad, and display are all top-notch.\nEnter the MacBook Air M3, which came out in early 2024. In theory, it took the place of the M2 MacBook Air, but Apple kept that older model around in the lineup at a cheaper price. While the M3 MacBook Air has faster performance, particularly in GPU-intensive apps, and the M3 model supports an additional external display (with the display closed). It\u2019s $100 more, but is that uptick in price justified? Here\u2019s how to decide which MacBook Air is right for you.\nSpecs and configurations\n| Apple MacBook Air M3 | Apple MacBook Air M2 | |\n| Dimensions | 11.97 inches x 8.46 inches x 0.44 inches | 11.97 inches x 8.46 inches x 0.44 inches |\n| Weight | 2.7 pounds | 2.7 pounds |\n| Processor | Apple M3 (8-core) | Apple M2 (8-core) |\n| Graphics | 8 GPU cores 10 GPU cores |\n8 GPU cores 10 GPU cores |\n| RAM | 16GB 24GB |\n16GB 24GB |\n| Display | 13.6-inch 16:10 Liquid Retina IPS 2560 x 1664 | 13.6-inch 16:10 Liquid Retina IPS 2560 x 1664 |\n| Storage | 256GB SSD 512GB SSD 1TB SSD 2TB SSD |\n256GB SSD 512GB SSD 1TB SSD 2TB SSD |\n| Touch | No | No |\n| Ports | 2 x USB-C with Thunderbolt 4 1 x 3.5mm audio jack |\n2 x USB-C with Thunderbolt 4 1 x 3.5mm audio jack |\n| Wireless | Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 | Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 |\n| Webcam | 1080p | 1080p |\n| Operating system | macOS Sonoma | macOS Sonoma |\n| Battery | 52.6 watt-hours | 52.6 watt-hours |\n| Price | $1,099+ | Buy at Best Buy |\n| Rating | 4 out of 5 stars | 4 out of 5 stars |\nDespite the fact that we\u2019re still waiting for the M4 MacBook Air, Apple did provide an update to its MacBook Air lineup in late 2024. Alongside the M4 MacBook Pro, the M3 and M2 MacBook Air both now start with 16GB of RAM. The 8GB RAM models have been removed from the lineup, without charging extra for the additional memory. That\u2019s a fantastic change, especially since it used to cost $200 upgrade to 16GB.\nSo, yes, now the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air starts at $1,099, coming with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The M2 MacBook Air is only sold in the 13-inch form factor, starting at $999. That also gets you 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Other than that, the two models have all the same configurations available, including up to 24GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.\nWith that considered, you need to be very careful when buying either of these configurations. Both are being sold at third-party retailers for as much as $150 off these days, but don\u2019t accidentally buy an 8GB model.\nDisplay and ports\nBoth laptops offer the same display, a 13.6-inch IPS display running at 2560 x 1664 and pumping out up to 500 nits of brightness. In our testing of the MacBook Air M2, the display provided very good color width at 100% of sRGB, 90% of Adobe RGB, and 100% of DCI-P3, with very good accuracy at a Delta-E of 1.08 (1.0 or less is indistinguishable to the human eye). The MacBook Air M3\u2019s display is every bit as strong.\nOne very important change to the MacBook Air M3 is its support for two external displays when the lid is closed. That\u2019s a significant improvement over the MacBook Air M2, which only supported one external display with the lid open or closed. While the MacBook Air M3 is also limited to a single external display when the built-in display is in use, the ability to use two high-resolution (up to 5K at 60Hz) displays when the lid is closed will please those who want more screen real estate. For some people, that alone is a reason to spend extra money on the new model.\nIt should be noted that if you open the lid of the M3 MacBook Air, it will automatically shut off one of your external monitors. That means you won\u2019t be able to use the MacBook Air keyboard and touchpad in this setup \u2014 you\u2019ll need to use external peripherals. There are also reports that performance is reduced while the lid is closed due to thermal restraints.\nI\u2019ll also mention wireless connectivity here, as it\u2019s one of the only other changes between these two laptops. The M3 MacBook Air gets the upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E, whereas the M2 is still on Wi-Fi 6. It\u2019s not a huge difference, but rather some future-proofing to make sure you get the highest internet speeds if you plan to upgrade your router anytime soon.\nPerformance\nOf course, the most significant change is the Apple Silicon M3 chipset upgrade, which provides a significant uptick in performance thanks to a switch to a 3nm process. In Geekbench 6, the M3 was 19% faster in single-core performance and 20% faster in multi-core. That is a significant increase and will provide significantly faster productivity performance.\nIn the Cinebench R24 GPU test, the improvement was more stark. The M3 GPU was 76% faster than the M2 GPU, thanks to various improvements that include built-in hardware mesh shading support and ray tracing and the new Dynamic Caching memory system. We didn\u2019t test either chipset using any live games, but Apple says the new chipset\u2019s graphics provide up to 60% faster frame rates in No Man\u2019s Sky over the M1 and up to a 60% improvement in Final Cut Pro. In our own testing, the M3 MacBook Air should be capable of playing many AAA games.\nFinally, the M3 has a faster 16-core Neural Engine that should help speed up AI functionality. That\u2019s an increasingly important specification, and it makes the MacBook Air M3 more competitive with laptops using the Intel and AMD Neural Processing Units (NPUs).\n| Geekbench 6 single/multi |\nCinebench R24 (GPU) | |\n| Apple MacBook Air (M2) |\n2,606 / 10,024 | 1737 |\n| Apple MacBook Air (M3) |\n3,102 / 12,078 | 3,049 |\nPortability\nBoth laptops are very small and relatively light machines that will fit into any backpack and won\u2019t wear you down. There\u2019s no difference between the two in their portability \u2014 but they\u2019re two of the thinnest laptops you can buy right now.\nThe MacBook Air M2 has excellent efficiency and some of the best battery life in a 13-inch laptop today. We saw 18 hours of web browsing and 21 hours looping our test video, which is twice as long as the Windows laptop average. You\u2019ll get not just all-day longevity but battery life that lasts well into a second day of typical use. The M3 MacBook Air is every bit as long-lasting at around 19.5 hours of web browsing.\nDesign\nThe MacBook Air M3 retains the stunningly thin CNC-machine aluminum chassis at just 0.44 inches thick and weighing 2.7 pounds. The display bezels are small, thanks to a controversial notch in the display for the webcam, making for a pleasantly dense and very small laptop. The chassis is solid and exudes quality, while the lid is just the tiniest bit bendable. Note that the MacBook Air M3 also has a 15-inch model that\u2019s incredibly thin at 0.45 inches and light at 3.3 pounds.\nThe same colors are available as before, including Silver, Starlight, Space Gray, but now there\u2019s a new option in Midnight. The more fingerprint-resistant (almost) black color first debuted on the M3 MacBook Pro, and is now available on the MacBook Air as well. Aside from the new color, the MacBook Air M3 and M2 are identical in appearance \u2014 and gorgeous. Few laptops offer the same elegance and fastidious design.\nThe Magic Keyboard remains in place with its large keycaps, plenty of key spacing, and the same snappy, precise switches that aren\u2019t the deepest around but are still the most comfortable. The Apple Force Touch haptic touchpad is the same size and provides the best haptics on a laptop, thanks to the additional functionality provided by the Force Click feature.\nWired connectivity is also the same, with dual USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 support and a 3.5mm audio jack. Power is provided by a MagSafe 3 connection that protects against accidental spills and keeps the USB-C ports available when charging. The webcam is also unchanged, providing the same 1080p resolution and software tools.\nIs the M3 MacBook Air really worth it?\nThere\u2019s much less of a difference between the M3 MacBook Air and the M2 MacBook Air than in the previous generation jump. The two laptops look identical (minus the Midnight color option) and offer a very similar overall package. In the past, only $100 separated the M2 MacBook Air from the M1 MacBook Air despite having a completely different design.\nSo yes, the MacBook Air M2 remains a great laptop for $999 if your budget is tight \u2014 especially since it\u2019s often selling for as low as $750. That\u2019s a great price for an M2 MacBook Air, so long as you\u2019re getting the 16GB model. It\u2019s the one that most people should buy if you\u2019re considering a purchase right now.\nWhile the M3 model is also selling for a good price these days, I would recommend waiting until the M4 MacBook Air comes out. It\u2019s not rumored to launch until early 2025, but it should provide a more meaningful jump in performance over the M2. It should also force prices on the M3 MacBook Air to drop even further.\nStill not certain? Here\u2019s how to decide which Mac to buy and which model is right for you."

These shopping events always live up to their reputation, as you can get powerful laptops for extremely low prices. For student laptop deals, you should also think about buying a new laptop during the back-to-school season, as there will be major discounts on devices that are geared towards learning.\nThere are many other sales over the year that slash the prices of laptops, and retailers are using any holiday as a reason to do so. If you\u2019ve got your sights set on a certain laptop, check the calendar to see if the next holiday is coming up. If you can, it\u2019s highly recommended that you wait until then because there\u2019s a chance that the device\u2019s price goes lower. It may not get as cheap as Black Friday or Cyber Monday, but when buying a new laptop, you should welcome any form of savings as you can use that cash towards other purchase like accessories, software, and subscriptions.\nYou should also be aware of any new laptop models that are on their way. Most brands reveal these fresh devices well ahead of their actual launch, and when that happens, their predecessors usually have their prices reduced. If you\u2019re fine with a previous-generation device \u2014 and let\u2019s face it, sometimes the gap between generations isn\u2019t that huge \u2014 then you should consider waiting for opportunities like this one.\nWhile there are lots of chances for you to get a new laptop for cheaper than usual, sometimes, you just can\u2019t wait. If the laptop that you\u2019re using already broke down, if there\u2019s an upcoming project that requires a faster device, if you need an upgrade right now, or for whatever reason, the good news is hat we\u2019ve got your back with the laptop deals that we\u2019ve gathered above. Some of these prices are close to what you can get them for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday too, so there won\u2019t be much regret if you make the purchase right now.\nHow we chose these laptop deals\nNot all laptop deals are built the same \u2014 how do you figure out which ones are worth it? To help you differentiate the good offers from the bad bargains, we followed a specific set of criteria when we chose the deals that we highlighted here. While the most important factors will be different for each person, these are the ones that everyone should be thinking about when buying a new laptop.\nValue for money\nFirst and foremost, you should be getting amazing value for the hard-earned cash that you spend on a new laptop. If you\u2019re going for a budget-friendly device, you should feel like you\u2019re getting a machine that\u2019s much more expensive, and if you\u2019re thinking about investing in a premium laptop, you shouldn\u2019t be spending more than you should for certain features. A good rule of thumb to follow is to determine how much you\u2019re willing to shell out and get the best laptop deal that you can get for it, and the ones above are excellent examples for their respective prices.\nLatest components\nYou should get the latest components as your budget allows, so the more you spend, the higher your expectation that you\u2019ll be getting the newest generation of processors and graphics cards with your new laptop. It\u2019s a huge bonus if you can get such specifications on a relatively affordable device, so you should be on the lookout for such offers. For the laptop deals that we chose, we want you to enjoy the most powerful performance that your budget allows.\nPurpose\nLaptops have varying designs, features, and specifications because they serve different purposes. A business laptop will focus on boosting your daily productivity, while a gaming laptop wants to run the best PC games without any issues. Figuring out how you\u2019ll mostly use your next laptop will greatly help in choosing the device that you should buy, as you can avoid paying for characteristics that you don\u2019t prioritize. When we chose these laptop deals, we made sure that they cater to multiple types of users, so there\u2019s surely something for you here.\nReliability\nYou wouldn\u2019t want to invest in a laptop that doesn\u2019t pass reliability tests, as a device that breaks down after just a few months is like watching money go down the drain. Going for the most trusted names in the computing industry with the laptop deals that we highlighted above helps ensure that you\u2019ll receive a durable laptop, and if something goes wrong, you\u2019ll get the necessary support for a repair or a replacement.\nPortability\nSome laptops can get pretty bulky \u2014 particularly gaming laptops and high-end workstations \u2014 but they\u2019re still more portable than lugging around an entire desktop computer setup. We don\u2019t want to burden you with unnecessary weight and size though, so we made sure that the laptops that we recommended are still capable of sliding into your backpack so that you can easily take them with you to work or school.\nHow to check you\u2019re getting a good laptop deal\nIt\u2019s easy to just pick the first laptop deals that we see when we go to any website, but we made sure to get the best offers available online. You can confirm yourself that you\u2019ll be getting good deals from any of the bargains above using tools such as CamelCamelCamel and Google Shopping Insights, which will show you the recent spikes and dips in the prices of these laptops. These tools are pretty easy to learn and utilize, so you\u2019ll be getting a nice snapshot of the pricing history of the laptop that you\u2019re interested in buying.\nWe used these tools to come up with this list of laptop deals so that you don\u2019t have to go through the process yourself, but it\u2019s not a problem if you don\u2019t want to take our word for it. We\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll get the same results if you look for the best bargains that are available right now, so once you\u2019re done comparing, feel free to take another look at our recommendations so that you can finally choose your next laptop. You better hurry though, because the more you delay your purchase, the higher the risk of missing out on these discounts that we\u2019ve sniffed out."

      "text": "Best Buy\u2019s Apple Shopping Event ends tomorrow, Sunday, August 10. The MacBook Air M4 is on sale and it\u2019s just what the doctor ordered for professionals and those going back to school. For two more days, you don\u2019t want to miss the Apple Shopping Event at Best Buy where you can get even more great Apple goodies. Since Apple deals en masse are so rare, it\u2019s certainly worth taking a look at everything the sales event has to offer. However, we\u2019ve got two MacBook Air M4 deals that are seemingly identical we think you should look at. They both originally start at $1,199 and drop $200 to $999. But that\u2019s where the similarities stop. Tap the buttons below to see the laptops up close yourself or keep reading to see which one is right for you.\nWhich MacBook Air M4 deal at $999 should you buy?\nIs the bigger laptop better? Not necessarily. The 15-inch version of the laptop has 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage while the 13-inch version has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. That means the real battle here is if you prefer screen space or storage space.\nIf you have access to ample cloud storage and live with near constant access to WiFi, the 15-inch MacBook is likely better for you. That is, unless having a smaller laptop makes it easier to get out and about. If the 15-inch laptop is too big for your bag or purse (it comes out to being 13.4 inches wide side-to-side) then it\u2019s also not going to be that great for you. In that case, the 13-inch laptop is better for you. Anyone that needs access to storage outside of cloud storage, including people that want to have lots of apps running on their machine.\nTap the button below to get the MacBook Air M4 of your dreams while the Best Buy Apple Shopping Event lasts. They\u2019re both marked down to $999 from $1,199, a savings of $200. Alternatively, split the difference between the two sizes and peruse our list of the best 14-inch laptops."

      "text": "Apple has officially announced the M2 chip at its WWDC 2022 keynote. It\u2019s the follow-up to the successful M1 chips that began Apple\u2019s two-year transition to its own silicon for its Macs.\nProducts using these chips aren\u2019t out yet, so there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know, including details about performance and specs. But from both what Apple has announced about the M2 and leaked information about the M2, here\u2019s everything we know so far.\nWhat products are getting the M2?\nIt was widely speculated that the next generation of Apple Silicon would be announced WWDC, and those assumptions were at least partially correct. Apple unveiled a redesigned MacBook Air packed with the M2 chip, and its new look closely resembles the newly revamped MacBook Pros. The 13-inch MacBook Pro will also receive the M2 chip, but Apple didn\u2019t give it the same refreshed design treatment as the MacBook Air.\nIn following with the cycle of the M1, we also expect the M2 to appear in an upgraded Mac Mini and 24-inch iMac.\nBeyond just the base M2, Apple will likely expand upon it for its more powerful options, such as the M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M2 Ultra. These chips are rumored to eventually show up in pro-level products such as the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, Mac Studio, and more.\nPerformance and specs\nWe won\u2019t be able to confirm performance results for the M2 until we\u2019ve reviewed the systems ourselves, but Apple has released some of its own claims about what improvements have been brought to the chip.\nIt\u2019s still features an 8-core CPU, which breaks down into four efficiency cores and four performance cores. This is the same core configuration as what was offered on the M1.\nThe M2 is based on a second-generation N5P process node from TSMC, rather than the rumored N3 node. Reporting indicates that this was due to production delays and lockdowns in China, leaving Apple to use this 5nm node as the basis for the M2. The N5P node offers just a 7% performance improvement over N5 with 15% less power draw, while the true next-gen node, the N3, is said to deliver up to 15% higher performance and 30% lower power draw than the N5.\nUltimately, that means the M2 will offer less of a jump in performance than Apple may have originally wanted.\nThe M2 does include some new features and upgrades that sweeten the deal, though. For example, it now supports up to 24GB of Apple\u2019s unified memory. It also supports 50% more memory bandwidth, up from 50GBps to 100GBps.\nApple has also brought over the same \u201chigh-performance media engine\u201d that\u2019s included in the M1 Pro and M1 Max. That means faster, hardware-accelerated media encoding. Apple also claims its neural engine is up to 40% faster.\nOverall, Apple says the M2 CPU is 18% faster than the M1. But the graphics have gotten an upgrade too. The M2 now features 10 GPU cores, up from 7. Apple says this leads to 35% better graphics performance. This is also strengthened by the improved Metal 3 graphics framework, and even MetalFX Upscaling for improved performance in some games.\nPrice and release date\nOnly two M2 devices have been announced so far: The new MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The M2 13-inch MacBook Air is selling for $1,299, the same as the M1 option when it was released. The M2 MacBook Air is more expensive than its M1 counterpart, starting at $1,199. The M1 MacBook Air started at (and still sells for) $999.\nBoth M2 devices will be available next month, but you can pre-order them now."
