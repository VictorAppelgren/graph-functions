  "title": "Can Nuno, Edu and Evangelos Marinakis fix the mess at Nottingham Forest?",
  "description": "A typically tumultuous 72 hours raised questions over manager's future and doubts still linger over his long-term prospects",
  "content": "As the equaliser went in, Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s coaching staff gathered around him.\n\nIt is something they do after every goal: celebrate as one. It is a show of togetherness and, perhaps more than ever, it is also the kind of unity Nottingham Forest\u2019s head coach needs from elsewhere in the club.\n\nHas it gone beyond that stage? Or is there any way to fix this mess, given that Nuno\u2019s working relationship with Edu, the newly appointed global head of football for Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis\u2019 multi-club empire, has got off to such an alarmingly bad start?\n\nNuno offered a glimpse into his own mindset before the 1-1 draw away to Crystal Palace on Sunday, when he confirmed he wanted to continue as Forest\u2019s coach \u2014 some reports had questioned whether he was trying to engineer his own sacking \u2014 but accepted the three relevant people needed to get together to work this out.\n\nThat meant himself and Edu, principally, and Marinakis, too, as the man who could never have foreseen this drama when the Brazilian, formerly Arsenal\u2019s sporting director, was announced in his new role on July 7.\n\nIt was after Sunday\u2019s match, however, that we learnt more about what Nuno wants to happen next \u2014 \u201cnot only the three of us, all the club has to come together\u201d \u2013 and his tone of voice went up for the first time.\n\nIt was, he said, an \u201cabsurd narrative\u201d to think that his complaints behind the scenes might lead to him resigning in protest or wanting to be sacked. \u201cAbsolute nonsense, absurd, absurd \u2026 never!\u201d he added, even more firmly, before referencing his admiration for a former Palace manager who was still managing at the highest level, at the age of 76, until last year.\n\n\u201cRoy Hodgson, chapeau! Every time I saw Roy working, I used to say: \u2018Wow! Can I do the same?\u2019 I wish I could,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many years I have been coaching now. I love what I do. The moment I do not enjoy it\u201d \u2014 at this, he blew out his cheeks \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nYet Nuno, by his own admission, accepts that his job is in danger and admitted last week \u2014 \u201cwhere there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire\u201d \u2013 that he suspected there was something in the reports that Marinakis was considering sacking him. So, is he really enjoying it?\n\n\u201cOf course, the situation has to be solved,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are responsible people and we are going to have a good conversation to try, more than anything, to create a good platform for what is most important \u2014 the team.\u201d\n\nAnd that question again: can it be fixed? Can he and Edu make up and Forest return to the kind of positive atmosphere that was there, say, six months ago?\n\n\u201cI believe so,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cEveryone wants the best for Forest. Myself, the president (Marinakis), all the club \u2014 we want the best for Forest. During my career, this is the first time I have faced this situation and been asked these things, and it is not helpful. But I believe we have to create harmony. We need it.\u201d\n\nThe strange thing, perhaps, was when Nuno went on to say he was willing to wait. If you thought he might want these talks to happen straight away, that would be wrong. Instead, he talked about the priority for Forest being to bring in three more signings \u2014 a goalkeeper and two full-backs \u2014 ahead of the transfer window closing next Monday, September 1.\n\nAfter that, he said, they could hold the relevant talks: \u201cWe need to have these conversations, and we are going to have them. This is what I think is more important than anything. The players need it, the squad needs it, the club needs it, we need it. And we are going to have it.\u201d\n\nAnd did he feel offended, after everything he has achieved with Forest since his December 2023 appointment, that suddenly his job seemed to be on the line? \u201cThis is how football is. There are things I cannot control. What comes out, the sacking (story), I cannot control.\u201d\n\nBefore heading over to the Forest fans at Selhurst Park to applaud their support after the final whistle, Nuno made a beeline to Morgan Gibbs-White to put an arm around the player\u2019s shoulder and explain why he had taken him off with eight minutes plus stoppage time left to find a winner.\n\nThe bond between Nuno and his team is a close one and, as he acknowledged, over the past few days there has been a lot of understandable confusion for those players.\n\nHis instruction to them was to block it all out and focus on the game. Yet Sunday\u2019s draw, secured by Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s second-half equaliser, took place amid a backdrop of reports stating that Brendan Rodgers, the Celtic manager, or Ange Postecoglou, fired by Tottenham Hotspur earlier this summer, were in the running to replace him. Who could be surprised if the mood in the dressing room had been more subdued than usual?\n\n\u201cWe speak every day,\u201d Nuno said of his players. \u201cFocus, determination, ignore the noise \u2014 this was our message. They are human beings, and everything that happens affects us. But we were able to shield them.\n\n\u201cI have known some of these players since they were 16 years old. What we did last season together (chasing Champions League qualification before finishing seventh to end up in the Europa League \u2014 Forest\u2019s first time in Europe since the mid-1990s) will stick forever in our memories. So this is the responsibility we have to our club: ignore the noise and work hard. And the boys did it well. I hope we can do it again next week; I hope I can do it again next week.\u201d\n\nNuno was subsequently asked whether there had been any contact with Marinakis or Edu since the manager\u2019s public conference last Friday exposed the divide.\n\n\u201cThey were here today,\u201d he said. Edu watched from the stands but Marinakis was conspicuous by his absence on a day Palace fans made it clear they blame Forest\u2019s owner, in part, for their FA Cup winners being demoted from the Europa League place they secured by beating Manchester City at Wembley in May to the third-tier UEFA Conference League.\n\nSome travelling Forest supporters had come to south London prepared with Marinakis masks. Others wore T-shirts celebrating the Greek billionaire. \u201cMarinakis, he does what he wants,\u201d went the song.\n\nAt the same time, there was also a sense of unease among the away fans \u2013 and perhaps also an uncomfortable feeling of deja vu, given the uncertainty around Nuno is not the first time they have had to endure this kind of turbulence in the eight-year Marinakis era.\n\nIn the 2018-19 season, Aitor Karanka was managing Forest in the Championship and popular enough with the public that a #dontsackaitor hashtag was trending on Twitter when it became clear something had gone wrong in his relationship with the club\u2019s hierarchy.\n\nKaranka, like Nuno, had grievances with one of the people above him, in his case Ioannis Vrentzos, then the chief executive and still a director at the club, though he\u2019s now based in Greece.\n\nAs a former Real Madrid player and assistant coach, Karanka had experienced the high politics of life at the Bernabeu. At Forest, though, it wore him down. His wife stopped attending matches because of the atmosphere and, ultimately, he decided enough was enough. In the end, Karanka asked to be released from his contract, even though Forest were just one place outside the play-off positions at the time.\n\nSix years on, Nuno was asked yesterday whether he was confident he would still be the Forest coach come the end of this transfer window next Monday.\n\n\u201cI cannot answer that question,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut what I know is that I am trying to do my job the best I can.\u201d",

      "text": "The question every Nottingham Forest fan would like answering is: how has it come to this? And the answer goes back to the appointment earlier this summer that owner Evangelos Marinakis believed would help take the club to the next level.\nWhen Marinakis announced the appointment of Edu, formerly Arsenal\u2019s sporting director, as Forest\u2019s new transfer guru, he was entitled to think of it as a significant coup for a club their size. Just check out the wording of the official announcement. Forest were \u201cproud\u201d to confirm Edu\u2019s arrival, read the club\u2019s statement \u2014 not just pleased, or delighted, but proud.\nNottingham Forest is proud to announce the appointment of Edu Gaspar as Global Head of Football, a newly established leadership role overseeing football operations.\n\u2014 Nottingham Forest (@NFFC) July 7, 2025\nUnfortunately for Forest, one man was not quite so enamoured: Nuno Espirito Santo, the manager who has led Forest back into Europe for the first time in 30 years and, unreported until now, has had a spectacular fallout with Edu behind the scenes.\nNuno\u2019s relationship with Edu started badly and, since then, it has deteriorated to the point where there is an acceptance at the City Ground that the damage is potentially irreparable. Edu arrived with Kia Joorabchian, the influential businessman and football advisor, as his close ally. The manager has made his feelings clear, particularly about Edu, both to the man himself and others at the club.\nAdvertisement\nIt is personal, deeply personal, between himself and Edu and perhaps the most worrying aspect for Forest fans is that, as things stand, it is difficult to see the two men making up. Of the two, Nuno has largely been the aggressor, outspoken in the extreme. Edu has been staying away from the club\u2019s training ground.\nThis has been bubbling away for the past two months and has clearly put Marinakis in a difficult position, to say the least, when two of the most important people at the club are not even on speaking terms.\nOn the one hand, Nuno is a highly respected and popular coach who has come to be adored by the club\u2019s supporters and was widely touted last season as a potential winner of manager-of-the-year awards.\nDon\u2019t forget that Nuno also signed a new contract on June 20, two and a half weeks before Edu was confirmed as the global head of football for Marinakis\u2019 empire \u2014 Forest, Greek club Olympiacos and Portuguese team Rio Ave. Marinakis saw the Brazilian as a brilliant appointment and expected his manager to adapt to a new working environment.\nSo what does Marinakis do when it becomes clear Nuno has taken against Edu and, even more troublingly, has suddenly chosen to direct his anger \u2014 or at least part of it \u2014 towards the club during a series of deliberately aggressive press-conference statements?\nFirst of all, let\u2019s go back to Nuno\u2019s interview with Sky on Wednesday last week when he went public for the first time about his grievances with the club\u2019s recruitment over the summer.\nForest, he said, had a \u201cmajor problem\u201d. It had been a bad pre-season, Nuno continued, expressing his irritation about how long everything was taking to come together. He talked about being \u201cworried\u201d and described Forest as \u201cvery, very far\u201d from where they needed to be.\nNuno did not mention Edu by name. Everyone, however, at the top level of the club, from Marinakis down, knew who it was directed towards \u2014 and that there was more to it than just the club\u2019s transfer business.\nAdvertisement\nThat interview was not supposed to be out until the weekend (though parts of it were released on Friday) and it was not a coincidence that Forest suddenly stepped up their transfer activity on Thursday and Friday.\nOmari Hutchinson arrived from Ipswich Town in a club-record \u00a337.5million transfer, followed by striker Arnaud Kalimuendo from French club Rennes and Manchester City\u2019s James McAtee. Then, on Thursday evening, Douglas Luiz arrived on loan from Juventus, with an obligation to buy.\nIn doing so, the PR narrative changed considerably from what it would have been had Nuno\u2019s comments gone out before the flurry of new signings. Everything had been overtaken and, while Nuno\u2019s comments were obviously concerning, the good news outweighed the bad. Or that, at least, was how it would have seemed to anyone not understanding the politics behind the scenes.\nIn reality, the rift still existed.\nMarinakis, moreover, could probably be forgiven for taking Nuno\u2019s comments personally, given how generous the Forest owner has been, financially, when it comes to transfer spend.\nIt is no exaggeration to say Forest were stunned by Nuno\u2019s comments \u2014 not just what he said, but the fact he looked visibly angry \u2014 and his timing to go public in this way for an interview that was meant to go out 24 hours before their first game of the season.\nAs it turned out, the mood was soothed by Forest\u2019s 3-1 win over Brentford and a performance that suggested Nuno\u2019s team might be in for another exciting season. Again, though, nothing has changed in the context of how Nuno sees Edu and the wider effect it is having on the club.\nAt his latest press conference, Nuno described his relationship with Marinakis as having changed and went public that they were \u201cnot so close\u201d anymore. And that, in a nutshell, is because Marinakis has aligned himself with Edu.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI have always had a very good relationship with the owner,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cLast season was very, very close, (we spoke) almost on a daily basis. This season, not so well. I always believed that dialogue and what you say, or your opinions, are always valid. Because my concern is the squad and the season that we have ahead of us.\n\u201cOur relationship has changed. It\u2019s not so close. It\u2019s not on a daily basis. It\u2019s not good, everyone at the club should be together but it\u2019s not the reality.\u201d\nFor context, this follows a concerted attempt by the club to pour cold water on reports from abroad, starting early on Friday, that Marinakis was considering sacking him. Instead, Nuno chose to go public again, surely knowing that Marinakis would take it as a personal affront. When asked about the reports, the 51-year-old replied: \u201cWhere there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire, so I know how things work, but I\u2019m here to do my job.\u201d\nBeing a manager in the Marinakis empire is a challenging job, as Steve Cooper and various others can testify. Behind the scenes at Forest, there is often conflict at the highest level. Some of the people who have been prominently involved since Marinakis\u2019 takeover in 2017 positively encourage it.\nAt the same time, this is a troubling situation for everyone at the City Ground and the speed at which relations have unravelled, or started to unravel, has been startling. And to a degree, it is easy to sympathise with Marinakis on this occasion. Plainly, he could never have realised that Nuno would take against the new man from virtually day one. Yet, at the very first meeting, there were hostilities. It blew up almost immediately.\nAre there more politics involved? Nuno is represented by Jorge Mendes, who at one stage could legitimately be described as Marinakis\u2019 go-to agent in the transfer market.\nYet Mendes has not been involved in any Forest transfer since Eric da Silva Moreira arrived from St. Pauli in June 2024, and these days it is very much an operation that has Joorabchian at the heart of what they do.\nAdvertisement\nJoorabchian, an Iranian-born businessman, is best known for looking after Carlos Tevez during the Argentine\u2019s brilliant yet often controversial playing career, including spells with West Ham United, Manchester United and Manchester City.\nJoorabchian has had a string of other top-level clients and was closely involved in the past with Everton, Reading and Manchester City. He also represents Hutchinson and Douglas Luiz and was partly involved in the deal that saw Anthony Elanga move to Newcastle United for \u00a352m earlier this summer.\nEdu sees him as a close ally, and so does Marinakis. In the last year or so, Joorabchian has become increasingly involved with Marinakis in a number of business interests, spending millions of pounds on racehorses with associates that include the Greek billionaire.\nHas that put Mendes\u2019 nose out of joint? Possibly, but The Athletic\u2019s information is that Mendes plays no significant part in the latest drama and it is far more the case that Nuno views his relationship with Edu as broken. Joorabchian is a big part of the modern Forest, but it all starts with the Nuno-Edu dynamic \u2014 what should be the second most important relationship within the club.\nCan it be fixed? Every Forest fan would hope so, and every player, too, because it is undoubtedly the case that Nuno is popular within the dressing room.\nFor now, though, this is a story of politics, tension, male pride and suspicion that has suddenly propelled Nuno to the top of the bookmakers\u2019 lists when it comes to the next Premier League manager to be sacked. It is also the case that questions are being asked about whether Friday morning\u2019s reports of a potential sacking were leaked deliberately to crank everything up just before Nuno\u2019s weekly press conference.\nIt is not a healthy situation and, one week into the new Premier League season, the supporters who have grown to love Nuno must be shocked by how quickly in football \u2014 and Forest, in particular \u2014 the mood can change.\n(Top pictures: Getty Images)"

I\u2019m the first one to be concerned.\u201d\nThis is Forest\u2019s first transfer window following the arrival of new global head of football Edu, who officially joined on July 7 after leaving his role as sporting director at Arsenal in November last year.\nAdvertisement\nGlobal head of football is a newly created position that sees the 47-year-old oversee \u201crecruitment, performance, squad strategy, and player development.\u201d\nNuno has been at Forest since December 2023, when he replaced Steve Cooper as head coach. After finishing 17th in 2023-24, the Portuguese oversaw a seventh-place finish last season which secured a return to European football for the first time since 1995.\n(Justin Tallis/AFP via Getty Images)"

      "text": "The English FA will investigate a banner displayed by Crystal Palace fans showing Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis holding a gun to the head of midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White.\nThe banner was displayed in the Lower Holmesdale Stand, where the Holmesdale Fanatics supporters\u2019 group sits, at Selhurst Park during Sunday\u2019s Premier League game between the sides. It was not shown during Sky Sports\u2019 UK broadcast of the match.\nAdvertisement\nOn the banner, Gibbs-White is shown with a speech bubble next to him reading: \u201cMr Marinakis is not involved in blackmail, match-fixing, drug trafficking or corruption!\u201d\nMarinakis has always strongly denied any wrongdoing in relation to these allegations.\nAs well as Gibbs-White, the banner also depicts Marinakis holding a briefcase overflowing with cash; what appears to be a UEFA delegate standing behind bags which read \u201ccorrespondence\u201d with the UEFA and Forest badges on; former Palace minority shareholder John Textor as a clown; and a ship with Marinakis\u2019 name on \u2014 the Greek businessman is the founder and chairman of Capital Maritime & Trading Corp.\nOn the Palace website, in a statement which ends with \u201cPublished by The Football Association Premier League Limited\u201d, the club say, \u201cBanners must not contain foul language, be defamatory or contain political or offensive slogans and the club reserves the right to turn banners away if the content is felt to be offensive in any way.\u201d\nWhen contacted by The Athletic, the Premier League indicated the incident was a matter for the FA. Palace and Forest were approached for comment. The Holmesdale Fanatics declined to comment.\nAhead of the game, Palace said on social media that they \u201cwould like to remind supporters that acts of discrimination, including inappropriate chanting, violence and entering the field of play, will not be tolerated at Selhurst Park\u201d.\nGibbs-White signed a new contract at Forest in late July, having been the subject of bids from Tottenham Hotspur and appearing set to have a medical at the north London club. The Athletic reported that Gibbs-White had a key 30-minute meeting with Marinakis before committing his future to Forest until 2028.\nTensions between Palace and Forest have grown over the summer after the former was demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League \u2014 with the latter promoted as a result \u2014 having been found to have breached UEFA\u2019s multi-club ownership rules. UEFA\u2019s decision to demote Palace was upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) earlier this month.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2021, a banner displayed at Selhurst Park by the Holmesdale Fanatics was the subject of a police investigation. That banner was on display when Newcastle United faced Palace, shortly after the north-east club\u2019s takeover, which was largely funded by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF). The banner took aim at the Premier League\u2019s owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test, and the Croydon Metropolitan Police said it had been reported as \u201coffensive\u201d.\nExplaining the Palace-Forest tensions\nIn the aftermath of Palace\u2019s demotion, their chairman Steve Parish did a round of media interviews in which he intimated that someone else had been behind the punishment.\n\u201cWe\u2019re led to believe that\u2019s the issue,\u201d said on The Rest Is Football podcast, when asked by host Gary Lineker if Forest had \u201cplayed a part\u201d in the process. \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t someone who wanted to get in as a consequence, then there wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\nThis was in reference to a letter that Forest had written to UEFA about the issue, which they have always insisted was a matter of them simply seeking clarity about which competition they would be in this season, so they could plan accordingly. Forest also say the letter was sent when UEFA was already investigating Palace\u2019s status amid a crackdown on these rules, which had already seen European football\u2019s governing body kick Irish side Drogheda United and Slovakia\u2019s DAC 1904 out of the Conference League for similar breaches.\nNevertheless, Forest\u2019s owner Marinakis, along with former Palace minority shareholder John Textor \u2014 whose controlling stake in French side Lyon had been the trigger for Palace\u2019s demotion \u2014 and UEFA, became the focus of Palace fans\u2019 ire.\nAt their first three games of this season \u2014 the Community Shield at Wembley, the goalless Premier League draw away to Chelsea and the first leg at home against Fredrikstad \u2014 Palace fans displayed a banner with the words \u2018UEFA MAFIA\u2019 on a version of the body\u2019s logo with a Euro symbol replacing the map of Europe, and also chanted \u201cF*** UEFA, f*** John Textor, f*** Marinakis.\u201d It\u2019s clear who they blame for the situation, and it\u2019s not anybody in the current Palace hierarchy.\n(Top photo: Richard Pelham/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Nottingham Forest head coach Nuno Espirito Santo has denied he wants to leave the club \u2014 but admitted that his relationships with global head of football Edu and owner Evangelos Marinakis need to improve.\nAs revealed by The Athletic on Friday, Nuno\u2019s relationship with Edu \u2014 who officially joined Forest on July 7, having stepped down as Arsenal director of football \u2014 has deteriorated to the point where the damage is potentially irreparable.\nEdu has been staying away from the club\u2019s training ground amid a deeply personal rift between the pair, who have clashed over the club\u2019s summer transfer business.\nNuno also admitted at his latest press conference that his relationship with Marinakis has worsened since last season.\nAsked by Sky Sports ahead of Forest\u2019s visit to Crystal Palace on Sunday if communication with Edu and Marinakis needed to improve, Nuno said: \u201cYes. That\u2019s what we need to do and we\u2019re going to do it.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cToday for sure not, because it\u2019s the match. But soon of course. There\u2019s no speculation around anything. What we have (to do) is to communicate and approach the final days of the market how we\u2019re going to approach the season (and) prepare our boys.\u201d\nAt a news conference after Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw, Nuno was asked if he was confident he would still be at Forest come the end of the transfer window.\n\u201cI cannot answer that question,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut what I know is that I am working and trying to do my job the best I can.\u201d\nWhen asked if he thought the situation could get back to being harmonious, the head coach said: \u201cI believe so. Everyone wants the best for Forest. Myself, the president, all the club\u2026 we want the best for Forest.\n\u201cI believe we have to create harmony. We need it.\u201d\nSpeaking last week, Nuno admitted his relationship with Marinakis had \u201cchanged\u201d and was not \u201cso close\u201d as last season, when he said they spoke every day.\nThose comments came a week after he said his \u201cunbalanced\u201d side had a \u201cmajor problem\u201d ahead of the start of the new season, and were \u201cvery, very far\u201d from where they need to be.\nNuno\u2019s recent outspokenness has led to suggestions that he is trying to engineer a way out of the City Ground, which he strongly denied on Sunday.\n\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense, that doesn\u2019t make any kind of sense,\u201d the Portuguese said. \u201cThe state is that we\u2019re focussed on the game. That\u2019s more important. We have to make sure the players are ready to play. This game is going to be very tough.\u201d\nPushed on whether he definitely wanted to continue, he replied: \u201cOf course. Of course.\u201d\nForest completed four transfers since Nuno claimed they had a \u201cmajor problem\u201d: the club-record signing of Omari Hutchinson from Ipswich Town, Arnaud Kalimuendo from Rennes, Manchester City\u2019s James McAtee and Douglas Luiz, on loan with an obligation to buy, from Juventus.\nAdvertisement\nThey were added to the earlier summer arrivals of Dan Ndoye, Igor Jesus, Jair Cunha and Angus Gunn.\nGlobal head of football is a newly created position at Forest that sees Edu, 47, oversee \u201crecruitment, performance, squad strategy, and player development\u201d.\nNuno has been at Forest since December 2023, when he replaced Steve Cooper as head coach. After finishing 17th in 2023-24, Nuno oversaw a seventh-place finish last season which secured a return to European football for the first time since 1995.\nHe signed a new three-year contract in June.\n(Top photo: Richard Pelham/Getty Images)"
