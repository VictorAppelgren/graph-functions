  "title": "Best AT&T Deals: Save Up to $1,100 on a New Phone",
  "description": "AT&T can help you score a coveted iPhone 16 series phone, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and other top models for less or even free.",
  "content": "Most people get the best phone they can afford from a trustworthy brand, such as Apple or Samsung. So, it's imperative to find a deal to maximize savings. Carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T are known for offering various top-rated phones for less with a trade-in or new line. Their deals are the perfect way to save hundreds on an Apple, Samsung or Google phone. They also offer discounts for teachers, first responders and military employees. Our dedicated shopping team at CNET has searched AT&T to find the best deals, which we've rounded up below. We consistently monitor the carrier's deals, so check back often.\n\nIt's worth noting that carriers constantly update their deals. AT&T has some compelling offers available, though the best deals often require a subscription to an AT&T unlimited plan. In general, the very best offers usually drop around the holidays or right after new phone launches (February or March for Samsung Galaxy S phones; September for Apple iPhones; fall for Google Pixel phones), but AT&T also tends to offer some solid bargains year-round.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nThough some manufacturers, particularly Apple and Samsung, offer deals on their own websites and stores, most users look to carriers to buy new devices.\n\nMany of AT&T's phone deals are available to new and existing customers, though trade-ins are often required to get the advertised prices. It's worth noting that these deals are split across 36 months of bill credits, meaning you'll need to remain an AT&T customer for at least three years to pay off the phone. If you cancel before that period is over, you'll be responsible for any remaining charges.\n\nIf you're looking to switch to AT&T, there are a few deals on various plans that might make you lean toward one or the other. Promotions on plans are less common these days, though oftentimes, you can get some free extras (like streaming service subscriptions and music subscriptions) with enrollment in some of the higher-end 5G plans from each carrier. AT&T, however, no longer offers free streaming services to new subscribers who don't already have it on their plans.\n\nAT&T includes 5G access with all of its plans; the biggest difference for most users on its latest plans is the amount of hotspot data. There are also differences in the amount of \"high-speed\" data, though even on its cheapest Starter plan, AT&T says it will slow your speeds \"temporarily\" only if you're in an area where the network is \"busy.\"\n\nAs for savings, your employer might also offer a corporate discount on plans, but you will need to check with them to see if that applies to personal accounts. AT&T also offers a host of discounts depending on your profession.",

      "text": "There are five models in Apple's current iPhone 16 lineup, and we tested and reviewed them all. Each has a different appeal, depending on your needs and budget. The $829 iPhone 16 gets you new buttons for shortcuts, an additional camera and MagSafe. Then there's the $999 iPhone 16 Pro, which has a new camera and a bigger screen. The $599 iPhone 16E is the most affordable. It has the same chip as the iPhone 16, along with a single rear camera, but it lacks Apple's most notable features, like MagSafe charging. Please note that we expect the iPhone 17 series to be revealed in September. So it might be best to hold off on buying any new iPhone until then.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat's the best iPhone right now?\nThe best iPhone for most people is the $799 iPhone 16. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger, 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps.\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and creating summaries of messages and web pages. There's also ChatGPT integration with Siri. The phones have an Action button, too, which can be programmed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at.\nBest iPhones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings\n- Photographic Styles makes photos pop\n- Ultrawide camera is better in low light\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t out yet\n- No always on display\n- No changes to wired charging speeds\n- No upgrades to the Action button\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.\nWho it's best for\nWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don\u2019t need the Pro\u2019s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won\u2019t disappoint.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.\nPros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $1,000\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.\nThe phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.\nWhy we like it\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech.\nPros\n- Does most of the Apple stuff I want\n- Battery life is great\n- Matte finish back\n- The rear camera is good\n- A18 chip performance\nCons\n- $599 price isn't cheap\n- Odd value proposition\n- Lacks MagSafe\n- Screen is good, but wonder how it will age\nApple took a Taco Bell-like approach with the $599 iPhone 16E, mixing and matching parts and features from prior phones to create a \"new\" iPhone. Its design and screen are similar to the iPhone 14. Its A18 processor is the same as the one in the iPhone 16. In my testing, I found that this gives the iPhone 16E a weird value proposition. It's new, but it's old. It's affordable, but not cheap.\nIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters. I do recommend looking into carrier deals, discounts and trade-ins to drop that price a bit, unless you're set on doing an installment plan over a couple of years. Read our iPhone 16E review.\nWhy we like it\nAfter testing the iPhone 16E, I was most surprised by how wonderfully uneventful it was to use. Along with all the standard iOS 18 functions and goodies, like iMessage and FaceTime, I used Apple Intelligence, made calls on 5G, took a bunch of share-worthy photos and videos and played video games like Resident Evil 4. If this is all you want in an iPhone, look no further.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the day plus battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters.\nWho shouldn't get it\nChoosing between the $829 iPhone 16 and the $599 16E is a tough choice. If you have the budget, I'd go with the regular 16. You get a brighter screen, MagSafe, and an ultrawide camera that doubles as a macro lens -- great for taking close-up photos like of food since the main camera automatically switches to a cropped version of the ultrawide in order to nail focus.\nPros\n- USB-C port is more convenient charging\n- Colorful matte design\n- Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\n- Dynamic Island brings better multitasking\nCons\n- No always-on display\n- Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\n- Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\n- Galaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.\nThe iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone.\nWho it's best for\nThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.\nWho shouldn't get it\nApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy.\nThe iPhone 16 is the recipient of a CNET Editors' Choice award, and you can get one for free when you switch to T-Mobile. You just need to sign up for a qualified Experience Beyond Plan with up to four lines. There's no trade-in required, and T-Mobile will pay off your current eligible phone, up to $800, via a prepaid Mastercard. It\u2019s never been easier to switch. (New line and port-in are required, and a $10 device activation charge applies.)\nBest iPhone models compared\n| Product | Apple iPhone 16 | Apple iPhone 16 Plus | Apple iPhone 16E | Apple iPhone 16 Pro | Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max | Apple iPhone 15 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556 x 1,179 pixel resolution; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.7-inch OLED; 2,796 x 1,290 pixel resolution; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED display; 2,532x1,170 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz adapative refresh rate | 6.9-inch OLED; 2,868 x 1,320 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz adapative refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556x1,179 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 6.33 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches | 5.78 x 2.82 x 0.31 in. | 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches | 6.42 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches | 2.82x5.81x0.31 inches |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8mm | 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8 mm | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm | 163 x 77.6 x 8.25mm | 71.6x147.6x7.8 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 170 g (6 oz.) | 199 g (7.03 oz.) | 167g (5.88 oz.) | 199 g (7.03 oz.) | 227 g, (7.99 oz.) | 171g (6.02 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 17 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 5x telephoto | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 5x telephoto | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K |\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Apple A18 | Apple A18 | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A16 Bionic |\n| RAM + storage | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM unknown + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | RAM N/A + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) |\n| Battery | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

The $599 price is more than Apple's previous cheap phone, the $429 iPhone SE, but it has a similar appeal especially for those currently on an older iPhone.\nFactors to consider when buying a new iPhone\nHold the iPhone first: You may love or hate the way it looks and feels in person.\nDon't discount the last year's model: Apple has a history of keeping recent iPhone models from previous years around at a lower price. You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a new iPhone 16 can do for a fraction of the price. The iPhone 15 packs a great camera and a big battery, but comes at a more reasonable price.\nBuy an iPhone case and screen protector: You'll protect your iPhone from costly damage, and will increase the phone's resale or trade-in value for when you're ready to move on.\nKnow what you care about most: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? Phones like the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, for example, pack incredible cameras that almost rival the quality you'd get from a DSLR. If you're a photographer, then spending money here is a good idea.\nSeek out holiday discounts: Look for deep discounts and promo deals around major holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday. And find out what your grace period is in case you need a quick return or exchange.\nHow we test iPhone models\nWe test every iPhone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new iOS updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for the iPhone, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K 120fps slow-mo video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long the iPhone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test and a 45-minute drain test starting with a full battery, which isn't always included in the initial review and added later in an update.\nPerformance measuring\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos and videos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of the iPhone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. Some of these tests are added later in updates after the initial review is published.\nRead more: How CNET Tests Phones\nOther iPhones we tested\nWhile Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review.\nKey terms\neSIM\nAn eSIM takes all of the important information about your phone account -- including its number, wireless carrier and subscription -- and stores it in software instead of on a physical SIM card.\nWith the iPhone 14, 15 and 16 series Apple removed the physical SIM card tray and embraced embedded SIM cards in the US. This means you can't just pluck your SIM card out of your current phone and put it into a new one. But this shouldn't affect your experience since all the major US carriers and a number of smaller operators work with eSIM.\nApple has long supported eSIM, dating back to 2018's iPhone XS, XS Max and XR. When setting up a new iPhone 14, 15 or 16, tthe device will guide you through transferring your current provider over to the new phone. A list of supported wireless networks can be found on Apple's website.\niOS 18\nApple's iOS 18 is the latest iPhone software version. It's on the iPhone 16 by default and is also available as an update for the iPhone XR and later. iOS 18 includes new features such as being able to move apps anywhere on your home screen, change an app icon's color and a size, add buttons to Control Center, use emoji and live photo stickers as Tapbacks in Messages, support for RCS in messages and eventually Apple Intelligence on some models.\niPhone FAQs\nWhen is the best time of year to buy a new iPhone?\niPhone or Android?\nShould I wait for the new iPhone model (iPhone 17)?\nHow reliable is an iPhone?\nHow long does an iPhone last?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nThere's already been plenty of buzz about what we could see with the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 17 -- from a slimmer version of the upcoming device to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on baseline models. The camera module could also get a makeover, and reports suggest Apple will overhaul the look and feel of its software with the launch of iOS 19. Apple doesn't release details on future products, but to get an idea of what to expect, we rounded up rumors, leaks and analysis on the iPhone 17 Air (one of several nicknames for Apple's next iPhone). Read CNET's iPhone 17 rumor roundup for more info."

      "text": "There are quite a few things you'll need to consider when choosing a cell carrier, including the coverage in your area and which plan makes the most sense for you. But you should also take a look at the deals being offered. Whether it's a free phone or a few bucks off your monthly bill, they can often help you lock in some significant savings. And T-Mobile has some incredible options to choose from.\nHowever, these offers typically come loaded with red tape and fine print, which can make it pretty tough to take advantage of them. To help spare you the headache, we've detailed some of T-Mobile's best deals below. Just note that the details of these deals change fairly often so don't wait too long or you could miss out.\nBest T-Mobile phone deals\nMany of T-Mobile's phone deals are available to new and existing customers, although trade-ins are often required to get the advertised prices. Keep in mind the deals are split across 24 months of bill credits, meaning you must remain a T-Mobile customer for at least two years for the phone to be paid off as the terms state. If you cancel before that period is over, you'll be responsible for any remaining charges.\nT-Mobile is offering many trade-ins and new-line discounts on the iPhone 16 series. Exchanging your old phone will save you up to $1,000 if you have an Experience Beyond plan, which scores you the basic iPhone 16, 16 Plus or 16 Pro free. People on an Experience More plan can get up to $830 off when they trade in an old device for a free basic iPhone 16. Those on most other plans will get up to $300.\nT-Mobile is also offering savings when you switch your number over from another eligible carrier. Switching to an Experience Beyond plan will save you $1,000, and an Experience More plan will save you $830.\nYou can also save up to $830 with a new line and a trade-in on most plans. There are special offers for military members, first responders and folks older than 55 as well.\nWith the new Galaxy S25 Edge available, there are now four models in Samsung's S25 lineup and you can score some serious savings when you order yours through T-Mobile. Those on an Experience Beyond or Go5G Next plan can get the basic Galaxy S25 or S25 Plus free, or save up to $1,000 on the S25 Edge and Ultra when trading in an eligible device. Those on an Experience More or Go5G Plus plan will save up to $800 and those on most other plans can save up to $500.\nIf you're adding a line of service, you'll get $800 off if you choose an Experience More or Go5G Plus plan, or $600 off for most other plans. Both a trade-in and a new line will save you up to $800.\nIt's not too late to take advantage of some preorder savings on Samsung's brand-new foldables. If you trade in an old phone, you can save up to $1,100 (getting you the basic Z Flip 7 free) if you're on an Experience More or Go5G Plus plan, $1,000 if you're on an Experience Beyond or Go5G Next plan or $500 off for most other plans.\nThose activating a line will save $1,100 with the Experience More or Experience Beyond plans, $800 with the Go5G Plus plan or $600 for most other plans.\nT-Mobile only has the basic Pixel 9, 9A and 9 Pro XL available right now but is offering savings on all three models. You can save up to $1,000 with either a new line or a trade-in if you're on an Experience More or Experience Beyond plan. Those on other plans will save $600 with a new line or up to $500 with an eligible trade-in.\nYou can also get a free pair of Google Pixel Buds A-Series or save $100 on the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 with your purchase.\nThe iPhone 16E is Apple's new budget-friendly model and there are plenty of ways to grab one for less at T-Mobile. If you're trading in an eligible device, you can save up to $1,000 if you're on an Experience Beyond plan, which will score you any storage configuration free. And you can still save up to $830 if you have an Experience More plan or up to $300 for most other plans. You'll also get one free with an eligible trade-in and the activation of a line. Plus, switching your number over from another carrier saves you $630. Exclusive discounts for military members, first responders and people older than 55 also are available.\nThis sleek 2025 Motorola can be yours for a lot less. You can get up to $1,000 off with a trade-in if you subscribe to the Experience More or Experience Beyond plans. If you don't want to upgrade plans, those on most other plans will still get $600 off with a new line or up to $500 off with a trade-in.\nBest T-Mobile plan deals\nIf you're looking to switch to T-Mobile, there are a few deals on various plans that might help you decide. Promotions on plans are less common these days, although often you can get some free extras, like streaming service subscriptions, music subscriptions and extra travel data, with enrollment in some of the higher-end 5G plans from each carrier, including T-Mobile.\nCustomers who are looking to move to T-Mobile and sign up for three lines of service will be happy to hear that the carrier is offering a buy two, get one free promotion, meaning the third line won't cost you anything. This offer is available to those on its Essentials, Experience More or Experience Beyond plans.\nT-Mobile offers active-duty military, veterans and first responders $5 off the cost of monthly service with autopay, bringing the overall cost down.\nT-Mobile has several discounted plans for people aged 55 and older. Essentials Choice 55 offers two unlimited lines for $60 per month ($30 per line), and the Experience More 55 plan is $100 per month for two lines. If you want the Experience Beyond 55 plan, it's $65 per line for two lines or $130 per month total. The Experience More and Beyond plans also come with free bonuses, such as a one-year AAA membership and a free Netflix subscription."

For a novel design, you can opt for Samsung's pricier foldable phones, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 -- or even its super slim Galaxy S25 Edge. If you need a cheaper option, Samsung's $200 Galaxy A15 5G or Galaxy A26, A36 and A56, which range from $300 to $500, might be a good fit. Check out our roundup to find the phone that best fits your needs.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat is the best Samsung phone?\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra -- priced at $1,300 -- comes packed with maximum features which, for most people, is more than necessary. For the rest of us, the $800 Galaxy S25 is a standout among its Galaxy counterparts. It has the same Snapdragon customized chip and RAM as the S25 Ultra, runs the same version of Android and costs $500 less.\nThe Galaxy S25 has a very capable triple rear camera setup that is versatile in capturing both bright outdoor scenes and candid moments inside under mixed lighting. Overall, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is ideal for Android fans who prioritize fast performance, versatile cameras and a spacious, bright screen.\nHow to pick the right Samsung phone for you\nDeciding which Samsung phone is right for you comes down to what you want in a phone and how much you're willing to spend. If you want the largest screen available on a standard Samsung phone, enjoy note-taking with a stylus and need a camera with a significantly closer zoom, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the right choice. You'll also have to spend $1,300 unless you score a trade-in deal.\nThose who don't need the stylus, prefer more compact phone and still want a good camera should consider the Galaxy S25 or Galaxy S25 Plus. If you just want the basics, like a spacious screen, 5G and a decent camera, consider the Galaxy S24 FE. Those looking for the flashiest tech around -- and who also have deep pockets -- should consider the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7 or even the slightly cheaper Z Fold 7 FE.\nFinding the best Samsung phone will ultimately come down to preference. Choosing among so many options can get complicated, so here's how to decide which Samsung phone is best for you. Refer to our phone buying guide for more tips on how to choose the right device.\nBest Samsung phones in 2025\nPros\n- Best screen on any phone\n- Versatile cameras\n- Most powerful phone I've tested\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- $1,300 price\n- Design is almost too minimal\n- AI features are hit-or-miss\n- S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.\nIf you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nWhy we like it\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\nPros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life\n- More AI features feel practical\nCons\n- Several gimmicky AI features\n- Not many changes over the S24\nThe Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\nAnd while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.\nWhy we like it\nHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.\nPros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\nWhy we like it\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll rarely need to open the phone -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the Galaxy S25 Ultra might be a better fit.\nPros\n- The 6.9-inch screen is immersive, with lovely colors and contrast\n- The 4.1-inch screen looks incredible\n- It's durable and survived a drop onto concrete\n- One UI 8 (Android 16) runs wonderfully\n- $1,100 is still a lot, but Samsung gives the phone more value than the Flip 6\nCons\n- Gets warm when recording videos and playing games\n- Battery life is the same as the Flip 6 despite a bigger battery\n- Cover screen software has room to grow\nWhen I first got my hands on Samsung's new Galaxy Z Flip 7, I was delighted to discover that it has a smaller crease, larger cover screen, thinner design and bigger battery compared to last year's Galaxy Z Flip 6. But as I tested the new clamshell phone, I became enthralled by its inner screen. At 6.9 inches, this is the biggest screen on any Samsung phone aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has an 8-inch foldable display.\nThe Z Flip 7's large screen size makes content feel more immersive and colors look lovely and vivid. This led to epic TikTok and Instagram sessions, watching widescreen films such as A Working Man and Back to the Future, as well as jumping back and forth between two apps stacked vertically on the screen thanks to One UI 8's 90:10 split tool.\nEvery time I open the Flip 7, I'm consistently dumbfounded by how such a large display can unfurl from something about the size of a makeup compact. And when it's closed, there's a 4.1-inch cover screen that's fantastic in its own ways, with new clever animations for when you're recording a video, charging the phone or taking a selfie, all efficiently using the extra display real estate. In terms of functionality, though, the cover screen's software is about the same as the 3.4-inch one on the Flip 6.\nThe Flip 7 impressed me in nearly every way but one: its battery life. It has a larger battery than the Flip 6, but it doesn't last any longer in daily use. It did consistently get me through a day on a single charge, often having 15 to 20% left, but there were also a few days where it needed an early evening top-off.\nWhy we like it\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the most fully realized version of Samsung's ideal of a flip phone since the launch of the original Galaxy Z Flip in 2020. The Flip 7's appeal is simple: It's a thin phone with a big, bold screen that folds in half into a coaster-sized square. The larger cover screen and inner screen make content more immersive. It's design is thin (for a clamshell foldable) and comfortable to hold. Plus you get twice the storage this year compared to last.\nWho is it best for\nIf you've been tempted by a clamshell-style foldable, you should definitely consider the Flip 7. If you have a Galaxy Z Flip 4 or older, the Flip 7 will be an upgrade in every way. It's harder to make that same recommendation for Flip 5 owners unless your phone is showing its age. And if you have a Galaxy Z Flip 6, you can sit this one out unless you really want those larger screens.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.\nPros\n- Excellent software and security support\n- 25-watt wired charging\n- Eye-catching Light Blue color option\nCons\n- Slow performance\n- Single audio speaker\n- Mediocre photography\nEditor's Note: Samsung has also released the Galaxy A16.\nSamsung\u2019s $200 Galaxy A15 5G is an easy choice for someone looking to buy a phone that will last for years. Samsung provides it with four years of software updates and five years of security support, which in this price range is unparalleled. Plus the phone supports 25W wired charging that in my testing was able to charge half of its big 5,000-mAh battery from empty in 30 minutes. I also like the eye-catching light blue option.\nA $200 phone has to have some compromises. The Galaxy A15 5G feels sluggish compared to competing phones like Motorola\u2019s $200 Moto G 5G, and as an entertainment machine falls short with its single audio speaker that is blocked by accident when you hold the phone sideways for games and video. Photography, which is typically a weak point on phones in this price range, is similarly mixed with decent photography in outdoor environments while struggling to photograph lowlight spaces. This makes the Galaxy A15 5G an easy choice for when you just need a phone that can handle the basics, but you may want to consider other options if you are looking for the best pocket YouTube player in this price range.\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance with games, movies and animations\nCons\n- Battery life is a day, similar to baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25 at a higher price\n- Rival phones at the same price have better cameras\nIf the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity \u2013 without upgrading all the way to the Ultra \u2013 the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.\nThat said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.\nWhy we like it\nWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.\nWho it's best for\nIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses\nPros\n- Lightweight design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Durable titanium frame and Gorilla Glass front and back\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- 12GB of RAM\nCons\n- Mediocre battery life\n- Only 25-watt wired charging\n- Steep price tag\n- Just two rear cameras\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge is a unique offering -- one that doesn't necessarily cater to most people's top priorities like longer battery life and an affordable price tag, and yet it still presents an alluring option with its slim frame and lightweight body. Thankfully, it doesn't scale back too much in the way of features and capabilities; it's got a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and the same 200-megapixel main camera you'll find on the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra (though there's no telephoto lens).\nThe main sacrifice is battery life, as the S25 Edge has a 3,900-mAh battery, the lowest amount across the S25 series. It also only supports 25-watt wired charging. But it still offers enough juice to get you through the day, even if you're a notoriously heavy phone user. Plus, using something so remarkably feather-light feels like such a breath of fresh air, you may not mind making some compromises. Read our full Galaxy S25 Edge review.\nWhy we like it\nThe S25 Edge is surprisingly enjoyable to use and hold, given its lightweight design (it weighs 163 grams) and generous 6.7-inch screen. And despite its thinner frame, it feels surprisingly sturdy, thanks to its Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 display and Victus 2 backing. That means it doesn't feel like it's going to snap in your pocket -- and you'll hardly even feel it in there.\nWho it's best for\nIf you want a phone that feels light and can slip easily into your pocket, without compromising too much on functionality, the S25 Edge is a great option. Plus, if you're looking for a fresh form factor but aren't interested in venturing into foldables territory, this unique phone is a solid -- and more familiar-feeling -- choice.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you're looking for something more budget-friendly, the S25 Edge might not appeal to you. Also, if battery life is your top priority, the S25 Edge leaves something to be desired, since it only lasts about 24 hours before needing a recharge.\nBest Samsung phones compared\n| Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 | Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED;

The Galaxy S24 FE packs a good camera and costs only $650 before discounts or trade-in offers.\nTest your phone: It's worth going to a store and trying out a phone before you shell out hundreds of dollars for it.\nFind peace of mind with a case: You spent all this time picking a phone, now protect it from damage with a case.\nBe ready for Cyber Monday sales: The holidays usually bring big discounts and sales, even on phones.\nHow we test phones\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting levels. We try out any new camera modes such as 4K 120fps slow motion video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max or AI reframe and focus on the Motorola Razr Plus (2024).\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, which isn't always included in the initial review and is added later in an update.\nPerformance\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nRead more: How We Test Phones\nOther Samsung phones we tested\nSamsung's $650 Galaxy S24 FE is such a comfort to use that at moments our reviewer, Mike Sorrentino, felt like he was testing a scaled-back version of the $1,000 Galaxy S24 Plus. The S24 FE's large 6.7-inch 120Hz refresh-rate display made it easy for me to enjoy streaming shows, playing games and taking video calls throughout the day. And it includes nearly every software perk from the more expensive Galaxy S24 line. Read our full review of the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE."

      "text": "Pros\n- Big screen and loud speakers\n- Telephoto lens\n- Samsung's full feature suite for less money\nCons\n- Battery life\n- Slower optical fingerprint sensor versus Galaxy S24\n- Galaxy AI feels gimmicky\nSamsung's $650 Galaxy S24 FE is such a comfort to use that at moments it felt like I was testing a scaled-back version of the $1,000 Galaxy S24 Plus. The S24 FE's large 6.7-inch 120Hz refresh-rate display made it easy for me to enjoy streaming shows, playing games and taking video calls throughout the day. And it includes nearly every software perk from the more expensive Galaxy S24 line.\nWith the S24 FE, you'll get a capable phone that features a telephoto camera -- which you don't get on cheaper devices -- along with access to all of Samsung's Galaxy AI features alongside Google's Circle to Search. Whether these AI features are useful will be up to you, but the access allows the Galaxy S24 FE to feel like a full-fledged Samsung flagship without having to spend more money.\nThe Galaxy S24 FE nails many elements that most of us want from a good phone, especially at a $650 price that most other flagship phone makers are currently ignoring. Since Google's Pixel 9 now starts at the same $800 price as the Galaxy S24, the Galaxy S24 FE is now a prime phone for someone that would like to step up from a mid-range device like Samsung's Galaxy A phones or Google's Pixel 6A without paying for a premium phone price.\nIf you're looking for a cheaper version of the Galaxy S24 Plus, the S24 FE should fit your needs quite well. Though pay an extra $60 to get the $710 Galaxy S24 FE model with 256GB of storage: mirroring the S24 Plus' baseline configuration (which is still $290 more).\nBut it's a different story when comparing the S24 FE with the $800 Galaxy S24. If you don't mind having a slightly smaller phone (the S24 has a 6.2-inch screen) and paying $150 more, you get a number of noticeable upgrades including a better camera, longer battery life, a faster fingerprint sensor and a speedier processor. But if you don't need the absolute top of the line, then save $150 and get the FE model.\nGalaxy S24 FE's design\nSamsung's Galaxy S24 FE has a slightly taller design to accommodate its 6.7-inch display, but it's otherwise similar to last year's Galaxy S23 FE, aside from the $50 price increase. The S24 FE has aluminum sides and pastel backs -- this time available in blue, mint, gray and graphite. I find both the blue and gray models to skew closer to a white under some lighting, while the mint and graphite versions have bolder colors.\nThe S24 FE's screen and speakers are a joy to use. I had no problems watching YouTube videos and playing We Love Katamari through Xbox Game Pass, which looked and sounded great. The S24 FE's size and shape also made it easy to use one-handed for phone calls and scrolling through texts.\nOne downside is the inclusion of an under-screen optical fingerprint reader on the Galaxy S24 FE compared with the faster, hypersonic, under-screen fingerprint scanner found on the pricier S24 phones. It took a second longer to unlock compared with the regular S24. I don't find the optical reader to interfere with the S24 FE's usefulness as I could still unlock the phone straight from its lock screen.\nGalaxy S24 FE's battery and performance\nThe S24 FE's has a 4,700-mAh battery compared with the S23 FE's 4,500-mAh battery. Battery life on the S23 FE was my chief complaint when I reviewed it. Fortunately the S24 FE's larger battery does improve things as I ended most days at 30% compared with the S23 FE, which often had between 12% and 20% left.\nIf you do need a boost, the S24 FE supports 25-watt wired charging speed, which refilled the battery in my testing from empty to 56% in 30 minutes. The FE also supports 15-watt wireless charging and PowerShare which lets you turn the phone into a Qi wireless charger for other devices, like to top off your wireless earbuds case.\nRead more: Samsung Breaks Down How Bixby Will Evolve Alongside Galaxy AI\nSamsung's Exynos 2400E processor powers the US edition of the Galaxy S24 FE, which is interesting as the phone maker has always used Qualcomm Snapdragon chips for Galaxy S phones sold in the US. For example, last year's S23 FE ran on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in the US, while the international model opted for an Exynos processor.\nThis isn't really an issue for the phone's performance though, as the Exynos 2400E outperformed the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor used on the 2023 Galaxy S23 in my benchmark testing. The S24 FE even scored just a hair slower than the more expensive Galaxy S24 and S24 Ultra, which run on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. It's worth pointing out that the S24 FE doesn't fully measure up to the regular Galaxy S24's performance, but for most people the S24 FE will be fine in terms of handling everyday tasks and still running fast for years to come.\nGalaxy S24 FE and Galaxy AI\nSamsung's biggest push for the S24 FE remains its Galaxy AI suite: a number of software tools aimed at improving writing, photos, translation and more. What's nice is that the phone gets access to every feature that is available on the more expensive S24 phones -- though last year's S23 FE also has these same AI features.\nI found Samsung's generative AI Sketch to Image tool to be a fun way to turn everyday objects into coloring books. The feature uses AI to generate a photo-realistic version of something you draw or doodle on an image in the Gallery app. For instance, I took a photo of a Dunkin' coffee cup, used the Sketch tool to draw a heart on it and watched Galaxy AI turn my sketch into an actual logo. It kept the colors of the Dunkin' logo while morphing my shape into a design that looked as if it was printed on the cup.\nI noticed that some words in images would become a jumbled mess. For instance, when I drew a star on an image of a Celsius can, the AI added letters and descriptors to the photo in places that didn't make sense. The Sketch to Image tool is a neat trick that I'd consider to be a fun game.\nThere's also Samsung's Interpreter app that can be set to Listening mode and offer a translation based on what the phone can hear. This is a bit different from Galaxy AI's Live Translation feature for phone calls and texting apps, which can come in handy for multilingual chats, but as my colleagues who have tested iterations of these on other Galaxy phones found, the results are mixed for how well these translations turn out.\nI opened the Interpreter app and put the phone into Listening mode while watching an Italian-language film. And while this isn't the intended purpose, the results weren't always accurate. I don't feel comfortable to actually use Galaxy AI for a live conversation, but if you're curious how the Interpreter app does in that scenario read this story from my CNET colleague Patrick Holland who tested it in Paris.\nThen there's Google's Circle to Search feature, which lets you draw a circle around something being shown on your display to run a search for it. The feature isn't part of Galaxy AI and is available on other phones like the Pixel series and the Galaxy S and Z series. Circle to Search was the most useful AI feature for my everyday needs. For instance, without needing to take a photo, I can open up the Camera app and then press and hold the home button to scan flowers, animals and sites like Manhattan's Little Island.\nCurrently, Galaxy AI functions best for creativity, transcription and translation, but I'd like it to help me with tasks like finding the cheapest hot lunch option near my office or organize my communications with a single point of contact. Other AI options like Google's Gemini and Apple Intelligence have announced similar plans for organizing our data with artificial intelligence, but it's still early days for these features.\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE cameras\nThe Galaxy S24 FE's cameras did a decent job taking photos in both well-lit and low-light environments. The phone has a trio of lenses: wide, ultrawide and telephoto. The main camera has a 50-megapixel image sensor, the ultrawide a 12-megapixel sensor and the telephoto an 8-megapixel one.\nTaking the cameras to New York's High Line park turned out to be a beautiful way to test out these cameras, as my photos taken on both the main lens and when zoomed in with the telephoto lens captured lots of detail for the various plants seen at the park. The main image suffers a bit from the shadows being boosted which gives it an HDR-look.\nUsing the phone's 10-megapixel front-facing camera also takes a balanced photo that captures my hair strands and skin tones while outside on a Manhattan rooftop.\nWhen inside, especially in nighttime environments, the Galaxy S24 FE's photo take a hit when it comes to image noise. I took the Galaxy S24 FE, the S23 FE and the regular S24 to a dimly lit bar. Despite there being only trace lighting, all three phones did an OK job capturing my bowl of pasta and beer. There is noticeable image noise across all three photos when zooming in, but the noise reduction each phone applied made the images look more like a drawing than a photo.\nWhen I switched to the front-facing cameras in the same bar, however, there was a noticeable difference between each phone's selfies. The S23 FE's image is soft and has a blurry look. The S24 FE's photo captures more detail in my facial hair. But the S24's image was the best and took the additional step of brightening up my face. While the S24 is able to put in that additional work it costs more.\nI also took comparison photos with just the S24 and S24 FE at a well-lit location of The Cheesecake Factory. Both images of a Bloody Mary have a lot of sharp clean details. Notice the water droplets on the tomato garnish and the spices used inside of the drink itself.\nAll in all, I find the S24 FE's cameras to compare quite favorably to the S24's, even if the more expensive phone has a bit more power for cleaning up images in challenging conditions.\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE: Bottom line\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is a great value-option for someone who is looking for a phone that can handle pretty much anything you want to throw at it, but isn't as concerned about having the latest and greatest specs. The Galaxy S24 FE is a solid handset with a nice big screen, loud speakers, decent cameras and is easy to use with one hand. You also get full access to Samsung's Galaxy AI features and a promise of seven years of software and security support that will provide you with new phone features for a considerable amount of time.\nWhile you can get more processing power and better photography by opting for the more expensive Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus phones, for most people this phone is an easy recommendation when you just want a nice Samsung phone that doesn't skimp on features to hit a lower price. But those who are looking to get the most possible power for your phone purchase should still consider the Galaxy S24 or wait a few more months until next year when we expect Samsung to announce its Galaxy S25 line at the beginning of 2025.\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE specs vs. Galaxy S23 FE, Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24 Plus, Google Pixel 9\n| Samsung Galaxy S24 FE | Samsung Galaxy S23 FE | Samsung Galaxy S24 | Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus | Google Pixel 9 | |\n| Display size, resolution | 6.7-inch AMOLED FHD+; 120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.4-inch AMOLED display; 2,340 x 1,080 pixels; adaptive 120Hz refresh rate (60-120Hz) | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 385 ppi | 466 ppi | 416 ppi | 509 ppi | 422 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 3x6.4x0.3 inches | 6.22 x 3.01 x 0.32 in | 5.79 x 2.78 x 0.3 in. | 6.24 x 3 x 0.3 in. | 6x2.8x0.3 inches |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 77.3 X 162.0 X 8.0mm | 157.9 x 76.4 x 8.1 mm | 147 x 71 x 7.6 mm | 158 x 76 x 7.6 mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm |\n| Weight (ounces, grams) | 213g | 209 g (7.4 oz) | 168g (5.93 oz.) | 197g (6.95 oz.) | 198g (7 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | Android 14 | Android 13 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 8-megapixel telephoto (3x optical zoom) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 8-megapixel (telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) |\n| Front-facing camera | 10-megapixel | 10-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 10.5-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 8K at 30fps; 4K at 60/30fps | 8K | 8K | 4K | |\n| Processor | Samsung Exynos 2400e | Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Google Tensor G4 |\n| RAM/Storage | 8GB + 128GB, 8GB + 256GB, 8GB + 512GB | 8GB + 128GB, 256GB | 8GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | No | None | None | None |\n| Battery/Charger | 4,700 mAh | 4,500 mAh (25W wired charging) | 4,000 mAh | 4,900 mAh | 4,700 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Under display | In-display | Under display | Under display | Under display |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | No | None | None | None |\n| Special features | 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G; IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 6E | Wireless PowerShare, Fast Wireless Charging 2.0, Samsung Knox with Samsung Knox Vault, IP68 water resistance | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 6E | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 45W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 6E | Satellite SOS; 7 years of OS, security and Pixel feature drops; Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover glass; IP68 dust and water resistance; 2,700-nit peak brightness; 45W fast charging (charger not included); 15W wireless charging with Google Pixel Stand (second gen); 12W wireless Qi-charging; Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7; NFC; Bluetooth 5.3; dual-SIM (eSIM + nano SIM); Add Me; Best Take; Magic Eraser; Magic Editor |\n| Price off-contract (USD) | $650 (128GB), $719 (256GB) | $600 | $800 (128GB) | $1,000 (256GB) | $799 (128GB) |\n| Price (GBP) | \u00a3649 (128GB), \u00a3699 (256GB) | \u00a3599 | \u00a3799 (128GB) | \u00a3999 (256GB) | Converts to \u00a3640 (128GB) |\n| Price (AUD) | AU$1,099 (128GB), AU$1,199 (256GB) | AU$1,099 | AU$1,399 (256GB) | AU$1,699 (256GB) | Converts to AU$1,210 (128GB) |\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances."

      "text": "At the start of the year, Samsung unveiled its new Samsung Galaxy S25 series of phones at its Unpacked event in San Jose, California. As expected, the phone company put new AI features center stage, highlighting the handful of hardware improvements over last year's handsets almost as an afterthought. Still, the S25 series represents Samsung's latest and greatest, so here's how the Galaxy S25 Ultra's specs compare with the standard Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus.\nAll three phones have the same prices as last year's Galaxy S24 family, but they've all seen changes. The standard $800 S25 has all the new AI tricks and upgrades. The $1,000 S25 Plus builds on that with more storage and battery in a larger format handset. And finally, the most premium (and most expensive) model, the $1,300 S25 Ultra, has the absolute best specs in terms of cameras and screen.\nUnbeknownst to everyone at the event, Unpacked had one last surprise: the Galaxy S25 Edge, a slimmer fourth sibling in the lineup. Unfortunately, Samsung hasn't revealed much about this device, and aside from seeing it on the show floor showing off its thinness, we don't have any specs to compare with those of its three well-known siblings. Call the device a mystery, one that could be released in the first half of this year, if rumors are true.\nThat said, here are all the specs for the three S25 phones we know plenty about.\nDesign and display\nYou'd be hard-pressed to see differences between last year's phones and this year's, as the overall look hasn't changed much. But there are still visual differences between the phones. Both the smaller S25 and larger S25 Plus both have a trio of phone lenses on the back, while the S25 Ultra has four. As has been the case for years, the Ultra model has a slot on the right side of its bottom edge for an extractable S Pen stylus.\nUnsurprisingly, the standard S25 is the lightest of the bunch, weighing 162 grams (5.71 ounces), while the S25 Plus is heavier at 190 grams (6.7 ounces) and the S25 Ultra coming in at 218 grams (7.69 ounces). The S25 and S25 Plus both have standard aluminum frames, while the S25 Ultra has a titanium one. All three phones are IP68 rated for dust- and water-resistance.\nThough all AMOLED with 1-120Hz refresh rates, the displays are where the phones start to differ. The standard S25 has a 6.2-inch screen with tall HD resolution (2,340 by 1,080 pixels), while the larger S25 Plus has a 6.7-inch screen with sharper 1440p resolution (3,120 by 1,440 pixels) and the S25 Ultra has a slightly bigger 6.9-inch screen with the same 1440p resolution with an anti-glare coating to help minimize reflections.\nThere's another unifying factor: for the first time in years, the S25 Ultra has a curved-cornered screen just like its smaller siblings. Another vestige of the Note series, the flat edges of the screen, is gone. The phone screens all have a maximum 2,600-nit peak brightness.\nCameras\nAll three phones' cameras haven't changed much since last year's S24 series. The standard S25 and S25 Plus both have a trio of rear cameras: a 50-megapixel main shooter, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 10-megapixel telephoto with 3x optical zoom.\nThe S25 Ultra boosts those capabilities with a 200-megapixel main camera, a new 50-megapixel ultrawide shooter, and dual telephoto cameras: a 10-megapixel 3x optical zoom along with a 50-megapixel 5x optical zoom camera.\nAll three phones have a 12-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies, and all can shoot up to 8K video from their rear cameras.\nPerformance\nThe phones are roughly aligned in terms of performance, likely because all of their AI features require a high specs baseline. (We've also heard this about Apple's iPhones.) All three phones pack 12GB of RAM, which could be a new baseline to use these features. Previously the S24 only had 8GB of RAM.\nAll three pack a customized version of Qualcomm's most advanced mobile chip, the Snapdragon 8 Elite introduced last October, which has fast speeds and plenty of AI capabilities built-in. The S25 phones aren't the first to pack the chip, coming in after the Xiaomi 15 late last year and the OnePlus 13 introduced at the beginning of this year -- but Samsung's newest phones are among the initial pack harnessing Qualcomm's most advanced silicon for phones yet.\nThe phones pack escalating amounts of storage, with the S25 coming in either 128GB or 256GB, the S25 Plus packing either 256GB or 512GB and the S25 Ultra arriving with either 256GB, 512GB or 1TB. As in previous years, none of the phones have a microSD slot or other way to physically expand storage, so you'll need to buy cloud storage options to save beyond their onboard storage.\nThe phones all come with Android 15 out of the box as well as Samsung's One UI 7 overlay. The phones all have Samsung's guaranteed seven years of Android and security updates.\nAI features\nThe new AI features in the S25 series may be its most defining feature distinguishing it from last year's S24 phones (it's unclear if or how many of the features will trickle down to older Samsung handsets). All three S25 phones can access the same AI features.\nOne of the most significant new AI features is what Samsung is calling cross app actions -- for example, a request to \"find a vegan pet-friendly restaurant and text it to me\" would consult multiple apps for an answer, like Yelp and Messages. Depending on the request, either Samsung's or Google's AI models will be used.\nAnother Samsung-exclusive AI feature is AI Select, which suggests actions or apps depending on what you're looking at. Just swipe out from the screen to launch the Edge Panel (the sidebar with app shortcuts) and tap the AI Select button to have it make suggestions in the context of what you're looking at, like setting a GIF or the image you're looking at as your phone background.\nSamsung also has a new feature called conversational search which responds to more casual requests with contextual suggestions -- so if you say \"my eyes are hurting, can you help with the screen\" then the phone will bring up brightness settings and the blue light filter. It will also help make photo search smarter, much like how Apple and Google have used AI to improve their own photo album searches.\nThe Circle to Search function, which debuted on last year's S24 series, is also getting an upgrade: It can now recognize audio, so you can say goodbye to Shazam. The new phones also have more personalized recommendations, Samsung says, like recommending thermostat changes when your phone notices you sleep better at a certain temperature (assuming that health data is coming in from a Samsung Galaxy Ring or Galaxy Watch).\nBattery\nBattery capacity is another area where the phones differ, though it's important to clarify that more capacity doesn't always correlate to your phone lasting longer. Brightness, GPS location-tracking and other features could drain your phone fast regardless. But all things being equal, bigger batteries mean more battery life: the S25 has a 4,000-mAh battery, the S25 Plus has a 4,900-mAh battery and the S25 Ultra has a 5,000-mAh battery.\nBoth the S25 and S25 Plus have 25-watt charging, a rate Samsung phones have been stuck on for years as other leading Android flagships leave them in the dust -- the OnePlus 13, for instance, has 100-watt charging (80-watt in the US) that completely refilled an empty battery in just over half an hour in our testing. The S25 Ultra is slightly better, with 45-watt charging, but it feels particularly archaic on the most advanced phone in Samsung's stable.\nAll three phones have 15-watt wireless charging (the same as you'll get with the Qi2 standard) as well as wireless PowerShare to juice up other devices using its own battery. While the phones don't have the MagSafe magnetic connection within the phones like Apple's latest iPhones, they can approximate it with official Samsung and third-party cases with magnetic connectors.\nConclusion\nSamsung's three-phone lineup is pretty set in stone these days, with the lowest-priced S25 having the least impressive specs, the larger S25 Plus suiting users who want more battery and the S25 Ultra offering the highest spec with S Pen functionality.\nBut those lines have been blurred a bit thanks to the across-the-board upgrade to 12GB of RAM, which leaves storage and screen resolution as the biggest differentiator between all the phones. The big leap between the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra remains the latter's more impressive cameras and stylus, though that's becoming a steeper hike for the $300 jump in price.\nGalaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S25 Plus vs. S25 Ultra\n| Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.9-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 416 ppi | 509 ppi | 501 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in. | 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in. | 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in. |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm | 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 162 g (5.71 oz.) | 190 g (6.70 oz.) | 218 g (7.69 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 15 |\n| Camera | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 200-megapixel (wide), 50-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto), 50-megapixel (5x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 8K | 8K | 8K |\n| Processor | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy |\n| RAM + storage | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 4,000 mAh | 4,900 mAh | 5,000 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Under display | Under display | Under display |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None |\n| Special features | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7 | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7; ultrawideband | Titanium frame, 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; integrated S Pen; UWB for finding other devices; 45W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7; Gorilla Glass Armor cover glass; ultrawideband |\n| US price starts at | $800 (128GB) | $1,000 (256GB) | $1,300 (256GB) |\n| UK price starts at | TBD | TBD | TBD |\n| Australia price starts at | TBD | TBD | TBD |"

      "text": "Phones are an essential but expensive part of our lives. New and existing Verizon customers seeking a new phone or a way to shave a few bucks off their monthly bill will find many offers to take advantage of. Upgrading to the latest iPhone, Pixel or Galaxy device for free can be as simple as adding a new line. A lot of these offers don't require a trade-in either. Plus, several special service plans are available to help first responders, seniors, students and others save each month. We've outlined some of the best deals below, so you can take full advantage.\nVerizon offers deals year-round, but the details change frequently. We'll keep this page updated with the latest bargains, so be sure to check back whenever you're looking to upgrade or switch from another carrier.\nBest Verizon phone deals\nVerizon routinely offers substantial savings on phones, but it's important to note that the majority of these discounts are applied as credits over 36 months. This means you'll need to remain a Verizon customer for at least three years to pay off your phone. You'll be responsible for any remaining charges if you cancel before that period ends.\nVerizon is offering some serious savings on all iPhone 16 models. Just adding a new line on a qualifying unlimited plan will get you the basic iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, 16 Pro Max or 16E for free.\nYou can grab almost any Galaxy S25 phone for free with a new line on an eligible plan at Verizon. That includes the Unlimited Welcome, Plus or Ultimate plan for the basic S25, and the Unlimited Plus or Ultimate plan for the S25 Plus. You can get a free Samsung Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Tab S10 FE 5G with purchase as well, but you'll need a new line for these devices. The Unlimited Ultimate plan is required for the S25 Ultra, but it'll still come out to $8 a month for 36 months.\nThough the next-gen models are out now, last year's Galaxy S24 is still an excellent Android, and you can snag it for free right now. To get the deal, you'll need to activate a new line of service on an Unlimited Ultimate plan, with no trade-in required. The more affordable Galaxy S24 FE is also available for free with a new line on an Unlimited Welcome, Plus or Ultimate plan. Currently, there aren't any special offers on the Galaxy S24 Ultra and the S24 Plus is sold out.\nAdding a new line on an eligible unlimited plan at Verizon scores you the basic Pixel 9, 9 Pro or the affordable Pixel 9A for free, which is up to $1,200 in savings. You can also save as much as $1,000 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold with a new line and trade-in, which drops the price to $22 per month. You can save $1,020 on the 9 Pro XL, bringing it to $5 a month.\nGetting a free Google Pixel Watch 3 or Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE 5G with the purchase is also possible, but you'll need a new line for these devices to get the deal.\nBest Verizon plan deals\nIf you're looking to switch to Verizon, there are a few deals on various plans that may make you lean toward one or the other. Promotions on plans are less common these days, though oftentimes you can get some free extras, such as free streaming service and music subscriptions, with enrollment in some of the higher-end 5G plans.\nThere are a few things to note on Verizon's plans. First, Verizon often limits these perks to one per account, so only one person on a family plan needs to be on an Unlimited Plan to get the Disney bundle (Disney Plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu). Other people on the plan can be on cheaper plans like 5G Start -- though it is worth mentioning that Verizon limits access to its fastest 5G networks (what it calls 5G Ultra Wideband) to its pricier unlimited plans.\nYour company may also offer a corporate discount on plans, but you will need to check to see if that applies to personal accounts. Those who have Fios can check if a corporate discount is available at Verizon's Deals at Work site.\nAre you a teacher, or is someone on your family plan a teacher? You could save on your wireless bill. Verizon offers a teacher discount of up to $25 off per month depending on how many lines you have.\nVerizon uses ID.me to verify eligibility, with the discount appearing on your bill in \"one to two billing cycles.\" You only need to have one teacher on your plan to get the discount to apply for all lines.\nVerizon's deal for nurses is identical to the teachers' deal mentioned above, with up to a $25 discount each month on wireless plans.\nYou'll need to verify your employment through ID.me, with the discount appearing in \"one to two billing cycles.\" Only one nurse needs to be on your account for all lines to get the savings, though you can't combine the nurse discount with the teacher offer.\nVerizon offers a discount to active-duty military, veterans and first responders. Like with the nurse and teacher deals, you only need one person on your plan to meet these qualifications to be eligible for up to $25 off, which will vary depending on how many lines you have.\nVerizon is using ID.me to verify eligibility, with the military offer available to both active-duty service members and veterans. The first responder deal is open to \"firefighters, police, EMS workers, retirees, volunteers and immediate family of those fallen in the line of duty.\"\nVerizon's student discount is actually pretty good. You need to be an \"actively enrolled student (including online enrollment) in a US secondary educational institution of higher learning, including undergraduate, graduate and/or vocational school or institution.\"\nIf you fit that description, you can get four years of discounts; one line gets $10 off each month, and two lines get $13 off. The discount is available on many current plans, including the Unlimited Welcome plan.\nVerizon verifies enrollment through UNIDAYS and caps the discount at two lines per account. The provider also requires annual enrollment verification.\nVerizon has a discount for customers aged 55 or above, though you will need to be in Florida to get it. If you do, you can get unlimited talk, text and 4G LTE data for $62 a month on one line or $84 a month for two lines. Like the student deal, this is capped at a max of two lines per account.\nOne of Verizon's most unique offers is that customers on eligible unlimited plans can add a variety of services and subscriptions for a flat rate of just $10 per month. That includes memberships, subscriptions and benefits like Walmart Plus, Disney Plus bundles, a 100GB hotspot and much more. At just $10 per month, signing up through Verizon could save you as much as $35 per month compared to signing up individually."

      "text": "If you're concerned about how durable Samsung's foldable phones are, I'm here to tell you not to worry. And that's especially true when it comes to the new Galaxy Z Flip 7, which holds its own among today's best smartphones.\nAfter less than six hours with the Galaxy Z Flip 7, I accidentally performed my own informal drop test. At a catered affair in Brooklyn, I walked outside to get a view of the waterfront, and when I pulled the Z Flip 7 out of my pocket, I fumbled it. I watched helplessly as Samsung's newest foldable phone fell to the ground. The noise it made when it clacked against the concrete caused everyone around to look at me with a knowing, sympathetic expression that said, \"Aw, that's a shame. Your phone is toast.\"\nHave you ever dropped your phone? There's that Schr\u00f6dinger's cat-like moment before you pick it up when you're anxious to see if the phone survived.\nFortunately, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 was fine. The 4.1-inch cover screen didn't have any cracks or scuffs. The 6.9-inch inner display was unharmed because the phone was shut. The only tell that it kissed the ground was a tiny scuff on the bottom of the phone near the microphones. Samsung's claim that its new \"Armour Flex Hinge\" is built to withstand impact is indeed true.\nIn the early days of foldable phones, one of the biggest unknowns was their durability. It's amazing that about six years later, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 can handle being dropped on concrete like it had landed on a velvet pillow. Now, I still wouldn't take the Flip 7 (or any foldable phone) to the beach, as it can only withstand particles that are 1mm or larger. So going to a confetti factory would be fine, but a salt factory is a definite no-no.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7's thin design\nThe star of Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event was the Galaxy Z Fold 7. At 8.9mm thick when closed, the Fold 7 is ridiculously thin. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 looks like it also went on Ozempic, but it's 13.7mm thick when closed. That's slim, but not Fold 7 slim. Why couldn't the Flip 7 be super slim like the Fold 7? I just keep imagining a Galaxy Z Flip 8 with the same thinness as the Fold 7.\nFor some perspective, here's how the Flip 7 compares to its clamshell kinfolk:\nGalaxy Z Flip 7 thickness vs. other flip phones\n| Phone | Closed | Open |\n|---|---|---|\n| Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 | 13.7mm | 6.5mm |\n| Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 | 14.9mm | 6.9mm |\n| Motorola Razr Plus | 15.32mm | 7.09mm |\n| Motorola Razr Ultra | 15.69mm | 7.19mm |\n| Motorola Razr (2025) | 15.85mm | 7.25mm |\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7's big cover screen\nThe original Galaxy Z Flip had a tiny, 1.1-inch pill-shaped cover display. It was perfect for showing the time but pretty much useless for anything else. The defining feature on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is its 4.1-inch cover display. The screen looks incredible. I was checking my notifications on the screen under direct sunlight and was able to read everything. One of the hang-ups I had reviewing the Galaxy Z Flip 6 was switching from the inner screen to the cover display outdoors. There would be times on sunny days where I could barely make out what was on the cover display, despite having no issues with the main screen.\nSamsung has increased the maximum brightness of the Flip 7's cover screen to 2,600 nits, which is the same as the inner display. Both screens now top out at 120Hz, too, which should make for a much more consistent experience by having system animations, gameplay and scrolling through a social feed look super smooth.\nThe 6.9-inch inner screen is big, but it doesn't feel unwieldy when I use it. The Flip 6 had a 6.7-inch display, but that extra 0.2 inches on the Flip 7's screen makes it feel much bigger, which my middle-aged eyes are grateful for.\nIn terms of functionality, the cover screen's natural state is widgets. And some, like Spotify's widget, are all I need in lieu of using full apps. But I want apps on the home screen, so I need to enable this functionality in the Labs section of Settings and download the MultiStar app. It takes a couple of minutes to set up, but I do wish the interface supported apps by default.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7's cameras\nThe Flip 7 has three cameras: a 50-megapixel wide-angle, a 12-megapixel ultrawide and a 10-megapixel selfie camera (in the main 6.9-inch screen). The cameras are the same as those on the Flip 6 and Flip 7 FE. But the phones run on different processors, so differences or improvements in photos and videos (if any) will come from Samsung's processing and machine learning.\nHere are some of my favorite photos from the Galaxy Z Flip 7 so far:\nGalaxy Z Flip 7 final thoughts for now\nSamsung gave its foldable line a major overhaul. And while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 feels like an entirely different phone from previous Folds, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 seems like a nice refinement. I will say that I've had only two days with the phone. And as enamored as I am with the larger cover screen, I'm excited to see how the battery life measures up.\nSamsung gave the Flip 7 a 4,300-mAh battery (compared with the Galaxy Z Flip 6's 4,000-mAh battery), but I wonder if the increased capacity will be offset by the power needed for its Exynos 2500 chip and those larger, brighter displays.\nI have a lot more testing to do. But as I work my way toward a full review, I'll try not to drop the Flip 7 anymore.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 specs vs. Motorola Razr Ultra, Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6\n| Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 | Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) | Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 | |\n| Cover display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 4.1-inch AMOLED, 948x1,048p, 120Hz refresh rate | 4-inch pOLED, 2,992x1,224p, up to 165Hz variable refresh rate | 3.4-inch AMOLED; 720x748 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate |\n| Internal display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.9-inch AMOLED, 2,520x1,080p, 1-120Hz refresh rate | 7-inch AMOLED; 1,272x1,080p, up to 165Hz variable refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 2,640x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | Cover: 342ppi.

      "text": "Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is how ordinary it feels in my hand. Well, at least when it's closed. Unfolded, it's a whole different story.\nI got to check out the Z Fold 7 at Samsung's Unpacked event in New York last week, along with the Z Flip 7 and Z Flip 7 FE. I've used many foldable phones, but the feel of the Z Fold 7 struck me as being the future of this category.\nAt 8.9mm thick when folded and weighing 215 grams, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 doesn't feel much different than a standard slate phone. The 6.5-inch cover display makes it something I can see myself willingly using to scroll through social media, text and watch videos.\nBut when opened, Samsung's book-style foldable is anything but ordinary. At just 4.2mm thick, it boasts a wildly slim profile that steals the spotlight from even the 5.8mm-thick Galaxy S25 Edge. The 8-inch inner display is 11% larger than the one on last year's Z Fold 6, which should help with multitasking. And a Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 cover and Victus 2 back make it feel nice and sturdy.\nThe Z Fold 7 feels exactly like what foldable phones have strived to be all along: thin, lightweight and spacious -- and also as \"normal\" as possible, at least where it matters. It also features an impressive 200-megapixel main camera, just like the not-so-thin S25 Ultra.\nIn an exclusive interview, Drew Blackard, Samsung's senior vice president of mobile product management, told CNET that by slimming down the Fold and leveling up the cameras, the book-style phone \"is now a mainstream form factor.\" After holding the phone, I can understand what he means. The Z Fold 7 does away with the thicker build and scaled-back cameras that previously characterized foldables, and introduces something that feels equal parts sleek and familiar.\nSamsung is by no means the first company to launch a thin foldable; Oppo's Find N5, Huawei's Mate X6 and Honor's Magic V3 also boast impressively slim designs, to name a few. But with the release of both the Galaxy S25 Edge and now the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung is doubling down on the skinny phone craze.\nAn Ultra experience on an ultra-thin phone\nBy bringing its 200-megapixel wide camera to the Z Fold 7 and S25 Edge, Samsung is proving you don't have to compromise camera quality for a slimmer build. It's a notable example of a foldable breaking away from the hardware limitations that have traditionally scaled back the cameras. It'll be interesting to see how competitors strive to match or outdo that feat.\nThe Z Fold 7 also has a 12-megapixel ultrawide and 10-megapixel telephoto camera, as well as 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the inner and cover screens. I look forward to testing the phone's cameras out in the real world.\nLike the S25 series, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. It comes out of the box with One UI 8 and Android 16.\nWhat I'm perhaps most relieved about is that the Z Fold 7's battery maintains last year's 4,400-mAh capacity, despite the new phone's slimmer build. The biggest downside of the S25 Edge is its 3,900-mAh battery, giving it the lowest capacity across the S25 series.\nI was fully prepared for the Z Fold 7 to take a similar hit, but its expanded real estate helped save it from that pitfall. Battery life is one of the biggest considerations when people buy a new phone, according to a CNET survey, so it's good Samsung didn't scale that back. We'll see how it actually holds up in my day-to-day use and if it's a match for my endless TikTok scrolling and photo taking.\nNot-so-slim price\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7's cutting-edge specs don't come cheap. The phone starts at $2,000, which is $100 more than last year's Z Fold 6.\nYou're certainly paying a premium for both that slimmer build (the S25 Edge starts at $1,100) and the Ultra-grade camera (the S25 Ultra starts at $1,300).\nThe Z Fold 7 is available in jet black, blue shadow and silver shadow, as well as an exclusive mint color when you order on Samsung.com. Preorders are open now, and the phones arrive July 25."
