      "feedback": "This draft is rich but too sprawling for a 4–6 sentence executive brief; compress into a single Regime A/B/C house view with a crisp causal chain (tariffs/policy credibility → capex localization → external balance → asset pricing) and explicit regime probabilities. Anchor the view with 2–3 numeric, source-backed levers (e.g., Ford EV margin/ROIC, Netflix FCF guidance, capex budgets, dividend yields) and clearly state baseline ranges (and tariff bands such as the 10% baseline with China-specific measures up to 125–145%) with IDs; recast Netflix/Ford as regime illustrations tied to the regime outcome rather than standalone case notes. Remove the dispersed 0–3 week and 3–6 month digressions in favor of a concise base-case narrative plus a 3–5 item watchlist with 2–3 catalysts and 2–3 explicit invalidation triggers, all mapped to Regime A/B/C and tied to the cited catalysts (tariff cadence, capex announcements, inflation surprises) and the Ford/Netflix signals. Tighten the prose to executive style, drop repetition, and ensure every factual claim cites a source ID and reconciles conflicts (e.g., differing forward P/E readings) across primary sources; ensure the final 4–6 sentences cover the horizon, catalysts, risks, and watch-items with complete core coverage of SGB2PAZGK, OGK8WLL69, Y6SQOEK69, 61SVFUKBY, A88B7V8PY, 65UUBU0OR, 22PL3Q360, S23W0Q0AW, RAV2UWRTT, Y4QWID79M, 4LDHF4T77, Z5IA1CYUF, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ, STBVARD8F, and U3ZK13ZQI.",
