  "description": "For the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, Desjardins Group, North America's largest financial cooperative group, recorded surplus earnings before member dividends of $900 million, compared to $918 million for the comparable period of 2024. This decrease in surplus earnings was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, due in particular to unfavourable developments in the economic outlook, related to the potential impact of trade disruptions.

  "content": "\"This year, in the 125th anniversary year of its founding, Desjardins has surpassed $500 billion in assets, demonstrating its ambition and how it has stayed close to members and clients,\" said Guy Cormier, President and CEO of Desjardins Group. \"Desjardins continues to deliver remarkable performance. These results demonstrate the financial solidity of our cooperative model, as well as the unwavering commitment of our teams to supporting our members and clients. I wish my successor, Denis Dubois, the very best for continued growth and development of Desjardins Group.\"\n\nFor the first six months ended June 30, 2025, Desjardins Group recorded surplus earnings before dividends of $1,638 million, down $135 million from the same period of 2024. This decrease in surplus earnings was primarily due to the results of the Property and Casualty Insurance segment, which were affected by higher claims expenses as a result of increases in both the frequency and the average cost of claims. There was also an increase in the provision for credit losses, due in particular to unfavourable developments in the economic outlook related to the potential impact of trade disruptions. However, the Personal and Business Services segment benefited from an increase in net interest income, related primarily to business growth. Lastly, we would like to point out that the increase in non-interest expense stemmed from investments aimed at supporting growth in operations and enhancing the services offered to members and clients.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2025, the provision for member dividends totalled $113 million, up $3 million from the comparable period of 2024. Sponsorships, donations and scholarships amounted to $34 million, of which $17 million came from the caisses' Community Development Fund.\n\nL\u00c9VIS, QC, Aug. 12, 2025 /CNW/ - For the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, Desjardins Group , North America's largest financial cooperative group, recorded surplus earnings before member dividends of $900 million, compared to $918 million for the comparable period of 2024. This decrease in surplus earnings was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, due in particular to unfavourable developments in the economic outlook, related to the potential impact of trade disruptions. However, the Personal and Business Services segment benefited from higher net interest income, mainly tied to growth in the loan portfolio, which, among other things, allowed the Group to surpass $500 billion in assets. To support this sustained growth, Desjardins Group expanded its presence on international financing markets by issuing subordinated debt in Swiss francs and yen. Lastly, it should be noted that non-interest expense increased due to investments aimed at supporting business growth and enhancing the services offered to members and clients.\n\nDesjardins Group announces the appointment of its new President and CEO\n\nOn June 2, the Board of Directors announced the appointment of Denis Dubois as the next President and CEO of Desjardins Group, effective September 2, 2025. He will succeed Guy Cormier, who has held this position since March 2016. Mr. Cormier will ensure a seamless transition in leadership, supporting Denis Dubois and the Board of Directors as a strategic advisor from September 2, 2025, to March 2026.\n\nThrough an innovative partnership with the Qu\u00e9bec government, the Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative, launched in 2022, continues to demonstrate its commitment to fighting the housing crisis. After surpassing its initial goal of 1,000 affordable housing units, Desjardins is taking another major step forward with a second agreement, this time in collaboration with the Qu\u00e9bec and Canadian governments. The new agreement will enable the creation of , bringing the total number of affordable units made available across 14 regions of Qu\u00e9bec to more than 3,000 by 2028.\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, 1,373 units were already in operation and 894 more were under construction, particularly in the , , and (in French only) regions. These achievements confirm the key role Desjardins is playing in the development of sustainable and inclusive.\n\nIn an unrelenting effort to meet the changing requirements of its members and clients, Desjardins Investments Inc., as manager of Desjardins Funds, its mutual fund offering. This initiative aims to provide a simpler, more accessible and advantageous investment experience, while promoting financial empowerment.\n\nLast June, Desjardins Investment Inc., acting as an exchange-traded funds (ETF) manager, launched the . This new ETF allows investors to support publicly traded Qu\u00e9bec companies and is part of the company's commitment to supporting the local economy.\n\nDesjardins is opening a new chapter in its support for the social economy. In partnership with (in French only), a non-profit organization that aspires to scale up social innovations, a unique program is being launched to support up to six promising projects over a 24-month period. By combining Sillons's on-the-ground expertise and Desjardins's impact in the community, this partnership meets a need that was strongly expressed at the last (in French only).\n\nDesjardins is continuing its efforts toward a fair and sustainable transition, as evidenced by its , published in May 2025. The document outlines the Group's commitments to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. During this period, Desjardins reached the $2 billion mark in investment in renewable energy infrastructure, issued its first green bond on the European market, and actively supported equity, diversity and inclusion.\n\nComparison of second quarter 2025 with second quarter 2024:\n\u2022 Surplus earnings before member dividends of $900 million, down $18 million.\n\u2022 Total net revenue of $4,091 million, up $338 million, or 9.0%:\n\u2022 Net interest income of $2,024 million, up $163 million, or 8.8%, mainly due to growth in average residential mortgages and business loans outstanding.\n\u2022 Insurance service result of $593 million, down $27 million, or 4.4%, due to increased claims expenses in the Property and Casualty Insurance segment.\n\u2022 Net insurance finance result of $312 million, up $75 million, or 31.6%, due to favourable developments in the financial markets, particularly in equities markets.\n\u2022 Other income of $1,162 million, up $127 million, or 12.3%, related to growth in assets under management and assets under administration.\n\u2022 Provision for credit losses of $203 million, compared to $87 million for the comparable period in 2024.

Regulation 52-112 respecting Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure (Regulation 52-112) provides guidance to issuers disclosing specified financial measures, including the following measures used by Desjardins Group:\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measure used by Desjardins Group in this press release, and which does not have a standardized definition, is not directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies, and may not be directly comparable to any GAAP measure. It is defined as follows:\n\nReturn to members and the community\n\nAs a cooperative financial group contributing to the development of communities, Desjardins Group gives its members and clients the support they need to be financially empowered. The amount returned to members and the community, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used to present the overall amount returned to the community and is composed of member dividends, as well as sponsorships, donations and scholarships.\n\nMore detailed information about the amounts returned to members and the community may be found in the \"Financial Highlights\" table on the following page.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation 52-112, supplementary financial measures are used to show historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flows. In addition, these measures are not disclosed in the financial statements. Desjardins Group uses certain supplementary financial measures, and their composition is presented in the Glossary on pages 52 to 59 of the MD&A for the second quarter of 2025.\n\nDesjardins Group maintains strong capitalization levels, in accordance with Basel III rules. As at June 30, 2025, its Tier 1A and total capital ratios stood at 22.9% and 25.5%, respectively, compared to 22.2% and 24.2%, respectively, as at December 31, 2024.\n\nResults for the second quarter\n\nFor the second quarter of 2025, surplus earnings before member dividends were $370 million, down $66 million from the same period in 2024. This segment benefited from the growth in net interest income and other income related to business growth. Furthermore, the increase in non-interest expense stems from investments made to support growth in operations and enhance the services offered to members and clients, and drove the decrease in surplus earnings. In addition, the provision for credit losses was higher than in the comparable period in 2024.\n\nResults for the second quarter\n\nFor the second quarter of 2025, the segment posted $226 million in net surplus earnings, down $20 million compared to the corresponding period of 2024. This decrease was due in particular to the gain in 2024 on disposal of the interest in Fiera Holdings Inc. and Fiera Capital LP as well as the increase in administrative expenses and investments related to continued implementation of strategic projects. This decrease was partly offset by increases in the net insurance finance result and the net insurance service result, while the results for the prior period had been negatively affected by the updating of actuarial assumptions.\n\nResults for the second quarter\n\nFor the second quarter of 2025, the segment posted $307 million in net surplus earnings, up $13 million, from the same period of 2024, primarily due to higher insurance revenue that was mainly on account of growth in automobile and property insurance premiums and to business arising from the 2024 acquisition of The Insurance Company of Prince Edward Island. In addition, the segment posted growth in its net insurance finance result. The increase in surplus earnings was partly offset by three major events in the second quarter of 2025: water and wind damage in Ontario, wind damage in Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario, and a forest fire in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, whereas no catastrophes or major events occurred during the corresponding quarter of 2024.\n\nResults for the second quarter\n\nFor the second quarter of 2025, the Other category posted a net deficit of $3 million, compared to a net deficit of $58 million in the second quarter of 2024. The Other category includes mainly treasury activities.\n\nMore detailed financial information can be found in Desjardins Group's interim Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the second quarter of 2025, available on the website or on the SEDAR+ website, at\n\nis the largest cooperative financial group in North America and the sixth largest in the world, with assets of $501.3 billion as at June 30, 2025.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that may be incorporated in other filings with Canadian regulators or in any other communications. In addition, Desjardins Group's representatives may make verbal forward-looking statements to investors, the media and others.\n\nThe forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, comments on Desjardins Group's objectives regarding financial performance, priorities, vision, operations, targets and commitments, its strategies to achieve them, its results and its financial position, economic as well as financial market conditions, the outlook for the Qu\u00e9bec, Canadian, U.S. and global economies, and the regulatory environment in which we operate. Such forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as \"target,\" \"objective,\" \"timing,\" \"outlook,\" \"believe,\" \"predict,\" \"foresee,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"have as a goal,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipate,\" \"aim,\" \"propose,\" \"should\" and \"may,\" words and expressions of similar import, and future and conditional verbs, in all grammatical variants.\n\nBy their very nature, such statements require us to make assumptions, and are subject to uncertainties and inherent risks, both general and specific. Desjardins Group cautions readers against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements when making decisions since a number of factors, many of which are beyond Desjardins Group's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, could influence, individually or collectively, the accuracy of the assumptions, predictions, forecasts or other forward-looking statements, including those in this press release. Although Desjardins Group believes that the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable and founded on valid bases, it cannot guarantee that these expectations will materialize or prove to be accurate. It is also possible that these assumptions, predictions, forecasts or other forward-looking statements, as well as Desjardins Group's objectives and priorities, may not materialize or may prove to be inaccurate, and that actual future results, conditions, actions or events may differ materially from targets, expectations, estimates or intentions that have been explicitly or implicitly put forward. Readers who rely on these forward-looking statements must carefully consider these risk factors and other uncertainties and potential events, including the uncertainty inherent in forward-looking statements.\n\nThe factors that may affect the accuracy of the forward-looking statements in this press release include those discussed in the \"Risk management\" section of Desjardins Group's 2024 annual MD&A and of its MD&A for the second quarter of 2025, and include credit, market, liquidity, operational, insurance, strategic and reputation risk, environmental, social and governance risk, and regulatory risk.\n\nSuch factors also include those related to security (including cybersecurity) breaches, fraud risk, the housing market and household and corporate indebtedness, technological and regulatory developments, including changes to liquidity and capital adequacy guidelines, and requirements relating to their presentation and interpretation, as well as interest rate fluctuations, inflation, climate change, geopolitical uncertainty, artificial intelligence and data risk. In addition, there are factors related to the trade dispute with the United States and the impact that tariffs on certain Canadian exports as well as any resulting retaliatory tariffs could notably have on goods and services, businesses in certain industries, and the Canadian economy. Also of note are factors related to general economic and business conditions in regions in which Desjardins Group operates; monetary policies; the critical accounting estimates and accounting standards applied by Desjardins Group; new products and services to maintain or increase Desjardins Group's market share; geographic concentration; changes in the credit ratings assigned to Desjardins Group; reliance on third parties; the ability to recruit and retain talent; and tax risk. Other factors include unexpected changes in consumer spending and saving habits, the potential impact of international conflicts on operations, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, or any other similar events affecting the local, national or global economy, as well as Desjardins Group's ability to anticipate and properly manage the risks associated with these factors despite a disciplined risk management environment. Additional information about these factors is found in the \"Risk management\" section of Desjardins Group's 2024 Annual Report and of its MD&A for the second quarter of 2025.\n\nIt is important to note that the above list of factors that could influence future results is not exhaustive. Other factors could have an effect on Desjardins Group's results. Additional information about these and other factors is found in the \"Risk management\" section of Desjardins Group's 2024 Annual MD&A and of its MD&A for the second quarter of 2025.\n\nThe significant economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements in this document are described in the \"Economic environment and outlook\" section of Desjardins Group's 2024 MD&A and of its MD&A for the second quarter of 2025 and can be updated in the interim MD&As subsequently filed. Readers are cautioned to consider the foregoing factors when reading this section. To determine economic growth forecasts in general, and for the financial services sector in particular, Desjardins Group mainly uses historical economic data provided by recognized and reliable organizations, empirical and theoretical relationships between economic and financial variables, expert judgments, and identified upside and downside risks for the domestic and global economies. In light of the changing circumstances of the U.S. trade dispute and the resulting impact on the Canadian economy, financial market conditions, commercial operations, and Desjardins Group's financial results and financial position, there is greater uncertainty about our economic assumptions than in previous periods, as these assumptions are based on uncertain future developments and it is difficult to predict how significant the long-term impact of U.S. tariffs will be.\n\nAny forward-looking statements contained in this press release represent the views of management only as at the date hereof, and are presented for the purpose of assisting readers in understanding and interpreting Desjardins Group's financial position as at the dates indicated or its results for the periods then ended, as well as its strategic priorities and objectives as considered as at the date hereof.

  "summary": "Desjardins Group, North America's largest financial cooperative group, has surpassed $500 billion in assets in the 125th anniversary year of its founding. The company posted surplus earnings of $900 million for the second quarter of 2025 and surpassed its total assets of $1,638 million, down $135 million from the same period of 2024. This decrease was primarily due to higher claims expenses and increased provision for credit losses due to unfavourable developments in the economic outlook related to trade disruptions. The Personal and Business Services segment saw an increase in net interest income, largely due to business growth. Non-interest expense increased due to investments aimed at supporting business growth and enhancing the services offered to members and clients. The appointment of Denis Dubois as the next President and CEO of Desjillardins Group was announced on June 2, 2025.",

      "text": "Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative: A strong partnership to deliver 1,000 additional affordable housing units across Quebec\nThe Government of Quebec, the Government of Canada and Desjardins are pleased to announce the creation of 1,000 new affordable housing units over the next three years. These units will be created as part of the Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative. This partnership was launched in 2022 and will deliver more than 3,000 units by 2028.\nAlmost $184 million in funding has been earmarked for these 1,000 new units. Part of this funding will come from the Housing Accelerator Fund (HAF), under which the Government of Canada will provide Quebec with $900 million to accelerate the construction of residential units in the province, along with an additional $900 million investment announced by the Government of Quebec during its fall 2023 economic update. Desjardins has committed to granting nearly $50 million in mortgage financing or patient capital to community developers.\nWith its one-stop shop model and extensive network of caisses and Desjardins Business centres, Desjardins can support community developers such as housing cooperatives, community organizations and municipal stakeholders to identify and qualify projects to accelerate the creation of affordable housing.\n\u201cThe housing crisis requires a strong, quick and coordinated response. This renewed partnership demonstrates that together, we can deliver real, large-scale results that have a real impact on people\u2019s lives. At Desjardins, we see access to affordable housing as a key driver to build stronger, more equitable and more people-focused communities. By adding 1,000 affordable housing units to our roadmap, we\u2019re continuing our commitment to supporting families, workers and communities across Quebec\u201d, said Guy Cormier, President and CEO of Desjardins Group\nProjects taking shape\n- As at May 31, 2025, there were nine projects totalling 1,198 housing units underway, plus another 908 housing units under construction.\n- These projects are located across 14 Quebec regions.\nThe Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative was launched in 2022 under an innovative partnership between the Quebec government and Desjardins. Its initial target was the creation of 1,000 affordable housing units by the end of 2025.\nThanks to the expertise of its dedicated team, Desjardins has quickly surpassed the goal set out in the initial agreement and raised it to more than 2,000 units.\nThe second agreement signed with the Government of Quebec in partnership with the Government of Canada is a clear indicator of Desjardins\u2019s leadership in tackling the housing crisis.\nIn just six years, this partnership will make more than 3,000 affordable housing units available across the province and ensure their affordability for at least 35 years.\nQuotes:\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud that partnering with Desjardins is making a real difference. This proves that by working together with the Government of Canada, municipalities, and housing organizations, we\u2019re able to quickly deliver quality affordable housing for Quebecers who need it most. We\u2019re innovating, we\u2019re thinking outside the box, and we\u2019re working hard to respond to the housing crisis. Our government is committed to doing things differently to building more and building better.\u201d\nFrance-\u00c9laine Duranceau, Minister Responsible for Housing\n\u201cOur government is implementing a series of measures to help double residential construction rates across the country. We\u2019re going to make housing more affordable by harnessing the power of public-private cooperation. Working with the Quebec government and Desjardins brings us closer to our goal to provide more affordable housing to Quebecers.\u201d\nThe Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure\n\u201cThe major partnership with Desjardins has proven its value in the field. It reinforces the SHQ\u2019s housing efforts by allowing us to work hand in hand with our partners to provide more affordable housing to those who need it most\u2014families, seniors, single people\u2014throughout Quebec.\u201d\nJean Martel, President and CEO, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019habitation du Qu\u00e9bec"

      "text": "QU\u00c9BEC, le 9 mai 2025 /CNW/ - Le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec, la Ville de Vaudreuil-Dorion ainsi que Desjardins, annoncent la construction d'un immeuble de 12 logements abordables pour les familles de la Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie. Ce projet d'habitation port\u00e9 par l'organisme Toit d'Abord est r\u00e9alis\u00e9 dans le cadre de l'Initiative Logement abordable Desjardins, un partenariat novateur entre le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec et Desjardins pour la cr\u00e9ation rapide de 1 750 logements abordables.\nLe montage financier de pr\u00e8s de 5,2 M$ regroupe des investissements du gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec (pr\u00e8s de 2,3 M$), de la Ville de Vaudreuil-Dorion (900 000 $) et de Desjardins (financement de 1,8 M$). Les premiers locataires devraient emm\u00e9nager d\u00e8s ao\u00fbt 2025.\n\u00c0 propos de l'Initiative Logement abordable Desjardins\nEn 2022, le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec confiait 175 M$ \u00e0 Desjardins pour cr\u00e9er 1 000 nouveaux logements sociaux et abordables d'ici la fin 2025, lesquels seraient le fruit de projets d'habitation r\u00e9partis dans 14 r\u00e9gions du Qu\u00e9bec. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Desjardins devait rendre disponible une somme de 150 M$ en financement et en capital patient, avec l'appui de Capital r\u00e9gional et coop\u00e9ratif Desjardins, aux organismes porteurs des projets. Ceux-ci s'engageaient \u00e0 assurer l'abordabilit\u00e9 des logements pour une p\u00e9riode allant jusqu'\u00e0 35 ans.\nGr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'expertise de son \u00e9quipe d\u00e9di\u00e9e aux logements abordables et \u00e0 son vaste r\u00e9seau de caisses et de Centre Desjardins Entreprises, Desjardins a vu cet objectif \u00eatre rapidement surpass\u00e9 pour rendre disponibles plus de 2 000 logements abordables d'ici la fin de 2025. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un mod\u00e8le de guichet unique Desjardins est en mesure de solliciter les promoteurs, les coop\u00e9ratives d'habitation, les organismes communautaires et les acteurs municipaux pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le d\u00e9veloppement de projets menant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation ou \u00e0 la r\u00e9novation de logements abordables.\nDevant cette efficacit\u00e9, en d\u00e9cembre 2023, Qu\u00e9bec a ajout\u00e9 une somme de 43,75 M$ \u00e0 l'enveloppe initiale octroy\u00e9e \u00e0 Desjardins afin que soient cr\u00e9\u00e9s 250 logements abordables additionnels. Par cons\u00e9quent, ce sont plus de 1 750 logements abordables que Desjardins rendra disponibles en trois ans.\nEn date du 31 mars 2025, huit projets totalisant 1 190 logements sont en exploitation et onze projets totalisant 772 logements sont en r\u00e9alisation, comme le projet annonc\u00e9 aujourd'hui.\nSur la totalit\u00e9 des projets, 75 % seront de nouvelles constructions, alors que 25 % seront des immeubles r\u00e9nov\u00e9s et acquis par des OBNL dans le but de p\u00e9renniser l'abordabilit\u00e9 des loyers.\nCitations :\n\u00ab Je l'ai dit souvent : il faut innover pour construire plus et mieux, surtout en contexte de crise du logement. Cette collaboration avec Desjardins est encore une preuve que notre gouvernement agit concr\u00e8tement, de pair avec les municipalit\u00e9s et les organismes d'habitation, pour mieux loger les Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et les Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois vivant avec un revenu faible ou modeste. Le partenariat avec Desjardins m'emballe, car il mobilise l'expertise des parties prenantes pour construire des logements de qualit\u00e9 et abordables dans des d\u00e9lais tr\u00e8s rapides. Je suis r\u00e9solue \u00e0 livrer des r\u00e9sultats \u00e0 travers ce partenariat, et la r\u00e9alisation du projet de Toit d'Abord en est un excellent exemple! \u00bb\nFrance-\u00c9laine Duranceau, ministre responsable de l'Habitation\n\u00ab Offrir plus de logements de qualit\u00e9 et \u00e0 un prix abordable est une mission envers laquelle notre gouvernement s'est engag\u00e9 afin de mieux loger les Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et les Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Gr\u00e2ce aux nouveaux logements abordables qui sont en cours de construction en Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, ce sont des dizaines de familles qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront tr\u00e8s bient\u00f4t d'un chez-soi o\u00f9 elles se sentiront en s\u00e9curit\u00e9, accomplies, et surtout, elles seront rassur\u00e9es d'avoir un loyer \u00e0 l'abri du march\u00e9 sp\u00e9culatif. Je me r\u00e9jouis de cette autre merveilleuse nouvelle! \u00bb\nSuzanne Roy, ministre de la Famille, ministre responsable de la r\u00e9gion de la Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie et d\u00e9put\u00e9e de Verch\u00e8res\n\u00ab Le projet Toit D'Abord repr\u00e9sente une r\u00e9ponse tangible aux besoins des familles de notre r\u00e9gion. En r\u00e9unissant les forces de partenaires engag\u00e9s, nous cr\u00e9ons des milieux de vie accessibles, ancr\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de notre r\u00e9gion. Ce type d'initiative d\u00e9montre qu'en travaillant ensemble, on peut b\u00e2tir des projets concrets qui am\u00e9liorent r\u00e9ellement la qualit\u00e9 de vie de nos citoyens.\u00bb\nMarilyne Picard, d\u00e9put\u00e9e de Soulanges\n\u00ab Nous sommes fiers d'accueillir ici, \u00e0 Vaudreuil-Dorion, le premier projet de logements abordables de la r\u00e9gion, qui va permettre \u00e0 une douzaine de familles de se loger \u00e0 un prix d\u00e9cent. Avec nos diff\u00e9rents partenaires, nous avons innov\u00e9 par la mise en place de balises facilitant la cr\u00e9ation de projets comme celui de la rue Saint-Michel. Ces initiatives nous ont d'ailleurs permis de remporter le prestigieux prix Joseph-Beaubien de l'Union des municipalit\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec en 2024. L'accessibilit\u00e9 aux logements est un enjeu majeur \u00e0 la grandeur du Qu\u00e9bec. Toit d'Abord Vaudreuil-Soulanges est un mod\u00e8le transposable pour toute ville voulant d\u00e9velopper des projets d'habitation \u00e0 prix abordable. Nous souhaitons qu'il puisse inspirer les organisations et que voient le jour d'autres projets dans la r\u00e9gion, mais aussi partout au Qu\u00e9bec. \u00bb\nGuy Pilon, maire de Vaudreuil-Dorion\n\u00ab Le sujet des tarifs de l'administration am\u00e9ricaine tend \u00e0 \u00e9clipser celui de la crise du logement au Qu\u00e9bec, qui est toujours pr\u00e9sente. Mais je tiens \u00e0 vous assurer que nous, chez Desjardins, on travaille activement sur les deux plans. On poursuit la construction de nombreux logements, pour soutenir les familles et les travailleurs partout dans la province. Ces logements sont une autre d\u00e9monstration concr\u00e8te de nos efforts et de l'efficacit\u00e9 de notre mod\u00e8le de guichet unique, qui nous permet de mobiliser rapidement les ressources n\u00e9cessaires et d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la livraison des projets. \u00bb\nGuy Cormier, pr\u00e9sident et chef de la direction du Mouvement Desjardins\n\u00ab C'est avec une immense fiert\u00e9 et une profonde conviction que nous annon\u00e7ons le lancement du tout premier projet de Toit d'Abord, une initiative porteuse d'espoir et d'avenir pour notre r\u00e9gion. Ce projet-vitrine, avec ses loyers bien en-dessous des prix du march\u00e9, est con\u00e7u avec soin pour r\u00e9pondre concr\u00e8tement aux besoins des m\u00e9nages \u00e0 revenu modeste. Les familles y trouveront des logements de qualit\u00e9, comprenant 2 ou 3 chambres \u00e0 coucher, et les personnes vivant avec des d\u00e9fis particuliers profiteront de ses 4 unit\u00e9s adaptables en rez-de-chauss\u00e9e. Ce mod\u00e8le fond\u00e9 sur la solidarit\u00e9, l'innovation sociale et la p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 de l'abordabilit\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente un jalon important dans notre lutte collective contre la crise du logement. Il incarne notre volont\u00e9 d'offrir des milieux de vie inclusifs, accessibles et durables, int\u00e9gr\u00e9s \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 des services essentiels. D'autres d\u00e9veloppements sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours dans plusieurs municipalit\u00e9s de la MRC de Vaudreuil-Soulanges. Ce projet du 15 Saint-Michel est le tremplin et le symbole d'un mouvement r\u00e9gional r\u00e9solument tourn\u00e9 vers un avenir plus juste et plus inclusif, o\u00f9 chacun et chacune peut habiter dignement, peu importe ses moyens. Nous nous f\u00e9licitons de l'appui d\u00e9terminant de partenaires engag\u00e9s, dont Desjardins, la ville de Vaudreuil-Dorion et les 22 autres municipalit\u00e9s de la MRC de Vaudreuil-Soulanges. \u00bb\nGenevi\u00e8ve Lachance, pr\u00e9sidente de Toit d'Abord\n\u00c0 propos de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'habitation du Qu\u00e9bec\nEn tant que r\u00e9f\u00e9rence en habitation, la SHQ a pour mission de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins en habitation des citoyens du Qu\u00e9bec par son expertise et ses services aux citoyens.

Encore aujourd\u2019hui, des solutions concr\u00e8tes existent d\u00e9j\u00e0, des solutions qu\u2019il est urgent de propulser.

L\u2019avenir ressemblera \u00e0 ce que nous en ferons et, par cette d\u00e9claration, nous affirmons que nous exercerons notre leadership afin que, d\u2019ici 2050, nous puissions, \u00e0 l\u2019aide de nouveaux outils dont nous nous doterons, contribuer au changement de logique \u00e9conomique au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des aspirations de toutes les communaut\u00e9s dans toutes les r\u00e9gions.\nRassembl\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al les 14 et 15 mai 2025, une grande diversit\u00e9 d\u2019acteurs \u00e9conomiques, culturels, environnementaux, politiques, communautaires et de la recherche affirment d\u2019une seule voix que face \u00e0 un statu quo \u00e9conomique qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 des d\u00e9gradations sociales et environnementales, l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale, ancr\u00e9e dans les communaut\u00e9s et au service du bien-\u00eatre collectif, repr\u00e9sente une solution incontournable pour construire une \u00e9conomie au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et dans le respect de la plan\u00e8te, une \u00e9conomie qui travaille pour nous.\nEn s\u2019inspirant des grands chantiers du pass\u00e9 qui ont fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 le Qu\u00e9bec contemporain, les personnes pr\u00e9sentes au Sommet invitent tout le Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 contribuer \u00e0 ce mouvement de l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale afin non seulement de r\u00e9pondre aux enjeux et r\u00e9alit\u00e9s vari\u00e9s du territoire, mais aussi de contribuer \u00e0 la transformation de nouveaux secteurs de l\u2019\u00e9conomie en se dotant d\u2019objectifs pour les 25 prochaines ann\u00e9es. En 2050, l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale sera un des piliers d\u2019un Qu\u00e9bec plus r\u00e9silient, inclusif, juste et durable. Pour ce faire, nous voulons :\nAffirmer le r\u00f4le incontournable de l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale comme moteur de la vitalit\u00e9 territoriale et l\u2019importance de renforcer nos capacit\u00e9s de coconstruction pour des d\u00e9cisions Pertinentes, structurantes et durables.\nEn collaborant \u00e0 la transformation des milieux par la mise en place et le renforcement d\u2019options r\u00e9sidentielles adapt\u00e9es aux besoins changeants de la population vieillissante, l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale permet aux personnes a\u00een\u00e9es de vieillir dans leur milieu, tout en prot\u00e9geant les c\u0153urs villageois.\nEn favorisant et g\u00e9n\u00e9rant des outils pour l\u2019\u00e9mergence de r\u00e9ponses aux besoins locaux, incluant la reprise collective d\u2019entreprises, le d\u00e9veloppement de nouveaux produits et services par les entreprises existantes et l\u2019expression de la culture locale, l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale soutient la vitalit\u00e9 de nos r\u00e9gions.\nAssurer un leadership structurant de l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale dans davantage de secteurs \u00e9conomiques pour changer la logique dominante insoutenable sur les plans sociaux, environnementaux et \u00e9conomiques, en d\u00e9veloppant des pratiques innovantes, et en se dotant d\u2019outils adapt\u00e9s et de nouveaux capitaux Pour les soutenir.\nNos mati\u00e8res sont moins enfouies, plus r\u00e9employ\u00e9es et les capitaux g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00e9conomie lin\u00e9aire sont utilis\u00e9s pour b\u00e2tir une \u00e9conomie circulaire.\nDes entreprises d\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale contribuent significativement \u00e0 assurer l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 une alimentation saine, durable et locale \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble de la population qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise.\nDevenir un moteur de la transition sociale et \u00e9cologique en collaborant avec des acteurs de tous les horizons pour favoriser la d\u00e9mocratisation de notre \u00e9conomie et une transition vers des mod\u00e8les d'affaires aux retomb\u00e9es durables et \u00e9quitables.\nLa place importante de l'\u00e9conomie sociale dans certains secteurs, par exemple en logement o\u00f9 elle atteint 20%, cr\u00e9e un contre-pouvoir dans le march\u00e9 immobilier, favorisant l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9silience.\nLes entreprises collectives d\u00e9montrent que la gouvernance d\u00e9mocratique est un v\u00e9hicule puissant pour arbitrer entre les imp\u00e9ratifs \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et environnementaux dans un contexte de crises multiples.\nCr\u00e9er un mouvement et une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 empreinte de solidarit\u00e9 \u00e0 travers nos actions en faveur de l'insertion et de l'inclusion et par le r\u00f4le des entreprises afin qu\u2019elles deviennent des employeurs exemplaires, par leurs pratiques favorisant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des genres, par leur souci d\u2019int\u00e9grer, renforcer, \u00e9lever et inclure les personnes qui apportent des perspectives diversifi\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019image de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nEn assurant des mod\u00e8les entrepreneuriaux collectifs qui g\u00e9n\u00e8rent des emplois durables et pertinents, ainsi que des milieux de travail empreints de justice, l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale suscite des changements soci\u00e9taux profonds.\nC\u2019est avec une profonde conviction pour cette vision que pr\u00e8s de 1 500 personnes se sont d\u00e9plac\u00e9es de partout au Qu\u00e9bec pour s\u2019inspirer, se coordonner et renforcer leurs ambitions et leurs capacit\u00e9s d\u2019action collective dans toutes les r\u00e9gions.\nLa jeunesse se mobilise \u00e9galement et se saisit de l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale afin de trouver des solutions \u00e0 la hauteur des d\u00e9fis et qui changent nos perspectives de d\u00e9veloppement futur. Le message des jeunes au Sommet est clair : le Qu\u00e9bec doit changer de logique \u00e9conomique et privil\u00e9gier l\u2019autonomie des communaut\u00e9s, l\u2019entraide, la solidarit\u00e9 et l\u2019adoption d\u2019une vision non lucrative pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins essentiels. La jeunesse pr\u00e9sente au Sommet en appelle \u00e0 une transformation du syst\u00e8me \u00e9conomique et \u00e0 ce que le mouvement qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de l'\u00e9conomie sociale, tout en \u00e9tant non partisan, s\u2019affirme comme un acteur politique.\nL\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale participe \u00e0 d\u00e9mocratiser l\u2019\u00e9conomie en renfor\u00e7ant le dialogue social dans les entreprises et dans les territoires et contribue ainsi \u00e0 la construction d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 plus r\u00e9siliente. L\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale n\u2019est pas qu\u2019un mod\u00e8le de d\u00e9veloppement, c\u2019est aussi une fa\u00e7on de rendre notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 capable de faire face aux chocs et d\u2019innover pour b\u00e2tir des solutions collectives \u00e0 nos d\u00e9fis communs. En s\u2019appuyant sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 collective et une gouvernance d\u00e9mocratique, l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale construit un mod\u00e8le qui nous rassemble et qui nous ressemble. Une \u00e9conomie qui travaille pour nous.\nLes personnes r\u00e9unies au Sommet de l\u2019\u00e9conomie sociale d\u00e9clarent avec confiance et fiert\u00e9 que la mise en \u0153uvre de cette vision est possible et r\u00e9aliste d\u2019ici 2050. Ensemble, nous invitons les acteurs de changement, les groupes sociaux et les partis politiques \u00e0 se joindre \u00e0 ce chantier qui vise la construction d'une v\u00e9ritable \u00e9conomie inclusive, d\u00e9mocratique, \u00e9cologique et transformatrice. Cette \u00e9conomie existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 et nous allons la mener plus loin. Collectivement, nous nous engageons en faveur d\u2019une \u00e9conomie qui travaille pour nous."

Les travaux d\u00e9buteront au cours des prochaines semaines.\nLe projet sera financ\u00e9 dans le cadre de l'Initiative Logement abordable Desjardins, un partenariat novateur entre le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec et Desjardins pour la cr\u00e9ation rapide de 1 750 logements abordables.\nLe montage financier, d'un peu plus de 5,8 M$, regroupe des investissements du gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec de plus de 3 M$, des contributions publiques et priv\u00e9es ainsi que le don du terrain par la Ville. Pour sa part, Desjardins contribue au projet pour un peu plus de 275 000 $ en capital patient et 24 000 $ du Fonds d'aide au d\u00e9veloppement du milieu de la Caisse Desjardins de Charlevoix-Est. Un pr\u00eat hypoth\u00e9caire compl\u00e8te le montage financier.\nLe projet d'habitation a pour but de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la communaut\u00e9 et des employeurs de la r\u00e9gion. Il pr\u00e9voit 24 logements abordables pour loger des familles \u00e0 faible revenu qui souhaitent s'\u00e9tablir \u00e0 La Malbaie. Les loyers mensuels doivent respecter la grille de loyers m\u00e9dians du march\u00e9 de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'habitation du Qu\u00e9bec. Les premiers locataires devraient emm\u00e9nager \u00e0 l'hiver 2026.\n\u00c0 propos de l'Initiative Logement abordable Desjardins\nEn 2022, le gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec confiait 175 M$ \u00e0 Desjardins pour cr\u00e9er 1 000 nouveaux logements sociaux et abordables d'ici la fin 2025, lesquels seraient le fruit de projets d'habitation r\u00e9partis dans 14 r\u00e9gions du Qu\u00e9bec. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, Desjardins devait rendre disponible une somme de 150 M$ en financement et en capital patient, avec l'appui de Capital r\u00e9gional et coop\u00e9ratif Desjardins, aux organismes porteurs des projets. Ceux-ci s'engageaient \u00e0 assurer l'abordabilit\u00e9 des logements pour une p\u00e9riode allant jusqu'\u00e0 35 ans.\nGr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'expertise de son \u00e9quipe d\u00e9di\u00e9e aux logements abordables et \u00e0 son vaste r\u00e9seau de caisses et de Centre Desjardins Entreprises, Desjardins a vu cet objectif \u00eatre rapidement surpass\u00e9 pour rendre disponibles plus de 2 000 logements abordables d'ici la fin de 2025. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un mod\u00e8le de guichet unique Desjardins est en mesure de solliciter les promoteurs, les coop\u00e9ratives d'habitation, les organismes communautaires et les acteurs municipaux pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le d\u00e9veloppement de projets menant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation ou \u00e0 la r\u00e9novation de logements abordables.\nDevant cette efficacit\u00e9, en d\u00e9cembre 2023, Qu\u00e9bec a ajout\u00e9 une somme de 43,75 M$ \u00e0 l'enveloppe initiale octroy\u00e9e \u00e0 Desjardins afin que soient cr\u00e9\u00e9s 250 logements abordables additionnels. Par cons\u00e9quent, ce sont plus de 1 750 logements abordables que Desjardins rendra disponibles en trois ans.\nEn date du 31 mars 2025, huit projets totalisant 1 190 logements sont en exploitation et onze projets totalisant 772 logements sont en r\u00e9alisation comme le projet de la Coop\u00e9rative de d\u00e9veloppement immobilier de Charlevoix.\nSur la totalit\u00e9 des projets, 75 % seront de nouvelles constructions, comme le projet de la Coop\u00e9rative de d\u00e9veloppement immobilier de Charlevoix, alors que 25 % seront des immeubles r\u00e9nov\u00e9s et acquis par des OBNL dans le but de p\u00e9renniser l'abordabilit\u00e9 des loyers.\nCitations :\n\u00ab Je l'ai dit souvent : il faut innover pour construire plus et mieux, surtout en contexte de crise du logement. Cette collaboration avec Desjardins est encore une preuve que notre gouvernement agit concr\u00e8tement, de pair avec les municipalit\u00e9s et les organismes d'habitation, pour mieux loger les Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et les Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois vivant avec un revenu faible ou modeste.

      "text": "Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative: A strong partnership to deliver 1,000 additional affordable housing units across Quebec\nThe Government of Quebec, the Government of Canada and Desjardins are pleased to announce the creation of 1,000 new affordable housing units over the next three years. These units will be created as part of the Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative. This partnership was launched in 2022 and will deliver more than 3,000 units by 2028.\nAlmost $184 million in funding has been earmarked for these 1,000 new units. Part of this funding will come from the Housing Accelerator Fund (HAF), under which the Government of Canada will provide Quebec with $900 million to accelerate the construction of residential units in the province, along with an additional $900 million investment announced by the Government of Quebec during its fall 2023 economic update. Desjardins has committed to granting nearly $50 million in mortgage financing or patient capital to community developers.\nWith its one-stop shop model and extensive network of caisses and Desjardins Business centres, Desjardins can support community developers such as housing cooperatives, community organizations and municipal stakeholders to identify and qualify projects to accelerate the creation of affordable housing.\n\u201cThe housing crisis requires a strong, quick and coordinated response. This renewed partnership demonstrates that together, we can deliver real, large-scale results that have a real impact on people\u2019s lives. At Desjardins, we see access to affordable housing as a key driver to build stronger, more equitable and more people-focused communities. By adding 1,000 affordable housing units to our roadmap, we\u2019re continuing our commitment to supporting families, workers and communities across Quebec\u201d, said Guy Cormier, President and CEO of Desjardins Group\nProjects taking shape\n- As at May 31, 2025, there were nine projects totalling 1,198 housing units underway, plus another 908 housing units under construction.\n- These projects are located across 14 Quebec regions.\nThe Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative was launched in 2022 under an innovative partnership between the Quebec government and Desjardins. Its initial target was the creation of 1,000 affordable housing units by the end of 2025.\nThanks to the expertise of its dedicated team, Desjardins has quickly surpassed the goal set out in the initial agreement and raised it to more than 2,000 units.\nThe second agreement signed with the Government of Quebec in partnership with the Government of Canada is a clear indicator of Desjardins\u2019s leadership in tackling the housing crisis.\nIn just six years, this partnership will make more than 3,000 affordable housing units available across the province and ensure their affordability for at least 35 years.\nQuotes:\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud that partnering with Desjardins is making a real difference. This proves that by working together with the Government of Canada, municipalities, and housing organizations, we\u2019re able to quickly deliver quality affordable housing for Quebecers who need it most. We\u2019re innovating, we\u2019re thinking outside the box, and we\u2019re working hard to respond to the housing crisis. Our government is committed to doing things differently to building more and building better.\u201d\nFrance-\u00c9laine Duranceau, Minister Responsible for Housing\n\u201cOur government is implementing a series of measures to help double residential construction rates across the country. We\u2019re going to make housing more affordable by harnessing the power of public-private cooperation. Working with the Quebec government and Desjardins brings us closer to our goal to provide more affordable housing to Quebecers.\u201d\nThe Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure\n\u201cThe major partnership with Desjardins has proven its value in the field. It reinforces the SHQ\u2019s housing efforts by allowing us to work hand in hand with our partners to provide more affordable housing to those who need it most\u2014families, seniors, single people\u2014throughout Quebec.\u201d\nJean Martel, President and CEO, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019habitation du Qu\u00e9bec"

At the end of 2024, seven housing projects with a total of 1,182 units had been completed and another 12 housing projects with a total of 780 units were under construction.\nGouvernance\nTo support sound governance and continuous improvement, Desjardins officially separated the duties of the Chair of the Board and the President and CEO. This decision reflects the best practices applicable to the financial sector.\nRemaining true to the values it has held for 125 years, Desjardins is committed to setting ambitious targets to create a more sustainable, supportive and compassionate future for generations to come.\nFor more information, see Desjardins Group\u2019s ESG reports on Desjardins.com"

      "text": "Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative: A strong partnership to deliver 1,000 additional affordable housing units across Quebec\nThe Government of Quebec, the Government of Canada and Desjardins are pleased to announce the creation of 1,000 new affordable housing units over the next three years. These units will be created as part of the Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative. This partnership was launched in 2022 and will deliver more than 3,000 units by 2028.\nAlmost $184 million in funding has been earmarked for these 1,000 new units. Part of this funding will come from the Housing Accelerator Fund (HAF), under which the Government of Canada will provide Quebec with $900 million to accelerate the construction of residential units in the province, along with an additional $900 million investment announced by the Government of Quebec during its fall 2023 economic update. Desjardins has committed to granting nearly $50 million in mortgage financing or patient capital to community developers.\nWith its one-stop shop model and extensive network of caisses and Desjardins Business centres, Desjardins can support community developers such as housing cooperatives, community organizations and municipal stakeholders to identify and qualify projects to accelerate the creation of affordable housing.\n\u201cThe housing crisis requires a strong, quick and coordinated response. This renewed partnership demonstrates that together, we can deliver real, large-scale results that have a real impact on people\u2019s lives. At Desjardins, we see access to affordable housing as a key driver to build stronger, more equitable and more people-focused communities. By adding 1,000 affordable housing units to our roadmap, we\u2019re continuing our commitment to supporting families, workers and communities across Quebec\u201d, said Guy Cormier, President and CEO of Desjardins Group\nProjects taking shape\n- As at May 31, 2025, there were nine projects totalling 1,198 housing units underway, plus another 908 housing units under construction.\n- These projects are located across 14 Quebec regions.\nThe Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative was launched in 2022 under an innovative partnership between the Quebec government and Desjardins. Its initial target was the creation of 1,000 affordable housing units by the end of 2025.\nThanks to the expertise of its dedicated team, Desjardins has quickly surpassed the goal set out in the initial agreement and raised it to more than 2,000 units.\nThe second agreement signed with the Government of Quebec in partnership with the Government of Canada is a clear indicator of Desjardins\u2019s leadership in tackling the housing crisis.\nIn just six years, this partnership will make more than 3,000 affordable housing units available across the province and ensure their affordability for at least 35 years.\nQuotes:\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud that partnering with Desjardins is making a real difference. This proves that by working together with the Government of Canada, municipalities, and housing organizations, we\u2019re able to quickly deliver quality affordable housing for Quebecers who need it most. We\u2019re innovating, we\u2019re thinking outside the box, and we\u2019re working hard to respond to the housing crisis. Our government is committed to doing things differently to building more and building better.\u201d\nFrance-\u00c9laine Duranceau, Minister Responsible for Housing\n\u201cOur government is implementing a series of measures to help double residential construction rates across the country. We\u2019re going to make housing more affordable by harnessing the power of public-private cooperation. Working with the Quebec government and Desjardins brings us closer to our goal to provide more affordable housing to Quebecers.\u201d\nThe Honourable Gregor Robertson, Minister of Housing and Infrastructure\n\u201cThe major partnership with Desjardins has proven its value in the field. It reinforces the SHQ\u2019s housing efforts by allowing us to work hand in hand with our partners to provide more affordable housing to those who need it most\u2014families, seniors, single people\u2014throughout Quebec.\u201d\nJean Martel, President and CEO, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019habitation du Qu\u00e9bec"

He will step into this role on September 2, 2025. Until then, Guy Cormier will continue to lead Desjardins Group, with the full powers granted to the president and CEO. He will also ensure a seamless transition in leadership, supporting Denis Dubois and the board of directors as a strategic advisor from September 2, 2025, to March 2026.\nMr. Dubois is a credentialed actuary and has been with Desjardins since 2003. He\u2019s served as the Executive Vice-President of Wealth Management and Life and Health Insurance since 2019, before which he was the Executive Vice-President of Property and Casualty Insurance. Three of Desjardins Group\u2019s five business sectors have therefore already been under his charge at some point. Mr. Dubois is a visionary leader, known for his engaging management style. He\u2019s made significant contributions to Desjardins\u2019s sustainable growth across Canada, including two major transactions that have helped consolidate Desjardins Group\u2019s position as a key industry player: first, the acquisition of State Farm\u2019s Canadian operations, and more recently, the integration of Guardian Capital Group Limited\u2019s insurance, mutual fund and securities distribution activities. He is also very active within a number of industry associations and has a strong belief in philanthropy.\n\u201cDenis Dubois is an outstanding leader. His extensive experience and clear, inspiring vision for Desjardins\u2019s future puts people first and will give us a renewed push forward,\u201d said Louis Babineau, Chair of the Board of Directors. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have him as president and chief executive officer. We\u2019re confident that he\u2019ll continue to grow Desjardins and advance our strategic plan, to the benefit of the 7.8 million members and clients we support on their journey to financial empowerment.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful for the trust the board has placed in me, and I\u2019m truly honoured to take on this exciting and meaningful challenge,\u201d said Denis Dubois. \u201cDesjardins is more than a cooperative financial group. It\u2019s a driver of socio-economic activity. It\u2019s a strong, present organization that, for 125 years, has helped make our society more innovative and inclusive, so that everyone can achieve their goals. And the vision I have for Desjardins involves everyone in the organization focused on a sole aim: listening to and supporting our members and clients. Each day, I\u2019ll be working with a large team of skilled people who are committed to solidarity and determined to give Desjardins a renewed push forward. It\u2019s a privilege to follow in Guy Cormier\u2019s footsteps, and I\u2019d like to thank him for his immense contribution.\u201d\nMr. Babineau also acknowledged Guy Cormier\u2019s commitment to Desjardins. \u201cOn behalf of the board of directors, I\u2019d like to thank Mr. Cormier for his inspiring leadership and unwavering dedication to Desjardins\u2019s future. I\u2019d also like to thank him for his vision and energy, and for his close collaboration in implementing our new governance model.\u201d\nThe new governance model for Desjardins leadership\nIn March 2024, the role and duties of the chair of the board of directors were separated from those of the president and CEO of Desjardins Group. As announced in May 2024, Louis Babineau was then elected chair of the Desjardins Group Board of Directors. With the appointment of Denis Dubois, the implementation of Desjardins Group\u2019s new governance model is now complete."

This fund\u2019s objective is to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing tactically in exchange-traded funds which themselves invest in fixed-income and equity securities throughout the world.\nSimplifying the solutions in the Desjardins portfolio lineup\nDI is also announcing that it intends to merge certain Melodia and Chorus II portfolios after the close of business at 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) on or around September 12, 2025.\nIn the case of each Merger, a portfolio (a \u201cTerminating Fund\u201d) will be merged into another portfolio (a \u201cContinuing Fund\u201d). Unitholders of a Terminating Fund will automatically become unitholders of a Continuing Fund. The proposed mergers reflect the Manager\u2019s desire to structure its Melodia and Chorus II portfolios as efficiently as possible, and to simplify its lineup of investments solutions so that investors and advisors can find their way around more easily.\nOn or around September 16, 2025, once the mergers and other changes are complete, the Continuing Portfolios will be renamed the Desjardins Active Strategy Portfolios:\nFor each merger, the Continuing Fund has essentially similar investment objectives, valuation procedures and fee structures as the Terminating Fund. In addition, management fees for units in the Continuing Fund will be the same as or lower than those for units in the Terminating Fund.\nThese mergers have been approved by the Desjardins Funds\u2019 Independent Review Committee and will be carried out on a tax-deferred basis. In addition, DI believes that each merger is in the best interests of the unitholders involved.\nChanges to the Desjardins Funds lineup leading up to the merger\n- Lower management fees for certain classes of Desjardins Funds units\nAs part of the changes announced above, DI is announcing a reduction of the management fees for each unit classes of the Funds indicated in the table below, effective on or around September 12, 2025.\n- Partial closure of certain Melodia and Chorus II portfolios\nAhead of the merger to simplify its product lineup, DI intends to partially close the Terminating Funds.

They will include amending the adjustments to the weighting of the indices that make up the blended benchmark of each Fund to calculate the portfolios' standard deviation.\n- Lower investment minimum for Chorus II Portfolios\nOn or around April 23, 2025, DI will lower the initial minimum purchase amount and the minimum account balance for investments in Chorus II Portfolios to bring them in line with Desjardins Investments\u2019 other investment solutions.\nThis means that the minimum investment for a Chorus II Portfolio will drop from $100,000 to $500.

      "text": "Desjardins posts surplus earnings of $900 million for the second quarter of 2025 and surpasses $500 billion in assets Fran\u00e7ais\nFinancial results for the second quarter of 2025\nL\u00c9VIS, QC, Aug. 12, 2025 /CNW/ - For the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, Desjardins Group, North America's largest financial cooperative group, recorded surplus earnings before member dividends of $900 million, compared to $918 million for the comparable period of 2024. This decrease in surplus earnings was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, due in particular to unfavourable developments in the economic outlook, related to the potential impact of trade disruptions. However, the Personal and Business Services segment benefited from higher net interest income, mainly tied to growth in the loan portfolio, which, among other things, allowed the Group to surpass $500 billion in assets. To support this sustained growth, Desjardins Group expanded its presence on international financing markets by issuing subordinated debt in Swiss francs and yen. Lastly, it should be noted that non-interest expense increased due to investments aimed at supporting business growth and enhancing the services offered to members and clients.\nFor the second quarter of 2025, the provision for member dividends totalled $113 million, up $3 million from the comparable period of 2024. Sponsorships, donations and scholarships amounted to $34 million, of which $17 million came from the caisses' Community Development Fund.\nFor the first six months ended June 30, 2025, Desjardins Group recorded surplus earnings before dividends of $1,638 million, down $135 million from the same period of 2024. This decrease in surplus earnings was primarily due to the results of the Property and Casualty Insurance segment, which were affected by higher claims expenses as a result of increases in both the frequency and the average cost of claims. There was also an increase in the provision for credit losses, due in particular to unfavourable developments in the economic outlook related to the potential impact of trade disruptions. However, the Personal and Business Services segment benefited from an increase in net interest income, related primarily to business growth. Lastly, we would like to point out that the increase in non-interest expense stemmed from investments aimed at supporting growth in operations and enhancing the services offered to members and clients.\n\"This year, in the 125th anniversary year of its founding, Desjardins has surpassed $500 billion in assets, demonstrating its ambition and how it has stayed close to members and clients,\" said Guy Cormier, President and CEO of Desjardins Group. \"Desjardins continues to deliver remarkable performance. These results demonstrate the financial solidity of our cooperative model, as well as the unwavering commitment of our teams to supporting our members and clients. I wish my successor, Denis Dubois, the very best for continued growth and development of Desjardins Group.\"\nDesjardins Group announces the appointment of its new President and CEO\nOn June 2, the Board of Directors announced the appointment of Denis Dubois as the next President and CEO of Desjardins Group, effective September 2, 2025. He will succeed Guy Cormier, who has held this position since March 2016. Mr. Cormier will ensure a seamless transition in leadership, supporting Denis Dubois and the Board of Directors as a strategic advisor from September 2, 2025, to March 2026.\nAffordable housing: concrete solutions for thousands of households\nThrough an innovative partnership with the Qu\u00e9bec government, the Desjardins Affordable Housing Initiative, launched in 2022, continues to demonstrate its commitment to fighting the housing crisis. After surpassing its initial goal of 1,000 affordable housing units, Desjardins is taking another major step forward with a second agreement, this time in collaboration with the Qu\u00e9bec and Canadian governments. The new agreement will enable the creation of 1,000 additional housing units, bringing the total number of affordable units made available across 14 regions of Qu\u00e9bec to more than 3,000 by 2028.\nAs of June 30, 2025, 1,373 units were already in operation and 894 more were under construction, particularly in the Beauce, Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, Outaouais and Charlevoix (in French only) regions. These achievements confirm the key role Desjardins is playing in the development of sustainable and inclusive.\nDesjardins makes investing easier with a revamped offering and a 100% Qu\u00e9bec fund\nSimplified fund lineup\nIn an unrelenting effort to meet the changing requirements of its members and clients, Desjardins Investments Inc., as manager of Desjardins Funds, has significantly simplified its mutual fund offering. This initiative aims to provide a simpler, more accessible and advantageous investment experience, while promoting financial empowerment.\n100% Qu\u00e9bec fund\nLast June, Desjardins Investment Inc., acting as an exchange-traded funds (ETF) manager, launched the Desjardins Qu\u00e9bec Equity ETF. This new ETF allows investors to support publicly traded Qu\u00e9bec companies and is part of the company's commitment to supporting the local economy.\nUnique program to support social economy projects in Qu\u00e9bec\nDesjardins is opening a new chapter in its support for the social economy. In partnership with Sillons (in French only), a non-profit organization that aspires to scale up social innovations, a unique program is being launched to support up to six promising projects over a 24-month period. By combining Sillons's on-the-ground expertise and Desjardins's impact in the community, this partnership meets a need that was strongly expressed at the last Sommet de l'\u00e9conomie sociale (in French only).\nDesjardins takes action for a fair and sustainable transition\nDesjardins is continuing its efforts toward a fair and sustainable transition, as evidenced by its 2024 ESG disclosures, published in May 2025. The document outlines the Group's commitments to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. During this period, Desjardins reached the $2 billion mark in investment in renewable energy infrastructure, issued its first green bond on the European market, and actively supported equity, diversity and inclusion.\nFinancial highlights\nComparison of second quarter 2025 with second quarter 2024:\n- Surplus earnings before member dividends of $900 million, down $18 million.\n- Total net revenue of $4,091 million, up $338 million, or 9.0%:\n- Net interest income of $2,024 million, up $163 million, or 8.8%, mainly due to growth in average residential mortgages and business loans outstanding.\n- Insurance service result of $593 million, down $27 million, or 4.4%, due to increased claims expenses in the Property and Casualty Insurance segment.\n- Net insurance finance result of $312 million, up $75 million, or 31.6%, due to favourable developments in the financial markets, particularly in equities markets.\n- Other income of $1,162 million, up $127 million, or 12.3%, related to growth in assets under management and assets under administration.\n- Provision for credit losses of $203 million, compared to $87 million for the comparable period in 2024.

It is defined as follows:\nReturn to members and the community\nAs a cooperative financial group contributing to the development of communities, Desjardins Group gives its members and clients the support they need to be financially empowered.

As at June 30, 2025, its Tier 1A and total capital ratios stood at 22.9% and 25.5%, respectively, compared to 22.2% and 24.2%, respectively, as at December 31, 2024.\nAnalysis of business segment results\nPERSONAL AND BUSINESS SERVICES SEGMENT\nResults for the second quarter\nFor the second quarter of 2025, surplus earnings before member dividends were $370 million, down $66 million from the same period in 2024. This segment benefited from the growth in net interest income and other income related to business growth. Furthermore, the increase in non-interest expense stems from investments made to support growth in operations and enhance the services offered to members and clients, and drove the decrease in surplus earnings. In addition, the provision for credit losses was higher than in the comparable period in 2024.\nWEALTH MANAGEMENT AND LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE SEGMENT\nResults for the second quarter\nFor the second quarter of 2025, the segment posted $226 million in net surplus earnings, down $20 million compared to the corresponding period of 2024. This decrease was due in particular to the gain in 2024 on disposal of the interest in Fiera Holdings Inc. and Fiera Capital LP as well as the increase in administrative expenses and investments related to continued implementation of strategic projects. This decrease was partly offset by increases in the net insurance finance result and the net insurance service result, while the results for the prior period had been negatively affected by the updating of actuarial assumptions.\nPROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE SEGMENT\nResults for the second quarter\nFor the second quarter of 2025, the segment posted $307 million in net surplus earnings, up $13 million, from the same period of 2024, primarily due to higher insurance revenue that was mainly on account of growth in automobile and property insurance premiums and to business arising from the 2024 acquisition of The Insurance Company of Prince Edward Island. In addition, the segment posted growth in its net insurance finance result. The increase in surplus earnings was partly offset by three major events in the second quarter of 2025: water and wind damage in Ontario, wind damage in Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario, and a forest fire in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, whereas no catastrophes or major events occurred during the corresponding quarter of 2024.\nOTHER CATEGORY\nResults for the second quarter\nFor the second quarter of 2025, the Other category posted a net deficit of $3 million, compared to a net deficit of $58 million in the second quarter of 2024. The Other category includes mainly treasury activities.\nMore detailed financial information can be found in Desjardins Group's interim Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the second quarter of 2025, available on the Desjardins website or on the SEDAR+ website, at www.sedarplus.com (under the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des caisses Desjardins du Qu\u00e9bec profile).\nAbout Desjardins Group\nDesjardins Group is the largest cooperative financial group in North America and the sixth largest in the world, with assets of $501.3 billion as at June 30, 2025. It has been named one of the top employers in Canada by both Forbes magazine and Mediacorp. It has also been recognized as one of the World's Best Banks 2025 by Forbes.

In 2025, Desjardins Group is celebrating its 125th anniversary, marking more than a century of focusing its ambitions and expertise on being there for members and clients.\nCaution concerning forward-looking statements\nDesjardins Group's public communications often include oral or written forward-looking statements, within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, particularly in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada and the United States. This press release contains forward-looking statements that may be incorporated in other filings with Canadian regulators or in any other communications. In addition, Desjardins Group's representatives may make verbal forward-looking statements to investors, the media and others.\nThe forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, comments on Desjardins Group's objectives regarding financial performance, priorities, vision, operations, targets and commitments, its strategies to achieve them, its results and its financial position, economic as well as financial market conditions, the outlook for the Qu\u00e9bec, Canadian, U.S. and global economies, and the regulatory environment in which we operate. Such forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as \"target,\" \"objective,\" \"timing,\" \"outlook,\" \"believe,\" \"predict,\" \"foresee,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"have as a goal,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"forecast,\" \"anticipate,\" \"aim,\" \"propose,\" \"should\" and \"may,\" words and expressions of similar import, and future and conditional verbs, in all grammatical variants.\nBy their very nature, such statements require us to make assumptions, and are subject to uncertainties and inherent risks, both general and specific. Desjardins Group cautions readers against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements when making decisions since a number of factors, many of which are beyond Desjardins Group's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, could influence, individually or collectively, the accuracy of the assumptions, predictions, forecasts or other forward-looking statements, including those in this press release. Although Desjardins Group believes that the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable and founded on valid bases, it cannot guarantee that these expectations will materialize or prove to be accurate. It is also possible that these assumptions, predictions, forecasts or other forward-looking statements, as well as Desjardins Group's objectives and priorities, may not materialize or may prove to be inaccurate, and that actual future results, conditions, actions or events may differ materially from targets, expectations, estimates or intentions that have been explicitly or implicitly put forward. Readers who rely on these forward-looking statements must carefully consider these risk factors and other uncertainties and potential events, including the uncertainty inherent in forward-looking statements.\nThe factors that may affect the accuracy of the forward-looking statements in this press release include those discussed in the \"Risk management\" section of Desjardins Group's 2024 annual MD&A and of its MD&A for the second quarter of 2025, and include credit, market, liquidity, operational, insurance, strategic and reputation risk, environmental, social and governance risk, and regulatory risk.\nSuch factors also include those related to security (including cybersecurity) breaches, fraud risk, the housing market and household and corporate indebtedness, technological and regulatory developments, including changes to liquidity and capital adequacy guidelines, and requirements relating to their presentation and interpretation, as well as interest rate fluctuations, inflation, climate change, geopolitical uncertainty, artificial intelligence and data risk. In addition, there are factors related to the trade dispute with the United States and the impact that tariffs on certain Canadian exports as well as any resulting retaliatory tariffs could notably have on goods and services, businesses in certain industries, and the Canadian economy. Also of note are factors related to general economic and business conditions in regions in which Desjardins Group operates; monetary policies; the critical accounting estimates and accounting standards applied by Desjardins Group; new products and services to maintain or increase Desjardins Group's market share; geographic concentration; changes in the credit ratings assigned to Desjardins Group; reliance on third parties; the ability to recruit and retain talent; and tax risk. Other factors include unexpected changes in consumer spending and saving habits, the potential impact of international conflicts on operations, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, or any other similar events affecting the local, national or global economy, as well as Desjardins Group's ability to anticipate and properly manage the risks associated with these factors despite a disciplined risk management environment. Additional information about these factors is found in the \"Risk management\" section of Desjardins Group's 2024 Annual Report and of its MD&A for the second quarter of 2025.\nIt is important to note that the above list of factors that could influence future results is not exhaustive. Other factors could have an effect on Desjardins Group's results. Additional information about these and other factors is found in the \"Risk management\" section of Desjardins Group's 2024 Annual MD&A and of its MD&A for the second quarter of 2025.\nThe significant economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements in this document are described in the \"Economic environment and outlook\" section of Desjardins Group's 2024 MD&A and of its MD&A for the second quarter of 2025 and can be updated in the interim MD&As subsequently filed. Readers are cautioned to consider the foregoing factors when reading this section. To determine economic growth forecasts in general, and for the financial services sector in particular, Desjardins Group mainly uses historical economic data provided by recognized and reliable organizations, empirical and theoretical relationships between economic and financial variables, expert judgments, and identified upside and downside risks for the domestic and global economies. In light of the changing circumstances of the U.S. trade dispute and the resulting impact on the Canadian economy, financial market conditions, commercial operations, and Desjardins Group's financial results and financial position, there is greater uncertainty about our economic assumptions than in previous periods, as these assumptions are based on uncertain future developments and it is difficult to predict how significant the long-term impact of U.S. tariffs will be.\nAny forward-looking statements contained in this press release represent the views of management only as at the date hereof, and are presented for the purpose of assisting readers in understanding and interpreting Desjardins Group's financial position as at the dates indicated or its results for the periods then ended, as well as its strategic priorities and objectives as considered as at the date hereof. These forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. Desjardins Group does not undertake to update any oral or written forward-looking statements that could be made from time to time by or on behalf of Desjardins Group, except as required under applicable securities legislation.\nBasis of presentation of financial information\nThe financial information in this document comes primarily from the Annual and Interim Combined Financial Statements. Those statements have been prepared by Desjardins Group's management in accordance with IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the accounting requirements of the AMF, which do not differ from IFRS. IFRS represent Canada's GAAP. The Interim Combined Financial Statements of Desjardins Group have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting.\" All the accounting policies were applied as described in Note 2, \"Accounting policies,\" to the Annual Combined Financial Statements.\nThis press release has been prepared in accordance with the current regulations of the Canadian Securities Administrators on continuous disclosure obligations. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are presented in Canadian dollars ($) and are primarily from Desjardins Group's annual and interim combined financial statements.\nSOURCE Desjardins Group\nFor further information (media inquiries only): Jean-Benoit Turcotti, Public Relations, 514-281-7000 or 1-866-866-7000, ext. 5553436, [email protected]; Alain Leprohon, FCPA, Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of Desjardins Group\nShare this article"
