      "summary": "WTI crude and gasoline prices fell sharply, with WTI down 2.79% and gasoline down 2.54%, as investors reacted to President Trump’s announcement of 10% global minimum and 15%+ tariffs on surplus‑trade countries, effective August 7. The decline was compounded by weaker‑than‑expected U.S. economic data—July payrolls and ISM manufacturing—and a 2‑week low in the S&P 500, dampening confidence in energy demand. Meanwhile, OPEC+ is planning a production hike of 548,000 bpd in September, while sanctions on Russian oil and inventory build‑ups add supply‑side pressure, creating a complex backdrop for future price movements.",
