  "content": "Is that too much complacency out there, do you think? I certainly think that is the case. I mean, looking at hedge funds, kind of betting on shorting the VIX, the most we've seen in three years really does suggest that they expect this comp to persist. I think we expect greater volatility if we do see some of this economic data materially surprise to the upside of the downside, just given that equities have really been predicated on the Fed easing coming through quite materially. We have about five rate cuts priced in by the July meeting and this is occurring against a backdrop where the inflation uncertainty still remains kind of unknown. Because if we think about, you know, yes, we're starting to see goods inflation that's expected to grind higher over the coming months. But last month, the super core inflation measure is actually what surprised to the upside if we start to see signs of services, inflation accelerating or wages accelerating, I think that could put, you know, some some cold water on some of these expectations for the market easing. That's yes. And so let's think about where we might be by Friday or what Friday's payrolls report might tell us, Laura, because do you think this is going to have a real bearing on September rate cut expectations or is it going to be more about the medium term? Because after we heard from Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole, Jackson Hole, we increase expectations of a Fed rate cut in September. And the market is probably quite attached to those expectations because of what we heard from the chairman. So is it that that's going to be the focus for markets or is it going to be all those other rate cuts that the market is priced in? I think it's going to be a combination of both. And I think to your point around, will the payrolls really be the determining factor for the September 17 Fed cut? I think it depends on the magnitude of the miss or the beat that comes through. I think last month's payrolls told us that the labor market is on much more precarious footing given the significant downward revisions. So if we do see a meaningful upside surprise, perhaps then that will start to question whether the Fed will be in a position to cut beyond that September rate cut with markets pricing in about 88% because the Fed doesn't want to necessarily cut into, you know, still hot economy. There's certainly implications on the back of that. But if we do see a material miss to the downside, perhaps then we're going to see not just a 25 basis point cut priced in for September, but perhaps that, you know, 5025 debate will come back to the focus, because if we look when they last surprised with 50 basis points, what precluded that what preceded that was really three consecutive months of weak payrolls print. So as well as the payrolls print, I think it's a number of the key labor market indicators as well this week to watch for that could guide that September cut and further out because there is this greater scrutiny certainly on that payrolls data more recently. Yes. And so are you expecting, given the the way that payrolls reports have gone recently, are you expecting this one to be another one that that disappoints what we've seen over the past couple of months? It was the revisions and the fact that we thought we had jobs that then turned out not to be that. That was the thing that that sort of disappointed and spooked markets. Well, our expectation is that we're fairly in line with consensus that we could see 100,000 job gains in August. But we'll be watching for the more stable metric around the unemployment rate. Right now, 4.2%. If it were to go to 4.4%, I think in this backdrop where there's supply constraints coming through from immigration restrictions, the Fed is really closely monitoring this key gauge. And I think that could really be what to watch for, to guide markets. But as well, look to, you know, the ADP print this week, you know, that's probably going to have disproportionate importance given the scrutiny on the BLS data. And if we look at given the revisions, the ADP print has actually been a more accurate gauge than historically it has been. So maybe market attention will turn there.",

  "summary": "The author suggests that there is too much complacency in the market regarding Fed rate cuts, given that there are about five rate cuts already priced in by the July meeting. He also suggests that if economic data surprises to the downside, equities have been heavily dependent on the Fed's anticipated easing measures. This comes as the super core inflation measure surprised to the upside last month. If signs of services, inflation accelerating or wages accelerating, this could potentially undermine these expectations. The author also notes that last month's payrolls indicated that the labor market is on a more precarious footing given significant downward revisions. However, he suggests that the payrolls report may be a significant factor for the September 17 Fed cut. The article also discusses the potential impact of the ADP print, which has been more accurate than the BLS, given the recent revisions.",

  "argos_summary": "The discussion focuses on how upcoming U.S. payroll data and inflation surprises could influence Fed rate cut expectations, particularly the September 17 cut. Hedge funds are betting on a VIX short, anticipating volatility if economic data deviates from forecasts. Market participants weigh the impact of potential upside or downside surprises in jobs, wages, and services inflation on the likelihood of further cuts beyond the priced 25\u2011bp September cut. The conversation highlights the importance of payroll revisions, unemployment rates, and alternative labor metrics like ADP in shaping Fed policy outlook.",
