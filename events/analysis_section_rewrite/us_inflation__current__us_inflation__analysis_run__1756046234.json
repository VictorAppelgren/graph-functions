      "feedback": "Strong start tying the near‑term macro driver to tariff dynamics in autos (S15934PBQ) and pairing it with visible Labor Day promotion momentum in consumer discretionary (Q4G7EPJJ6). To reach world‑class, tighten the 0–3 week framing into a crisp, testable causal chain, quantify the transmission, and set explicit catalysts/invalidations. Actionable edits in one compact paragraph: 1) Reframe the thesis as a two‑channel transmission: (a) price/margin channel in autos from tariff pass‑through (quantify ranges, e.g., whether pass‑through is low, moderate, or high within a 0–6 week window given the tariff move to 15%); (b) demand/retail channel from Labor Day promotions that lift discretionary spending despite autos headwinds. 2) Add quantified baselines and thresholds from the sources: use the 15% tariff level and the note of Toyota NA operating income swinging to a $438m loss (S15934PBQ) as a trigger for margin compression; contrast with the total promo depth in the Labor Day window from Q4G7EPJJ6 (Pottery Barn sectionals at 20% off to $2,235; other promos: HexClad up to 44% off; Saatva up to $400 off on orders over $1,000; Amazon up to 40% off; REI up to 50% off). Translate these into implied consumer impulse signals (e.g., a 2–4 week uplift in discretionary categories vs. autos). 3) Build a tight 3‑scenario framework (base/bull/bear) with explicit triggers: base = pass‑through modest, promotional demand offsets autos headwinds; bull = stronger promo cadence and faster pass‑through to prices/margins; bear = tariff/policy surprises or promotion fatigue causing weaker consumer spend. For each, specify 0–3 week catalysts and risk checks (e.g., if CPI print shows hotter inflation, or if auto‑maker guidance signals higher pricing, that’s bear; if autos inflation remains contained and promo lift continues, that’s base/bull). 4) Define key levels/thresholds and invalidations: e.g., price pass‑through rate threshold (e.g., >20% of tariff cost passed to U.S. consumers within 2–4 weeks), a promo‑driven retail lift exceeding a 1–2% weekly consumption signal, and an explicit stop if Labor Day promo cadence ends with sales decelerating by week 3. 5) Improve causal articulation with first‑principles framing: connect tariff pass‑through to producer margins, competitor pricing, and the potential shift in supply dynamics due to domestic auto‑production investments (S15934PBQ); link consumer‑level price signals to discretionary spend cadence during Labor Day, not as isolated promotions. 6) Expand monitoring slate and source mapping: attach S15934PBQ for tariff/mfg signals and Q4G7EPJJ6 for consumer promotions; if citing, keep exact IDs after the corresponding claim and note any conflicts (e.g., some executives deny tariff‑driven price increases). 7) Deliver a cleaner, tighter write‑up by pruning extraneous product‑category spill (e.g., avoid over‑weighing small promotions across non‑core sectors) and place the promo data into a single “near‑term demand impulse” box with explicit numbers. 8) Ensure the piece explicitly requests or notes the next 1–3 data releases to watch (e.g., upcoming CPI inflation readings and auto pricing signals) and states how those readings would invalidate or update the base case. 9) Improve density and precision of citations—after each pivotal quantitative claim, append the exact source IDs (S15934PBQ for tariffs, Q4G7EPJJ6 for Labor Day promos) to satisfy the source‑integrity requirement. 10) If you want a one‑paragraph synthesis, end with a concise, testable forecast: “0–3 weeks: autos pass‑through pressure remains a key risk, offset by domestic capacity investments and a steady flow of Labor Day promotions that support retail and consumer confidence; monitor auto pricing signals, CPI prints, and the pace/decay of Labor Day demand.” This will elevate the piece from descriptive to a disciplined, testable short‑horizon framework.",
