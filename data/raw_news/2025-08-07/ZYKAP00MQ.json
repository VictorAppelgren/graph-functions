  "content": "PRINCE Harry has accused the Sentebale boss of acting in the \"poorest taste\" after he walked away from the charity, sources claim.\n\nThe Duke slammed Dr Sophie Chanduaka after she referenced his late mother Princess Diana in the wake of their bitter \"bullying\" row.\n\nHarry, 40, set up the charity in 2006 in memory of Diana for young people and kids living with HIV and Aids.\n\nBut he stepped down from his position - alongside co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho - in March following a public fall out with Dr Chandauka.\n\nYesterday, it was revealed that the prince was walking away from the charity after a damning report accused him of \"harming\" its reputation.\n\nThe investigation rebuked \"all parties\", but judged that Dr Chandauka could remain in place as chair of trustees with the current board.\n\nIn response, she hailed the ruling and pointed to the co-founders' mothers, who inspired the creation of the organisation.\n\nShe said: \"Despite the recent turbulence, we will always be inspired by the vision of our founders, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, who established Sentebale in memory of their precious mothers, Princess Diana and Queen 'Mamohato.\n\nThe Duke is said to be \"devastated\" that his late mother was referenced by Chandauka, who he has accused of destroying his \"life's work\".\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph, a source close to Harry said: \"For Sophie Chandauka to have invoked Princess Diana's memory in her own defence was in the poorest possible taste.\n\n\"She's got what she wants, which is control of the charity, but unfortunately the people who suffer most out of all of this\u2026 are the children of Lesotho and Botswana.\n\n\u201cThe most devastating thing for Prince Harry in all of this is that his life\u2019s work and all the money he was able to pump into Lesotho and Botswana through his work has gone down in flames.\"\n\nThe co-founders publicly fell out with Dr Chandauka, a Zimbabwe-born lawyer, who was selected to be chair of the trustees last year.\n\nThe bitter feud appeared to be triggered by the move to transfer the youth charity's fundraising operation to Africa.\n\nBoard of trustees chair Dr Chandauka said the \u201ctoxicity\u201d of Harry\u2019s brand since his move to live in the US had seen a drop in donors.\n\nThe decision had caused several key figures to quit the organisation.\n\nThe Charity Commission said chances were missed to settle differences at Sentebale.\n\nA probe was launched after Harry and Prince Seeiso stood down in support of trustees.\n\nDr Chandauka slammed the \u201cadverse media campaign\u201d launched by those who resigned, which she said had \u201ccaused incalculable damage\u201d to the charity.\n\nShe said: \"The unexpected adverse media campaign that was launched by those who resigned in March has caused incalculable damage.\n\n\"We are emerging not just grateful to have survived, but stronger: more focused, better governed, boldly ambitious and with our dignity intact.\n\n\"To all who believe in our mission: please walk with us as Sentebale recovers, renews, and rises to meet the hopes and expectations of the next generation.\"\n\nDavid Holdsworth, chief executive of the Charity Commission, said the public feud risked overshadowing Sentebale's achievements.\n\nHe added: \"Passion for a cause is the bedrock of volunteering and charity, delivering positive impact for millions of people here at home and abroad every day.\n\n\"However, in the rare cases when things go wrong, it is often because that very passion has become a weakness rather than a strength.\n\n\"Sentebale's problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity's reputation.\n\n\"It risks overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardising the charity's ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve.\"\n\nThe regulator, which cannot investigate individual allegations of bullying, found no evidence of systemic bullying or harassment, including misogyny or misogynoir at the charity.\n\nBut it acknowledged \u201cthe strong perception of ill treatment\u201d felt by some involved.\n\nA spokesperson for The Duke of Sussex told The Sun: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t recognise the source of these quotes, it would be accurate to say that the Duke is, of course, deeply upset by this entire ordeal.\n\n\"Though he remains absolutely committed to continuing the work he began 19 years ago \u2013 that being to support the children of Lesotho and Botswana living with HIV/AIDS and struggling with mental health issues.\u201d",
