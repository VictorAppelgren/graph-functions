  "description": "AI is undercutting the very skills and industry that feeds it.",
  "content": "AI is gobbling up journalism for many of the same reasons humans do: to develop a concrete understanding of the world; to think critically; to differentiate between what is true and what\u2019s not; to become a better writer; and to distill history and context into something accessible. But what happens to AI when our journalistic institutions crumble? Upon what foundation of truth will it answer everyone\u2019s questions? Write their emails? Do their jobs? Because while the alarm bells have been ringing for journalism for decades, the so-called end of search feels like the potential death knell. What does that mean for AI, and for us as we try to make sense of an increasingly confusing world?\n\nIn our rush to integrate generative AI into every corner of our lives, we\u2019ve ignored a fundamental truth: AI cannot function without a baseline of verified facts. And, at the moment, that baseline is built and maintained by so-called \u201ctraditional\u201d journalism (the kind with fact checkers and editors). As AI threatens to upend search, media monetization, and news consumption behaviors, it\u2019s also undercutting the very industry that feeds it the facts it depends on. A society cannot function without objective journalism, and neither can AI. Recent Apple research says that, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to cause generative AI to fall into \u2018complete accuracy collapse.\u2019\u201d It goes on to show that generative AI models lack strong logical reasoning, unable to function beyond their complexity threshold. I immediately thought of a recent piece from The New Yorker, in which Andrew Marantz weaves together various examples of autocracy, set against thousands of years of history, to (attempt to) make sense of what is happening in America right now. I imagined AI trying to do the same, essentially short-circuiting before being able to form the salient points that make the piece so impactful. When asked to think too hard, the AI breaks. An even more damning report from the BBC reports that AI can\u2019t accurately summarize the news. It asked ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Perplexity to sum up 100 news stories and asked expert journalists to rate each answer. \u201cAs well as containing factual inaccuracies, the chatbots \u2018struggled to differentiate between opinion and fact, editorialised, and often failed to include essential context,\u2019\u201d says the report. Almost one-fifth of the summaries included false facts and quote distortions\u201419%!\n\nThere\u2019s more, of course. This study from MIT Sloan shows that AI tools have a history of fabricating citations and reinforcing gender and racial bias, while this Fast Company article argues that AI-driven journalism\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d standards are accepted because of the revenue these tools create. And that, of course, is the less human reason AI is gobbling up journalism: the money. None of that money is going back into funding the journalistic institutions that power this whole experiment. What happens to our society when the core pillar of a true and free press collapses under the weight of the thing that has sloppily consumed it? Our AI lords must place real value on fact-checked reporting\u2014right now\u2014to ensure its continued existence. Josh Rosenberg is CEO and cofounder of Day One Agency.",

      "text": "AI chatbots unable to accurately summarise news, BBC finds\nFour major artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are inaccurately summarising news stories, according to research carried out by the BBC.\nThe BBC gave OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini and Perplexity AI content from the BBC website then asked them questions about the news.\nIt said the resulting answers contained \"significant inaccuracies\" and distortions.\nIn a blog, Deborah Turness, the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said AI brought \"endless opportunities\" but the companies developing the tools were \"playing with fire\".\n\"We live in troubled times, and how long will it be before an AI-distorted headline causes significant real world harm?\", she asked.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said: \"We support publishers and creators by helping 300 million weekly ChatGPT users discover quality content through summaries, quotes, clear links, and attribution.\"\nThe other tech companies which own the chatbots have been approached for comment.\n'Pull back'\nIn the study, the BBC asked ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Perplexity to summarise 100 news stories and rated each answer.\nIt got journalists who were relevant experts in the subject of the article to rate the quality of answers from the AI assistants.\nIt found 51% of all AI answers to questions about the news were judged to have significant issues of some form.\nAdditionally, 19% of AI answers which cited BBC content introduced factual errors, such as incorrect factual statements, numbers and dates.\nIn her blog, Ms Turness said the BBC was seeking to \"open up a new conversation with AI tech providers\" so we can \"work together in partnership to find solutions\".\nShe called on the tech companies to \"pull back\" their AI news summaries, as Apple did after complaints from the BBC that Apple Intelligence was misrepresenting news stories.\nSome examples of inaccuracies found by the BBC included:\n- Gemini incorrectly said the NHS did not recommend vaping as an aid to quit smoking\n- ChatGPT and Copilot said Rishi Sunak and Nicola Sturgeon were still in office even after they had left\n- Perplexity misquoted BBC News in a story about the Middle East, saying Iran initially showed \"restraint\" and described Israel's actions as \"aggressive\"\nIn general, Microsoft's Copilot and Google's Gemini had more significant issues than OpenAI's ChatGPT and Perplexity, which counts Jeff Bezos as one of its investors.\nNormally, the BBC blocks its content from AI chatbots, but it opened its website up for the duration of the tests in December 2024.\nThe report said that as well as containing factual inaccuracies, the chatbots \"struggled to differentiate between opinion and fact, editorialised, and often failed to include essential context\".\nThe BBC's Programme Director for Generative AI, Pete Archer, said publishers \"should have control over whether and how their content is used and AI companies should show how assistants process news along with the scale and scope of errors and inaccuracies they produce\".\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told BBC News: \"We've collaborated with partners to improve in-line citation accuracy and respect publisher preferences, including enabling how they appear in search by managing OAI-SearchBot in their robots.txt. We'll keep enhancing search results.\"\nRobots.txt is an instruction in a web page's code which asks a bot not to use that page in search results."

      "text": "The nonfiction best-seller list in early 2018 included \u201cTrumpocracy: The Corruption of the American Republic\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration Is Doing to America.\u201d The cover of the former was emergency-alert red; on the latter, a map of the United States was bursting into flames. By comparison, the cover of another book, \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d was somewhat muted\u2014white capital letters on a black background. The word \u201cDIE,\u201d though, did loom large.\nThe anti-Trump books were received the way most information about Donald Trump is received. Those who hated him felt apoplectic, or vindicated; those who liked him mostly tuned it out. But \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d by two political scientists at Harvard, was about a global phenomenon that was bigger than Trump, and it became a touchstone, the sort of book whose title (\u201cManufacturing Consent,\u201d \u201cBowling Alone\u201d) is often invoked as a shorthand for an important but nebulous set of issues. When a book attains this status, the upside is that it can have a wide impact. (In 2018, according to the Washington Post, Joe Biden \u201cbecame obsessed\u201d with \u201cHow Democracies Die\u201d and started carrying it around with him wherever he went.) The downside is that many people\u2014including those who are aware of the book but haven\u2019t quite got around to reading it\u2014may hear a game-of-telephone version of the argument, not the argument itself.\nTrump\u2019s first term lasted four years\u2014no more, no less. The sun rose every morning and set every evening. The President made some wildly unsettling statements; he allowed his relatives to exploit their power for profit; he badly mishandled a pandemic; he threatened to nuke North Korea, or (reportedly) a hurricane, but in the end he didn\u2019t do either of those things. Nor did he declare martial law, barricade himself inside the White House, and refuse to leave. In his final days, he did gin up a fleeting attempt at a \u201cself-coup,\u201d but he never had the judges or the generals on his side. By the time he left, many casual observers found it absurd to imagine that American democracy was dying. What would that even mean?\nWhen Trump ran again, in 2024, his autocratic rhetoric was more pitched. He promised retribution, a purge of ideological enemies, and mass deportations on flimsy legal pretexts. His opponents called him a fascist, but this only seemed to backfire. \u201cLook, we can disagree with one another, we can debate one another, but we cannot tell the American people that one candidate is a fascist, and if he is elected it is going to be the end of American democracy,\u201d his running mate, J. D. Vance, said at the time. Vance had previously compared Trump to Hitler and to heroin, but his views, along with those of most Americans, had softened over time. This vibe shift was enough to get Trump re\u00eblected, but it didn\u2019t change the underlying threat.\nFor decades, scientists argued that rising carbon levels would cause an increasingly unstable ecosystem, but most people got only the game-of-telephone version. \u201cWe keep hearing that 2014 has been the warmest year on record,\u201d Senator James Inhofe said, holding up a snowball on the Senate floor. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very cold out.\u201d The climate Cassandras hadn\u2019t actually predicted the immediate end of winter. The slow-motion emergency they had predicted\u2014melting permafrost, once-in-a-century storms appearing once every few months\u2014was in fact happening, right on schedule. Still, no matter how dire the situation got, it was possible to normalize the damage. \u201cNo one\u2019s denying it is unpleasant,\u201d Laura Ingraham, the Fox News anchor, said in 2023. \u201cMy eyes are pretty itchy and watery.\u201d That day, the air in midtown Manhattan was choked with acrid wildfire smoke from Canada, and the sky was a macabre shade of orange. \u201cThere\u2019s no health risk,\u201d her guest, a former coal lobbyist, replied. \u201cWe have this kind of air in India and China all the time.\u201d\nIn a Hollywood disaster movie, when the big one arrives, the characters don\u2019t have to waste time debating whether it\u2019s happening. There is an abrupt, cataclysmic tremor, a deafening roar; the survivors, suddenly transformed, stagger through a charred, unrecognizable landscape. In the real world, though, the cataclysm can come in on little cat feet. The tremors can be so muffled and distant that people continually adapt, explaining away the anomalies. You can live through the big one, it turns out, and still go on acting as if\u2014still go on feeling as if\u2014the big one is not yet here.\nThe authors of \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, were describing what political scientists call \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d\u2014a potential descent into \u201ccompetitive authoritarianism.\u201d This is not what happened in nineteen-thirties Europe, when pluralistic republics suddenly collapsed into genocidal war machines. Nor is it what happened in late-twentieth-century Russia and China, which transitioned so quickly from totalitarian communism to autocratic capitalism that there was never much democracy to slide back from. It\u2019s what happened in Turkey after 2013, in India after 2014, in Poland after 2015, in Brazil after 2019\u2014countries that had gone through the long and difficult process of achieving a consolidated liberal democracy, then started unachieving it. \u201cBlatant dictatorship\u2014in the form of fascism, communism, or military rule\u2014has disappeared across much of the world,\u201d Levitsky and Ziblatt write. \u201cDemocracies still die, but by different means.\u201d Some of this may happen under cover of darkness, but much of it happens in the open, under cover of arcane technocracy or boring bureaucracy. \u201cMany government efforts to subvert democracy are \u2018legal,\u2019 in the sense that they are approved by the legislature or accepted by the courts,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThey may even be portrayed as efforts to improve democracy.\u201d\nThe first hundred days of Donald Trump\u2019s second term have been enervating, bewildering, almost impossible to parse in real time. The Administration has used some degree of brute force to accomplish its aims, but it has relied more often on ambiguity, misdirection, and plausible deniability. Some of its actions have seemed comically paltry: coercing a government attorney to restore Mel Gibson\u2019s right to a gun license; making the Kennedy Center \u201chot\u201d again. Others may be haphazard power grabs, or may amount to something more. The Department of Government Efficiency, which is not a government department, declares that it will not allow condoms to be sent to Gaza, which actually means that it has cut off funding for health services in Mozambique. An eight-billion-dollar budget cut turns out to be an eight-million-dollar budget cut. Jeff Bezos smothers the editorial mission of the Washington Post, and Amazon commissions a forty-million-dollar documentary about the First Lady. Undercover agents arrest people for thought crimes. \u201cWe\u2019ve had two perfect months,\u201d the President says, moments after signing an executive order that reverses some of the signal achievements of the civil-rights movement. \u201cLike, in the history of our country, no one\u2019s ever seen anything like it.\u201d\nIn their book, Levitsky and Ziblatt return many times to the example of Hungary. The first time Viktor Orb\u00e1n was Prime Minister, from 1998 to 2002, he governed democratically. But by the time he won again, in 2010, he had recast himself as a hard-right skeptic of liberal democracy. Within a few months, mostly through legal means, his party, Fidesz, locked in its power and began reshaping the courts, the universities, and the private sector in its favor. Orb\u00e1n is now the longest-serving Prime Minister in the European Union. Since 2011 or so, Hungary has been what is known as a \u201chybrid regime\u201d\u2014not a totalitarian dictatorship, but not a real democracy, either. There are no tanks in the streets; there are elections, and public protests, and judges in robes. But, the more closely you look at its core civic institutions, the more you see how they\u2019ve been hollowed out from within. \u201cThe way they do it here, and the way they are starting to do it in your country as well, they don\u2019t need to use too much open violence against us,\u201d P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, a Hungarian social scientist, told me in January, over lunch in central Budapest. \u201cThe new way is cheaper, easier, looks nicer on TV.\u201d\nWe were in an Italian restaurant with white tablecloths, at a window overlooking a bustling side street\u2014as picturesque as in any European capital. Krek\u00f3 glanced over his shoulder once or twice, but only to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be overheard gossiping about professional peers, not because he was afraid of being hauled off by secret police. \u201cBefore it starts, you say to yourself, \u2018I will leave this country immediately if they ever do this or that horrible thing,\u2019 \u201d he went on. \u201cAnd then they do that thing, and you stay. Things that would have seemed impossible ten years ago, five years ago, you may not even notice.\u201d He finished his gnocchi, considered a glass of wine, then opted for an espresso instead. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, almost, how comfortable you can be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things you could do or say\u2014as a person in academia, or in the media, or an N.G.O.\u2014that would get them to come after you. But if you know where the lines are, and you don\u2019t cross them, you can have a good life.\u201d\nKrek\u00f3 has an office at the Budapest campus of Central European University, a couple of blocks away from the restaurant. It is a complex of multi-story buildings, sleek and strikingly modern. We passed through an angled glass foyer into a sunlit atrium full of blond wood and exposed brick. You didn\u2019t have to be an architecture expert to get the message: openness and transparency. But, for a weekday afternoon, it was eerily quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a ghost building,\u201d Krek\u00f3 said.\nSoon after C.E.U. opened, in 1991, it became one of the most prestigious and well-funded liberal-arts universities in the post-Soviet world. The man who funded it, the Hungarian expat George Soros, was an ally of many young members of Hungary\u2019s newly elected parliament, including a former pro-democracy activist named Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The campus in Budapest was refurbished in 2016, in time for the university\u2019s twenty-fifth anniversary. By then, though, Orb\u00e1n was governing as a pugnacious ultranationalist. He had refashioned Soros as his archenemy, the personification of everything real Hungarians should reject: decadent globalism, open borders, \u201cgender ideology,\u201d a rootless cosmopolitan \u00e9lite.\nThat same year, Istv\u00e1n Heged\u0171s, a former politician who had served in parliament alongside Orb\u00e1n, read an article in a pro-Fidesz newspaper which implied that only the Party\u2019s generosity enabled C.E.U. to stay in Budapest. A few days later, he attended a reception at the university, where, he recalled, he told an administrator, \u201c \u2018You must interpret this to mean that you are in danger.\u2019 But he said, \u2018Who cares what they write in an article?\u2019 \u201d C.E.U. was a private institution, accredited both in Hungary and in the U.S.; even if Orb\u00e1n had wanted to meddle with it, he had no legal authority to do so. Still, Heged\u0171s told the administrator, \u201cYou are underestimating him.\u201d Orb\u00e1n\u2019s populist rhetoric didn\u2019t always line up with reality\u2014while promising to uplift the working class, he and some of his closest friends seemed to have rapidly grown rich\u2014and it was inconvenient when intellectuals pointed this out. Win or lose, a public spat with C.E.U. seemed to redound to his political benefit. An \u00e9lite institution, full of foreigners and strange ideas, had taken root in his country\u2019s biggest city, and he would not stand for it.\nLike all semi-autocrats, Orb\u00e1n picks more fights than he wins. For a few months, it seemed as though his broadsides against C.E.U. might be mere rhetoric. But, in 2017, Fidesz quietly passed an amendment to a law, placing new restrictions on international universities within Hungary. The amendment didn\u2019t mention Soros or C.E.U. by name, but the school was widely perceived to be its sole target. The European Court of Justice ruled that this was a violation of E.U. law\u2014three years later. But by then it was too late. C.E.U.\u2019s academic operations had been transferred to Vienna, leaving a large number of students in limbo, and causing many of Hungary\u2019s top scholars to leave the country. In the ensuing years, many of Hungary\u2019s public universities came under the control of a set of private foundations\u2014ostensibly a step toward modernization, but in practice a way for the foundations, which are said to be run by Orb\u00e1n loyalists, to exert more influence over the country\u2019s next generation of leaders. Beyond higher education, Fidesz used similar tactics in attempts to restrict international donations to N.G.O.s, and to force independent judges into early retirement. This year, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the competitive-authoritarian President of Turkey, took the unprecedented step of having his main political rival, the mayor of Istanbul, arrested. So far, Orb\u00e1n has not resorted to such a move, but, then again, most of his re\u00eblection campaigns haven\u2019t been close.\nEven now, there is still some plausible deniability. I had read about C.E.U. being banished from Budapest, and yet here I was, standing inside the building. A few American college students were passing through on a study-abroad tour. A display case was filled with recently published books; a polished-stone plaque was engraved with a quote (\u201cThinking can never quite catch up with reality\u201d) attributed to C.E.U.\u2019s founder and honorary chairman, George Soros.\nThe more I poked around, though, the more I saw indications that the institution had, in fact, been hollowed out\u2014a Potemkin university with a sleek fa\u00e7ade. A laminated sign, dated months prior, was taped to a locked door: \u201cThe PhD labs at the Budapest site will be closed.\u201d An inviting rooftop terrace stood empty, except for some newly planted trees bending in a stiff wind. Inside, though there were still department markers on the walls (Gender Studies, Historical Studies, International Relations), many of the offices were either empty or littered with debris. I passed an office with a light on, and a young man at a computer looked up, clearly startled to see anyone. He politely explained that he worked for a video-editing startup, which was renting the office by the month.\nAt a caf\u00e9 on the ground floor, where \u201cHotel California\u201d was playing in the background, I sat with Zoltan Mikl\u00f3si, a political philosopher who now commutes to C.E.U.\u2019s campus in Vienna. \u201cIn the social sciences, they talk about the \u2018just-world bias,\u2019 \u201d he told me. \u201cPeople want to believe that the world they live in, the system they live under, is mostly fair.\u201d In 2015, one of his colleagues \u201cmade the case, very meticulously, that we no longer live in a democracy. I felt, \u2018I cannot go there\u2019\u2014it seemed too extreme. But I had to admit that I couldn\u2019t think of good counter-arguments.\u201d This sort of discrepancy\u2014the lag between intellectual acknowledgment and emotional acceptance\u2014relates to one of Mikl\u00f3si\u2019s areas of research. \u201cIf I admit that I live in an autocracy, especially a \u2018hybrid autocracy\u2019 that functions by unpredictable rules, this raises a lot of other inconvenient questions,\u201d he said. Many of a citizen\u2019s fundamental decisions\u2014whether to vote, whether to follow the law\u2014presuppose a democratically legitimate state. \u201cIf that\u2019s gone, then how am I supposed to live?\u201d\nI agreed that the hybridity was confusing. I could hardly make sense of the building I was in. If Orb\u00e1n was so single-minded in his opposition to C.E.U. Budapest, then why not raid the building and put a \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign on the door? If Hungary was an autocracy, then why were its critics still allowed to sit in the middle of the capital and say so? Mikl\u00f3si suggested that this ambiguity was part of the point. Maybe, he said, if government ministers started to fear that his peer-reviewed articles were about to spark a revolution, \u201cthey would find a way to make my life unpleasant.\u201d They probably wouldn\u2019t jail him, but in theory they could subject him to smears in the state-aligned media, or make it difficult for anyone in his family to get a government job. He added, \u201cFor now, I guess, they don\u2019t think I\u2019m worth the effort.\u201d\nYou hear the word \u201cplaybook\u201d a lot these days. (The Guardian: \u201cTrump\u2019s weird obsession with the arts is part of the authoritarian playbook.\u201d MSNBC: \u201cIs the chaos that we have seen since Inauguration Day part of the playbook?\u201d) Trump has never made a secret of his admiration for tyrants, and he frequently mentions Orb\u00e1n as a model statesman. \u201cThese guys do seem to learn from one another,\u201d Julia Sonnevend, a communications scholar at the New School who grew up in Hungary, told me. Trump\u2019s son Don, Jr., went to El Salvador last June to attend the inauguration of that country\u2019s despot, Nayib Bukele. Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of the Brazilian semi-autocrat Jair Bolsonaro, was in Washington for Trump\u2019s Inauguration in January (and was also there four years before, on January 6th).\nIf you\u2019re looking for one master playbook, though, you may end up overemphasizing resemblances and downplaying distinctions. \u201cOne difference between Orb\u00e1n and Trump is between suborning the state and blowing it up,\u201d Anna Grzymala-Busse, a political scientist at Stanford, told me. Moreover, some parts of Trump\u2019s program are escalations of pre\u00ebxisting trends, not fundamental discontinuities. The corruption, the xenophobic nationalism, the ambient threat of decentralized violence\u2014these may be more glaring now, but, whether we like to admit it or not, they have been present throughout American history. George W. Bush stretched Presidential powers well beyond their previous limits; Barack Obama expanded them even further. In the first hundred days of this term, Trump has issued the most executive orders of any modern President. There\u2019s nothing inherently illegitimate about that. Some of these orders\u2014declassifying documents related to the J.F.K. assassination, declaring English the country\u2019s official language\u2014have been divisive but have not obviously exceeded the President\u2019s legal authority. Others, such as a ban on paper straws, have been mostly for show.\nIn other respects, though, this term already represents a sharp and menacing break. Executive orders such as the ones titled \u201cAddressing Risks from Paul Weiss\u201d and \u201cAddressing Risks from Jenner & Block\u201d are self-evidently cudgels for Trump to wield against his enemies\u2014in this case white-shoe lawyers who have worked for his political opposition. (The orders could be read as prohibiting employees at these firms from entering federal buildings, including courthouses.) When the Bush Administration gave no-bid military contracts to Halliburton, of which Vice-President Dick Cheney had recently been the C.E.O.\u2014or when the current Administration awarded contracts to SpaceX, whose current C.E.O., Elon Musk, is one of Trump\u2019s top advisers\u2014it certainly seemed like favoritism, but it was impossible to prove that any strings had been pulled. In Trump\u2019s orders against the law firms, though, he is explicit that he is punishing them because of his antipathy to their employees (\u201cthe unethical Andrew Weissmann\u201d) or their clients (\u201cfailed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u201d)\u2014which appears to be a textbook violation of the First and Sixth Amendments. Turkuler Isiksel, a political theorist at Columbia, told me, \u201cThe sovereign openly picking winners and losers in the market\u2014forget Orb\u00e1n or Erdo\u011fan. That\u2019s something a seventeenth-century king would do.\u201d\nThe Biden Administration, and even the first Trump Administration, justified deportations with arguments that had a chance of holding up in court. But this Administration has swept up putative gang members, some reportedly for nothing more than having a tattoo, and disappeared them to foreign prisons. Instead of bringing prosecutions, it has simply sent undercover officers to snatch legal residents\u2014accused of nothing but disfavored political speech\u2014off the street. \u201cDear marxist judges,\u201d Trump\u2019s homeland-security adviser, Stephen Miller, wrote. \u201cIf an illegal alien criminal breaks into our country,\u201d the only due process \u201che is entitled to is deportation.\u201d But this isn\u2019t how the law works, even for non-citizens. As one expert put it, in 2014, \u201cAnybody who\u2019s present in the United States has protections under the United States Constitution.\u201d The Marxist judge who said that was Justice Antonin Scalia.\nPrevious American Presidents signed orders knowing that they would be challenged in court. But some of Trump\u2019s orders\u2014one radically curtailing birthright citizenship, one banning transgender people from the military, and several more\u2014seem facially unconstitutional. In the early days of this term, there was a lot of speculation about whether the executive branch might defy a direct order from a federal judge, and, if so, whether this would comprise a constitutional crisis. Then it happened, several times. In February, a federal judge ordered immigration officials to turn planes around, but the officials preferred not to. (\u201cI don\u2019t care what the judges think,\u201d Trump\u2019s border czar said. Trump agreed, posting, \u201cThis judge, like many of the Crooked Judges\u2019 I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\u201d) In March, one district judge ordered the release of emergency-management funds that were being withheld from nearly two dozen states run by Democrats; in April, another judge ordered the government to halt its plan to decimate the staff of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In written rulings, both judges expressed concern that the government was not complying with their orders. (\u201cThere is reason to believe,\u201d one judge wrote, that Administration officials were \u201cthumbing their nose at . . . this Court.\u201d) Last week, the F.B.I. arrested a judge in Wisconsin and charged her with two felonies. Still, no matter how dire the situation got, some commentators kept saying that we were on the brink of a constitutional crisis, not already in one. Once you admit that you are in a constitutional crisis, it raises a lot of other inconvenient questions.\nOne morning in January, I took a car high into the Buda Hills to meet with David Pressman, who was then serving out his final days as the U.S. Ambassador to Hungary. We sat on settees in his official residence, next to a grand piano and a painting called \u201cSisyphus Smiling,\u201d while the staff served us coffee in fine china. Pressman, previously a human-rights lawyer and the director of George Clooney\u2019s Foundation for Justice, had done stints in Mogadishu and Khartoum before he was sent to Budapest. \u201cI wanted to go somewhere, candidly, where democracy was in crisis,\u201d he said. What he couldn\u2019t anticipate was that he would be subject to unrelenting attacks in the state-aligned media, turning him into a nationally famous pariah. Before he arrived, in 2022, with his husband and their two children, someone rolled out a welcome banner on the Danube: a skull and crossbones, with the message \u201cMr. Pressman, don\u2019t colonize Hungary with your cult of death\u201d; during his stay, the pro-regime media mocked him constantly as an \u201cL.G.B.T. activist\u201d and a \u201cfull-time provocateur.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a state that has clearly dispensed with the traditional norms, it doesn\u2019t work to just stick to the old ways,\u201d Pressman told me. He was trying to break from the staid habits of diplomacy, but the impact remained unclear. The previous night, he\u2019d announced that the U.S. Treasury had sanctioned one of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s top ministers, freezing his American assets. This was an unprecedented step\u2014similar sanctions had been issued against government ministers in Russia, but not against officials in countries that are putative U.S. allies, such as Hungary\u2014yet it was hardly a death blow to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s kleptocracy. The government treated it as more evidence of American animus, and the minister in question denied wrongdoing and shrugged it off. When I Googled his name, Antal Rog\u00e1n, there were a few stories about the sanctions in the international press, but many more about \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience.\u201d (A few weeks after Trump was inaugurated, the sanctions were repealed.)\nIn an armored S.U.V. with a tiny American flag on the hood, we were driven to the American Embassy. Pressman met with civil-society leaders, saying his goodbyes. The Hungarian government had unveiled a mysterious new department called the Sovereignty Protection Office. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if it\u2019s just a publicity tactic, or if they are being given new surveillance powers,\u201d Mikl\u00f3s Ligeti, from a nonprofit called Transparency International Hungary, said. \u201cBut our organization is under investigation by this office, so maybe we will find out.\u201d\n\u201cI heard one of the ministers on TV this morning, stating, \u2018After Ambassador Pressman leaves, he should avoid Hungary in the future,\u2019 \u201d a representative from Human Rights Watch said.\n\u201cI won\u2019t be following that recommendation,\u201d Pressman said, with a wry smile.\n\u201cWell, bring a burner phone,\u201d Szabolcs Panyi, an investigative journalist, said. It was gallows humor, but also good advice.\nEach June in Budapest, Pressman hosted a Pride celebration on his lawn. The Hungarian government seemed to hate this, but there didn\u2019t appear to be much it could do\u2014there had been a large Pride parade in the streets of Budapest every year since 1997. Yet nothing in politics is static. Last month, the Hungarian parliament passed a law banning all Pride celebrations. Anyone disobeying the ban this June could be identified by the police with facial-recognition software.\nPressman recently moved back to New York and resumed his work as a partner at Jenner & Block, one of the law firms Trump has targeted with an executive order. (Unlike other firms, which cut deals with the Administration, Jenner & Block is fighting the order in court.) \u201cMost Americans haven\u2019t lived through a situation like this, so they have no idea what it means for powerful institutions to be captured by the state,\u201d Pressman told me earlier this month. \u201cThey may assume they can keep their heads down for four years, make concessions, and then regain their independence on the back end. But history shows\u2014and the Hungarian experience shows\u2014that they would be mistaken.\u201d\nCastle Hill, on the west bank of the Danube River, is full of fortresses built during the Middle Ages. Tucked among them is a slender building constructed to include a five-hundred-year-old stone fortification. It houses the Danube Institute, a right-wing think tank funded indirectly by the Orb\u00e1n government. In January, Istv\u00e1n Kiss, the director, invited me into his office, which was tastefully crammed with Impressionist-style paintings and leather-bound books. It was a busy time for him: he had been in Palm Beach for one of Trump\u2019s Election Night victory parties, and he was invited back to Washington for the Inauguration, but he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to go, because his wife was about to give birth. The government offers generous tax breaks to families with more than two children, a policy aimed at increasing the Hungarian birth rate, and this would be Kiss\u2019s third. \u201cHonestly, we might have stopped at two otherwise,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut the incentives were quite appealing.\u201d When he was a university student, he spent a week at the Mises Institute, a libertarian think tank in Alabama. \u201cI discovered that I have some libertarian leanings, but my social conservatism is stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cThe left is using the state for its purposes, so why shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d\nIn April, 2023, in a dungeon-like theatre space in the building\u2019s basement, Kiss introduced an onstage Q. & A. with Christopher Rufo, a right-wing American activist who was in Hungary for a six-week Danube Institute fellowship. For years, Rufo had been pushing for an ideological overhaul of the entire American education system\u2014a proposal that had once struck most politicians, even most MAGA Republicans, as a non-starter. But Rufo said that a version of this program was taking shape in Florida, where he was an adviser to Governor Ron DeSantis. It could be accomplished most directly at state-run institutions such as New College, where DeSantis had installed Rufo as a trustee. (Within months, the trustees had dismantled the gender-studies program and replaced the school\u2019s president, a feminist English professor, with a former Republican politician.) Even when it came to private institutions, where DeSantis had less formal power, he still found ways to gain leverage\u2014for example, by announcing that he would rescind tax breaks from Disney and, by extension, perhaps other \u201cwoke\u201d corporations. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to have someone that understands how to change institutions,\u201d Rufo said, onstage in Budapest. He added that, during Trump\u2019s first term, \u201cthe reality is that the institutions submerged Trump more than Trump reformed the institutions.\u201d\nWhen Trump returned to office, in 2025, he seemed determined to prove such skeptics wrong. Rufo, whose posts on X had caught Musk\u2019s attention, went to Washington in early February, posting a photo from the Department of Education headquarters with the caption \u201cEntering the inner sanctum.\u201d (Rufo recently told me that he was an informal adviser to the Department of Education. A spokesperson for the department, when reached for comment, replied, \u201cHe does not advise DOE in any official capacity and should not be referred to as an advisor.\u201d) Rufo told the Times that he hoped the government would withhold money from universities \u201cin a way that puts them in an existential terror.\u201d He didn\u2019t have to wait long. On March 7th, shortly after Linda McMahon, the former C.E.O. of World Wrestling Entertainment, was confirmed as Trump\u2019s new Secretary of Education, the Administration threatened to cut off four hundred million dollars in federal funds to Columbia University, citing campus demonstrations against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Trump may have been eager to pick a fight with Columbia because it was the only Ivy League school in his home town, or because it was the school he most associated with anti-Israel protests, perhaps having seen so many of them on TV. In any case, if there is one thing the President understands, it\u2019s how to seed a compelling media narrative: an \u00e9lite institution, full of foreigners and strange ideas, had taken root in his country\u2019s biggest city, and he would not stand for it.\nOn March 13th, the Trump Administration sent Columbia a letter that might as well have been a ransom note. Before the university could even discuss getting its money back, it had to implement nine new policies, including banning face masks and empowering campus security guards to make arrests. On March 21st, it acceded to nearly all the government\u2019s demands. \u201cColumbia is folding\u2014and the other universities will follow suit,\u201d Rufo wrote on X. He told me recently, \u201cIt has been happening, honestly, way more quickly than I anticipated. It\u2019s beautiful to see.\u201d\nPrevious Presidents have used incentives to goad private institutions, but no modern President has so openly used executive spending as an extortion racket. Eighteen of the country\u2019s top constitutional-law scholars, both liberals and conservatives, wrote an open letter: \u201cThe government may not threaten funding cuts as a tool to pressure recipients into suppressing First Amendment-protected speech.\u201d Yet the government has continued to do exactly that. (\u201cPresident Trump is working to Make Higher Education Great Again,\u201d a White House spokesperson told The New Yorker, in part. \u201cAny institution that wishes to violate Title VI is, by law, not eligible for federal funding.\u201d) Given how quickly some universities have capitulated, why wouldn\u2019t the Administration use similar tactics to bully state governments, or Hollywood studios, or other entities that rely on federal money? Last year, Vance gave an interview to the European Conservative, a glossy print journal published in Budapest, in which he praised Orb\u00e1n\u2019s dominance of cultural institutions. By altering \u201cincentives\u201d and \u201cfunding decisions,\u201d Vance added, \u201cyou really can use politics to influence culture.\u201d\nIt will take a lot more than this to turn Columbia into a Potemkin university, or to drive it out of the country. C.E.U. was founded in the nineteen-nineties; Columbia was founded before the Declaration of Independence was written, and still has an endowment of more than fourteen billion dollars. In the coming months, though, smaller universities will surely be targeted, and some will presumably go bankrupt. (In February, with the stroke of a pen, Trump slashed the staff at two colleges run by the Bureau of Indian Education, and it barely made the news.) I visited Columbia earlier this month. Instead of passing through the main gate as usual, I had to stop at a checkpoint, where, between a couple of classical sculptures representing Science and Letters, some uniformed security guards waited to check my I.D. Two professors met me on campus. \u201cThey keep adding more of this Orwellian shit,\u201d one told me, gesturing at a bulbous security camera above our heads. The other added, \u201cAfter a while, unfortunately, you stop noticing.\u201d One of them had studied democratic collapse in Europe and Latin America; the other was from India, where, under the competitive authoritarian Narendra Modi, academic freedom was under constant assault. Neither would say more, even off the record, until we walked away from campus to the edge of the Hudson River, where they would be less likely to be overheard or recorded. \u201cIt may seem paranoid,\u201d one of them said. \u201cBut not if you\u2019ve seen this movie before.\u201d\nThe most influential independent media outlet in Hungary is a YouTube channel called Partiz\u00e1n, a name that evokes both advocacy journalism and anti-authoritarian resistance. It does its work not in the pine forests of Belarus but on the outskirts of Budapest, where it broadcasts from a soundstage in an unmarked warehouse. To get there one night, I walked past dilapidated brick buildings in an industrial area without sidewalks or street lights. My American street sense told me that I was about to get mugged, but in Central Europe it can be hard to tell the difference between imminent danger and shabby chic. M\u00e1rton Guly\u00e1s emerged from the shadows and smiled, shaking my hand. \u201cThey filmed part of \u2018The Brutalist\u2019 in this parking lot,\u201d he said, and led me upstairs.\nIn the studio, the mood was much warmer. Guly\u00e1s, Partiz\u00e1n\u2019s founder and main anchor, took his place on set, wearing a hoodie, in front of a bank of vintage TVs. He had just finished moderating the channel\u2019s flagship daily show\u2014a two-hour live roundtable, analyzing the day\u2019s news from a leftist perspective\u2014and he was about to tape an interview with Ben Rhodes, who had been one of Barack Obama\u2019s top foreign-policy advisers. I sat in a control room, where a few long-haired, effortlessly well-dressed employees made instant coffee. Partiz\u00e1n receives small donations from all over Hungary, and the control room was stocked with high-end equipment (a five-thousand-dollar video router, a cabinet labelled \u201cHUM\u00c1N-ROBOT INTERF\u00c9SZ\u201d).\nSince 2010, the Hungarian media has been thoroughly compromised. There are a few news sites in Budapest that still do valiant investigative work, but most TV channels and newspapers with national reach essentially function as privately owned state propaganda. Again, though, the regime is careful to preserve plausible deniability. Unlike in Mexico or the Philippines, government agents in Hungary don\u2019t kill or arrest hostile journalists. \u201cThey don\u2019t walk into a newsroom and announce, \u2018We are shutting you down because you published tough stories about us,\u2019 \u201d G\u00e1bor Mikl\u00f3si, a veteran investigative journalist (and the brother of Zoltan, the C.E.U. academic), told me. \u201cThey say, \u2018This is the new owner, and the new owner has some ideas about how to improve the business.\u2019 And the part they don\u2019t have to say, but everybody knows, is that this new owner is an oligarch who happens to be very close to the Prime Minister.\u201d For a decade, G\u00e1bor worked at Index, which used to be one of Hungary\u2019s most reliable news outlets. After Orb\u00e1n came to power, G\u00e1bor started to worry about editorial independence. But there wasn\u2019t much meddling at first, he said, \u201cso I convinced myself I should stay.\u201d When he did start to notice some editorial interference, \u201cit was mostly minor things\u201d\u2014a headline softened at the last minute, a story spiked for ambiguous reasons\u2014\u201cso you can never be sure. Maybe this particular case was a misunderstanding. Maybe I\u2019m imagining things.\u201d Around 2018, a company affiliated with Index was acquired by new owners, \u201clesser-known businesspeople tied to Fidesz oligarchs.\u201d After this, the editor-in-chief was fired, and most of the editorial staff, including G\u00e1bor, resigned in protest. Now he works at Partiz\u00e1n.\nGuly\u00e1s started Partiz\u00e1n in 2015, when he was an avant-garde theatre director in his mid-twenties. He spoke directly to the camera, aiming for \u201csatire mixed with activism\u2014\u2018People, wake up! They\u2019re taking our rights away, can\u2019t you see that?\u2019 \u201d He now considers this style cringeworthy and ineffective. \u201cYou can\u2019t just raise awareness, every day, every hour, about some new fucking emergency,\u201d he continued. \u201cMaybe it is an emergency, but if you keep saying only that then people stop listening.\u201d The director of the Hungarian National Theatre, an outspoken critic of the government, was replaced, which became front-page news. (In Hungary, the director of the national theatre is a celebrity.) Guly\u00e1s led a series of protests. In 2017, he went to Castle Hill with a bucket of paint, prepared to throw it on the Presidential palace, and was arrested. But, when the government put him on trial as a threat to national security, Guly\u00e1s became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on social media. \u201cThey did not make that mistake again,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, when they want to put pressure on us, they do not do it so publicly.\u201d\nTax officials have inspected Partiz\u00e1n\u2019s financial records more than once, ostensibly for routine reasons. \u201cWe just tell them, \u2018Here are our books, we have kept them very carefully for you,\u2019 \u201d Guly\u00e1s said. He is gay, and government-aligned tabloids often spread baseless rumors attempting to associate gay people with such things as pedophilia. \u201cI am a boring person, actually,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut they could use anything\u2014a picture of me sitting in a restaurant near someone who later turns out to be a bad guy\u2014and make it look like a conspiracy.\u201d\nThe fact that Partiz\u00e1n broadcasts online limits its reach, but also limits the government\u2019s leverage over it. Its videos often get hundreds of thousands of views\u2014a big deal in a country of some ten million people. In the last election, when Orb\u00e1n\u2019s main challenger couldn\u2019t get airtime on TV, he put his message out on Partiz\u00e1n; the current opposition candidate gained widespread attention through an interview with Guly\u00e1s. The anchor now occupies a unique status\u2014something like Hungary\u2019s Rachel Maddow, Amy Goodman, and John Oliver rolled into one. The American media is far more robust than the Hungarian press, but there have been early signs of trouble. The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times pulled their Presidential endorsements last year; Trump filed frivolous lawsuits against ABC News, which quickly settled, and CBS News, which initially vowed to fight but now seems poised to settle. The First Amendment still offers broad protections, but, even if you have the law on your side, there are plenty of incentives to avoid a confrontation with the President. This is especially true when the President seems willing to engage in extralegal tactics, such as selective audits, retributive regulation, and harassment campaigns carried out in the parts of the media that are already loyal to him.\nGuly\u00e1s lives in an upscale bohemian neighborhood of Budapest, and one night he had me over for a long dinner. His boyfriend made osso buco and risotto; Guly\u00e1s put on a John Coltrane record and poured red wine, then made Negronis. Guly\u00e1s is considering a move to the countryside, where most Orb\u00e1n supporters live; he can\u2019t really understand his country, he feels, without spending time outside Budapest. But, for now, he is living the urban dream. \u201cThey say that Hungary is the poster child for the failure of the Enlightenment project,\u201d Guly\u00e1s said. \u201cBut I will stay in this country until the last possible moment.\u201d\nSome people, of course, see Trumpism not as a democratic emergency but as a triumph of democracy. Recently, when Vance told a Politico reporter that the President may end up defying the Supreme Court, he portrayed this as an effort not to subvert democracy but to improve it: \u201cIf the elected President says, \u2018I get to control the staff of my own government,\u2019 and the Supreme Court steps in and says, \u2018You\u2019re not allowed to do that\u2019\u2014like, that is the constitutional crisis.\u201d David Reaboi, a right-wing operative who has been an adviser to American and Hungarian politicians, told me, \u201cThe Venn diagram of the people who think Orb\u00e1n is Hitler and Trump is Hitler is a circle, and it\u2019s made up entirely of people who are out of their minds. Saying \u2018Hungary is for Hungarians\u2019 or \u2018America is for Americans\u2019 is a tautology. Who else would it be for? I don\u2019t understand why anyone would have a mental breakdown over it.\u201d\nSome constitutional scholars still maintain that hair-on-fire rhetoric about the demise of the republic is counterproductive. \u201cLook, Trump was elected democratically, and I don\u2019t see anything that suggests that future elections will not be as democratic as previous ones,\u201d Michael McConnell, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford, told me. \u201cSome of what he\u2019s attempting to do is unlawful, and he exaggerates it to make it sound even scarier than it is, but the likely end result is that he will be checked by the courts.\u201d Andrew Jackson, McConnell went on, also had \u201cauthoritarian instincts.\u201d Franklin Delano Roosevelt fired civil servants for ideological reasons, attempted to pack the Supreme Court, and\u2014violating precedent, though not the Constitution\u2014won a third term, and then a fourth. The Biden Administration also overreached, McConnell told me; it just did so more quietly. One thought experiment McConnell likes to float: if a President were bending the rules on behalf of policies you liked instead of policies you deplored, how much would it bother you? \u201cIt\u2019s just a talking point of the left,\u201d Tom Fitton, the head of a right-wing group called Judicial Watch, told me. \u201cIf they\u2019re not getting their way, democracy\u2019s at risk.\u201d\nThe exact steps from the Hungarian playbook cannot be replicated here. They started with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party winning a legislative super-majority, which it used to rewrite the Hungarian constitution. In our sclerotic two-party system, it\u2019s become nearly impossible for either party to sustain a long-standing majority; and, even if Trumpists held super-majorities in both houses of Congress, this wouldn\u2019t be enough to amend the Constitution. \u201cAll those veto points in our system, by making it so hard to get anything done, may have helped bring about this autocratic moment,\u201d Jake Grumbach, a public-policy professor at U.C. Berkeley, told me. \u201cNow that there is an autocratic threat in the executive branch, though, I have to say, I\u2019m glad those checks exist.\u201d For years, Samuel Moyn, a historian at Yale, argued that liberals should stop inflating Trump into an all-powerful cartoon villain\u2014that he was a weak President, not an imminent fascist threat. But in March, after the disappearance of the Columbia student activist Mahmoud Khalil, Moyn applied the F-word to Trump for the first time. Still, he insisted, \u201cEven at the most alarming and dangerous moments, politics is still politics.\u201d All talk of playbooks aside, an autocratic breakthrough is not something that any leader can order up at will, by following the same ten easy steps.\nIn 2002, Levitsky and another co-author, the political scientist Lucan Way, wrote a paper called \u201cElections Without Democracy: The Rise of Competitive Authoritarianism.\u201d Way recently told me, \u201cWhen people would predict, \u2018America will turn into Hungary,\u2019 I would roll my eyes. But, boy, have I been humbled.\u201d This February, Way and Levitsky published a piece in Foreign Affairs. \u201cDemocracy survived Trump\u2019s first term because he had no experience, plan, or team,\u201d they wrote. \u201cU.S. democracy will likely break down during the second Trump administration, in the sense that it will cease to meet standard criteria for liberal democracy.\u201d What Americans are living through now may feel basically normal, Levitsky told me\u2014\u201cTrump hasn\u2019t brought out the tanks. Schumer\u2019s not in prison\u201d\u2014but, he said, this is the way it often feels, even after things have already spun out of control. When I spoke to Way, he mentioned the capitulation of top law firms (\u201cdisastrous\u201d), and the shambolic response from Democratic Party leaders (\u201cutterly depressing\u201d). Trump recently told NBC News that he was considering staying in office for more than four years, then clarified that he was \u201cnot joking.\u201d Way wouldn\u2019t even rule out the possibility that he might succeed. \u201cRight now,\u201d he said, \u201cI think the U.S. is no longer a democracy.\u201d He meant that we were seeing democratic backsliding, not a totalitarian dystopia. Still, when he said those words, I felt the way Zoltan Mikl\u00f3si must have felt a decade ago. The conclusion sounded extreme, even if I couldn\u2019t entirely refute it.\nOne paradox of strongmen like Bukele and Modi is that their anti-democratic maneuvers have made them genuinely popular. Break enough bureaucratic logjams, through either ingenuity or thuggish intimidation, and people may celebrate you as a man of action. It\u2019s too early to tell whether Trump\u2019s frenetic approach will be good or bad for his approval rating, but it is impossible to deny that he has been a man of action. The central tenet of competitive authoritarianism, though, is that an autocrat, even one who has already stacked the deck, can still lose. In Poland, the Law and Justice party entrenched its power, following the Hungarian model\u2014but it pushed too far, notably with a series of unpopular anti-abortion measures, and, in 2023, lost its majority. In Brazil, in 2022, Jair Bolsonaro, the \u201cTrump of the tropics,\u201d tried to rig his own re\u00eblection, but all his efforts failed, and he will soon stand trial for conspiracy to overthrow the government. Rodrigo Duterte, of the Philippines, who once seemed invincible, was arrested in March and brought to The Hague. There will be elections in Hungary next year, and Orb\u00e1n, for the first time in decades, is facing a formidable challenger. Right now, the polls are tied.\nNothing in politics is permanent, and nothing is inevitable. The scholar Timothy Snyder warns against \u201canticipatory obedience\u201d to tyranny, and fatalism can be its own form of capitulation. Even a gutted democracy can always come back from the dead. \u201cIn that sense, \u2018How Democracies Die\u2019 is actually a terrible metaphor,\u201d Levitsky told me. \u201cEverything is reversible.\u201d In these frantic days, he sounds like both a Cassandra and a Pollyanna, sometimes simultaneously. \u201cWe are not El Salvador, and we are not Hungary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent centuries, as a society, building up democratic muscle, and we still have a lot of that muscle left. I just keep waiting for someone to use it.\u201d\nWhen a graduate student whom I\u2019ll call No\u00e9mi moved to the U.S., in 2018, she thought it would be a refuge from what was happening in her native Hungary. She had read enough history to understand that America wasn\u2019t perfect. \u201cI knew about the McCarthy era, and the tensions after 9/11,\u201d she said. \u201cBut all the things you hear about the First Amendment and the legal protections for speech\u2014somehow I still thought that meant something.\u201d She is a Ph.D. student living in New York. Although she has a green card, she asked me not to use her name; if the State Department tries to kick students out, university officals may not be able to protect them. Her grandfather has late-stage cancer, and she isn\u2019t sure she\u2019ll be able to visit him in Hungary before he dies. \u201cI told my partner, \u2018I\u2019m not a criminal, I\u2019m not even an activist\u2014why shouldn\u2019t I go?\u2019 \u201d But her partner sent her news article after news article: a German green-card holder arrested at Logan Airport and sent to a detention facility; a French scientist denied entry after anti-Trump messages were discovered on his phone. For now, No\u00e9mi is \u201cfrozen in place. Scared here, but also scared to leave.\u201d She\u2019s already considering where she will go next, if she has to go.\nLast month, when a newspaper published a photo of a campus protest, an international student appeared in the background. She wasn\u2019t there as a protester\u2014she was just walking by\u2014but knowing that her face was visible in the photo caused her to go into hiding for two weeks. I heard about another student, a Palestinian with a green card, who hadn\u2019t left his apartment since March 8th, the night Mahmoud Khalil was taken; his friends were bringing him food, and he was using light-therapy lamps to regulate his sleep. A Ph.D. student whom I\u2019ll call Divya told me that she left India in part because of academic repression under the Modi government, and she now lives in New York on an F-1 visa. Some of her friends, she said, \u201cwon\u2019t use credit cards, in case they\u2019re being tracked.\u201d Among her friends who teach undergraduates, she added, \u201cthe new fear is that if you have a student who\u2019s a citizen, and they don\u2019t like what you say in class, maybe they\u2019ll report you and get you deported.\u201d Meanwhile, her neighbors go about their lives\u2014shopping at Whole Foods, picking up the dry cleaning, then going home to catch up on the news and curse the latest Trump outrage, as if it were all happening somewhere else. For most of us, the sun still rises in the morning and sets in the evening, even as some of us now have to use L.E.D. lamps to substitute for natural light.\nTurkuler Isiksel, the political theorist at Columbia, met me in her office, where the Declaration of the Rights of Man was framed on a wall. On her desk was a plush dog adapted from a meme (the one where the dog sits in a burning room saying, \u201cThis is fine\u201d). Isiksel grew up in Turkey, then left to study in the U.K., the U.S., and Italy before becoming a tenured professor and a naturalized American citizen. She told me, \u201cI really thought, as a constitutional theorist, that no place has fully solved the problem of checking power and letting the people rule, but at least America has it figured out better than anywhere else. But maybe Madison was right\u2014maybe constitutions really are just parchment barriers.\u201d She considered saying something more pointed, but held her tongue\u2014she had an upcoming flight to Istanbul, and she didn\u2019t want to cause unnecessary trouble for herself or her family. I asked whether she meant trouble in Turkey, or trouble back in the U.S. \u201cI don\u2019t even know at this point,\u201d she said. \u2666"

      "text": "It doesn't take much to cause generative AI to fall into 'complete accuracy collapse,' Apple research claims Credit: Foundry Filling the void in the few hours before WWDC begins, Apple\u2019s machine learning team raced out of the gate with a report to make people think twice about artificial intelligence, arguing that while the intelligence is artificial, it\u2019s only superficially smart. Some seem to think that Apple is attempting to mask its slow progress in AI development as its competitors push ahead toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Others warn that perhaps we should all think about these findings, given the speed with which the technology is being deployed across almost every part of our society. Are we really becoming dependent on tech that doesn\u2019t really work and will simply repeat the prejudices of its owners? Because that\u2019s what you get when you use something that is basically the kind of glorified pattern matching Apple\u2019s researchers reveal in their latest paper, \u201cThe Illusion of Thinking.\u201d The Illusion of Thinking In the 32-page paper, Apple\u2019s machine learning experts argue that despite the impressive results they can achieve, AI models aren\u2019t actually capable of authentic reasoning, relying more on pattern matching than deduction. For its analysis, the team tested models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and DeepSeek. \u201cRecent generations of frontier language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers,\u201d they write.\u201cThrough extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having an adequate token budget.\u201d They also claim that while both LRM and LLM systems are good at some things, LLM wins at low-complexity tasks, LRMs do well in medium complex tasks, and both LLM and LRM models \u201cexperience complete collapse\u201d when handling high-complexity tasks. \u201cWe found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models\u2019 computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities,\u201d the researchers wrote. It raises the critical question: are the genAI systems we think are capable of reasoning actually doing so, or have they simply been taught to appear to be reasoning, even when they aren\u2019t. Between AI ideas and reality, falls the shadow To prove its point, Apple shows how existing systems can be fed irrelevant or fake data they don\u2019t recognize, leading to failures. The inference is that while these machines are good at repeating and identifying the patterns they know, actual creative problem-solving is beyond their abilities. AI struggles with abstraction and generalization, which means the notion we\u2019re anywhere near AGI\u2026, well, it\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon. Apple isn\u2019t alone in warning about resisting the hype around AI. Critic Gary Marcus has been raising red flags about the true intelligence in these systems, pointing to their over-reliance on trading data. This reliance means that while we\u2019re promised that genAI will change everything and make everything better and more productive, it probably won\u2019t achieve anything like those promises. The gulf between promise and reality is driving many in the industry to reassess their expectations already. What this means, of course, is that rather than becoming reliant on these systems, it makes more sense to remain pragmatic and develop a hybrid approach, both toward AI deployment AI development. Hold the door Apple would say this, I suppose. We know it is facing unexpected challenges realizing the promises it made for Apple Intelligence at WWDC last year. \u201cWe need more time to complete our work on these features, so they meet our high quality bar,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said during last month\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers\u2019 hands.\u201d It\u2019s not impossible that part of the reason Apple has delayed introduction of some AI features is quite simply because they don\u2019t work as they should. It\u2019s possible this reflects what Apple\u2019s research shows, with the abilities of Apple Intelligence constrained by the same challenges its report describes. To some degree, Apple Intelligence doesn\u2019t matter. What is important is that any move to bet the entire future of you or of your business on AI is doomed to fail right now, if only because at root even automated pattern matching will eventually repeat the errors of the past. In the future? Who knows \u2014 the ability to create machines with human level intelligence is evidently in process, though most humans will probably prove more a little resistant to being replaced by machines. In the meantime, Apple will bring us a rebranded Siri, APIs so developers can build Apple Intelligence within their apps, and more partnerships with AI providers; the final obstacle is whether Apple can evolve an iteration of AI that gives it a truly competitive edge, and how long the company can play for time to achieve that.

It highlights a BBC study revealing that major AI chatbots struggle to accurately summarize news, often producing significant inaccuracies and failing to differentiate between fact and opinion. The piece warns that without a strong foundation of objective journalism, both society and AI could face dire consequences, as generative AI models are shown to collapse under complexity and lack true reasoning capabilities.",
