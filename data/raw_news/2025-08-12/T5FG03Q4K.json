      "text": "- Walmart has invested heavily in its online sales and delivery efforts.\n- The company's latest investment includes opening \"dark stores\" that will help boost e-commerce, but won't be open to the public.\n- The next 100%+ earnings move could hit this month. See how to find it live on Wednesday \u2192\nRetail giant Walmart Inc. WMT faces macroeconomic concerns and tariffs as it seeks to post continued revenue growth going forward.\nThe company could have a new secret weapon to support its growth.\nWhat Happened: Walmart is opening \"dark stores\" in several markets to ramp up its delivery and e-commerce efforts in the ongoing struggle with Amazon.com Inc. AMZN for the retail revenue crown.\nOne dark store has already opened in Dallas and another is planned for Bentonville, Arkansas, near the company's headquarters, according to Bloomberg.\nUnlike traditional Walmart supercenters or retail locations, these dark stores are closed to the public. They carry some of the most popular items that consumers frequently buy.\nEssentially, the new dark stores are large warehouses that will complement existing warehouses and ramp up the speed and size of Walmart's delivery range.\nThe report said more dark stores could be built in the future, and faster delivery is among the retail giant\u2019s key priorities.\nRead Also: Walmart Growth Prospects Remain Solid But Tariff Uncertainty Lingers, Analysts Say\nWhy It's Important: Walmart\u2019s strategy of having more warehouses to help with e-commerce growth isn't new. The company previously had a small number of warehouses similar to these dark stores in the mid-2010s, but those stores were mostly closed after the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo better compete with Amazon and other digital retailers, Walmart has launched new services like pharmacy delivery and increased its third-party selling marketplace items.\nWalmart expects to hit profitability for its online segment this year, following billions of dollars in investment in the segment.\nIn recent quarters, Amazon has posted higher revenue totals than Walmart, but this is due to the inclusion of both Amazon's retail and AWS businesses.\nIn March, Benzinga polled readers to see which retail stock they thought would lead by the end of 2025.\nThe results were:\n- Amazon: 48%\n- They\u2019ll remain neck-and-neck: 34%\n- Walmart: 18%\nAmazon was the clear leader in the poll, suggesting investors think the e-commerce giant could have the top stock return in 2025 of the two companies and continue to pass Walmart in revenue totals.\nWhile Amazon has surpassed Walmart in several quarters, Walmart maintained its lead in the 2024 fiscal year totals.\nAmazon's revenue was $638.0 billion in 2024, including $107.6 billion from AWS. Walmart\u2019s was $681.0 billion.\nWalmart's latest focus on e-commerce could help expand its growth and help fight off competition from Amazon.\nWMT Price Action: Walmart stock trades at $97.78 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $66.67 to $105.30. Walmart stock is up 8.5% year-to-date in 2025 and 44.8% over the last year.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com. Reserving the ticker symbol is not a guarantee that the company will go public.

      "text": "Trump Organization has filed a lawsuit against several unnamed merchandise sellers on popular marketplaces for allegedly marketing counterfeit Trump-branded products.\nWhat Happened: The Trump Organization, owned by President Donald Trump, has accused multiple online sellers, including retail giants like Walmart Inc. WMT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, and eBay Inc. EBAY, of selling \u201cinferior imitations\u201d of Trump-branded merchandise, reported Fortune. The lawsuit was filed in a U.S. District Court in Florida on Friday.\nAround 9,000 Amazon sellers earned nearly $140 million from Trump merchandise sales in the months before the election, per Omnisend data.\nThe lawsuit accuses the defendants of \u201cimproperly advertising, marketing, and/or selling unauthorized and illegal products infringing upon at least a portion of plaintiffs' Trump trademarks.\u201d The decision by the Trump Organization to sue these sellers has sparked controversy among legal experts due to its choice of a Schedule A case.\nSchedule A cases have become popular among trademark lawyers as they permit the plaintiff to sue a broad range of defendants without naming specific entities, often bypassing costly filing fees. This approach also grants considerable power to the judge\u2019s discretion.\nLegal experts have voiced concerns that Schedule A's broad grouping of defendants could lead to smaller vendors being penalized similarly to large-scale operations. Sarah Fackrell, an intellectual property law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, warned about due process issues and the risk of defendants being \"railroaded.\"\nWhy It Matters: This lawsuit comes at a time when the Trump brand is expanding its global presence. Earlier this month, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. DJT launched its TV streaming service, Truth+, worldwide. The company also operates the Truth Social social media platform.\nIn June, Donald Trump Jr., the executive vice president of The Trump Organization, defended his father's financial gains from a family-owned cryptocurrency company, stating that \"he doesn't touch it.\" This followed the disclosure of a $57.7 million income from World Liberty Financial.\nIn April, Donald Trump\u2019s online store began selling merchandise branded with \"Trump 2028,\" despite the constitutional prohibition on a third term presidency. This move raised eyebrows and sparked debates about the family\u2019s future political plans.\nREAD MORE:\nImage via Shutterstock\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nAmerica has a debt problem, and recent policy is making it worse. President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d is expected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, and economists project that the debt-to-GDP ratio will go from 100% to 120% in the same timespan.\nAs a result, corporations and consumers will be stuck with high interest rates until something changes.\nThat change might just come from artificial intelligence, one company argues.\nRange is an AI-powered wealth management platform for high earners that centralizes investments, taxes, estate plans, and more in one account. The platform uses advanced AI technology to deliver personalized financial guidance at fees 75-90% lower than traditional advisors, making expert wealth management more accessible. Today, Range serves nearly 2,000 clients managing over $6 billion in assets.\nTaresh Batra, Range\u2019s vice president of Investments, says these AI-driven productivity gains could be the key to accelerating GDP growth while bringing inflation and interest rates down. \u201cHigher growth and lower interest rates as a result of AI could be a panacea for the markets,\u201d Batra says.\nProductivity is Key\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office uses the following formula to measure and forecast the country\u2019s GDP, or Gross Domestic Product:\nReal GDP Growth = Labor Growth(x labor contribution) + Capital Growth(x capital contribution) + Productivity\n\u201cOf these variables, changes in productivity have the largest impact on GDP growth,\u201d Batra says. \u201cTechnological innovation has been the driver of productivity over the course of history.\u201d\nAI, Batra argues, has the potential to improve productivity and benefit the economy in the coming years, similarly to how the dot-com boom did in the mid-1990s.\nHere\u2019s how:\n- Direct Economic Growth: With AI, companies and workers can be more productive without requiring additional resources.\n- More Jobs, Not Less: While AI may automate certain tasks, history shows that technology creates more jobs than it replaces. In fact, 60% of today\u2019s jobs didn\u2019t exist in 1940. The World Economic Forum projects AI will generate a net gain of 78 million new jobs this decade alone. Range itself exemplifies this trend by employing CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs who collaborate closely with AI engineers to build smarter financial tools.\n- Increased Tax Revenues: \u201cHigher productivity usually leads to higher corporate profits, wages, and economic activity\u2014all of which generate increased tax receipts,\u201d Batra says. \u201cMore government revenue means less need to borrow.\u201d\n- Disinflationary Pressure: \u201cLess government borrowing leads to lower inflationary pressure,\u201d Batra says. \u201cIn addition, productivity improvements reduce the cost of producing goods and services, which slows down inflation.\u201d\n- Improved Debt Dynamics & Lower Rates: Lower inflation means the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates, which helps stimulate the economy and allows the government to spend less on interest expense and spend more money on the private sector.\nWhat\u2019s more, we\u2019re already seeing measurable productivity gains in industries that have integrated AI tools into their workflow. Even if policymakers fail to rein in spending in the coming years, AI-driven productivity gains in the private sector may allow us to \u201cgrow our way\u201d out of fiscal distress.\n\u201cIf AI delivers even modest incremental productivity gains of 1-1.5% annually, the US could potentially maintain or reduce current debt-to-GDP levels despite continued spending growth,\u201d Batra says.\nAI Is Transforming, Not Destroying the Job Market\nYes, the rise of AI has resulted in people losing their jobs. This, however, is not a new phenomenon.\nTake farming, for example. Around 70% of people were employed in agriculture in the early 1800s, but that number is now less than 2% thanks to the creation of farming machines and other advancements.\nAt the same time, technological innovations not only created new jobs to replace the ones lost. They added new roles that previously never existed.\n\u201cRemarkably, 60% of the jobs people are employed in today didn't exist in 1940,\u201d Batra says. \u201cThat means nearly 90% of employment growth over the last 80 years resulted from technology creating entirely new categories of work.\u201d\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs Report estimates that AI and related technologies will create a net gain of 78 million new roles this decade.\nRange is living proof of this. They\u2019ve hired CFPs, CPAs, and CFAs as critical subject matter experts to help their AI engineers build and validate their platform.\n\u201cThese aren't traditional roles\u2014they represent the emergence of new types of knowledge workers who combine domain expertise with technological fluency,\u201d Batra says.\nHow You Could Bring the Power of AI Into Your Wealth Management With Range\nIn just four short years, Range has signed up almost 2,000 high income members and advises them on more than $6 billion in assets.\nCurrently in beta, Range\u2019s proprietary AI engine is capable of delivering financial insights and guidance in seconds, potentially allowing you to capitalize on opportunities and avoid any potential pitfalls \u2014 for example, if you should buy an investment property or if you can retire early based on your complete financial picture\nRange also operates on a flat-fee pricing model and offers portfolio management with 0% Assets Under Management fees, so you won\u2019t pay more as your net worth continues to grow.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nYou see a shocking number of ads daily \u2013 researchers estimate between 6,000 and 10,000 and 375 to 625 per waking hour. In the modern age, most of them come from social media apps whose entire business model revolves around constantly showing you ads and keeping 100% of the revenue. But what if users got a share? That company might just grow its revenue by 32,481% in three years, help users earn and save $325 million and be named Deloitte's fastest-growing software company in North America. That\u2019s what Mode Mobile did. You can still get in for just $0.30 per share.\nReaching Financial Stability One Tap at a Time\nMost Americans can\u2019t afford a $1,000 emergency bill. That means many are one car breakdown or ER visit away from serious financial trouble. There's no quick fix to such a big financial challenge that over 50% of Americans face. However, it's safe to bet that the masses will flock to any good solutions. Mode Mobile created one such solution years ago by allowing people to earn money doing what they already spend a third of their waking hours on \u2013 tapping, scrolling and looking at their smartphone screens.\nMode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. However, users can earn income on their existing devices as well. This extreme competitiveness has allowed Mode Mobile to attract over 50 million registered beta users. Launching the finalized version could bring in millions more, helping the company reach its goal of $150 million in annual revenue within three years.\n6,955,000,000 Users to Go\nCurrently, seven billion smartphones worldwide provide functionality or entertainment but take all the profits. Mode Mobile\u2019s disruption offers the same benefits but allows users to earn money at a time when the prices of goods are skyrocketing. Just like Airbnb lets users earn extra cash by renting out their bedrooms and Uber allows users to make money on their rides back home from work, Mode Mobile wants to enable its users to make money from their phones. However, its total addressable market is much larger than Airbnb\u2019s and Uber\u2019s \u2013 currently at over $1 trillion.\nYou can invest in Mode Mobile at $0.30 per share with a minimum investment of $4,950. Plus, the company is offering the chance to earn up to 120% in bonus shares, if you invest more. All funding rounds open to non-accredited investors, including Mode Mobile\u2019s, are limited in time. So, if you\u2019d like to be part of the future it's building, consider acting soon.\nDisclaimer:\nAN OFFERING STATEMENT REGARDING THIS OFFERING HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE SEC. THE SEC HAS QUALIFIED THAT OFFERING STATEMENT, WHICH ONLY MEANS THAT THE COMPANY MAY MAKE SALES OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED BY THE OFFERING STATEMENT. THE OFFERING CIRCULAR THAT IS PART OF THAT OFFERING STATEMENT IS AVAILABLE HERE.\nMode Mobile recently received their ticker reservation with Nasdaq ($MODE), indicating an intent to IPO in the next 24 months. An intent to IPO is no guarantee that an actual IPO will occur.\nThe Deloitte rankings are based on submitted applications and public company database research, with winners selected based on their fiscal-year revenue growth percentage over a three-year period.\nDisclaimer: Please be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nCollect passive income from real estate without taking on the headaches of being a landlord. You can now take advantage of the higher-for-longer interest rate environment by investing in a portfolio of private real estate debt with as little as $100.\nThe explosion of private credit returns is unlikely to last forever, but currently, it\u2019s one of the hottest asset classes out there. In 2020, its total value stood at $1.04 trillion. Just three years later, it grew by a staggering 55% to reach $1.61 trillion. BlackRock expects it to climb up to $3.5 trillion by 2028. The IMF has recognized its spectacular returns in recent years. Bezos\u2019 darling real estate platform, which has completely disrupted the industry, now targets 7%-9% in annual cash dividends through private debt investing.\nPrivate Debt for All\nArrived has become a household investment platform that knows how to deliver passive investments. It has generated $5.6 million for its investors in dividends alone, and its user base continues to grow throughout market fluctuations. The company now boasts 614,000 registered investors who routinely snap up the shares of its carefully vetted offerings. Over the years, it has developed deep knowledge about what makes real estate markets tick. Now, using that knowledge to deliver 7%-9% for investors looking to diversify into real estate private debt through the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\nThis type of corporate credit offers relatively higher profits at lower risk as it's backed by real estate. If things go south, investors may be able to recoup their losses, depending on their position. Arrived uses a tried and tested fund mechanism to deliver passive income to the investors. It pools the funds and uses them to finance specific real estate projects that pay out monthly interest. It\u2019s targeting 7% to 9% returns after all fees and expenses. To achieve this goal across its loans, it approaches individual loans with the same scrutiny level as the homes.\nArrived's Q3 2024 report underscores the broader success of its investment strategy. During the quarter, investors earned over $1.54 million in dividend income, marking a 25% increase from Q2 2024. Across 354 individual properties, single-family residential investments averaged 3.7% annualized dividends, while vacation rentals provided an average return of 2.8%. These consistent results demonstrate the platform's ability to balance income and appreciation across its portfolio.\nLIMITED TIME FOR JUST $100\nThe Byers House\nOwn a piece of the Byers House, a vacation rental located at the iconic home of Joyce, Jonathan, and Will Byers, featured in Stranger Things and located in Fayetteville, GA, just 20 minutes from Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. This property was used to film the exterior scenes in the actual show and influenced the design for the interior sets, which were filmed in a nearby studio.\nDebt Acquisition Tactics\nArrived partners only with experienced professionals with a history of successful real estate projects and a spotless financial record. Sticking to this criterion mitigates the risk of delays, cost overruns, and other unpredictable problems that may arise.\nAdditionally, the platform only considers residential properties in the first loan position, which creates a thick protection barrier in the event of a downside. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, Arrived and its investors would be the first to get their investment back.\nLocation also plays an important factor. Just like with its fractional share offerings, Arrived uses a combination of data science and human expertise to pinpoint the most promising deals that come its way.\nA Way In\nPrivate credit was reserved only for high-net-worth individuals who could afford the astronomical investment minimums and fees. But with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, any investor, accredited or non-accredited, can acquire a stake in the fund with as little as $100 and receive monthly dividends.\nClick here to invest in the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\nCheck out the latest offerings on Arrived\nDiversify your portfolio with a mix of debt and equity real estate investments through Arrived's multiple offerings.\nHold on!\nInvestors are seeing outstanding returns through curated real estate investment alerts. Sign up to get them sporadically and don\u2019t miss out on offers you\u2019d likely never hear about.\nMore From Benzinga\nDisclaimer: Please be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.
