      "summary": "U.S. Critical Metals Corp. (USCM) has retained 100% ownership of the Haynes Cobalt Project in Idaho, a past‑producing asset adjacent to Jervois Mining’s only U.S. cobalt mine. The move comes as the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency launches a $500 million, five‑year program to acquire 7,480 t of cobalt, underscoring the nation’s heavy reliance on imports and the strategic need for domestic supply. USCM views the Idaho property as a key asset for defense, aerospace and energy‑transition industries, and highlights recent U.S. government support for critical metals, including a $400 million equity investment in MP Materials. The company plans further exploration to confirm the property’s potential to bridge future supply gaps for the U.S. critical‑metals supply chain.",
