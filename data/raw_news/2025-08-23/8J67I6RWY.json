  "content": "The Trump administration has handed the Department of Homeland Security \u201climitless authority\u201d in effect to search travelers\u2019 devices without a warrant, the ACLU\u2019s Esha Bhandari says.\n\nWIRED reported Wednesday that Customs and Border Protection searched 14,899 devices between April and June, a record quarterly total and a 16.7 percent jump over the previous high of at least 12,766 in early 2022. The increase comes as the second Trump administration takes aggressive actions on migration, including massive DHS/ICE budgets and a focus on incarcerating migrants in remote camps and federal prisons.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to target the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d recent data shows more than a third of ICE arrests in June were of people who have no criminal convictions or pending charges.\n\nIn related news this week, a Senate investigation led by Senator Jon Ossoff has so far identified more than 500 credible reports of abuse in US immigration detention since January\u2014including miscarriages, child neglect, and sexual abuse\u2014spanning facilities in 25 states, Puerto Rico, US military bases, and charter deportation flights.\n\nOssoff cited, among other public reporting, a June investigation by WIRED that revealed a pattern of medical crises at 10 of the nation\u2019s largest ICE facilities, with incidents ranging from pregnancy complications and suicide attempts to seizures, head injuries, and allegations of sexual assault.\n\nIn somehow perhaps even worse news, new research shared exclusively with WIRED by International Justice Mission (IJM) links 493 child sextortion reports made to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) over two years to scam compounds in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos; another 18,017 NCMEC reports contained IP addresses used at those locations. IJM cross-referenced more than 1.1 million \u201conline enticement\u201d incidents and mobile ad data, concluding that at least 40 of 44 known compounds are tied to the reports\u2014the first clear evidence connecting forced scamming centers to child sextortion.\n\nIn data breach news, an unsecured database exposed nearly a million medical-cannabis patient records\u2014including Social Security numbers, government IDs, and health details\u2014likely tied to Ohio Medical Alliance, security researcher Jeremiah Fowler found. The 323-GB trove was taken offline a day after Fowler notified the company on July 14. Ohio Medical Alliance informed WIRED that it could not immediately provide a comment, requiring additional time to \u201cinvestigate this alleged incident.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn\u2019t cover in-depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nIn a subpoena issued earlier this year to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, The Washington Post reports, the Department of Justice sought an extraordinarily broad range of information about care for trans minors dating back to 2020. This included the names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and addresses of CHOP patients who were prescribed hormone therapy or puberty blockers, as well as medical records relating to prescriptions. Other records sought include personnel files for anyone with authority to direct \u201cany aspect of [CHOP] affairs,\u201d for \u201cemployees, contractors, or affiliates who have authority to prescribe mediations or perform medical evaluations,\u201d and for anyone \u201cengaged in billing activities.\u201d\n\nPost sources said that similar subpoenas have targeted information about the provision of gender-affirming care to patients under 19, including in states where such care was and is legal. President Donald Trump has issued executive orders purporting to define sex and block hospitals offering a range of treatments to minors from receiving federal finds, but for now those have been stayed by the courts.",

      "text": "United States Custom and Border Protection officials have sweeping powers to search anyone\u2019s phone when they are entering the country\u2014including US citizens. Newly released figures show that over the past three months, CBP officials have been searching more phones and other devices than ever before.\nFrom April through June this year, CBP searched 14,899 devices carried by international travelers, according to stats published on the agency's website. While the figures aren\u2019t broken down by device type, the CBP has the ability to search phones, computers, cameras, and other electronics. The April-June spike tops the previous highest quarterly figure of at least 12,766 devices, which were searched by CBP officials from January through March 2022, by 16.7 percent.\nThe increase in phone and device searches at the border comes as the second Trump administration takes aggressive actions on migration, with a vast increase in budget for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement and thousands of arrests taking place. Since the start of the year, people traveling to the US have reported long detentions, intrusive phone searches and allegedly being denied entry due to content on their devices. In recent months, some European travelers have canceled trips to the US, while the number of Canadian visitors to the US has dropped for seven consecutive months.\n\u201cThe real issue is the chilling effect it has on all travelers,\u201d says Esha Bhandari, a deputy director of American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. Bhandari adds that anyone could be subject to a potential device search, including those who are critical of the administration or lawyers and journalists who may have sensitive information on their devices. \u201cThis is essentially a limitless authority that they claim for themselves to search travelers without a warrant to search the full scope of information people carry on them,\u201d Bhandari says.\nThe CBP\u2019s data shows that there has been an uptick of phone and electronics searches over the past decade, throughout various administrations. According to the agency\u2019s statistics, which are published using the fiscal year running from October to September, there were 8,503 searches in 2015. By 2018, this figure had risen to 33,296 device searches, and the last full year of data available, the fiscal year 2024, there were 46,362 searches.\nThe latest quarterly statistics for the past three months of 2025 show 13,824 \u201cbasic\u201d searches and 1,075 \u201cadvanced\u201d searches. Basic searches can involve a border agent manually scrolling through someone\u2019s phone and inspecting its contents. This means an agent may be able to find some information on a device but may not have the time or ability to conduct a deep inspection of what is included in messages or buried in photo reels. Meanwhile, advanced searches involve a much more intrusive approach: connecting forensics tools to the device to extract huge reams of data. Despite the spike in overall device searches, the number of advanced searches has remained relatively steady over the past 21 months.\nThe CBP did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. \u201cThe number of travelers crossing the border that experience a border search of their electronic devices is small,\u201d the CBP\u2019s web pages say. It says that in the last year where data is available, \u201cless than 0.01 percent\u201d of international travelers had their devices searched.\nAnyone entering the US\u2014from citizens to temporary visa holders\u2014can potentially have their phones or electronics searched by CBP staff. Across the country, border zones typically fall outside of Fourth Amendment protections that require warrants for devices to be searched by officials. On its website, the CBP says that people should present their devices \u201cin a condition that allows for the examination of the device and its contents.\u201d In short, that means unlocked and potentially giving the password to border agents.\nIf a US citizen or green card holder refuses a search, they cannot\u2014at least in theory\u2014be denied entry to the country. However, their devices may be seized temporarily, and they could be subject to extra questioning. Foreign visitors can face detention or deportation for refusing a search.\nWhile advanced searches have made up only a tiny percentage of phone searches in recent years, that could be set to change as the second Trump administration progresses. As WIRED reported at the start of July, Customs and Border Protection is in the process of procuring advanced digital forensics tools to process data from electronic devices. The CBP currently has multiple contracts for forensics tools from Cellebrite.\nIn a request for information, which was published in June and updated in July, the CBP said it is looking for more tools that can process data from travelers\u2019 devices and help border agents understand it. One example listed the ability to \u201csearch a list of text messages to find patterns or \u2018hidden language\u2019 in suspect communications that may not be obvious at first look.\u201d"

      "text": "On April 28, a nurse at the Aurora ICE Processing Center near Denver called 911. A woman in custody, four months pregnant, had arrived at the facility\u2019s medical unit, bleeding and in pain. As the staff rushed to get vitals, the dispatcher rattled off questions: How old was she? Was the pregnancy high risk? The nurse hesitated: \u201cShe just came to us three days ago.\u201d\nOn 911 audio obtained by WIRED, the dispatcher\u2019s voice cuts in:\n\u201cIs there any sign of life?\u201d\n\u201cHave we heard a heartbeat?\u201d\n\u201cDoes she feel any kicking?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the equipment to do that,\u201d the nurse replies.\nIt was just one incident in a spike of emergencies playing out inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers nationwide.\nA WIRED investigation into 911 calls from 10 of the nation's largest immigration detention centers found that serious medical incidents are rising at many of the sites. The data, obtained through public records requests, show that at least 60 percent of the centers analyzed had reported serious pregnancy complications, suicide attempts, or sexual assault allegations. Since January, these 10 facilities have collectively placed nearly 400 emergency calls. Nearly 50 of those have involved potential cardiac episodes, 26 referenced seizures, and 17 reported head injuries. Seven calls described suicide attempts or self-harm, including overdoses and hangings. Six others involved allegations of sexual abuse\u2014including at least one case logged as \u201cstaff on detainee.\u201d\nWIRED spoke with immigration attorneys, local migrant advocates, national policy experts, and individuals who have been recently detained or have family currently in ICE custody. Their accounts echoed the data: a system overwhelmed, and at times, seemingly indifferent to medical crises.\nExperts believe the true number of medical emergencies is far higher.\nThe records WIRED reviewed capture only the medical emergencies that resulted in a 911 call\u2014typically made by facility staff. Experts say many serious incidents likely go unreported, citing years\u2019 worth of reports and independent medical reviews. Even among those that did prompt outside help, a third of all the calls had vague or nonexistent descriptions, with details often withheld by authorities.\nFor example, on March 16, a woman identifying herself as a detainee at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, called 911. Communication was strained: The dispatcher spoke no Spanish, and the caller only a little English. \"I need help,\u201d the woman said. \"I need \u2026 ayuda.\" The line goes abruptly dead, triggering a follow-up call from the emergency operator. A staff member at the facility answers the phone: \u201cWe're at a detention center, and the detainee called 911, I'm sorry.\u201d The woman's voice is still audible in the background, still pleading. Records indicate no ambulance was dispatched.\nICE detention facilities are operating over capacity. Detention has surged by more than 48 percent since January, pushing the detained population to over 59,000\u2014an all-time high, according to available data. The 2025 emergency call data also reflects conditions before ICE\u2019s latest enforcement surge\u2014a May directive from Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem and White House adviser Stephen Miller to triple daily arrests. Accordingly, the crises documented here are likely to deepen.\nIn pursuit of its eventual goal of detaining 100,000 people simultaneously, the agency is targeting not just high-priority criminal offenders, but those who report, check in, and otherwise follow the law. The result has stretched the detention system to its limit. ICE has responded by offloading detainees into federal penitentiaries and tent-like barracks in detention camps, while issuing a wave of no-bid contracts\u2014financial windfalls for private prison giants like The GEO Group and CoreCivic, which operate the vast majority of the facilities named in this report.\nThe human cost of ICE\u2019s strategy is increasingly visible. Dispatch data from 911 calls reveal how quickly medical emergencies can spiral inside these remote, crowded facilities\u2014places where urgent care delivery is often delayed, falls on overworked staff, or is hindered by \u201cinsufficient or malfunctioning\u201d equipment.\nThe DHS and ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nCare on the Margins\nOne of America\u2019s busiest detention centers sits on a plot of unincorporated land in the heart of rural Georgia. It\u2019s isolated even by local standards.\nWhen emergencies strike at Stewart Detention Center, responders are often dispatched from a weathered brick building in the nearby town of Lumpkin, a former agricultural community steeped in plantation-era history, economically defined by the ebb and flow of Stewart\u2019s detained population. The detention center is a leading source of both jobs and operating revenue for the county.\nThroughout 2024, Stewart logged a steady stream of medical emergencies and violent episodes, from seizures and head injuries to suicide attempts and abdominal pain. But medical emergencies at Stewart have increased in both volume and severity in the first four months of 2025 alone, compared to the same time last year. Though Stewart\u2019s population is only roughly 10 percent larger now, serious medical emergencies\u2014seizures, head traumas, and suspected heart issues\u2014have more than tripled.\nIn March, a Stewart staff member called 911 to report that multiple women were \u201cnot breathing\u201d after they'd been pepper sprayed. At least one serious injury reported this year was self-inflicted: an inmate \u201cbeating his head against the wall.\u201d Jes\u00fas Molina-Veya, a Stewart detainee, is also confirmed to have died by suicide on June 7.\nStewart has reported more in-custody deaths since 2017 than any other facility nationwide.\nStewart County is part of a region hit hard by rural hospital closures, leaving residents with some of the longest emergency transport times in the state. EMS crews are being called upon to stabilize patients for longer periods, with doctors that provide advanced care occasionally taking an hour or more to reach.\nIn several instances since March, it has taken EMS crews hours to clear some of the most urgent medical calls at Stewart, including cases involving chest pain and abnormal heart readings. In April, EMS spent more than two hours handling a seizure at Stewart. The same month, a pregnant woman at the facility was discovered \u201cspitting up blood.\u201d EMS logs show the call took two and half hours to clear.\nMarc Stern, a physician and former subject matter expert for the DHS\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, where he investigated equality-of-care issues at privately run ICE facilities, cautions that 911 records alone offer limited insight into why some calls took over two hours to resolve. But for people in ICE custody\u2014who have no say in where they\u2019re being held\u2014being placed in areas with scarce medical infrastructure only deepens their vulnerability.\n\u201cAs a community member, you make a choice to live where you\u2019re living, with all its pros and cons, including, in this case, distance from a hospital,\u201d Stern says. When ICE detainees with chronic health conditions are transferred from urban areas like Los Angeles\u2014where there\u2019s greater hospital access and faster emergency response times\u2014to isolated detention centers in rural towns with limited infrastructure and fewer emergency services, they\u2019re forced to accept a significantly lower standard of care.\nCoreCivic, which runs Stewart, says its detention facilities are staffed with licensed, credentialed doctors, nurses, and mental health professionals. \u201cCoreCivic does not enforce immigration laws, arrest anyone who may be in violation of immigration laws, or have any say whatsoever in an individual\u2019s deportation or release,\u201d says spokesperson Brian Todd.\n\u201cCoreCivic also does not know the circumstances of individuals when they are placed in our facilities,\u201d he says.\nEl Refugio, a nonprofit based near Stewart supporting detainees and their families, has fielded a recent surge of allegations about overcrowding at the facility, as well as claims of medical neglect, according to Amilcar Valencia, the group\u2019s executive director.\n\u201cThat\u2019s been the story of the last eight weeks,\u201d he says.\nDuring visits in recent months, Emelie says her husband, who was detained at Stewart until he was deported last month, described severe overcrowding. \"He told me once Trump took over, they were rolling out mats in the halls. People were sleeping out there.\u201d\nEmelie is a pseudonym granted for privacy. She says the conditions took a visible toll on her husband, who lost weight, grew increasingly anxious, and struggled to sleep amid the noise and tension. He described having to wait long stretches between meals. When her husband came down with the flu and spiked a high fever, she says, he filed multiple sick call requests, but never received care. \"He had Covid-19 once,\u201d she says. \u201cSame thing. People would be sick and just left to get worse.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t stand a chance at Stewart,\u201d Emelie says, \u201cIt\u2019s a death sentence for you and your family.\u201d\nWhen asked about overcrowding at Stewart, Todd told WIRED, \u201cEveryone in our care is offered a bed.\u201d But three attorneys who regularly visit the facility said their clients have consistently described sleeping on floors or in plastic containers fitted with thin mats. Three relatives of current and former detainees corroborated those accounts.\nCoreCivic did not respond when asked how it defines a \u201cbed.\u201d\nScrambling to Cope\nThe consequences of overcrowding extend far beyond Stewart.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more transfers happening abruptly and frantically,\u201d says Jeff Migliozzi, the communications director for the nonprofit Freedom for Immigrants, which runs the National Immigration Detention Hotline. \u201cThey\u2019re scrambling.\u201d Hotline calls more than doubled from 700 in December to 1,600 in March. Many go unanswered, Migliozzi says, because the lines are often too busy.\nDispatch data obtained from these detention facilities across the US reflect the surge. Six of the 10 facilities reviewed by WIRED experienced a sharp month-to-month spike in 911 calls at some point in 2025, with emergency dispatches more than tripling in certain cases. For example, nearly 80 emergency calls were placed from the remote South Texas ICE Processing Center between January and May. Logs show that the number of calls more than tripled in March, rising from 10 in February to 31. In one week, dispatchers fielded 11 separate calls at the facility, which is run by the GEO Group, one of the nation\u2019s largest for-profit prison operators.\nMigliozzi cautions that a rise in 911 calls doesn\u2019t necessarily signal worsening conditions but may simply reflect a surging detainee population within an already dire system. Other experts noted a rise in calls could, hypothetically, signal that staff are getting quicker to call for help\u2014though, conversely, a decline might just as easily point to delayed responses, not fewer crises\nThree of the seven 911 calls obtained by WIRED involving suicide attempts this year came from the South Texas center: In February, a 36-year-old man swallowed 20 over-the-counter pills. In March, a 37-year-old detainee ingested cleaning chemicals. Two weeks later, a 41-year-old man was found cutting himself.\nImmigration detention isn\u2019t supposed to be punitive, says Anthony Enriquez, vice president of advocacy at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. \u201cBut the conditions of confinement in detention are so brutal,\u201d he says, \u201cthat people have attempted suicide while waiting for their day in court.\u201d\n| Got a Tip? |\n|---|\n| Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about immigration enforcement? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at dmehro.89 or dell.3030. |\nEnriquez argues that the decision to locate facilities in such remote areas\u2014limiting access to family, legal support, and community resources\u2014is no accident. The volume and frequency of 911 calls nationwide, he says, reflect a system that not only isolates detainees but leaves them dangerously vulnerable to harm.\nAs of May, over five dozen 911 calls have been placed this year from the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado, another facility operated by the GEO Group. In April, the calls were more than double that of March. In one case, a nurse reported a 20-year-old woman detoxing from a drug commonly prescribed to treat anxiety and seizures. She was too weak to walk, the nurse said, and \u201cbarely weighs 90 pounds.\u201d The facility, she explained, does not treat people in withdrawal, adding: \u201cWe want to make sure she doesn\u2019t have a seizure.\u201d\nAnother 911 call was placed about a 20-year-old woman withdrawing from the same drug less than a week later. This time, she had a seizure and, according to the nurse, was \u201cin and out of consciousness.\u201d\nSince January, at least four 911 calls from detention facilities in Colorado, Texas, and Georgia have involved pregnant women in distress, bleeding or suffering severe pain\u2014one of them a CoreCivic employee. Research links ICE detention to high rates of pregnancy complications, with physicians finding serious risks to both fetal and maternal health. As a result, ICE policy generally discourages the detention of pregnant individuals.\nEnforcement of this policy appears inconsistent. According to DHS data, ICE booked 158 pregnant, postpartum, and nursing individuals over a six-month period ending early last spring.\nEunice Hyunhye Cho, a senior attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, says that while it's hard to judge ICE\u2019s compliance from 911 call data alone, it\u2019s clear that the agency\u2019s recent drive to boost the detained population has dramatically increased the number of people who would have never been detained in the past, including pregnant individuals. \u201cPrevious administrations have chosen to exercise discretion about who to detain and who to release, based on medical vulnerability, but there is less indication that this is happening now.\u201d\n\u201cAs multiple medical experts and medical associations have noted, placing individuals who are pregnant, postpartum, or nursing in detention is simply not a safe practice,\u201d Cho adds, \u201cparticularly in light of poor nutrition and medical care in detention settings, as well as the harm it causes to children and families.\u201d\nIn an email, CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd says detainees have \u201cdaily access to sign up for medical care, including mental health services,\u201d adding that Stewart\u2019s clinic is staffed with licensed professionals who \u201ccontractually meet the highest standards of care as verified by multiple audits and inspections.\u201d\n\u201cOur onsite health services team at SDC, as with every facility where we provide medical care, takes seriously their role and responsibility to provide high-quality health care,\u201d he says.\nMeredyth Yoon, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice \u2013 Atlanta, says her office has documented cases of pregnant people suffering miscarriages in custody after being denied proper medical attention. \u201cWe know specific instances where people have made repeated medical requests for weeks and not been seen,\u201d she says. In other cases, she adds, pregnant detainees have gone months without any prenatal care.\n\u201cWhen you hear about someone bleeding for days without being seen, locked alone in a room with no medical attention, it\u2019s deeply disturbing,\u201d she says. \"But it's not out of line with the types of things that we see at Stewart.\u201d\nCoreCivic's Todd says the company is barred by privacy laws from commenting on specific medical cases.\nSilence on the Line\nFor every 911 call, advocates say, many more emergencies go unreported. Structural barriers often prevent detainees from receiving timely care. To see a provider, people in ICE custody normally submit a written \u201csick call\u201d request. But responses can take days, and even then, evaluations are often cursory, according to detainees and their families.\n\u201cA 911 call usually means someone\u2019s in a condition the facility can\u2019t handle,\u201d says Cho. ICE detention centers typically rely on on-site medical units that operate more like basic clinics, she explains, able to dispense medication and check symptoms, but may not be equipped to handle most emergencies. When staff can\u2019t manage a detainee\u2019s condition, policy requires them to call 911 and notify supervisors through specific emergency protocols. But in practice, these steps have often been poorly followed or lead to delays.\nRodney Taylor, a double amputee detained at Stewart Detention Center, has never been taken to a hospital despite multiple medical emergencies, according to his fianc\u00e9e, Mildred Pierre. \u201cIt has taken three to four days for detainees to be seen,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the capacity to support people with disabilities,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s automatic medical neglect.\u201d\nThree weeks ago, Taylor fell and seriously injured himself, breaking the prosthetic limbs he\u2019d waited months to receive. He also hurt his hand trying to brace the fall. \u201cBruised. Swollen. The thumb won\u2019t bend at all,\u201d Pierre says of his injuries.\nTaylor suffers from chronic conditions, including diverticulitis and a history of heart disease, according to Pierre. While in custody, she recalls, his blood pressure once spiked to a dangerously high reading that warrants emergency care when combined with other symptoms. \u201cHe was having blurred vision and a headache,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was having tingly feelings in his arms. I'm like, \u2018It sounds like you're having a stroke.\u2019\u201d When he was finally seen by onsite medical staff, she says, they gave him Tylenol and his usual blood pressure medicine.\nAllison Bustillo, a 23-year-old nursing student with scoliosis, has spent the past four months in ICE custody in Georgia. Her mother, Keily Chinchilla, says Bustillo has often been forced to sleep on the floor, her spine seizing from inflammation, her left arm and half her face numb. Chinchilla says her daughter relies on a cocktail of anti-inflammatories and other drugs to manage her condition, but she isn't receiving them regularly.\nSince her detention began, Bustillo\u2019s condition has worsened markedly. She has reported blood in her stool, severe stomach pain, and episodes of dangerously low blood pressure that once led staff to rush her to the infirmary. Most days, though, her mother says her pleas for help go ignored or are met with indifference. Unable to tolerate the facility\u2019s food, which she says exacerbates her pain, Bustillo survives mostly on commissary oatmeal and canned tuna, funded by her mother from far.\n\u201cI'm the only one trying to help my daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cShe's not a criminal. She's sick and needs help.\u201d\nOther 911 calls from facilities around the country suggest that even when emergencies are recognized, access to medical care can be delayed\u2014or denied entirely.\nAt the South Texas ICE Processing Center, a woman called 911 on March 31 to report that her husband, detained inside, had been too weak to get out of bed all day and \u201cthey have not helped.\u201d\nIn Denver, a female nurse at the Aurora ICE Processing Center called 911 on April 30 to report that a detainee on Level 1 suicide watch\u2014the highest risk tier\u2014had intentionally slammed his head into a wall and was bleeding from the mouth. Midway through the call, there's some commotion in the background, and a man can be heard telling the nurse to cancel the call. \u201cYou know what, never mind,\u201d she says. When the dispatcher asks, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d she responds: \u201cThe provider cancelled it.\u201d\nWhat Gets Buried Inside\nAt least six 911 calls placed from two GEO Group facilities this year reference possible forced sexual contact.\nThe company says it enforces a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy for sexual abuse and complies with federal regulations under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), a 2003 law aimed at curbing the epidemic of sexual violence in US prisons and jails. Experts warn that in the absence of meaningful oversight under the Trump administration, written rules cannot guarantee real-world protections.\nOne of the facilities is the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, which reopened early this year after years of relative dormancy due to reports of unsafe conditions. Within its first three months back in operation, the facility generated at least 13 emergency calls\u2014including at least two involving reported sexual assaults or threats of sexual assaults in March and April.\nAt the South Texas ICE Processing Center, another GEO-run facility, the pattern continues. One 911 dispatch from March states simply: \u201cStaff on detainee.\u201d Since January, at least three other emergency calls have referenced sexual abuse.\nIn recent months, the Trump administration has quietly gutted two critical oversight bodies at DHS responsible for investigating abuses in detention: the immigration detention ombuds office and the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. According to Zain Lakhani of the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, their dismantling has left detained migrants with virtually no channel to report sexual assault, medical neglect, or violations of parental rights. \u201cThese statutory obligations that they have to prevent and respond to sexual abuse, there\u2019s no one to actually do this work now,\u201d she says.\nThe administration hasn\u2019t said how it will handle the abandoned complaints or meet its obligations under PREA. Groups like WRC, once granted regular access to ICE facilities to document abuses and escalate reports, have been effectively cut off\u2014resulting in what Lakhani calls a \u201cblack box of impunity.\"\nLike other experts, Lakhani says gauging the true scale of sexual abuse in detention is nearly impossible. \u201cI think using 911 calls at the best of times is only going to capture a very, very small fraction of the number of cases,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd migrants are also terrified. They're calling from inside detention and they don't know what's going to happen to them.\u201d\nAt least hundreds of immigrants have reported sexual abuse while in ICE custody over the past decade, according to an investigation by Futuro Media, whose reporting found that \u201cmost sexual abuse complaints aren\u2019t being investigated.\u201d Analysis of internal records by the nonprofit newsroom revealed allegations of 308 sexual abuse or assault complaints filed across ICE facilities between 2015 and 2021. More than half implicated staff.\nSimilarly, The Intercept reported that ICE records revealed more than 1,200 allegations of sexual abuse and assault between 2010 and 2017. Only 43 were investigated by DHS.\nLike GEO Group, CoreCivic says it's committed to combatting sexual abuse and harassment, citing regulations imposed under PREA, adding that its staff receive \u201cpre-service and in-service\u201d education and training.\nBoth companies cited oversight and accreditations from the American Correctional Association (ACA) and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) as evidence of their adherence to national guidelines.\nAccreditation shows whether a facility checks boxes\u2014not whether people inside get care, says Dr. Stern. Facilities can score points just by writing policies or hiring staff, regardless of outcomes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like saying someone has a driver\u2019s license,\u201d says Stern. \u201cThey passed a test. But that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t run a red light tomorrow.\u201d\nUpdated 5:35 pm ET, June 25, 2025: Added additional comment from a CoreCivic spokesperson regarding the company's policies around pregnant detainees."

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nA far larger share of non\u2011criminal migrants have been arrested as part of the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement campaign, according to new federal and independent data.\nThe director of the Deportation Data Project told Newsweek that he found it \"impossible\" for the president to keep his promise of mass deportations of \"criminals.\" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs at DHS, however, told Newsweek, in part, \"It is not an accurate description to say they are 'non-criminals.' This deceptive categorization is devoid of reality and misleads the American public. Let us remind you that being here illegally is in fact a crime (8 USC 1325).\"\nWhy It Matters\nPresident Donald Trump emphasized a prioritization of the removal of violent offenders and the \"worst of the worst\" during his presidential campaign; however, data shows growing arrests of people without U.S. criminal charges or convictions, raising legal and policy questions about resources, detention capacity and humanitarian oversight.\nRecent cases involving nonviolent immigrants lacking criminal records have exacerbated concerns and led to broader discussions of whether immigrants, in certain instances, who lack citizenship but have abided by all other U.S. laws, should be removed.\nWhat To Know\nFederal and independent datasets show that ICE arrested substantially more people overall during the Trump administration's first six months in office than during the final six months of the Biden administration.\nResearchers at the the University of California at Berkeley's Deportation Data Project, which compiles federal data, found that roughly 37 percent of ICE arrests in July 2025 were of people with no U.S. criminal convictions or pending charges\u2014doubling to about 92,000 during the first six months of the Trump administration compared with the final half\u2011year of the Joe Biden administration.\nThat 37 percent figure is up from 13 percent during Biden's last full month in office in December.\n\"As the [Trump] administration increases immigration arrests, it will inevitably sweep in many people with no criminal record,\" Davis Hausman, a law professor and faculty director of the Deportation Data Project, told Newsweek via email on Thursday. \"There just aren't many noncitizens with criminal records, so the promise of mass deportations of criminals is an impossible one to keep.\"\nThe Trump administration has dramatically increased arrests of people who have never been convicted of a crime in the US, accounting for a little more than 60 percent of ICE arrests during his first six months in office, roughly equating to 188 days, compared to the 44 percent of arrests during Biden's last six months as president.\nOf the Trump administration's approximate 132,485 arrests, 39 percent had criminal convictions; 31 percent had criminal charges pending; and 30 percent had no criminal charges.\nIn comparison, the Biden administration's approximate 52,334 arrests included 56 percent with criminal convictions, 28 percent with pending criminal charges, and 16 percent with no criminal charges.\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs at DHS, told Newsweek via email that the Deportation Data Project \"is being cherry picked...to peddle a false narrative.\"\nMultiple independent analyses and reporting showed the detention population rose to record levels in June and July, with estimates of roughly 55,000 to 59,000 people held in ICE facilities during late June and July, according to The Guardian\u2014noting that ICE arrests have more than doubled in 38 states and are most prevalent in states with large immigrant populations including California, Florida and Texas.\nSouthern and western states that have embraced Trump's agenda have also experienced higher arrests.\nDuring a White House meeting in May, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller urged ICE agents to aim for as many as 3,000 arrests per day.\nA recent case involving a Chinese immigrant and small-business restaurant owner, Kelly Yu, in Arizona has led to bipartisan calls for her release from ICE detainment. DHS has refuted statements in her defense.\n\"Lai Kuen Yu, an illegal alien from Hong Kong, has had a final deportation order from a judge since 2005,\" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs at DHS, told Newsweek via email. \"She was arrested illegally crossing the border by U.S. Border Patrol in Arizona on February 4, 2004, and two days later was released into the country.\"\nDHS said that in November 2013, the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed her appeal and upheld her final order of removal. On August 23, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied her appeal.\nOn June 12 of this year, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted her a temporary stay of removal while it considers her motion to reopen. She will remain in ICE custody pending her removal proceedings.\n\"ICE does not deport U.S. citizens,\" McLaughlin said. \"It's her choice. Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children or ICE will place the children with someone the parent designates.\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nDavis Hausman, a law professor and faculty director of the Deportation Data Project, told Newsweek via email on Thursday: \"As the [Trump] administration increases immigration arrests, it will inevitably sweep in many people with no criminal record. There just aren't many noncitizens with criminal records, so the promise of mass deportations of criminals is an impossible one to keep.\"\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs at DHS, told Newsweek via email on Thursday: \"This data is being cherry picked by the Deportation Data Project to peddle a false narrative. Many of the individuals that are counted as 'non-criminals' are actually terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more; they just don't have a rap sheet in the U.S. Further, every single one of these individuals committed a crime when they came into this country illegally.\n\"It is not an accurate description to say they are 'non-criminals.' This deceptive categorization is devoid of reality and misleads the American public. Let us remind you that being here illegally is in fact a crime (8 USC 1325). We are putting the American people first by removing illegal aliens who pose a threat to our communities.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nLawmakers have sent oversight letters raising priority questions for enforcement, and legal groups filed suits challenging arrests at courthouses and expanded detention practices, indicating litigation and hearings were likely to follow.\nThe administration has sought expanded detention capacity and funding to sustain higher arrest rates, with federal budget allocations and proposals under discussion as the enforcement campaign continues.\nAbout the writer\nNick Mordowanec is a Newsweek investigative reporter based in Michigan.

      "text": "Over the past decade, organized crime gangs working out of Southeast Asia have scammed people out of billions of dollars. Operating giant scam compounds\u2014where experts estimate around 200,000 victims of human trafficking have been forced to run scams 24 hours a day\u2014the criminal enterprises have used an array of romance, cryptocurrency investment, and impersonation fraud to target thousands of people around the world. Now new research reveals that the already chilling scam compounds may have an even darker underbelly.\nNearly 500 reports linked to child sextortion made over a two-year period to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a US child safety organization, have been tied back to scam compounds operating in Southeast Asia, according to new research exclusively shared with WIRED by the anti-slavery organization International Justice Mission. Another 18,000 child exploitation reports made to NCMEC also contain IP addresses used by devices at known scam compound locations, the research says.\nAt least 40 of 44 previously identified scam compounds in Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos can be linked to the child sextortion reports, says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the IJM who focuses on combatting forced scamming and was part of the team behind the study. Heintz says it is the \u201cfirst clear evidence\u201d that the forced scamming operations are \u201clikely\u201d linked to global instances of child sextortion. \u201cIt was surprising how widespread it was,\u201d he says, adding that the wider data also indicated the locations of previously undiscovered scam compounds.\nThe findings directly linking scam compounds to the reports of sexual exploitation of children and young people come as sextortion cases have exploded in the past few years. Sextortion often involves criminals tricking someone into sharing sexually explicit images, which they then use to blackmail that person into making payments. While all cases of sextortion can be devastating, criminals have increasingly targeted children, and dozens of teenage boys have reportedly taken their own lives as a result. Many sextortion cases against children have been linked back to Nigerian Yahoo Boy scammers and other West African fraudsters.\nThe new IJM research, which was funded by child safety group Safe Online and the Thomson Reuters Social Impact Institute, reviewed data from more than 1.1 million \u201conline enticement\u201d incidents\u2014including 3.1 million IP addresses\u2014that tech companies reported to NCMEC between January 2022 and August 2024. Tech companies and electronic service providers in the US are required to report online child exploitation incidents to NCMEC\u2019s CyberTipline.\nThe data was cross-referenced with IP addresses known to be used at the location of 27 scam compounds in Cambodia, 16 in Myanmar, and one in Laos. In total, 18,017 of the child exploitation reports to NCMEC contained IP addresses used at the scam compounds. To establish a stronger link between the potential sextortion cases and the scam centers, the IJM researchers also obtained mobile phone advertising data from data brokers and compared it against the data from NCMEC. Taking all of their analysis together, the IJM concluded that at least 493 of the reports made to the NCMEC are \u201clikely\u201d directly connected to forced scamming locations.\n\u201cThere are limitations to what we can see with this data, but what we have so far is accurate,\u201d says Heintz. \u201cIf anything, I think it\u2019s undercounting the scale of the problem.\u201d\nThe data the researchers obtained is only a snapshot of some alleged sextortion activity linked to scam centers. For instance, advertising industry mobile data is incomplete, the NCMEC data does not contain all possible reported sextortion cases, and tech companies reporting data to NCMEC likely skew toward American firms.\nIn its report, the IJM points to multiple reports of scam centers being linked to wider sextortion against adults. The report does not rule out that children are being deliberately targeted with sextortion crimes but notes that children may also get caught in schemes targeted at adults if they are using parents\u2019 or other caregivers\u2019 devices. Now that this research has demonstrated a link, the researchers emphasize that further research is needed to strengthen authorities\u2019 understanding of the connection between child sextortion and scam compounds and determine whether children are being specifically targeted. NCMEC did not immediately respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment.\nOften run by Chinese organized crime groups, scam compounds have exploded across Southeast Asia since roughly 2019. Criminals have trafficked thousands of people from more than 70 countries into the compounds, where they are usually held captive, have their passports taken away, and are forced to scam people online. If they refuse, they can be beaten and brutalized. Initially targeting Chinese speakers, the scam centers have deployed so-called \u201cpig butchering\u201d scams, alongside various other forms of investment and romance scams. With vast flows of illicit cash, the criminals have increasingly opened scam compounds in the Middle East, West Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe; they have targeted scams against people across the world and altered the ways they scam people.\n\u201cScam centers and cyber-enabled fraud networks in Southeast Asia have rapidly diversified their business lines and scope of targeting, increasingly integrating sextortion as well as malware, deepfakes and pornography into their operations,\u201d says John Wojcik, a senior threat researcher focusing on Asia at the cybersecurity firm Infoblox. An October 2024 report into the growth of scam compounds from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which was partially authored by Wojcik, who worked at the organization at the time, pointed to the increase in sextortion cases against adults and the use of AI.\nWojcik says the IJM research is consistent with reports from law enforcement agencies within Southeast Asia that there has been a \u201csteady rise\u201d in financial sextortion cases against children.\nHieu Minh Ngo, a reformed criminal hacker and now cybercrime investigator at the Vietnamese nonprofit scam-fighting organization Chongluadao, says he has seen sextortion efforts targeting young people and adults in Vietnam in the past few years, and these \u201coperations trace back to scam compounds\u201d located along the Vietnam-Cambodia border. \u201cThe tactics are consistent: Bad actors pose as attractive individuals on social media, build trust with victims, then coerce them into sharing sensitive images or videos,\u201d Ngo says. The use of AI deepfakes is also increasing, he adds. \u201cThis trend shows clear links between regional scam compounds and organized sextortion targeting children and vulnerable populations.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely only a matter of time before they scale up operations in other parts of the world, as they have done in the past,\u201d Wojcik says.\nWhile some efforts have been made to shut down the operations of scam compounds\u2014including thousands of alleged arrests, internet and power shutdowns, and sweeping political declarations\u2014the scam compounds are still operational and appear to be continually expanding. Criminal organizations have flourished as a result of local corruption, weak enforcement of laws, and the ability to use Big Tech services to run scams, such as creating social media accounts that are used to trick people and using web hosting infrastructure to run scams.\nHeintz says that governments and tech companies need to do more to tackle the many crimes linked to the scam compounds\u2014including human trafficking, fraud, money laundering, and now, following the IJM\u2019s research, evidence that children are likely being harmed. \u201cEveryone is treating this just as a financial crime or a fraud crime, where the tools that everyone can use are limited to that type of crime,\u201d Heintz says. \u201cNow that you have internet crimes against children, then that should open the door for more tools that both tech companies and governments can use.\u201d"

      "text": "A United States Senate investigation has identified more than 500 credible reports of human rights abuses in US immigration detention since January, including alarming allegations of mistreatment of pregnant women and children.\nAs of late last month, the investigation\u2014led by US senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat of Georgia\u2014had unearthed 41 cases of physical and sexual abuse; 14 involving pregnant detainees and 18 involving children.\nThe accounts of abuse span facilities in 25 states and include Puerto Rico, US military bases, and charter deportation flights. Among the most harrowing: a pregnant woman reportedly bled for days before being taken to a hospital, only to miscarry alone without medical attention. Others described being forced to sleep on the floor or denied meals and medical exams. Attorneys reported that their clients\u2019 prenatal checkups were canceled for weeks at a time.\nChildren as young as 2 were also subjected to neglect. One US citizen child with severe medical needs was hospitalized multiple times while in Customs and Border Protection custody, where an officer allegedly dismissed her mother\u2019s pleas for help by telling her to \u201cjust give the girl a cracker.\u201d Another child recovering from brain surgery was reportedly denied follow-up care, and a 4-year-old undergoing cancer treatment was deported without access to doctors.\nThe Senate investigation found most abuse reports at detention centers in Texas, Georgia, and California, spanning both facilities run by the Department of Homeland Security and federal prisons used under Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agreements. The findings are based on dozens of witness interviews, Ossoff\u2019s office says, including detainees, family members, attorneys, correctional staff, law enforcement, doctors and nurses, as well as site inspections of detention centers in Texas and Georgia.\nThe report also cites corroborating news investigations and public records, drawing on sources such as WIRED, Miami Herald, NBC News, CNN, BBC, and regional outlets like Louisiana Illuminator and VT Digger.\nTogether, these sources formed the foundation of what the report describes as an \u201cactive and ongoing investigation\u201d into systemic mistreatment of pregnant women and children in US custody.\n| Got a Tip? |\n|---|\n| Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about the US immigration system? We\u2019d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dell.3030. |\nICE did not respond to WIRED\u2019s request for comment.\nA WIRED investigation published in late June focused on 911 calls from 10 of the nation\u2019s largest ICE detention centers, and it revealed a pattern of medical crises ranging from pregnancy complications and suicide attempts to seizures, head injuries, and allegations of sexual assault. (WIRED shared its findings with Ossoff\u2019s office upon request last month.)\nSources told WIRED that detention staff frequently failed to respond to urgent calls for help, including multiple cases in which pregnant women suffered serious complications or miscarriages without timely medical attention.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s detention system is undergoing rapid expansion, with plans to more than double capacity to over 107,000 beds nationwide. New facilities are rising in West Texas, where a $232 million contract has funded a tent-style camp at Fort Bliss capable of holding up to 5,000 people; and in Indiana, where ICE struck a deal to house 1,000 detainees in the state prison system.\nFlorida\u2019s so-called \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d caged encampment has already drawn lawsuits over alleged human rights abuses and environmental damage, while critics warn that relying on military bases and remote rural prisons to absorb the surge strips detainees of due process and shields conditions from public scrutiny.\nCivil rights groups and local advocates argue that the expansion cements a system already plagued by neglect, pointing to reports of miscarriages, untreated illness, and violence inside.\nWith contracts flowing to private prison companies and military facilities alike, the US is locking in the largest immigration detention network in the country\u2019s history\u2014an infrastructure that critics say is designed not only to hold migrants but to make their suffering invisible."

      "text": "As legal cannabis has expanded around the United States for both recreational and medical use, companies have amassed troves of data about customers and their transactions. People who have applied for medical marijuana cards have had to share particularly personal health data to qualify. For some patients in Ohio who use medical weed, a recent data exposure could impact their sensitive information.\nSecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler found a publicly accessible database in mid-July that appeared to contain medical records, mental health evaluations, physician reports, and images of IDs like driver's licenses for people seeking medical cannabis cards. The 323-GB trove stored close to a million records, including Social Security numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, dates of birth, and medical data\u2014all organized by name.\nBased on information that seemed to describe specific employees and business partners, Fowler suspected that the data belonged to the Ohio-based company Ohio Medical Alliance LLC, which goes by the name Ohio Marijuana Card. Fowler contacted the company on July 14; when he checked the database the next day, it had been secured and was no longer publicly accessible online. Fowler did not receive a response about his submission.\nOhio Medical Alliance did not answer WIRED's questions about Fowler's findings. At one point, though, the company's president, Cassandra Brooks, wrote in an email: \u201cI need time to investigate this alleged incident. We take data security very seriously and are looking into this matter.\u201d\n\u201cThere were physicians' reports that would say what the underlying problem was\u2014whether it was anxiety, cancer, HIV, or something else. In some cases, the applicants would submit their own medical records as proof\u201d of their qualifying condition, Fowler tells WIRED. \u201cI saw identification documents from lots of states, from everywhere. And I even saw offender release cards, which are basically IDs for people who just got out of prison that they submitted as proof of identity to get a medical marijuana card.\u201d\nFowler says that most of the files in the database were image formats like PDFs, JPGs, and PNGs. One CSV plaintext document called \u201cstaff comments\u201d appeared to be an export of internal communications, appointment histories, notes about clients, and application status. That file also contained more then 200,000 email addresses of Ohio Medical Alliance employees, business associates, and customers.\nDatabases that are misconfigured and have inadvertently been left publicly exposed on the open internet are a common problem online in spite of efforts to raise awareness about the mistake and its privacy implications."
