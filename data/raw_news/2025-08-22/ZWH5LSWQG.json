  "content": "One of my siblings has a Pixel phone , and they told me they wanted to have integrated products like Apple does. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 offers just that. In addition to having seamless compatibility with Pixel phones, they have quality active noise cancellation features and a long battery life. Over at Newegg, you can now grab the Pixel Buds Pro 2 at a 24% discount, bringing the price down from $299.00 to $225.99. Don't miss out on this deal!\n\nThese earbuds weigh in at around 4.7 grams, making them super light and easy on the ears. They also have a unique twist-to-adjust stabilizer that locks them in to your ears during workouts for a more secure fit, and you can twist them the other way around for more comfort. Either way, they're designed to feel snug in your ears so you can have an immersive experience.\n\nThe battery life lasts up to 8 hours of listening time, ensuring that you won't be interrupted. The charging case stands out as well. Not only does it support wireless charging, but it's also water-resistant like the earbuds themselves, leaving you a peace of mind that they won't be worn down by the elements.\n\nContributor Christian de Looper awarded the earbuds an \"Excellent\" rating. In our Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review , he said, \"The Pixel Buds Pro 2 offer strong sound quality and solid noise cancellation in a comfortable design, along with Google Gemini support and seamless integration with Pixel phones.\" With this statement and this deal, you'll definitely want to act fast.\n\nBe sure to also check out our other and .\n\nMore Earbud deals on\n\nMore Earbud deals on\n\nMore Earbud deals on",
