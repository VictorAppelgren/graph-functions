      "feedback": "This draft has solid cross‑asset intuition (Jackson Hole, Fed signals, and AI/tech tilt in GX057ADL7 and 37UZC9X8I), but to reach world‑class, you need a tight, multi‑year regime map with explicit first‑principles anchors, a clean causal chain to pricing, and replace broad language with precise numbers from the sources. Actionable edits: 1) Add a three‑regime framework (Base/Policy‑Accommodative, Hawkish/Inflation‑sticky, Geopolitical/Regulatory Shock) with explicit transition triggers drawn from the sources: e.g., 50bp easing talk vs 25bp priced in (GX057ADL7); Jackson Hole rhetoric (hawkish vs dovish) and payroll/CPI signals (37UZC9X8I); USChip acts and export controls/Chips Act dynamics (H7Q52FKDH); Tencent/Beijing credit impulse (GX057ADL7). 2) Ground the analysis in first‑principles: tie policy path to real rate differentials and expected growth via the Fed’s dual mandate (employment and inflation), then translate into equity risk premia and dollar trajectory; explicitly state the invariant causal chain: policy stance → yields/dollar → asset pricing (tech/equities) and cross‑border capital flows. 3) Build a true multi‑year scenario structure with clear bases, catalysts, and invalidation points; for each scenario specify base case numbers (e.g., 10‑year yield around 4.20–4.25%, 25bp vs 50bp Sept cut, dollar direction), upside/downside catalysts (e.g., stronger inflation surprise, Jackson Hole hawkish tone, or a big China tech monetization beat), and the invalidation trigger (e.g., three consecutive CPI reports above target or a decisive, sustained policy pivot). 4) Quantify where possible: commit to exact figures from the sources—e.g., the market pricing around a Sept move (25bp vs 50bp), 10‑year yield near 4.23%, Tencent fastest growth in four years, PBOC credit contraction, and the Yur‑level context around AMD/NVIDIA export controls (H7Q52FKDH; GX057ADL7). 5) Reconcile conflicts explicitly: if Bessent’s 50bp push clashes with 25bp priced in, state the base‑case as the mid‑point (e.g., 25bp) unless the data shifts; explain how a larger cut would alter the regime map and the base case. 6) Expand coverage of critical signals from all cited sources (GX057ADL7, 37UZC9X8I, H7Q52FKDH) and reconcile any inconsistent narratives (e.g., “don’t buy the dips” caution vs. tech‑cycle upside). 7) Concretize “what to watch” and “confidence” with a short list of indicators and a calibrated confidence band (e.g., high confidence in an eventual softer dollar and AI/tech upside under a gradual easing regime, but only if inflation and Jackson Hole guidance stay consistent). 8) Keep the form a single compact paragraph but weave in these three sources’ numbers and signals so the causal chain is explicit, the horizon is multi‑year, and the base case is firmly anchored.
