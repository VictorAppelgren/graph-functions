  "title": "Passenger Assaulted in Viral TikTok Video Sues Southwest Airlines, Blames Seating Plan",
  "description": "Southwest is transitioning to assigned seats in January 2026.",
  "content": "Video footage went viral on social media earlier this summer after an intoxicated woman was seen on a Southwest Airlines flight pulling another woman\u2019s hair and shouting abusive things before being subdued and arrested. Now the woman who was attacked has filed a lawsuit against her attacker and named Southwest as a co-defendant, partially blaming the airline\u2019s open seating policy for the confrontation.\n\nLeanna Perry, identified as a 32-year-old illustrator from Brooklyn by the New York Post, was filmed attacking Kansas resident Livia Rombola during a perplexing outburst on a June flight from New York to Kansas City. Perry appears to slap Rombola and could be heard saying she didn\u2019t want to sit next to a \u201cfucking fat lady\u201d and a \u201cfat-ass bitch.\u201d Perry grabs her hair and won\u2019t let go, as other passengers try to intervene and de-escalate the situation.\n\nAs passengers tell Perry to let go of Rombola\u2019s hair, she smiles and denies doing what she\u2019s clearly doing in the video. As Perry is being restrained, she spat on Rombola multiple times. Someone wearing a Southwest Airlines shirt holds Perry\u2019s head down across the back of a seat in an attempt to get her to stop spitting, but she just keeps saying \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d repeatedly.\n\nThe TikTok video of the incident that got the most attention has been deleted from the social platform. But copies still exist elsewhere on the internet, like the subreddit for Kansas City.\n\nAnother video that was originally posted to TikTok, but is now on Reddit, shows Perry being rolled out on a gurney off the plane while police and paramedics escort the woman.\n\nThe complaint, obtained by The Independent and available online, details how Rombola has sustained \u201cserious, severe and painful personal injuries, some of which are permanent and lasting in their nature.\u201d The lawsuit says that Perry was intoxicated and that she displayed an \u201cearly red flag\u201d to staff of the airline by rejecting an open seat near a different person on the flight.\n\nSouthwest has always had an open seating arrangement, but the lawsuit contends the policy \u201cwas a clear departure from the industry standards of other airlines within the same industry.\u201d Southwest announced in the summer of 2024 that passengers would get assigned seating in 2025, but the date of implementation is actually scheduled for January 2026.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that \u201clack of proactive seat assignment directly contributed to the confrontation\u201d and \u201cseating policy serves the company\u2019s financial and logistical interests, while exposing passengers to the unnecessary issue of conflict arising from the act of self seat selection.\u201d\n\nThe suit also explains that Rombola has suffered due to the amount of attention from the altercation online, including in online videos, headlines, and commentary following the assault. Rombola says she\u2019s experienced \u201creputation harm, professional embarrassment, and social stigma\u201d from the exposure.\n\nThe FAA has received over 1,000 reports of unruly passengers in the U.S. so far this year, according to the agency\u2019s website. That may seem high, but it\u2019s actually down considerably since 2021 during the worst of the covid-19 pandemic, when there were 5,973 reports of unruly passengers.\n\nSouthwest didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions emailed on Wednesday. An email address associated with Perry and an attorney for Rombola also didn\u2019t immediately reply. Gizmodo will update this article if we hear back.",

      "text": "Passenger attacked in viral hair-pulling incident sues Southwest, blaming the airline\u2019s \u2018free-for-all\u2019 seating policy\nExclusive: Livia Rombola\u2019s attorney told The Independent that Southwest Airlines\u2019 lack of assigned seating \u2018was a substantial factor\u2019 in causing the wild melee\nAn \u201cintoxicated\u201d Brooklyn artist arrested on charges she assaulted a fellow passenger aboard a Southwest Airlines plane, pulling the astonished victim\u2019s hair before spitting in her face, is now facing further legal woes stemming from the ugly altercation.\nIn a lawsuit filed Monday in New York State Supreme Court and obtained first by The Independent, Kansas resident Livia Rombola says Leanna Perry not only injured her physically in the wild incident, but left her emotionally distressed and psychologically traumatized after bystander video of the brawl went viral.\nThe footage shows Perry, 32, yelling that she doesn\u2019t want to sit next to \u201ca f**king fat lady,\u201d denigrating Rombola as a \u201cfat-ass b***h,\u201d and an \u201cugly-ass b***h.\u201d The horrifying situation only ended when Perry was zip-tied, placed on a gurney, and hauled off the aircraft by police.\nIn the aftermath, \u201crepeated exposure\u201d to the footage, along with myriad news articles and online commentary, have caused Rombola acute distress, along with \u201creputational harm, professional embarrassment, and social stigma,\u201d according to her complaint.\nThe lawsuit also names the low-cost airline as a defendant, blaming its policy of unassigned seating for encouraging the chaos. On Tuesday, Rombola\u2019s attorney, Joel J. Turney, told The Independent, \u201cThe plaintiff has a strong case against Southwest, especially with respect to their unusual free-for-all seating policy, which was a substantial factor in the cause of the incident.\u201d\nPerry did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Southwest spokeswoman declined to comment.\nRombola\u2019s complaint argues that open-seating was \u201ca clear departure from the industry standards of other airlines,\u201d and that the system \u201ccreated a foreseeable hazard of passenger conflict.\u201d\nSouthwest\u2019s \u201clack of proactive seat assignment directly contributed to the confrontation,\u201d according to the complaint, saying it benefits only the airline but \u201cexpos[es] passengers\u201d to potential issues such as the one between Perry and Rombola.\nAlthough the open-seating approach was popular with some, the stress of jockeying for a spot was too much for many and has led to brawls between travelers. Last month, Southwest announced it would be phasing out the policy in January 2026, saying 80 percent of its customers preferred an assigned seat.\nIn a statement at the time, a Southwest Airlines spokesperson told the New York Post, \u201cThe customer involved in the incident was removed from the flight and denied boarding. We commend our team for their professionalism during the incident.\u201d\nSo far in 2025, federal authorities have fielded 1,058 reports of unruly passengers aboard commercial aircraft.\nThe attack onboard the Southwest flight occurred on June 17, shortly after 1 a.m., according to Rombola\u2019s complaint. During boarding, the complaint says an \u201cerratic\u201d Perry \u201cinitially caused a disruption by rejecting an available seat near a different individual.\u201d\nPerry then \u201cproceeded through the cabin and ultimately chose to sit near [Rombola], where she\u2026 initiated a violent and unprovoked confrontation, involving physical assault, battery, spitting, and the use of slurs.\u201d\nIn video of the incident posted online, Perry can be seen standing by Rombola and sneering, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to sit next to a f*****g fat lady.\u201d\nPerry, an illustrator who has done work for top brands including Adidas, Hot Topic, and Maybelline, appeared to be \u201cpossessed\u201d during the epic meltdown, witnesses said.\nPerry was drunk, and never should have been permitted to get on flight number 779 from LaGuardia Airport in Queens to Kansas City, Missouri, according to the complaint.\nFAA regulations prohibit commercial carriers from allowing intoxicated passengers onboard.\nThe confrontation soon spiraled out of control, with Perry yelling, \u201cShut the f**k up, don\u2019t f**king touch me!\u201d while concerned crew members and bystanders tried to intervene.\n\u201cLet go of her hair!\u201d one crew member instructs Perry, who ignores the command.\nPerry continued her harangue, shrieking, \u201cLook at this fat-ass b****h, you can\u2019t even see her stomach,\u201d as Rombola sits by quietly.\n\u201cYour boyfriend\u2019s d**k is like, two inches big,\u201d Perry shouts at Rombola. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. I\u2019m so sorry about your boyfriend.\u201d\nThis went on for several minutes, the video shows, with Perry calling Rombola an \u201cugly-ass b***h,\u201d until members of the cabin crew, along with a couple of helpful passengers, managed to zip-tie Perry\u2019s hands behind her back. Perry is then brought down to the floor, after which she begins kicking her legs in the air and screaming, \u201cF**k you, f**k you, f**k you!\u201d\nWhen police arrived, they strapped Perry down and wheeled her off the plane, after which she was charged with numerous misdemeanors that each carry up to a year in jail: obstructing governmental administration; three counts of attempted assault with intent to cause physical injury; disorderly conduct; and three counts of harassment.\nAppearing before a judge later that morning for arraignment, Perry pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nPerry\u2019s lawyer in the criminal case, Legal Aid attorney Carl Tropnas, did not respond on Tuesday to a request for comment.\nRombola is seeking an award of damages to be determined in court. Perry, who now has roughly three weeks to respond to Rombola\u2019s lawsuit, is due back in Queens Criminal Court on September 3."

  "argos_summary": "A viral video shows intoxicated Brooklyn artist Leanna Perry pulling hair and spitting on fellow passenger Livia Rombola aboard a Southwest flight, leading to Perry\u2019s arrest and a lawsuit filed by Rombola that names Southwest as a co\u2011defendant. Rombola alleges she suffered serious physical injuries and emotional distress from the incident and the online exposure, and claims the airline\u2019s open\u2011seating policy contributed to the confrontation. The lawsuit accuses Southwest of prioritizing cost savings over passenger safety, noting the airline plans to shift to assigned seating in 2026. Southwest has not yet responded, while Perry faces multiple misdemeanor charges and a pending court appearance. The case highlights rising concerns over unruly passengers and airline seating policies in the U.S. aviation industry.",
