  "content": "The fallout from Elon Musk's relatively brief yet controversial foray into politics continues.\n\nA federal judge in Texas has rejected Musk's attempt to have the court toss out a proposed class action suit brought by an Arizona resident over Musk's pledge to randomly award $1 million per day to people who signed a petition in key battleground states, Newsweek reported.\n\nJacqueline McAferty, the lead plaintiff, has alleged that Musk and his America PAC induced people to sign the petition, which required that individuals hand over valuable personal data, by promising that the daily giveaway would be awarded randomly.\n\nInstead, Musk's own lawyers admitted to a court in November that the so-called \"winners\" were not selected at random but were, in fact, individually selected paid spokespeople.\n\n\"The $1 million recipients are not chosen by chance,\" Chris Gober, a longtime lawyer for the GOP, told a Pennsylvania court in November, Newsweek reported at the time. \"We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million recipient today and tomorrow.\"\n\nThe admission came as Musk and his political action committee defended themselves against accusations of running an illegal lottery under Pennsylvania law.\n\nThose same admissions could now work against Musk, as he seeks to defend himself and his PAC against accusations that their explicit promises of a random lottery amounted to fraud.\n\n\"It is plausible that plaintiff justifiably relied on those statements to believe that defendants were objectively offering her the chance to enter a random lottery \u2013 even if that is not what they subjectively intended to do,\" wrote Robert Pitman, an Austin-based U.S. District Court judge, according to Reuters.\n\nExperts have said that it is flatly illegal to promise the public a random lottery when the reality is that the selections are anything but random.\n\n\"You cannot lawfully lie to the public about conducting a random sweepstakes, lottery, or contest and then rig the results to hand-select the winners,\" Christopher Peterson, a University of Utah law professor, told NBC News in November.\n\n\"It really is not complicated,\" he continued. \"This is just fraud; a simple, ugly fraud on the public.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was just the latest controversy for the embattled Tesla CEO.\n\nIn August, a jury ordered Tesla to pay $240 million in damages after finding that the company's Autopilot self-driving feature was responsible for a fatal 2019 crash.\n\nAdditionally, investors have formally asked Nasdaq to investigate the propriety of a recent $29 billion pay package that the Tesla board of directors awarded to Musk.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

      "text": "A lawyer for Elon Musk said in a Philadelphia courtroom Monday that the winners of Musk\u2019s $1 million daily prize giveaway in election swing states are not chosen at random, contradicting what Musk said when he announced the contest last month.\nLegal experts told NBC News that the disclosure could have legal fallout for Musk across multiple jurisdictions under laws designed to protect consumers from deceptive practices.\n\u201cThis is absolutely, unambiguously illegal,\u201d Christopher Peterson, a University of Utah law professor who specializes in consumer protection, said in an email.\n\u201cYou cannot lawfully lie to the public about conducting a random sweepstakes, lottery, or contest and then rig the results to hand-select the winners,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is not complicated. This is just fraud; a simple, ugly fraud on the public.\u201d\nHe said Musk and his super PAC\u2019s behavior could be \u201cboth a civil wrong and a crime.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s America PAC declined to comment on that analysis or the views of other legal experts. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nChris Gober, a lawyer for America PAC, made the disclosure at a hearing about the giveaways. He said that the winners are not chosen by random, as in a lottery drawing, but that the super PAC instead selects the winners based on who it believes would be effective political spokespeople.\nThe disclosure flew in the face of what Musk said onstage at a Pennsylvania rally on Oct. 19, when he revealed the contest to draw attention to a petition supporting free speech and gun rights.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be awarding $1 million randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election,\u201d Musk said, followed by wild applause from the audience.\nThe disclosure that Musk\u2019s statement was not true was met with backlash on Musk\u2019s social media app, X, where some users said Monday that he had deceived petition-signers or even defrauded them. To sign the petition, people are required to give their names, email addresses, cellphone numbers and mailing addresses, and they must be registered to vote in one of seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.\nAmerica PAC\u2019s daily $1 million giveaway has been a key feature of Musk\u2019s efforts on behalf of former President Donald Trump. Musk has spent more than $118 million to try to re-elect Trump, and he has appeared in Pennsylvania numerous times to campaign in person. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner sued Musk and America PAC over the offer, calling it an unlawful lottery under Pennsylvania law and leading to Monday\u2019s court hearing.\nJohn Summers, a lawyer for Krasner, called Gober\u2019s disclosure \u201ca flat-out admission of liability\u201d at the hearing.\nWhile Gober said he believed the non-random nature of the offer means it is not a lottery, legal experts said the statement could open up Musk and the super PAC to additional claims of liability under federal consumer protection law or in the seven battleground states where people have been winning prizes.\nRebecca Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School who specializes in the First Amendment and false advertising, said she considered Gober\u2019s disclosure to be an admission of liability.\n\u201cThey falsely advertised that people who never had a chance to win should participate, and participation meant providing the PAC with valuable information about voters to target,\u201d she said in an email.\n\u201cDeceptive trade practices laws may be triggered by claiming \u2018random\u2019 selection and then not delivering, but states may differ about exactly what conduct is covered \u2014 many limit prohibitions to conduct that relates to selling goods or services,\u201d she said.\nWhether such laws apply in the circumstances around America PAC would be determined in court only if someone decides to sue. Tushnet said that she expects plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers could explore class action lawsuits over consumer protection and that state attorneys general may be interested in pursuing enforcement actions, too.\nGeorge Conway, a prominent lawyer and former Republican who is a vocal critic of Trump, agreed that state attorneys general could see the disclosure as a consumer protection issue.\nTypically under state law, \u201cthis is actually bread and butter stuff for them,\u201d he said in a direct message. \u201cThere are church raffle exemptions and such but if you are giving out a million dollars you\u2019ve got to comply with some specific requirements.\u201d\nA representative for the Pennsylvania attorney general declined to comment. Representatives for attorneys general in several other states did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA spokesperson for the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees consumer protection on the federal level, declined to comment.\nNot all legal experts agree that action would be warranted on behalf of petition-signers.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine any AG or the FTC getting into the middle of this very minor dust up,\u201d said David Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor, in an email. He said that even if Musk\u2019s offer of a random chance at $1 million was deceptive, \u201cit was isolated (only a few days) and unlikely to be repeated.\u201d\nBut Vladeck added that there is the separate question of whether the offer violated federal election law, which bars paying people to vote or register to vote.\n\u201cSome of the criminal authorities might be concerned that there was a quid pro quo in that Musk was providing cash for people to vote for his candidate, albeit dressed up with some kind of lottery,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is going to be an enforcement action against Musk, it will be by the criminal authorities, not the FTC or State AGs.\u201d\nLorrin Freeman, the district attorney of Wake County, North Carolina\u2019s largest county, said in an email: \u201cOur office has not received any information that would give rise at this time to an investigation of Mr. Musk for conduct within the state of North Carolina that violates state law.\u201d\nJeff Sovern, a professor of consumer protection law at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, said Musk\u2019s offer \u201csounds like a fairly clear violation\u201d of the 1914 federal law that bans deceptive trade practices. He said that, under that law, conduct is deceptive if it misleads consumers who are acting reasonably under the circumstances and if there\u2019s a false statement that\u2019s material, or that matters to consumers.\nHe said a non-random contest marketed as random appears to fit both requirements.\n\u201cThe claim that this is random is likely to cause consumers acting reasonably to believe it is random,\u201d he said in an email. He added, \u201cIt seems likely that a chance to win a million dollars would matter to many consumers.\u201d\nBut he said that doesn\u2019t mean the FTC would bring a case. He said that Congress hasn\u2019t given the FTC the budget to bring every case it could and that if it did bring a case, the result might simply be an order for America PAC to stop the offer \u2014 which is scheduled to end Tuesday, anyway.\n\u201cSometimes the FTC can get a financial penalty \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether that would be the case here \u2014 but I suspect that wouldn\u2019t matter much to the world\u2019s richest man,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOn the other hand, the FTC has become the federal government\u2019s foremost protector of privacy and the privacy implications of this might increase their interest in the matter,\u201d he added.\nThe Justice Department, which had warned Musk\u2019s super PAC that its offer may run afoul of federal election law, did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nLawyers for Elon Musk's political action committee (PAC) told a judge this week that the winners of his $1 million-a-day voting sweepstakes aren't chosen by chance.\nOn Monday, lawyers for America PAC, Musk's political organization, told a judge in Philadelphia that participants labeled as \"winners\" in Musk's $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes in key swing states are not randomly selected; rather, they are chosen to serve as paid \"spokespeople\" for the organization.\nWhat the PAC Argues\nRepublican attorney Chris Gober stated that Monday's and Tuesday's recipients would be selected from Arizona and Michigan, respectively, and thus would not impact the Pennsylvania election. He explained that recipients are chosen for their personal stories and sign contracts with America PAC.\n\"The $1 million recipients are not chosen by chance,\" Gober said on Monday. \"We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million recipient today and tomorrow.\"\nMusk was absent from Monday's hearing, held just a day before the presidential election. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner took the stand, denouncing the sweepstakes as a scam and urging the judge to put a stop to it.\nThe Sweepstakes\nAmerica PAC aims to boost Donald Trump's presidential campaign through the lottery initiative, according to its organizers. Krasner noted that 18 prizes have been awarded so far.\nAttorneys representing Musk and America PAC assured the judge that they have no plans to continue the lottery beyond Tuesday.\nKrasner argued that the sweepstakes constitutes an illegal lottery under Pennsylvania law, pointing out the lack of published rules or privacy policies for voter data collected by the PAC. Participants are required to sign an oath to the U.S. Constitution when registering.\nWhat the State Argues\nDuring his testimony on Monday, Krasner said, \"They were scammed for their information...It has almost unlimited use.\"\nJohn Summers, representing Krasner, described Musk as \"the heartbeat of America PAC,\" noting that he personally announces the winners and presents the checks.\n\"He was the one who presented the checks, albeit large cardboard checks. We don't really know if there are any real checks,\" Summers said on Monday.\nKrasner indicated that criminal charges remain on the table, emphasizing his responsibility to safeguard both lottery regulations and election integrity. In the lawsuit, he asserted that the defendants are \"indisputably violating\" Pennsylvania's lottery laws.\nKrasner's lawsuit also asserts that Musk and America PAC are \"indisputably violating Pennsylvania's statutory bans on illegal lotteries and misleading consumers.\"\nWith its 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania remains a critical battleground, drawing repeated visits from both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential nominee. Both candidates, aiming to sway last-minute voters, have scheduled stops in the state for Monday as the race draws to a close.\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press.\nAbout the writer\nMatthew Impelli is a Newsweek staff writer based in New York.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nA federal judge has ordered Elon Musk to face a proposed class-action lawsuit from voters who say they were misled into signing a petition in the buildup to the 2024 election by promises of a chance to win $1 million in a daily giveaway.\nThe lawsuit, brought in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, invokes the Class Action Fairness Act and alleges that the total value of all class members' claims exceeds $5 million. It seeks damages and injunctive relief on behalf of petition signers who say they were wrongly induced to provide personal identifying information when signing the petition.\nNewsweek contacted lawyers for Musk and America PAC for comment via email on Thursday outside regular office hours.\nWhy It Matters\nThe case centers on whether Musk's America PAC promotion\u2014announced in the run-up to the election to support Donald Trump's 2024 campaign in seven battleground states\u2014was a genuine, random lottery or whether signers suffered harm when they supplied contact details later used for political targeting.\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has faced several legal challenges over America PAC and the $1 million petition giveaway. In October, the Department of Justice warned Musk that the promotion might violate federal election laws. If the lawsuit succeeds, Musk could face millions in damages, and the case could spur similar suits in other states where voters signed the petition.\nWhat To Know\nThe complaint names Arizona resident Jacqueline McAferty as lead plaintiff and alleges that America PAC and Musk induced voters in seven battleground states\u2014Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina\u2014to sign a petition supporting free speech and Second Amendment positions by promising $1 million daily prizes chosen \"randomly\" until Election Day.\nThe suit said petition signers were required to provide names, addresses, emails and phone numbers and that the defendants benefited by driving traffic to X, Musk's social platform, and by collecting valuable political contact data. It also alleges that the lottery was not random, giving voters no real chance to collect.\nIn November, Musk's lawyers told a Pennsylvania judge that winners were not chosen at random but were selected in advance\u2014contradicting Musk's own statements when he launched the contest.\nU.S. District Judge Robert Pitman ruled that McAferty plausibly alleged that she had been misled and that an expert could testify about the commercial value of battleground voters' contact information.\nWhat People Are Saying\nU.S. District Judge Robert Pitman told Reuters on Wednesday: \"It is plausible that plaintiff justifiably relied on those statements to believe that defendants were objectively offering her the chance to enter a random lottery\u2014even if that is not what they subjectively intended to do.\"\nJarrett L. Ellzey of EKSM LLP told Newsweek: \"We are pleased with the Court's ruling and agree with Judge Pitman's careful reasoning. This decision affirms that our client and the proposed class have viable claims and deserve the opportunity to pursue justice.\"\nElon Musk said at a Trump campaign event in Pennsylvania on October 19: \"We are going to be awarding $1 million randomly to people who have signed the petition, every day, from now until the election.\"\nChristopher Peterson, a University of Utah law professor, told NBC News on November 5, 2024: \"You cannot lawfully lie to the public about conducting a random sweepstakes, lottery, or contest and then rig the results to hand-select the winners. It really is not complicated. This is just fraud; a simple, ugly fraud on the public.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nThe case, McAferty v. Musk et al., remains before the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Pitman has denied dismissal, allowing discovery and further proceedings to go forward.\nAbout the writer\nRobert Charles Alexander is the Senior Crime and Court Reporter for Newsweek based in London.
