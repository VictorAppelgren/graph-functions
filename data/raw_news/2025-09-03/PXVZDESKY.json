  "content": "Blizzard says it's considering bringing back old Diablo 4 seasonal powers as permanent fixtures.\n\nDiablo 4 introduced unique powers and abilities exclusive to new seasons way back in Season 1 with its Malignant Heart powers, but with each passing season, seasonal powers disappear entirely. That could be about to change.\n\nIn a new entry in Diablo 4's Burning Questions video series (queued up just below), class designer Charles Dunn acknowledged the fact that players miss some seasonal powers that aren't in the game anymore and said the team is considering bringing some of them back.\n\n\"The most limited part are the seasonal powers. Those really are only applicable for that season. And on one hand, we really like that, because it allows us to be very experimental. We can try a bit more wacky and crazy things.\n\n\"But we are definitely aware that a lot of players really resonate with some of these mechanics, some of these powers, in particular. So we're gonna look to find ways to re-incorporate those old powers and old effects into future systems as well.\"\n\nAs a goth Necro main, I severely miss the Vampiric powers added in Season 2, Season of the Blood, especially the one that turns you into a cloud of bats when you Evade. As Blizzard is wont to do, the developer has not yet shared any official details on how it'll go about bringing back past seasonal powers, but I'm all for Diablo 4's base game being padded out with some fun new powers to tinker with.\n\nFinal Fantasy 14's Yoshi-P is \"a maniac about One Piece,\" but his dream collab is still the RPG he's spent 1000s of hours in: \"I love Diablo so much that I would want to make a Diablo game myself\"",

      "text": "Diablo 4 guide to help you loot and slaughter through dungeons\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about in Diablo 4, from builds, to salvaging gear, to quest help\n- Review\n- Release date and platforms\n- Tips\n- How long is it?\n- Classes and builds\n- XP, difficulty, and endgame\n- Aspects and gems\n- Sanctuary map\n- Fast travel and mounts\n- Healing potions\n- Gear, repairs, and customization\n- Quests and collectibles\n- Resources and currencies\n- Bosses\n- Multiplayer and PvP\n- Error codes\n- Battle Pass\n- How to get pre-order items\nThis Diablo 4 guide has loads of tips and tricks on all things Diablo, from the basics, such as salvaging gear and fast travel, to thorough class build guides and PvP. With so many overlapping mechanics and systems, seemingly infinite build possibilities, and lots of numbers, Diablo 4 is pretty complicated and can be a bit overwhelming at times. However, our Diablo 4 guides are here to help you make sense of it all as you battle your way across Sanctuary whether you\u2019re a veteran demon hunter or a novice.\nDiablo 4 review\nIn the GamesRadar+ Diablo 4 review, we gave it five stars and said that \"Diablo 4 is a diabolical assault on the senses\" \u2013 praising the sharp refinements to combat, gear, and loot systems, and the expressive open world that Blizzard has engineered with smart MMO sensibilities.\nDiablo 4 release date, platforms, and Game Pass\nDiablo 4 is playable now for early access players that pre-ordered the game, but the full release is on June 6. Make sure you keep up with the Diablo 4 launch times to find out when exactly you can play. If you're having trouble trying to find your Diablo 4 pre-order bonuses, we can help point you in the right direction.\nYou can play Diablo 4 on PC, Xbox Series X, PS5, Xbox One, and PS4. It's worth pointing out that Blizzard has said that there are \"no plans\" for a Diablo 4 Game Pass release. With the Xbox Activision Blizzard deal still ongoing, it's unlikely that this will change anytime soon. If the acquisition ever closes, there's a good chance that Diablo 4 will quickly make it onto the Xbox Game Pass list.\nDiablo 4 tips\nWe\u2019ve laid out 11 Diablo 4 tips to help you get started with the game. If you\u2019re new to Diablo, you\u2019ll definitely want to start here to make sure you\u2019re making the most out of your gear and know how to efficiently play through the game. However, even seasoned players will benefit as some of the tips will help you learn how to get some of the most useful items, such as healing potions.\nHow long is Diablo 4?\nDiablo 4 has a pretty long, 20+-hour main story that isn\u2019t easy to power through, and it can take an incredibly long time to complete the game if you get side-tracked with perfecting your build, gathering loot, taking on dungeons, and completing sidequests. If you\u2019re wondering \u201chow long does it take to beat Diablo 4?\u201d we can give you a rough idea with our guide.\nDiablo 4 character classes and build guides\nThere are five classes to choose from in Diablo 4, all of which are quite different from each other. They also all feature a vast array of Skills which allows for plenty of variation even within the same class! Make sure you check out the class guides below to get a feel for each one and learn about some useful builds.\n- Diablo 4 Barbarian builds\n- Diablo 4 Druid builds\n- Diablo 4 Necromancer builds\n- Diablo 4 Rogue builds\n- Diablo 4 Sorcerer builds\nIf you don\u2019t like the Skills you\u2019ve chosen, learn how to respec in Diablo 4 and you can reallocate your Skill Points. You\u2019ll also want to know about how to swap Diablo 4 weapons, particularly if you\u2019re a Barbarian player \u2013 you can obviously swap your weapons out freely when you find improvements, but actually swapping the weapons in your hands isn\u2019t something you can do. Finally if you\u2019re trying out the Necromancer class with all its minions, you should learn how to summon the Diablo 4 golem too.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nDiablo 4 XP, difficulty, and endgame\nTo get access to the Skills for your class, you\u2019ll need to earn a lot of XP, so here\u2019s how you can level up fast in Diablo 4. One of the best ways to help you level up a bit faster is to change to one of the higher Diablo 4 World Tiers since they offer better XP rewards.\nAll this will help you along the way to the Diablo 4 max level of 50, but beyond that you\u2019ve got to switch over to the Paragon system. Beyond Level 50, you\u2019ll start earning Paragon Points instead of Skill Points to that can be spent on the Diablo 4 Paragon Board to unlock even more enhancements for your Skills. Get far enough through the board and you\u2019ll need to content with Diablo 4 Glyphs too. Endgame levelling can be quite confusing so make sure you read through those guides to get acquainted with the Paragon system.\nAspects and gems for your gear\nAs you level up and start getting a feel for you desired build, you\u2019ll want to bolster your power with Diablo 4 Aspects. These powerful perks can be applied to Legendary gear to add great passive bonuses or enhance existing Skills you\u2019ve unlocked. Learn all about them in this guide and check out the class build guides above where we\u2019ve also included lists of useful Aspects for each class.\nAs if Skills, and Aspects weren\u2019t enough, you can apply Diablo 4 Gems to your armor, weapons, and jewelry to get even more bonuses, including extra Skill damage, increased maximum health, and superior elemental resistances. Get up to speed on all the gem types, what they do, and how you can craft improved ones.\nDiablo 4 map\nThe Diablo 4 map of Sanctuary is pretty massive, featuring five expansive regions with unique terrain, enemies, and all sorts of dungeons and other loot-filled nooks. You\u2019ll start in the Fractured Peaks region but there\u2019s also Scosglen in the north, the Dry Steppes to the west, Kehjistan to the southwest, and southeast is Hawezar.\nDiablo 4 fast travel and mounts\nOnce you\u2019ve completed the prologue and made it to Kyovashad, Sanctuary is your oyster and you explore. However, you need to make sure you visit Waypoints, which are usually found in towns, to help with Diablo 4 fast travel. There are also a few ways to rapidly exit a dungeon to save you the hassle of walking back out, so make sure you know how to leave a Diablo 4 dungeon too.\nRideable mounts are available in this game, so it\u2019s good to know how to get a Diablo 4 horse to help you get around. Although do note that you won\u2019t be able to get a mount right away so you\u2019ll be stuck trudging around on foot for quite a few hours.\nDiablo 4 healing potions\nWhile dungeon-delving, make sure you keep yourself healthy with Diablo 4 healing potions. You can upgrade their healing potential and increase the number you can hold at once through various means.\nDiablo 4 gear, repairs, and customization\nDiablo 4 is all about killing horrific foes to get sweet loot \u2013 armor, weapons, amulets, rings, Aspects, and more. There\u2019s also a lot you can do with gear aside from just wearing and using it, and you\u2019ll be constantly switching it all out as you collect superior stuff. You can sell gear for gold, but it\u2019s also important to salvage Diablo 4 gear for crafting materials.\nBy salvaging, you can also unlock Diablo 4 transmog options to customize your character\u2019s outfit. For an added cosmetic touch, you can also select a title in Diablo 4 which can be seen by other players. However, it\u2019s also important to ensure your gear is in peak condition and well as being beautiful, so make sure you know how to repair Diablo 4 gear and restore its durability.\nDiablo 4 quests and collectibles\nThere are loads of quests, side quests, and collectible items to find across Sanctuary in Diablo 4. Sometimes these quests include battling bosses, fetching items, or solving some sort of puzzle \u2013 quite a lot of these puzzles involve performing emotes, so it\u2019s good to know how to use emotes in Diablo 4. Be sure to use your Diablo 4 quest log to stay on top of all your tasks, but if you need help seeking out collectibles or completing any quests, the guides below may be able to help:\n- Diablo 4 Rite of Passage is one of the earlier quests in Diablo 4 and marks the end of the prologue and the start of Act I. It presents you with an inconsequential choice, but our guide will clear up exactly what\u2019s going on here.\n- The Diablo 4 Secret of the Spring side quest isn\u2019t especially clear, so we\u2019ve got a guide on how to complete it.\n- If you\u2019ve got far enough in the Dry Steppes, you might be stuck on the Diablo 4 Reject the Mother side quest, but all you need to do is perform an emote.\n- Similar to the above side quests, the Diablo 4 Keeping the Old Traditions solution also involves breaking out the right emote.\n- Diablo 4 Altars of Lilith are found throughout the regions of Sanctuary, and each one provides Renown for the relevant region and a small stat buff.\n- Diablo 4 Whispering Keys are used to open Silent Chests that can be found randomly out in the world.\n- Diablo 4 Faded Plaques have somewhat cryptic messages on them that require you to perform a specific emote.\nDiablo 4 resources and currencies\nDiablo 4 offers plenty in the way of loot that\u2019s not just gear: crafting materials, currencies to spend, upgrade materials, and more. Here\u2019s a list of some high-demand items that we\u2019ve written guides for, explaining how you can get these desirable resources:\n- Diablo 4 Murmuring Obols \u2013 a special currency spent at Purveyors of Curiosities for randomized gear drops.\n- Diablo 4 Crushed Beast Bones \u2013 a crafting material that\u2019s annoyingly hard to come by but is essential for a healing potion upgrade.\n- Diablo 4 Baleful Fragments \u2013 Gather up Baleful Fragments and use them to upgrade Legendary weaponry.\n- Diablo 4 Abstruse Sigils \u2013 You\u2019ll need this rare material to upgrade Legendary jewelry.\n- Diablo 4 Fiend Rose \u2013 collect these roses in Helltide areas of Sanctuary.\nDiablo 4 bosses\nAs well as hordes of monstrous foes, you\u2019ll also come up against horrific demon warriors and towering creatures in boss fights. Here are some that you might face in your adventures:\n- The Diablo 4 Den Mother boss can be found at the end of the Light\u2019s Watch dungeon and is quite a tough one to beat.\n- Diablo 4 Ashava is one of the game\u2019s world bosses, but this horrible, scaly beast is only available at certain times.\nDiablo 4 Multiplayer and PvP\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of dungeon crawling solo, you can always get up to three other friends to join in online co-op play. Your friends can even be on different platforms as Diablo 4 crossplay allows you to all play together, so long as you have linked Battle.net accounts. Although if fighting other players is more your style, there\u2019s also a dedicated Diablo 4 PvP area.\nDiablo 4 error codes\nIf you\u2019re receiving any Diablo 4 error codes, you might be having some connection issues, or there are problems on Blizzard\u2019s end. Look at our full error codes guide to see if there\u2019s a solution to the problem you\u2019re having.\nDiablo 4 Battle Pass\nDiablo 4 has embraced the live service model and even has its own Diablo 4 battle pass with exclusive rewards \u2013 there\u2019ll be quests and even Legendary items! Read our guide to get caught up on the essentials.\nDiablo 4 pre-order items\nWondering where your promised Diablo 4 pre-order bonuses have got to? We can guide you through exactly how you can retrieve your exclusive gear.\nDiablo 4 is one of the biggest new games of 2023, but take a look at what else is coming out later this year to keep on your radar.\nWill Sawyer is a guides writer at GamesRadar+ who works with the rest of the guides team to give readers great information and advice on the best items, how to complete a particular challenge, or where to go in some of the biggest video games. Will joined the GameRadar+ team in August 2021 and has written about service titles, including Fortnite, Destiny 2, and Warzone, as well as some of the biggest releases like Halo Infinite, Elden Ring, and God of War Ragnarok.\n- Josh WestEditor-in-Chief, GamesRadar+\n- Jordan Gerblick\n- Iain WilsonGuides Editor"

      "text": "Blizzard jumps out of bed, rushes to the desk, and slams the nerf button after Diablo 4 players find a way to use Season 9 powers to \"teleport effectively infinitely\" and speed farm with every class\nThe Season 9 teleport Propulsion combo was \"stomping on build identity,\" says Blizzard\nDiablo 4 PTR testers have been tinkering around with the new Season 9 Horadric powers for a few weeks now, and Blizzard has identified and heavily nerfed a combination that was giving all classes the ability to speed farm by endlessly teleporting around the map while blasting enemies down in droves.\nThe power combo doesn't appear to be super widely known, but a video from Rob2628 effectively breaks down how it works.\nDiablo 4 Season 9 essentially lets you craft your own spells with the Horadric Spellcraft system, and it works by letting you pick a base spell, or Catalyst, and then modify it with Infusions that change the type of damage you deal and add various effects.\nTo achieve Diablo 4's Season 9 teleporting trick, you would've wanted to use Propulsion as your Catalyst and Floaty Bubble and Bloody Charm as your Infusions.\nPut simply, Propulsion sends out a powerful mana blast that \"executes non-boss enemies.\" Simple enough. Meanwhile, with the Floaty Bubble Infusion, you'll blink over to the center of the mana blast's AoE, and then Bloody Charm resets your cooldown so you can chain attacks and teleport seemingly endlessly. It's a lot like a homebrewed version of Path of Exile's Flicker Strike melee attack, and similarly, any class can use it.\nIt wasn't long before the Diablo 4 community took notice, rightly predicting an incoming nerf. And right on schedule, Blizzard has also now taken notice with a nerf specifically to the Bloody Charm's ability to reset Propulsion's cooldown. Per the new patch notes, the combination will now simply result in a five-second, 70% movement speed buff upon successful executions.\nThe Diablo 4 dev team hosted a livestream today where they addressed the nerf (timestamped here). \"This effect caused you to be able to teleport effectively infinitely in a lot of builds,\" said systems designer Aislyn Hall. \"It was transformative, and so transformative to the point where it was actually stomping on build identity, in many cases.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n\"We really want you to experience the full breadth of what different characters can offer in Diablo 4. We don't want it all to be condensed down to one thing.\"\nAdded game designer Charles Dunn, \"When you're playing a different class and different build, you want your gameplay to feel meaningfully different ... the Horadric Spellcraft is kind of a compliment on top of what you're already doing. It's a unique utility, it's an interesting wrinkle to your build. And on the PTR we found that this particular teleport Propulsion interaction was basically eclipsing everything else.\"\nThe tight-rope Blizzard has been walking between reasonable balance updates and nerfs in the name of simply killing fun has been a constant pain point both for the studio and for the Diablo 4 community since the game's launch two years ago. This change obviously only affects the PTR branch at this point, so it won't have quite the ripple effect that a nerf like this would have on the final build, and hey, that's precisely the point of a public test realm.\nAfter earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side. I got my big break here in 2019 with a freelance news gig, and I was hired on as GamesRadar's west coast Staff Writer in 2021. That means I'm responsible for managing the site's western regional executive branch, AKA my home office, and writing about whatever horror game I'm too afraid to finish.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "\"I actually felt heard\": Diablo 4 content creators tease exciting things to come for the ARPG after a call with Blizzard, following seasons of complaints about nerfs, endgame, and more\nFingers crossed\nDiablo 4's season 8 got a lot of flack, but a new meeting with Blizzard has content creators excited for its future now that season 9 is live. What could be in store for us?\n\"Last night some people including myself got a glimpse of Diablo 4's future,\" tweets wudijo (as spotted by Wowhead). \"Take all the stuff I have been complaining about for the past 1.5 years and imagine I actually felt heard.\"\nLast night some people including myself got a glimpse of #DiabloIV 's future. Take all the stuff I have been complaining about for the past 1.5 years and imagine I ACTUALLY felt heard \ud83d\udc40July 12, 2025\nA lot of players have had a lot of complaints about the isometric action RPG. There's frustration with the battle pass, a perceived increase in busywork, and a general lack of fun.\nBlizzard didn't help matters by nerfing a speed farming method you all were using back when season 9 first came out, but a patch coming out tomorrow looks set to actually buff pretty much every class instead. So, we can already see some of the changes that are coming, but the content creators are teasing even more.\n\"Just got off a call with the Diablo team on upcoming changes coming to Diablo 4\u2026\" tweets Lucky Luciano. \"Keep an eye out because they have been cooking and have a lot planned.\"\nWarlugtv echoes the sentiments: \"Look forward to a lot of stuff coming, let's hope it pans out the way it was discussed! Super excited and actually makes me want to log in!\"\nNone of the creators are giving any specifics, but if those buffs are anything to go by, it seems that our concerns have been heard and listened to, so we should hopefully see more positive changes.

Heck, he's not even content with thousands of hours logged in. He loves the Blizzard RPG so much, he'd actually quite like to make his own Diablo game.\nFinal Fantasy is no stranger to crossovers, and MMO Final Fantasy 14 is full of them. Fall Guys. Dragon Quest. Nier. The Monster Hunter Wilds collab. It's safe to say the lid has been thoroughly lifted on FF14 crossovers, and we probably haven't seen the end of them.\nIn an interview with TechRadar, Yoshi-P was asked about his own dream collabs. \"I'm a maniac about One Piece and I'm a super fan of Evangelion as well,\" he said. \"Oh, and it goes without saying, but Gundam, too!\"\nHe then went on to talk about a Blizzard Entertainment series he's praised before. \"But yes, as a fan of Diablo, I've spent many thousands of hours playing the game, and I never ever got sick of it. I love Diablo so much that I would want to make a Diablo game myself, and I have huge respect for all the staff working at Blizzard, not only as a gamer, but as a developer. So I really would love to achieve some sort of collaboration with them,\" Yoshi-P explained.\nThere you have it - if Yoshi-P could have it his way, Lilith would be plastered all over his MMORPG.

      "text": "Hey Blizzard, the best part of Diablo 4 Season 9 isn't even in the patch notes: a new wardrobe quality-of-life feature that changes the true endgame \u2013 fashion\nOne-click outfit swaps are the Season 9 change I needed\nDiablo 4 season 9 is officially live, and while there's all sorts of new stuff to talk about, the thing I'm most hyped about is a quality of life change that'll make swapping between outfits in your wardrobe much faster and easier.\nDiablo 4's endgame is one of the most hotly debated topics in the ARPG community, but for me, it's not about what you're doing, it's about how you look doing it. Forget the Berserk collab, I want to demon slay with an emphasis on slay, you feel me?\nWell, Blizzard clearly feels me, because it added a genuinely great quality of life feature to the in-game wardrobe. As spotted by Redditor Ropp_Stark and independently confirmed by me, you can now equip an entire outfit with the single click of a button.\n[Wardrobe] You can hold-click to equip all pieces from an armor set in the new patch from r/diablo4\nIn case you don't why this is a big deal, it's basically just a huge time saver for people who like to switch between cosmetic armor sets. With so many different transmogs dropping each season, my wardrobe is a cluttered mess, and especially with Blizzard's naming conventions not being consistent within armor sets, it makes assembling a complete outfit a tedious affair.\nNot anymore. Just to verify, I logged in as my Necromancer, walked into my wardrobe room, and walked out precisely three seconds later dressed as The Bone Knight from Berserk. It's super easy; you just hover over any item that's a part of an armor set and long click over \"Equip Theme,\" and bada bing, bada boom. Time to click some stuff to death in style, baby.\nI'm not all that surprised that the new feature isn't included in the new patch notes. It is such a tiny thing at first blush, but it really will have a big impact for people like me who have been telling people to look up fashion for years.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAfter earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side. I got my big break here in 2019 with a freelance news gig, and I was hired on as GamesRadar's west coast Staff Writer in 2021. That means I'm responsible for managing the site's western regional executive branch, AKA my home office, and writing about whatever horror game I'm too afraid to finish.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."
