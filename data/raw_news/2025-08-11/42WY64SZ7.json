      "text": "Country music star Spencer Hatcher\u2019s mom stabbed to death in home invasion\nThe mother of an up-and-coming country star was stabbed to death after a stranger broke into her Virginia home and attacked her and her husband, according to authorities.\nHolly Hatcher, 62, whose son is music artist Spencer Hatcher, was murdered in her home north of Harrisonburg last Sunday by 41-year-old Kevin Moses Walker, WTVR reported.\nHer husband, Michael Hatcher, 65, was also wounded in the terrifying attack just before midnight Aug. 3, but managed to shoot Walker dead after retrieving a handgun from his vehicle.\n\u201cThis is a highly unusual, apparently completely random [attack] with an individual with no known history of violent behavior of any kind, or even criminal behavior of any kind,\u201d Rockingham County Sheriff Bryan Hutcheson told a press conference.\nTwo days before the killings, Walker, of Pikesville, Maryland, rented a campsite at Endless Caverns in New Market, Va., and bought a large knife at a nearby Walmart, according to investigators.\nThe day before the killing, Walker\u2019s abandoned vehicle was discovered near Endless Caverns by Virginia State Police after cops say he rammed into the store there, but didn\u2019t steal anything.\nPatrol vehicles and a drone were deployed, but there was no sign of him, and police had no idea of the horror that was about to unfold.\n\u201cThere was no indication of any violence or potential for any violence from the offender that the Virginia State Police became aware of throughout that investigation,\u201d Hutcheson said at the press conference.\nFirst responders found Michael Hatcher outside his home with visible injuries, while Walker was lying deceased in the driveway.\nHolly Hatcher was discovered inside the house with fatal stab wounds.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be questions that will never be answered, but all I can tell you is we\u2019ve cried, we\u2019ve hurt, and we\u2019ve hugged, and we have found more love than we have ever known has existed between us, and between you,\u201d Michael Hatcher told the press conference in an emotional statement.\nSpencer Hatcher, who also appeared at the press conference beside his father, announced on social media he was canceling several upcoming shows.\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart and overwhelming sadness that \u2014 due to a monumental loss in our family \u2014 I must cancel my upcoming shows at VOA Country Music Fest in Butler County, OH (8/8) and at Rockingham County Fair in Harrisonburg, VA (8/11 & 8/12),\u201d he said in the Instagram post.\nAuthorities are still investigating a motive for the slaying, Hutcheson said.\nHolly Hatcher has been remembered as a beloved teacher in the rural Virginia community where she worked for the past 19 years.\n\u201cShe poured her heart into her work, positively impacting countless students and colleagues. Her loss is deeply felt by the entire Rockingham County Public Schools (RCPS) family,\u201d a tribute on Facebook read."

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown \u2014 and warns NYC could be next\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced a sweeping crime crackdown in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 while warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor \u2014 and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\nThe Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending his control, which would require a bare majority in the Republican-held House and Senate.\nDocuments formalizing the takeover were transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon and DC police officials set up a meeting later in the day with White House officials to discuss the new arrangement.\nTerry Cole, the Senate-confirmed administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer MPD under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump said.\nIt was not immediately clear how the National Guard deployment will proceed \u2014 including numbers and neighborhoods where they will be sent \u2014 but members of that force historically assist law enforcement in a supporting role and do not have the ability to make arrests.\nJustifying his action Monday morning, the president displayed a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed. And you all know people, friends of yours, where that\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTrump cited many high-profile recent crimes in the capital, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\nTrump also mentioned the 2023 carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the near-fatal stabbing of an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) the same year by a \u201cdemented lunatic\u201d and the shooting death of a three-year girl in July.\nThe president described criminals lawlessly cruising about town on unauthorized ATVs and motorbikes and said he planned to beautify the District by fixing road medians, broken marble and potholes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums too\u2026I know it\u2019s not politically correct,\u201d Trump said, teasing apparent plans to get rid of public housing in high-property-value DC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums where they live.\u201d\nHomeless encampments will also be removed from all public places, including in parks and underpasses, the president vowed, while the US Park Police \u2014 under the control of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 will be responsible for the removal of graffiti.\nDC officials say they won\u2019t resist\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser, an elected Democrat, confirmed Monday afternoon that she would comply with the federal takeover.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work every day to make sure it\u2019s not a complete disaster, let me put it that way,\u201d Bowser said at her own press conference, at which she called Trump\u2019s move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cThe main point is this: Everybody should follow the law, the police and the community. And that\u2019s the case now, it was the case last week and it was the case the week before,\u201d she said.\nThe mayor added that she was particularly concerned about making sure that \u201call law enforcement be identifiable by uniform, a badge, a jacket, so that people know that they are law enforcement.\u201d\nTrump first ordered federal officials, including members of the FBI, DEA and Border Patrol, onto the streets of DC the night of Aug. 7-8. Photos circulating on social media and in the press showed those agents wearing clearly identifying uniforms.\nMPD Chief Pamela Smith confirmed she had a meeting set for later Monday with two federal officials, whom she did not name, about next steps.\nSmith added she was interested in receiving help to enforce outstanding warrants for criminal suspects, saying there are \u201cthings that the federal government is also very useful for.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be an opportunity for us to come together and collaborate on being able to go out and execute warrants,\u201d the police chief said.\nAhead of Trump\u2019s announcement, Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday that \u201cwe do need the federal government\u2019s help\u201d and specifically requested assistance rebuilding the city jail.\nBowser recently invoked curfews in parts of the city in a bid to keep teens off the street as early as 7 p.m., but also has claimed crime rates are going down in the city, pointing to official data.\nTrump claimed Monday that the numbers were \u201cphony\u201d and promised that Bondi will be \u201clooking into that.\u201d\nThe president noted that DC police commander Michael Pulliam, whose district included the densely populated Adams Morgan and Columbia Heights neighborhoods, was suspended last month for allegedly falsifying crime data to make trends appear more positive.\nPulliam\u2019s police union defended him and accused MPD leadership of ordering subordinates to falsify violent crime data.\nDC Police Union chairman Gregg Pemberton endorsed Trump\u2019s takeover, saying in a Fox News interview: \u201cWe completely agree with the president that crime in the District of Columbia is out of control and something needs to be done with it.\u201d\nNew York, Chicago, LA in crosshairs\nTrump announced at his press conference that other cities may be next, saying at one point that \u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while\u201d \u2014 and also name-checking Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\u201cYou look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting very strongly with DC, and we\u2019re going to clean it up real quick, very quickly as they say.\u201d\nTrump additionally announced plans for federal legislation that would override state laws barring judges from applying cash bail requirements to criminal defendants.\nIf necessary, Trump added, ordinary military members could be deployed to join the National Guard and the local cops.\nThe president has direct control over DC\u2019s National Guard, unlike every other unit, which is under the authority of state governors.\n\u201cWashington, DC, should be one of the safest, cleanest and most beautiful cities anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump summed up his plans, \u201cand we\u2019re going to make it that.\u201d"
