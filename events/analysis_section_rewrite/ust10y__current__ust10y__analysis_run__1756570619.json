      "feedback": "Your draft is on target but can be sharpened to meet Argos’ “action‑over‑prose” standard.  \n**Add explicit handle mapping and magnitude**:  \n- State “Expect ust10y to fall 10–20 bps to ~4.20 % by early September (cut probability 89 % – fed_policy).”  \n- Tag the 2‑year flattening as a term‑premium signal (ust2y).  \n- Cite the core PCE level (us_core_pce 2.6 %) and its threshold (2.9 %) with IDs.  \n- Note the tariff regime (tariff_policy) and its mid‑October expiration.  \n\n**Include a clear catalyst window**:  \n- “Key catalysts: September 16‑17 FOMC (fed_policy), mid‑October tariff expiration (tariff_policy), next PCE release (us_core_pce).”  \n\n**Trim extraneous narrative**:  \n- Remove generic phrases (“persistence of tariff‑driven inflationary pressure”) and focus on the causal chain: Fed cut odds → 10‑year decline → tariff persistence → yield support.  \n\n**State invalidation conditions explicitly**:  \n- “If core PCE > 2.9 % or Fed signals tightening, ust10y could rally to 4.30 %.”  \n\n**Keep the paragraph concise** (≤4‑5 sentences) and ensure every claim has an inline ID citation. This will satisfy the mapping, catalyst, and magnitude requirements while keeping the tone decisive and defensible.",
