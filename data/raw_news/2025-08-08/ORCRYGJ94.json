(Photo by Warren Little/Getty Images)\n\nThe Grand Slam winner's absence was not unexpected. He had hinted as early as last November that he would likely skip Memphis, noting his poor finish there last year and minimal impact on his playoff standing.\n\n\"I finished basically dead last there this year (2024) and only moved down one spot,\" McIlroy told The Telegraph last year.\n\nWith currently 3,444 FedEx Cup points, he's virtually guaranteed a spot in the Tour Championship at East Lake -- even if he also skipped the BMW Championship next week.\n\nYet McIlroy's decision has left many concerned\n\nPGA Tour Policy Board player director Peter Malnati told Golfweek he was \"very concerned\" and hinted at possible future measures to prevent top players from skipping playoff events.\n\n\"I think there is stuff in the works, and I'll leave it at that,\" Malnati added. Social media was quick to dub any potential rule change the \"Rory Rule.\"\n\nThe timing couldn't be riper. With major season getting over, August is dull, and McIlroy's absence has become a lightning rod for debates about player responsibility and the Tour's authority.\n\nMcIlroy is the only player among the top 70 to skip Memphis. His decision reflects a calculated move to preserve energy for a grueling end-of-year stretch that includes the BMW Championship, the Tour Championship, the Ryder Cup and international events in India and Australia.\n\nMore Golf: How One Key Change Sparked Akshay Bhatia's Career-Low 62 to Lead St. Jude",

Inconsistencies may occur.\nGermany's Matti Schmid struck the opening tee ball to open the FedEx St. Jude Championship at 8:20 a.m. ET, but by the end of the day it was Akshay Bhatia who stole the spotlight to open the PGA Tour playoffs.\nThe 23-year-old fired an 8-under 62, his career-low round on Tour, to grab the solo lead in the opening leg of the FedEx Cup playoffs.\nHis score was just one shot shy of the course record last set by Justin Thomas in 2023. With this, Bhatiya also marked his third career 18-hole lead/co-lead, and his first of the season. His previous low was 63, recorded six times, scored recently at the 3M Open's Round 3.\n\"I felt like I wasn't putting great throughout the day, but then those last couple putts managed to drop,\" Bhatia told reporters after his round when asked about his day. \"All in all, I felt like Iron Play was nice.\"\nDespite the career-best score, Bhatia admitted there's still room for improvement.\n\"I just need to kind of clean up ... like a couple wedge shots, and get a little more comfortable with the putter, but all in all, I felt like I was driving it nice.\"\nApart from scores, what truly seems to have shifted for the two-time Tour winner is his mindset. After a frustrating final round at the 3M Open, where a \"furious\" Bhatia sat in his hotel contemplating, he made a conscious decision to seek more peace on the course.\n\"I've been looking at a lot of numbers that I don't need to look at FedEx Cup, world ranking, and I still catch myself doing it,\" he expressed during the post-round media conference.\n\"But I'm just really trying to have a little more peace on the golf course. I think this game can consume your life, your happiness, and so I'm just trying to figure out ways to change that because I feel like I don't really want to live my life based off of an unstable game. That's going to drive me nuts.\"\nThat shift in perspective paid off Thursday. Bhatia closed his day one with an eagle on 16, followed by birdies on 17 and 18.\nNow he sits atop the leaderboard, followed by Tommy Fleetwood (7-under), who birdied his final four holes to finish solo second.\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, playing for the first time since his win at The Open, carded a 3-under 67, finishing five shots back. He started strong with birdies on 2 and 3, added two more on the back nine but bogeyed the final hole after a three-putt from 70 feet.\n\"Today was a good day. I did some solid stuff,\" Scheffler shared with reporters on Thursday. \"Felt like I was close to playing a really great round but ended up with a solid round. Overall, a decent start.\"\nFor Round 2 on Friday, Bhatia teed off at 11:50 a.m. ET, again paired with Harry Hall, while Scheffler went out earlier at 10:35 a.m. ET alongside Sepp Straka.\nMore Golf: Jordan Spieth Reveals Ryder Cup Tension With Cheeky Keegan Bradley Comment\nAbout the writer\nDevlina Sarkar is a Newsweek contributor based in New Delhi, India.

      "text": "Is PGA Tour planning to implement a 'Rory McIlroy rule' so players can't skip playoffs?\nRory McIlroy is skipping the FedEx Cup\u2019s first playoff \u2013 the event sponsored by the PGA Tour\u2019s biggest sugar daddy, FedEx.\nMcIlroy, the reigning Masters champion and world No. 2, is the only eligible player from the field of 70 that is skipping out on the $20 million purse at this week\u2019s FedEx St. Jude Championship in Memphis at TPC Southwind.\nPeter Malnati, a player director on the PGA Tour Policy Board, was asked if he was concerned that one of the top players elected not to compete in one of the three legs of the FedEx Cup playoffs.\n\u201cVery concerned,\u201d he said.\nThis year is considered a bridge year for the FedEx Cup playoffs and the Tour Championship, in particular. After several months of debating numerous potential formats, the Tour reached an unanimous decision to ditch the much-beleaguered Starting Strokes format and reinstitute a format where all 30 contestants that make it to East Lake for the final leg of the playoffs will begin the 72-hole stroke-play championship at even par.\nHowever, the Tour didn\u2019t close the loophole that allows McIlroy, who with three wins this year has amassed 3,444 FedEx Cup points to rank second to Scottie Scheffler, to sit this week out \u2014 and the next if he wanted to \u2014 with little consequence. On Sunday, McIlroy banked a cumulative $10 million in bonus money for his successes in the regular season and he\u2019s in line for two more paydays in addition to his winnings in the remaining two playoff events should he choose to compete. He\u2019s already mathematically locked up a berth in the second playoff event, the BMW Championship, reserved for the top 50 in the FedEx Cup standings, and the Tour Championship, which pits the top 30, in Atlanta. The playoff events offer four times the points (with 2,000 being awarded to the winner) so not playing ostensibly could cost him a few spots in the season-long standings and effect his bonus after the BMW depending on who plays well in Memphis.\nBut when asked if any measures will be added in the future to prevent McIlroy or any other players from taking the week off during the playoffs, Malnati said, \u201cI think there is stuff in the works and I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\nWebb Simpson, a fellow player director on the Tour board, didn't elaborate if it would be a rule or a penalty implemented to discourage others from skipping playoff events in the future and said he didn't have a problem with McIlroy's decision.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s too hard of a thing to make guys have to play. We\u2019re still a sport where you can play when you want to play,\u201d Simpson said.\nHe recalled that in 2020, he ranked third in the FedEx Cup and withdrew from the BMW Championship to prioritize rest and preparation ahead of the Tour Championship.\n\u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t fall more than one spot and I thought losing one stroke at East Lake was worth a week of rest because I was toast,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know Rory\u2019s reason but I totally get it. It\u2019s a hard to thing to fix.\u201d\nSimpson isn\u2019t the only player to skip FedEx Cup playoff events before, either. Tiger Woods skipped the inaugural FedEx Cup event in 2007, citing fatigue after back-to-back victories at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA Championship. He would go on to win the final two playoff events and claim the first Cup. He also withdrew from the Northern Trust in 2019, the first playoff event, citing an oblique strain.\nJim Furyk famously missed the 2010 Barclays, a FedEx Cup playoff event at the time, due to oversleeping after his alarm clock battery died and being late for his pro-am tee time. He still managed to win the FedEx Cup title that year.\nMcIlroy, who is planning to play several international events later this year, including in India and Australia, should be commended for being a global player, but this can\u2019t sit well with FedEx. One could argue that this is no different than a division champ receiving a post-season bye in other sports, but McIlroy's action diminishes the Tour's product and doesn't show much respect for FedEx's $100 million annual commitment. He made his intentions known that he would skip the first playoff event nearly a year ago, and hasn\u2019t been shy about saying that TPC Southwind isn\u2019t his cup of tea. \u201cI finished, basically, dead last there (last) year, and only moved down one spot in the playoff standings,\" he told The Telegraph last November. [He actually finished second-to-last in 2024 but who\u2019s counting? He also missed the cut in 2022 when the field was 125 players. In 2023, he did finish T-3.]\nThe show will go on in Memphis with 69 not 70 players but expect there to be a more severe penalty instituted for players who don\u2019t play all three playoff events if eligible.\n\u201cYou might have 1-2 guys do that for an event but I don\u2019t think it will become a thing because they are still huge events against the best players in the world,\u201d Jordan Spieth, a former Tour policy player director, said. \u201cI think they\u2019re trying to figure out how to make sure you don\u2019t skip both of them and ideally neither of them.\u201d\nIt will be an interesting case study into the style of new Tour CEO Brian Rolapp and how he handles this delicate situation with his biggest sponsor and most popular player. In an era where the Tour likes to talk about what is best for the fan, Rolapp knows from his days at the NFL that a true playoff needs consequences. It\u2019s stuff such as McIlroy skipping the first playoff event that damages the credibility of the FedEx Cup just as the Tour is renewing efforts yet again to present its season finale as a legacy-making event. It\u2019s time for Rolapp to close the playoff loophole and when he does it should be referred to as the McIlroy Rule."
