      "text": "Micah Parsons watched from the sideline on Friday as the Dallas Cowboys dominated the Atlanta Falcons in both teams' preseason finale, but he still managed to make news.\nBefore kickoff, the star pass rusher was spotted eating nachos. At one point during the game, Parsons appeared to take a rest on the training table near the Cowboys bench while the Cowboys' offense had possession of the ball.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\nThe moves stirred controversy, which prompted a response from Parsons.\n\"I actually appreciate this. The way media shapes perception and narratives is wild\u2014and if he hadn\u2019t said anything, everyone would\u2019ve just run with it,\" Parsons said in response to a reporter saying the defensive end seemed to be on the table for \"relatively short portion\" of the preseason contest.\n2025 NFL PRESEASON BUZZ: BROWNS GM OPENS DOOR TO HAVE 4 QBS ON ACTIVE ROSTER\nThe three-time All-Pro added that he would \"never disrespect the guys out there fighting for their lives.\"\nCowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said he wasn't aware of Parsons' in-game actions. The 26-year-old did not talk to the media after the Cowboys' 31-13 victory.\nTrevon Diggs did make a notable admission about his teammate.\n\"It depends on how his back feels. I know he was real sore this morning. He went and got it checked out. That\u2019s the last thing I heard from him,\" hinting the edge rusher had recently undergone an MRI.\nIt all comes as Parsons and the Cowboys are entrenched in a contract standoff. Parsons recently made his trade request public. On Friday, longtime Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones doubled-down on his stance against trading Parsons, while also pointing to Parsons' agent David Mulugheta.\n\"We were going to send [an offer] over to the agent and the agent said don\u2019t bother because we\u2019ve got all that to negotiate,\" Jones told former Cowboys star Michael Irvin. \"Well, I\u2019d already negotiated. I\u2019d already moved off my mark on several areas. And so, the issue is, frankly, that we already had the negotiation in my mind, and now the agent is trying to stick his nose in it.\"\nAgent David Mulugheta said that \"never happened,\" according to former Pittsburgh Steelers star and current ESPN NFL analyst Ryan Clark.\n\"This is just another public way to make this situation, which is already ugly, even uglier,\" Clark said. \"David Mulugheta in no way has ever told Jerry Jones or any other general manager or owner that. It\u2019s all bull crap. It\u2019s all lies.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nParsons missed four games last season but still finished the year with 12 sacks. He has recorded double-digit sacks in each of his four seasons in the NFL.\nAs it currently stands, Parsons will enter the 2025 regular season under the fifth and final option year of his rookie deal.\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter."

Sanders, an undrafted free agent and son of Deion Sanders, had been fighting for a roster spot behind several other safeties.
