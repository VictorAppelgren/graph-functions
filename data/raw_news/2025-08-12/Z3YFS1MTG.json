  "title": "Travis Kelce is ready to tone down 'party guy' image as his 13th NFL season begins",
  "description": "Travis Kelce tells GQ he's 'starting to phase out of wanting to be known as the party guy.' Girlfriend Taylor Swift appears to have influenced his new outlook.",
  "content": "Travis Kelce is done fighting for his right to party.\n\nOr at least the 35-year-old Kansas City Chiefs tight end is ready to start toning down his party-hearty image \u2014 which is kind of big news for a dude who is known for his wild, celebratory, off-key renditions of the Beastie Boys classic \u201c(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party!)\u201d and is often seen out enjoying life with superstar girlfriend Taylor Swift.\n\nKelce made the revelation during a lengthy interview with GQ that was published Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to phase out of wanting to be known as the party guy,\u201d the three-time Super Bowl champion and 10-time Pro Bowl selection said.\n\n\u201cWhen you see me hanging out at the US Open with Taylor, it may look like the two of us are partying. But I\u2019m just enjoying the fun of being at this really cool event that I always wanted to go to with the person that I love.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve become way more strategic in understanding what I am portraying to people.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Chiefs\u2019 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles at Super Bowl LIX in February, Kelce didn\u2019t immediately commit to returning for his 13th NFL season and the final year of his contract with the Chiefs. He acknowledged to GQ that he has been thinking about his life after the NFL, although he didn\u2019t offer any details on what that might look like.\n\nKelce already has a high profile off the field, thanks in large part to his relationship with Swift but also from his appearances in countless TV commercials and on his successful \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast, which he co-hosts with older brother Jason. Incidentally, that podcast is sure to hit, uh, new heights in its number of listeners this week when Swift makes her first appearance on the show.\n\nPart of Kelce\u2019s new outlook on his image seems to have been influenced by Swift and the way she interacts with her immense fan base.\n\n\u201cPeople gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in a little room with her,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cShe is so good at mesmerizing everybody and making everybody feel like it\u2019s an intimate situation. I think that alone \u2014 there is so much calm and coolness. She\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s up there making everyone feel at ease.\n\n\u201cWhenever I get in front of a crowd, I feel like I\u2019ve got to be like, Woooo! Like, excited, bringing the energy. Then I saw that coolness and that calmness and that relatability that she is so good at presenting. I really grabbed that. Like, Man, I can use that side of entertainment as well. It\u2019s not just always being the guy that brings the energy and creates these exciting moments.\u201d\n\nKelce added that he and Swift share similar outlooks when it comes to their respective legacies.\n\n\u201cNowadays I just want to be respected and loved by the people that I\u2019m surrounded by in my work,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to leave it better than where it was when I started. And I see her having those same values.\u201d",

      "text": "In a dimly lit dining room in Miami, a waiter places a course of hamachi crudo in front of Travis Kelce. \u201cWe don\u2019t get fresh fish like this in Kansas City,\u201d Kelce says. We are sitting in a horseshoe-shaped booth, and Kelce\u2019s voice can just be heard over that of the young woman on the restaurant\u2019s stage, covering Sade\u2019s \u201cThe Sweetest Taboo\u201d and other quiet storm standards. Kelce did not encounter fish like this \u2013raw, finely sliced, opalescent \u2013 growing up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, either. \u201cRed Lobster was the nice spot for us to go to as a kid. We used to go there, see the lobsters in the tank like we were at an aquarium. We put on pants for that shit.\u201d\nKelce is here, in the swank, lean-protein-and-rich-people capital of the world, not just because it is a comfortable off-season home for a 35-year-old multimillionaire. Kelce is here in South Florida to get back to his roots, to reunite with Fort Lauderdale-based speed-and-agility coach Tony Villani. Villani trained Kelce for his NFL combine more than a decade ago and has worked with Kelce during the summers for most of his professional career. Kelce took a hiatus from Villani a few years ago, when the Kansas City Chiefs tight end moved his off-season operations to Los Angeles, near his burgeoning second career in film and television. Now, though, Kelce has come back east to regroup from last season\u2019s lopsided defeat in the Super Bowl.\n\u201cWin a Super Bowl is the only goal,\u201d Kelce says. \u201cIt\u2019s the only goal. It\u2019s every goal.\u201d It\u2019s been nearly four months since that defeat, and Kelce is still hard on himself about it. \u201cI think it might have slipped a little bit because I did have a little bit more focus in trying to set myself up. And opportunities came up where I was excited to venture into a new world of acting and being an entertainer,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t say this as \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u2019 I\u2019m just saying that my work ethic is such that I have so much pride in how I do things that I never want the product to tail off, and I feel like these past two years haven\u2019t been to my standard.\u201d He adds, \u201cI just have such a motivation to show up this year for my guys.\u201d\nHis past 24 hours have been ridiculous. Yesterday he woke up at five to drive to the Everglades for this story\u2019s photo shoot. He spent 12 hours trudging through swamps and cradling alligators and riding airboats. From there he drove to the airport to catch an evening flight to Kansas City for a children\u2019s hospital charity event that night. The next day, he drove to the airport, caught a flight back to Miami, and came straight to dinner. At some point in this itinerary, Kelce got in a workout. And, after he\u2019s done with me, he\u2019s due to interview Shaquille O\u2019Neal for an episode of New Heights \u2013 the podcast he cohosts with his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles centre Jason Kelce, which was licensed by Wondery last year in a deal reportedly worth $100 million. Beside the plate of hamachi is a cup of coffee, the only hint that he might be experiencing some fatigue.\nKelce is not, to be clear, letting his squandered shot at a historic Super Bowl three-peat or his punishing off-season training stop him from having fun. His unapologetic zest for life is one of his superpowers, and it\u2019s key to his popularity, the sense that he knows what a lucky schmuck he is, can\u2019t believe it any more than you can, and damn if he isn\u2019t going to enjoy every second while it lasts. The impression he gives off lately is of unrepressed joy \u2013 squint-smiling through his newly long hair and the glare of paparazzi flashes as he goes to dinner or a Stanley Cup game with his partner, Taylor Swift. And, besides, brooding self-pity is simply not in his nature. \u201cI love being the happiest guy in the world all the fucking time,\u201d he says.\nKelce is famously bad at hiding his emotions. One story he tells me is of when he was 23, preparing for his NFL draft, and had the opportunity to meet Rob Chudzinski, then head coach of the Cleveland Browns, the team the Kelce brothers zealously rooted for growing up: \u201cI cried in Chud\u2019s office and said, \u2018I will fucking die for this city!\u2019 \u201d Kelce tells me. \u201cI literally was in tears. I said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m getting emotional. I grew up down the street. I would fucking do anything to play for the Cleveland Browns.\u2019 He looked at me like I was insane. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever had somebody just pour out their emotions.\u201d\nThe Browns passed on Kelce. So did every other team until the third round of the 2013 draft, when he was selected by the Chiefs, where ultimately Kelce turned out to be a perfect complement to the incoming future MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes. On the other end of so many of Mahomes\u2019s scrappy schoolyard plays, there was Kelce, improbably open, commemorating a completion with a wider array of dance moves than a junior high mixer. \u201cWhen I was younger in the league,\u201d he says, \u201cI used to have some of the older players come up to me and be like, \u2018Man, you celebrate after every fucking catch!\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m in the NFL, dude! I love this shit! I finally get the ball in my hands and I have millions of people watching me, this shit is exciting!\u2019 \u201d\nFive Super Bowl appearances and three rings later, and having surpassed Jerry Rice for the all-time lead in postseason and Super Bowl receptions, Kelce has a strong case to be considered the greatest tight end ever. \u201cThere will be arguments about him versus Gronk, versus Tony Gonzalez,\u201d says Jason Kelce, who, as New Heights listeners know, is more prone to giving his brother shit than praise. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anybody has ever been as unique of a player in that spot.\u201d Yet age and success have not tempered Travis\u2019s intensity. Not towards opposing players, not towards referees, not even towards his head coach, Andy Reid, whom Kelce infamously and heatedly confronted on the sideline at the 2024 Super Bowl. (He would later apologise and say the two men had laughed about it.) \u201cI get all my negative energy out when I play football,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there on the field, I can hit somebody, I can talk shit. That\u2019s where the meaner side of me is or the asshole side of me.\u201d\nStill, the Travis Kelce I spend time with is different from the Travis Kelce I expected. Though no less ebullient, he is more introspective. \u201cThat football is shaped funny,\u201d Kelce says. \u201cThat thing can bounce your way, and it can not bounce your way. There\u2019s a lot of fortune that goes into playing this game.\u201d It\u2019s this slightly philosophical bent that complicates the carefree, club-hopping Midwestern bro persona that has made him so relatable and beloved. \u201cI\u2019m starting to phase out of wanting to be known as the party guy,\u201d says the guy who emcees a namesake music festival in Kansas City that draws 20,000 spectators to see the likes of Diplo and Lil Wayne, the guy whose post-playoff victory routine is a guttural rendition of \u201c(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (to Party!).\u201d\n\u201cWhen you see me hanging out at the US Open with Taylor, it may look like the two of us are partying,\u201d Kelce says. \u201cBut I\u2019m just enjoying the fun of being at this really cool event that I always wanted to go to with the person that I love.\u201d Put another way, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve become way more strategic in understanding what I am portraying to people.\u201d Later during our time together he tells me, \u201cI have a good understanding of how I want to be portrayed.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a new interest, exactly. At college, when Kelce was suspended from the University of Cincinnati team for failing a drugs test (marijuana), his brother, Jason (who also played for UC), advocated for his reinstatement, and Travis was given another chance, but only if a number of conditions were met. Some of these have been well documented in the brothers\u2019 Amazon Prime and ESPN documentaries \u2013 no missed classes, a grade point average of 3.0. A lesser-known condition was, as Kelce tells me, \u201cI had to sit down with a shrink for an hour a week. He got me to look at my life way more strategically. He got me to understand that you go through these emotions, and your reaction can either help you or hurt you or be indifferent. He walked me through all these different phases of my life. \u2018How did this make you feel? How did you react?\u2019 I started to understand and process these emotions completely differently. You start to control it and not let it get too crazy.\u201d\nI\u2019m curious how the media scrutiny \u2013 increased exponentially since he started dating Swift \u2013 affects him. Does he pay any attention to it? \u201cYou can\u2019t block that out,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone says something that they don\u2019t like about you, you have to be able to understand how you are portraying yourself for them to say that. I\u2019m don\u2019t want anyone to say anything negative about me. Some people don\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019m someone who does care.\u201d\nIt requires a certain amount of vulnerability and bravery for someone of Kelce\u2019s renown to admit what Kelce is admitting here. Even with all his professional accomplishments, all his money and the luxury it buys, all his romantic prosperity, he still cops to the desire to be liked by strangers. He\u2019s willing to keep working to make you like him. Kelce continues: \u201cI do want people to look at me like I\u2019m doing good in the world, I\u2019m influencing and using my platform for the better, being a role model, being somebody that has done it the right way.\u201d\nWe\u2019re wrapping up dinner so Kelce can get some much-deserved sleep before his morning speed workout when the restaurant singer approaches our table, holding a wireless microphone. She starts to sing again, serenading us and only us with Lauryn Hill\u2019s \u201cEx-Factor.\u201d I feel my face go red and try to suppress an uncomfortable chuckle. This is way too intimate. I glance over at Kelce, expecting to catch his eye and exchange some recognition of the awkwardness. But Kelce has been quick to understand what I have not. The singer is simply doing her job, our table one mandatory stop in her nightly loop around the room. So he treats her with the same respect he has shown every other employee in the restaurant thus far, making eye contact with and thanking the staff who bring our food and fill our water glasses and clear our plates. He watches her attentively for the full minute she croons away at us, until she slinks off to the next table.\nWhen you\u2019re trying to win your fourth Super Bowl, you don\u2019t go to a \u201cstudio\u201d with eucalyptus-scented towels, an apparel shop, and a coworking space. You go to a gym. XPE Sports in Fort Lauderdale is a windowless warehouse-sized space in a commercial complex, between a shooting range and an escape room, and immediately upon entering you understand you\u2019re not here to film TikToks and grab-ass.\nKelce has shown up in a hat with \u201cCincinnati\u201d in minimalist block type, a logo-less black tee, black Nike shorts, and vintage LeBrons. He prefers basketball shoes for training. \u201cI don\u2019t find that much power in the shoes that are meant for more speed,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the low-tops, that\u2019s just what you get: the lighter fabrics. Everybody wants to feel like they\u2019re out there almost barefoot.\u201d\nI watch him spend an hour cycling through a series of high-tech, data-yielding drills: 15-yard flies measured by Brower Timing Systems lasers, split squats calculating bar-speed acceleration with a Vitruve velocity app, standing jumps on the Hawkin Force Plates, Shredmill sprints, resistance work on the OHM Run Delta-Kinetic Trainer. He is doing this in rotation with a few other XPE clients.\n\u201cI like being part of the action,\u201d Kelce says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people doing it with you that motivate you.\u201d One of them is a kid who can\u2019t be more than a high school senior and who impresses me by how chill he is getting in reps with a future Hall of Famer who has more than 6 million Instagram followers. Both of us manage to resist the urge to retrieve Kelce\u2019s hat when it flies off during each of the sprints.\nThe session concludes with a half hour of legs: dumbbell box step-ups, single-leg RDLs. You don\u2019t ever get to see them, hidden by tracksuit bottoms and socks, but his legs are tremendous, real Bernini shit. And to witness him perform a Nordic hamstring curl is something I will never, ever forget. On his knees, his ankles held by a trainer, his arms at his sides, Kelce slowly, methodically lowers his torso toward the artificial turf, the angle steadily collapsing from 90 degrees to 45 degrees to still lower, inconceivably lower, to the point where his chest is nearly parallel to the floor and seems to be levitating. Only when his nose is practically touching the turf does he extend his hands to brace himself. Then he pushes himself back up and does it a few more times.\nAfter Kelce finishes, he lingers nearby as Tony Villani, his baseball cap curved and low like we\u2019re at a World Series of Poker final table, explains his approach to Kelce\u2019s speed training. \u201cI started to realise that when you got too fast, you couldn\u2019t decelerate,\u201d Villani explains. \u201cAll Travis is trying to do to the linebacker or safety is make him chase him. Once that linebacker or safety chases him and runs, he\u2019s out of control\u2026. Travis plays between 12 and 16 miles per hour. That\u2019s it. If he goes past his zone, then he turns into a track athlete and can\u2019t change direction. He caught a pass in the Super Bowl three years ago and he jumped it up to 19 miles an hour, the fastest speed he hit in three years.\u201d\nKelce recalls and says, \u201cYou know what\u2019s funny? During that run, I felt how out of control I was and the guy had the angle on me. I just didn\u2019t even have a move.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s set every tight end record known to man without ever really being above 19,\u201d Villani says with the contented look of a teacher praising their star pupil. \u201cThis is what he\u2019s an artist at. This isn\u2019t just, Did he go from A to B as fast as possible, which he knows how to do, but he also knows how to be an artist creating illusion with agility.\u201d\nVillani draws my attention to two whiteboards. Using a marker, he covers them with fractions, percentages, decimal points, arrows, triangles, triangles within triangles, and a house-shaped polygon. His arcane formula amounts to shaving a few tenths of a second off Kelce\u2019s movements so that he can gain an extra half-yard of separation from a defender \u2013 so that there\u2019s a higher probability of a catch than a deflection. I nod along and pretend I know what the hell he is talking about. \u201cI haven\u2019t released all this yet, but you\u2019re going to make me,\u201d Villani says.\nNothing to worry about, I think. I couldn\u2019t report on Villani\u2019s proprietary theorem even if I wanted to. Kelce is clearly not confused. It makes perfect sense to him.\nIn our conversations, Kelce is ambivalent about the meathead jock stereotype that he sometimes seems to wear (like when, shortly after we speak, he goes viral for this comment about his experience guest hosting SNL: \u201cThe table reading, for a guy that can\u2019t really read that well, it was kind of a fucked situation\u201d). \u201cI find it funny,\u201d he says. \u201cI joke about it. It is what it is. I\u2019m just out here living life,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily want everyone to think I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d But he\u2019s earnest about his belief that it\u2019s more powerful to know what you don\u2019t know. \u201cThere\u2019s always something to learn. Acting like you\u2019re the smartest one in the room just isn\u2019t the way to go.\u201d\nTwice over dinner the night before, Kelce told me stories that began with him missing school. The first came after his [seafood restaurant] Red Lobster quip. His dad was a waiter there. Ed Kelce had a lot of jobs. His main job was sales for a company that made insulation for factory furnaces and kilns. He also picked up part-time jobs. One was at the See\u2019s Candies kiosk at Beachwood Place mall.\n\u201cHe never told me,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI found this out when I was skipping school one day and saw him there. I got right out of there.\u201d\n(When I speak to Ed and tell him this story, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this one! He must have turned and ran because he would have definitely caught hell, no question about that.\u201d)\nThe other story was about his mum\u2019s work. Donna Kelce got her college degree in communications, with the aspiration to go into radio or television. \u201cIt really didn\u2019t go to waste!\u201d she tells me, shortly before it is announced that she will appear in the next season of the reality competition show The Traitors. Those industries, she says, \u201cwould put up with [women] but didn\u2019t see us as anything serious.\u201d So she entered banking, ending up at KeyBank in Cleveland.\n\u201cWhen I would get kicked out of school for fighting,\u201d Travis said, \u201cI would sometimes have to go with my mum to work and hang out with her.\u201d Over the years, and with each successive suspension, he was able to witness his mother\u2019s ambition realised. \u201cIt went from cubicles to a really nice office in the back, to all of a sudden the offices are getting bigger and bigger and now she\u2019s got her name on her office. I saw my mum go through it by being a little bad-ass kid.\u201d\n(Donna contends her son wasn\u2019t sent home for fighting: \u201cSometimes he went above and beyond overboard trying to make the other kids laugh. He just loved attention. Which he still does, God bless him!\u201d)\nNow, Kelce didn\u2019t tell me these stories to show how crappy he was at school. He told them to show how he gets his work ethic from his parents, how determined they were to give their two sons a chance to find and pursue their dreams, and how much he loves them for that, among so many other reasons. Still, I also knew from my research that he\u2019d been ineligible to play football his sophomore year of high school because he failed French class, and that he didn\u2019t get his college degree until 2022. So: how is a guy like that \u2013 a guy who during a live taping of New Heights at the University of Cincinnati chugged a beer in cap-and-gown while belatedly receiving his diploma \u2013 able to look at Tony Villani\u2019s graffitied whiteboards and easily decipher all those complex diagrams?\n\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly intelligent,\u201d says Jason Kelce. \u201cBut he never really cared enough about school to be in AP [advance placement] courses. I was always in AP courses and then we\u2019d take the same proficiency test, and he\u2019d get a higher grade. It\u2019s like, \u2018How are you getting a better maths grade when you haven\u2019t even taken algebra yet?\u2019 \u201d\nJason then tells me a story of how one Christmas when he was eight and Travis was six, they both got the same Erector set. They sat at the kitchen table with their father putting them together. Ed and Jason carefully read the instructions before beginning the assembly. When they\u2019d read them, they looked up to find Travis had finished.\n\u201cTravis has always had these moments that we refer to as \u2018Travis Moments,\u2019 \u201d Ed says when I ask him about the story. \u201cHe will suddenly surprise you by doing something or knowing something or seeing something.\u201d\nEd provides another example. \u201cWhen Travis was in grade school, we were called in to discuss some problems he was having: his teacher and a counsellor and Donna and me. I wasn\u2019t buying that there was anything wrong with him. But I shut up, listened to them, let them do their spiel. And the teacher said, \u2018Travis, I want you to write your name so that I can read it.\u2019 Travis was sitting across the table from her. He wrote his name upside down and backwards.\u201d\nAlex Smith also had his share of Travis Moments. Smith was the Chiefs\u2019 starting quarterback for Kelce\u2019s first five years in the NFL, before he was succeeded by Patrick Mahomes. Most people credit Mahomes with helping Kelce achieve his full potential, including Kelce himself. But Kelce also acknowledges how crucial Smith \u2013 \u201cone of my favourite teammates, favourite people in my entire career\u201d \u2013 was in his development. The Chiefs\u2019 offence favoured wide receivers. As tight end, Kelce would often be by himself on one side of the field. So he started tweaking his routes, tinkering and freestyling, just to see if he could get anywhere.\n\u201cI like to play to the rhythm, if you think of it as a piano player,\u201d Kelce says. One hand provides the structure for the song, while the other hand crafts the melody your brain can\u2019t help but follow. \u201cBut I\u2019m always on the quarterback\u2019s timing. I\u2019m always making sure I\u2019m not screwing up anybody else\u2019s route. But at the same time, I\u2019m going to manipulate the defence\u2026 I\u2019m nonstop trying to get in those guys\u2019 heads. One, keeping them in a reactionary position. But two, if I understand what this guy is being taught on this play in terms of leverage, in terms of when I threaten him, I can move him, now I can move guys to open up windows. Now I can attract attention to open up somebody else.\u201d\nIn Kelce\u2019s third season, with the Chiefs\u2019 offence struggling, Smith and then quarterbacks coach Matt Nagy sat down to watch a video of their most recent game.\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget,\u201d says Smith. \u201cEvery single pass play, wherever I was going, whatever the concept intended for me to throw, whatever defensive look I was getting, it didn\u2019t matter: Travis was open. He was supposed to turn out, but on this one he flipped in, and he was open. He always put his little twist on it, and it worked. The number one insight for us coming out of that meeting was that we needed to get the ball to Travis more. When in doubt, get it to Travis.\u201d\nSoon after, they were playing the Denver Broncos. Kelce had already caught one pass on a fake shallow cross that he turned back out. They ran it again. This time the defensive end didn\u2019t bite on the fake.\n\u201cAs a quarterback,\u201d says Smith, \u201cI have to generally know where you\u2019re going to be. It\u2019s part of accountability and timing. I\u2019ve got to trust that when I throw it, you\u2019re going to be there. Travis instinctively did this weird little hesitation and then just kept running the shallow [cross]. This is an NFL game! We had never talked about this! This was not remotely a possibility for him when we installed this play! It turned into a 35-yard gain. This is the brilliance of Kelce. He did the Randy Moss \u2013 put his hand up. There aren\u2019t many guys you can trust when they put their hand up. I trusted him and he made it right\u2026 it\u2019s pretty savant what he\u2019s been able to do.\u201d\nKelce and I are supposed to spend an afternoon playing nine holes of golf. But rain is forecast, so we sit in a rooftop lounge area at the golf club and talk. He wears a Kith for USA Basketball long-sleeve shirt and sips an iced coffee.\nI ask him about his trademark first down gesture \u2013 one of the all-time athlete celebrations. So simple, so cocky, so devastating to opposing fans. Across from me, Kelce chuckles, raises both hands, points his fingers in the same direction, though not as emphatically as in games. It\u2019s the slight dramatic pause followed by the assertive point that makes it so savage.\n\u201cWhen did that start?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat was the inspiration?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cI know Tay picked it up and she did it in New Orleans.\u201d\nLast October, on a Louisiana stop of her Eras Tour, Swift worked the first down point into her choreography. And the internet went crazy, as it always does over anything to do with the pair. I\u2019ve been looking for the right way to ask Kelce about Swift, without making him a sidekick. As it turns out, taking turns being a sidekick sits just fine with him.\n\u201cI get to be the plus one,\u201d he says. \u201cI get to go and be that fan. Because I am a fan. I\u2019m a fan of music. I\u2019m a fan of art. And it\u2019s so cool that I get to experience her being that plus one for me on the football field\u2026 I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows.\u201d A few weeks after we speak, Swift will join Kelce in Nashville at Tight End University, a training camp and charity fundraiser Kelce cofounded, and put on an impromptu performance. \u201cI sort of made her a football fan,\u201d Kelce says. \u201cShe is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like. She understands what special situations are, third and short \u2013 all these things because she just naturally loves to hear about my job.\u201d\nKelce says he and Swift have a lot in common, entertaining sold-out stadiums. \u201cI hadn\u2019t experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, the ups and downs of being in front of millions. That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows. She may not think of herself as an athlete. She will never tell anyone that she is an athlete. But I\u2019ve seen what she goes through. I\u2019ve seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d\nSwift\u2019s training regimen of singing her entire set while running on the treadmill has been widely covered; what Kelce emphasises is the conditions in which she performs. \u201cTo go out on stage, on a computer, essentially, for three hours. The [Eras Tour] floor is literally \u2013 I\u2019ve seen underneath that thing. It is a football-field-sized computer. You take that into Singapore, where it is scorching hot, and all of a sudden you\u2019re feeling the fumes from the computer and you\u2019re feeling the fumes from the sun and you\u2019re doing a show for three hours with a lot of energy, bringing it every single song. That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she\u2019s doing it three, four, five days in a row.\u201d\nKelce talks about Swift freely, with the confident adoration of a sturdy relationship, and with obvious pride. Not macho pride in his having attained the seemingly unattainable, or the overprotective possessiveness so often confused for chivalry. Kelce expresses selfless pride. Immaculate pride. The kind he, of traditionally Midwestern stock, has been unwilling to express about his own accomplishments when I\u2019ve raised them. I think of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe \u2013 how when she returned from entertaining troops in South Korea, she said, \u201cJoe, you never heard such cheering.\u201d And he replied, \u201cYes I have.\u201d There is no such ego when Kelce speaks of Swift, praising the creative purposefulness of the Eras Tour.\n\u201cHave you learned anything from her about how to hold a crowd\u2019s attention or harness its energy?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cPeople gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in a little room with her. She is so good at mesmerising everybody and making everybody feel like it\u2019s an intimate situation. I think that alone \u2013 there is so much calm and coolness. She\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s up there making everyone feel at ease.\n\u201cWhenever I get in front of a crowd, I feel like I\u2019ve got to be like, Woooo! Like, excited, bringing the energy. Then I saw that coolness and that calmness and that relatability that she is so good at presenting. I really grabbed that. Like, Man, I can use that side of entertainment as well. It\u2019s not just always being the guy that brings the energy and creates these exciting moments.\u201d\nI remind him of an interview in which he said his ideal partner would share some of the same qualities as his mum.\n\u201cAre there any similarities between the two of them?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cTheir kindness, their genuineness, their ability to say hello to everyone in the room,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir ability to show love and support no matter what. And on top of that, their work ethic. I saw my mother reach goals that she had set for herself, go from being a teller to working all the way up in the KeyBank building.\u201d\nHere, thinking of his mum\u2019s determination and perseverance, Kelce gets a bit emotional and pauses briefly to collect himself. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Taylor do the exact same thing of setting goals for herself and exceeding the expectations and really captivating the world in that regard.\u201d\nIn documentaries about the Kelce brothers, the family has been open about how Donna and Ed kept their marriage together for the sake of Travis and Jason, finally divorcing after 28 years when Travis was at college. \u201cThey were always the ultimate partners in terms of being there for us as kids,\u201d Kelce had told me. \u201cThere was no division in terms of anger at each other. I think the romance of it all might\u2019ve just kind of faded, being so focused on their careers and raising a family. It\u2019s probably hard for parents to keep that romance, especially when you\u2019ve got kids that are into fucking everything, you know? My brother was into so much more stuff than me \u2013 he was a musician, he was doing all this theatre stuff \u2013 outside of just sport. I\u2019m doing all these sports \u2013 two sports every season. So there\u2019s so much shit going on.\u201d\nI had asked Kelce how visible the strain in his parents\u2019 marriage was growing up, and he recalled just one, small moment. \u201cWe always had the calendar on the refrigerator of everything, and it said \u201825th anniversary\u2019 on it. Might have been 15. I don\u2019t want to get this wrong.\u201d More so than at any other point in our conversation, Kelce deliberated, scrupulously, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure whether he should reveal this memory, and if he was going to do so then he wanted to be certain he wasn\u2019t mischaracterising it in any way.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get this wrong,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt had to be around 20. Let\u2019s say 20. I remember seeing it and I was like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s their anniversary. I wonder what they\u2019re going to do.\u2019 And it was kind of just another day almost. Another day of knocking out things for the kids.\u201d\nKelce was quick to explain that his parents\u2019 wedding anniversary was not overlooked out of neglect. \u201cI\u2019m sure my father probably did something, \u2019cause he\u2019s always been very good at making sure we celebrate our mother when it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day and all that. He still to this day will text, like, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s your mum\u2019s birthday coming up. Don\u2019t forget about it,\u2019 \u201d Kelce said. \u201cBut at the same time, I never saw the romance of it all. A lot of friends I grew up with shared that. The handful of my friends whose parents are still together and still thriving \u2013 those situations I would love to have. Not that I think my parents dealt with it the wrong way or anything like that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more so, if we\u2019re gonna start this and do it, why not try and do it to last forever? Not just in a \u2018It\u2019s just for the kids\u2019 aspect.\u201d\nNow, sitting with him in the golf club lounge, its windows streaked with rain, I remind him of this story and ask how he and Swift \u2013 also two very career-orientated people with unrelenting schedules \u2013 manage to keep their romance from waning.\n\u201cWhenever I\u2019m with her, it feels like we\u2019re just regular people,\u201d he says, not exactly answering the question. It might not need answering yet; they are only two years in. But he goes on: \u201cWhen there is not a camera on us, we\u2019re just two people that are in love. It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out, but I would say that it\u2019s as normal of\u2026 it happened very organically even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked. It still happened very organically.\u201d\n\u201cNothing I\u2019ve ever done has been a controlled, organised process. When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the fuck off.\u201d\nTalking about Swift, Kelce brings up the question of his legacy. Early in his career, he says, he was motivated by the stats and records that would be attached to his name but, \u201cnowadays, I just want to be respected and loved by the people that I\u2019m surrounded by in my work. I want to leave it better than where it was when I started. And I see her having those same values.\u201d\nWhile Kelce does not discuss the timing or terms of his NFL exit, he says he has been thinking about what his life looks like when he\u2019s done playing. He\u2019s now in the last year of his contract, but, unlike many who have been in his position, he does not necessarily need to take a team-friendly deal or grind it out in a new city. He has built his own media enterprise, one that benefits from the fascination with his relationship with Swift but is in no way dependent on it. Whatever he does next, he will begin from the starting point of, roughly speaking, the largest pop cultural platform in modern American history. What will it be?\nKelce describes a process not of relentlessly upward ambition, but of a curious searching, an improvisational trial and error similar to how he mastered route running. \u201cI know to stay away from a few things that I dabbled in early,\u201d he says. There are still a couple of years on the New Heights agreement. He\u2019s got an investment in some Missouri car washes, family businesses that invest in their local communities. \u201cThe whole \u2018teaming up\u2019 aspect is something that I\u2019ll always kind of desire,\u201d he says. He\u2019s enjoyed acting, and finds developing his on-camera skills satisfying. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily know if I\u2019ll take it and run with it when I\u2019m done playing,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I know that I want to stay around the football world as a profession and then dabble in other areas as well.\u201d When he looks around at his fellow former players, he admires people like ESPN\u2019s Pat McAfee, who are \u201cmaking it fun.\u201d\n\u201cI think there is a happy medium,\u201d he says. Kelce seems to be looking for the pieces of a life that will satisfy his abundant passion and drive but also allow him to remain being the happiest guy in the fucking world all the time. The secret, he thinks, is balance. \u201cI do want to have free time. I do want to have the ability to be around my family. I don\u2019t want to get too busy to where I\u2019m travelling all over the world and I\u2019m not present at home.\u201d\nA lot of players take years to figure this out after they\u2019ve hung up their boots, if they ever do. Kelce is way ahead. Quietly wise. Consider it yet another Travis Moment: what he\u2019s experienced of fame and influence so far, he explains, just makes him appreciate where he comes from all the more. \u201cThere is an easier and a better way of life,\u201d he says. \u201cA more fun way to live.\u201d\nSean Manning is the publisher of Simon & Schuster.\nA version of this story originally appeared in the September 2025 issue of GQ with the title \u201cHow Travis Kelce Spent His Summer Vacation\u201d\nPhotographs by Ryan McGinley\nStyled by Law Roach\nHair by Thom Priano\nSkin by Leslie Lopez at Tracey Mattingly\nTailoring by Tina Manners\nMovement direction by Ash Rucker\nAnimal handling by Native Village Rescue\nFlyboard by Atlantic Flyboard\nProduced by Nicole Tondre at Hen\u2019s Tooth Productions\nShot on location at The Beach Club at The Boca Raton, Marine Stadium Marina, and Mack\u2019s Fish Camp"

Swift made the announcement on \u201cNew Heights,\u201d the popular podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 tight end Travis Kelce.\nWho worked with her on it?\nWhile there\u2019s no information yet about a tracklist or collaborators, shortly after the news, a string of billboards in New York and Nashville directed fans to a Spotify playlist titled \u201cAnd, baby, that\u2019s show business for you.\u201d It\u2019s full of previously-released Swift hits produced by Max Martin and Shellback, suggesting the pop superproducers had prominent roles on the new record.\nIf that theory holds, it might mean a departure from her longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff, who helmed \u201cPoets\u201d and the Grammy-winning albums \u201cMidnights\u201d and \u201cFolklore.\u201d\nWhen will it be released?\nThere\u2019s no release date, but it\u2019s available for preorder on Swift\u2019s website now. The cover art is \u2014 assuming this isn\u2019t some misdirection \u2014 a cryptic minty green background and sparkly orange padlock.\nDidn\u2019t she just release a 31-track album last year?\nSwift has been relentless in releasing new music over the last few years. In 2024, she released \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d followed by a massive \u201cAnthology\u201d edition of bonus tracks, which made \u201cPoets\u201d the bestselling album of the year.\nWhat\u2019s up with the final \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d albums?\nSwift re-purchased her back catalog of master recordings, first released through Big Machine Records, from investment group Shamrock Capital for a rumored nine-figure sum. Swift\u2019s rerecorded \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d editions of those albums were a popular rebuttal to her old nemesis Scooter Braun\u2019s purchase of her catalog.\nWhile two of those \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d LPs (her self-titled debut and \u201cReputation\u201d) remain unreleased or unfinished, she now plans to reissue the originals as well."

      "text": "- Share via\nKANSAS CITY \u2014 Travis Kelce wears many hats. He\u2019s an All-Pro tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, ubiquitous commercial pitchman, and as boyfriend to the world\u2019s biggest pop star, Swiftie in Chief.\nIt was a different hat \u2014 a cartoonish chapeau \u2014 Kelce donned a decade ago when he began a journey that would impact thousands of children and families in his adopted city.\n\u201cI did a community relations deal with the Chiefs and read a Dr. Seuss book to a bunch of preschoolers,\u201d recalled Kelce, who wore a towering red-and-white-striped top hat to the event. \u201cAnd when I did that, I looked around and I\u2019m like, `Man, this building is crazy.\u2019 They were taking care of infants and providing meals. Not only breakfast and lunch, but they were sending kids home with dinner for their entire families.\u201d\nIt was a nonprofit learning center called Operation Breakthrough, one that would grow significantly in the ensuing decade, in some part thanks to the support of the budding Chiefs star, along with many others.\nThe program provides education, social services and help from cradle to career for some of Kansas City\u2019s most vulnerable children and families. Over the last decade, enrollment has grown from about 400 to nearly 1,500 students per week.\nMore than ever, the Chiefs are in the national spotlight as they look to become the first team in NFL history to win three consecutive Super Bowls. Their quest begins Thursday night with the kickoff opener against the Baltimore Ravens at Arrowhead Stadium.\nThe Chiefs boast two of the NFL\u2019s unofficial faces of the league in quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Kelce, who has ascended to pop-culture superstar in light of his romance with Taylor Swift, one that has him jetting all over the world to attend her concerts.\nVirtually every professional athlete with any contract of note has an association with a charity. Some are emotionally invested, others view them largely as tax shelters. Kelce has gone the extra mile, buying a onetime muffler shop to expand Operation Breakthrough\u2019s campus and create the Ignition Lab, in which students convert dilapidated jalopies into lacquered, showroom-ready electric vehicles.\nWho can win the Super Bowl in New Orleans? Los Angeles Times NFL columnist Sam Farmer analyzes seven teams that can hoist the Lombardi Trophy this season.\nIn one bay of the Ignition Lab is a 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle SS, once rusted and with a bent frame, but now transformed into a garnet-red classic modified with a Tesla drive unit. That car, bought out of a field for $14,000, is now valued at close to $200,000. It will be raffled this fall \u2014 after Kelce drives it around town and to games for a few weeks.\nThe class is also converting a 1973 Ford Bronco, a 1974 Chevelle Laguna donated by former Chiefs guard Will Shields, and a 1980 Chevrolet pickup that belongs to Travis\u2019 brother, Jason Kelce, who retired as Philadelphia Eagles center after last season.\n\u201cKnowing that I can convert a car from gas to electric is one of my biggest flexes,\u201d said Jordi Martinez, a high school senior, one of the lead students on the project.\n- Share via\nOz Qureshi talks about MINDDRIVE\u2019s real-world learning program. (Sam Farmer / Los Angeles Times)\nOperation Breakthrough started 52 years ago in a convent on the east side of Kansas City, with two nuns watching four children so their parents could go to work. The free after-school program grew over the decades and eventually moved into an old JCPenney\u2018s.\nKelce first visited to read in 2015, meeting Mary Esselman, who had just taken over as president and chief executive of the program.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a safe haven for kids in a very rough area of the city, from when they\u2019re infants all the way up until they\u2019re eighth graders,\u201d Kelce told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cAnd I asked her, `Where do they go once they get to high school,\u2019 and she just kind of put her palms in the air and was like, `Well, this is just all we have. This is all that we can accommodate at this point.\u2019 And I was like, man, we\u2019ve got to do something about that.\u201d\n1.

(Reed Hoffman / For the Times)\nFirst, he made an investment in the Smart Lab, helping with the robotics team along with the digital electronics and 3D printing programs. That coincided with the physical expansion of Operation Breakthrough, which purchased a warehouse on the opposite side of Troost Avenue with an enclosed walkway connecting the two buildings.\n\u201cTroost has always been the dividing line in Kansas City for race, separating poverty and prosperity,\u201d Esselman said. \u201cSo when we put that bridge in it was super significant because it was like bridging the east and west.\u201d\nSoon after, Kelce bought the old muffler shop and, along with Operation Breakthrough and another nonprofit called MINDDRIVE, helped launch the Ignition Lab. Kelce\u2019s foundation is 87 and Running, a reference to his jersey number. He would frequently drop by, check in with kids, occasionally helping work on the car.\n\u201cHe would never wear his Chiefs stuff,\u201d Esselman said. \u201cHe just acted like a regular person, so that\u2019s the way a lot of our kids see him, as a regular person.\u201d\n- Share via\nOz Qureshi, Director of MINDDRIVE, talks about how they converted a 1969 Chevy Chevelle SS to an electric engine. (Sam Farmer / Los Angeles Times)\nNushawnti Jones, who is in her fourth year in the program, said she was nervous to approach Kelce when she first encountered him in the garage.\n\u201cI was like, `I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s here,\u2019 and he was walking around like this was his place,\u201d said Jones, 18, a high school senior. \u201cBut he\u2019s a normal dude \u2014 a big normal dude. He treats people like he knows them.\u201d\nEspecially since he started dating Swift, it\u2019s tough for Kelce to have any semblance of a normal life and difficult to make those unannounced pop-ins at Operation Breakthrough. He continues to help the program with various fundraisers.\n\u201cHe shared with his manager that this was the one [commitment] he wanted to continue to do because it keeps him connected to the kids,\u201d Esselman said. \u201cI love that.\u201d\n\u201cThe place,\u201d Kelce said, \u201cis a hidden gem.\u201d\nAnd has he brought his girlfriend by for a look?\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Esselman said. \u201cBut you never know.\u201d"

      "text": "Has Travis Kelce played his final NFL game? \u2018I\u2019m gonna take some time to figure it out\u2019\n- Share via\nTravis Kelce has a lot on his mind right now, just three days after he and the Kansas City Chiefs came up short in their quest to become the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowls.\nProbably the last thing the veteran tight end should be thinking about right now is whether he wants to continue his NFL career in the fall.\nSo he\u2019s not thinking about it yet.\n\u201cI know everybody wants to know whether or not I\u2018m playing next year,\u201d Kelce said on Wednesday\u2019s episode of \u201cNew Heights,\u201d the podcast he co-hosts with older brother and retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce. \u201cRight now I am just kicking everything down the road. I am kicking every can I can down the road. I\u2019m not making any crazy decisions.\u201d\nJason Kelce had his \u2018New Heights\u2019 podcast delete an X post congratulating the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl win over the Chiefs because it had photos of him. He retired last year.\nKelce does seem to recognize that after 12 seasons, 10 Pro Bowl selections, five Super Bowl appearances and three Super Bowl victories, retirement is something that at least should be considered. He finished the 2024-25 regular season with the lowest yards receiving (823), yards per catch (8.5) and touchdowns (three) in his career.\nAfter a standout game against Houston (seven catches for 117 yards and one touchdown) in the wild-card round of the playoffs, Kelce had little impact through the rest of the playoffs, with two catches for 19 yards and no touchdowns during a 32-29 win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC championship game and four catches for 39 yards and no touchdowns during a 40-22 loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX.\n\u201cThe fact that we keep going to these AFC championships and these Super Bowls, that means I\u2019m playing an extra three games more than everybody else in the entire league,\u201d Kelce said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of wear and tear on your body, and it\u2019s a lot of time in the building, focusing on your craft, focusing on the task at hand, every challenge that you set up for yourself. That process can be grueling. It can weigh on you. It can make you better and it can drive you crazy at the same time.\nAfter the Eagles won the Super Bowl in 2018, Trump rescinded their White House invitation after learning about possible no-shows. Lane Johnson says it will be \u2018a team decision\u2019 this time.\n\u201cAnd right now, it was one of those things where it was kind of driving me crazy this year, and I think that it happens as you tail off towards the back nine of your career, as you see yourself or not feel yourself having the success that you once used to have. Man, it\u2019s a tough pill to swallow. And then on top of that to not be there in the biggest moments, knowing your team is counting on you \u2014 it\u2019s just a tough reality.\u201d\nKelce has more on his plate these days than football. He might be considered by many fans to be a future Hall of Famer, but to at least some portion of the population Kelce is better known as the pitchman for countless companies or as Taylor Swift\u2019s boyfriend.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna take some time to figure it out,\u201d Kelce said of his football future. \u201cI think I owe it to my teammates that if I do come back that it\u2019s gonna be a wholehearted decision and I\u2019m not half-assing it and I\u2019m fully here for them. I think I could play, it\u2019s just whether or not I\u2019m motivated or if it\u2019s the best decision for me as a man, as a human, as a person to take on all that responsibility.\u201d"

      "text": "Taylor Swift on Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast? Swifties think it\u2019s about to happen. Here\u2019s why\n- Share via\nTravis and Jason Kelce are going to have a \u201ca special episode with a VERY special guest\u201d on their \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast this week.\nThat\u2019s big news ... because that mystery guest can be only one person, right?\nJason Kelce and wife Kylie have welcomed a fourth baby, another girl. At 2 days old, Finn surprises uncle Travis Kelce with a quick podcast appearance.\nJust to be clear, the person in question would be Travis Kelce\u2019s girlfriend, pop superstar Taylor Swift.\nKelce and Swift have been an item for roughly two years now. And while the \u201cLove Story\u201d singer has become a fixture at NFL games to root for her beau, she has never appeared on the popular podcast the Kansas City Chiefs tight end hosts with his brother, a retired Philadelphia Eagles center.\nThat could change in a couple of days, based on a tease posted on the \u201cNew Heights\u201d social media accounts Monday \u2014 and on Swifties\u2019 interpretations of the tease. The text is straightforward, simply informing fans of the special nature of the episode and the guest and noting it will drop Wednesday at 4 p.m. PDT.\nThe real juicy bits, though \u2014 if Swift\u2019s fans are to be believed \u2014 are apparently found in the post\u2019s graphic. Over the years, Swifties have become pretty good at spotting and deciphering Easter Eggs, so here\u2019s what jumped out at the \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d singer\u2019s diehard fans (based on observations they posted on social media and Reddit):\nTaylor Swift is still cracking up about boyfriend Travis Kelce\u2019s commitment to his Eras Tour performance during his surprise appearance on stage in London.\n1. A silhouette of a slender person with long hair appears between images of the Kelce brothers, and naturally fans are convinced it can only be that of one particular slender woman with long hair. One commenter on X insists they can see Swift\u2019s bangs in the completely darkened image.\n2. Jason Kelce appears to be wearing a shirt bearing Swift\u2019s image. Swifties are noting that the garment is from the Eras tour and that Travis is wearing one from that tour as well. This reporter, who did not attend the Eras tour, has no reason to doubt them on this.\n3. The graphic\u2019s background color is orange and sparkly. This apparently is seen as a reference to a particular dress Swift wore during the Eras tour. (Although didn\u2019t she famously change her outfit more than a dozen times during each performance? Or so we\u2019ve heard.)\n4. Travis Kelce has a giant smile on his face. OK, sure, he has probably smiled numerous times during his life \u2014 like, say, maybe after at least one of the three Super Bowls he won with the Chiefs. But apparently he has a special grin reserved for the \u201cLover\u201d singer, which one X commenter refers to as his \u201cTay smile.\u201d\nTaylor Swift delivers a surprise performance Tuesday night as part of Travis Kelce\u2019s Tight End University event this week near Nashville.\nThere are many other observations \u2014 including several that involve numbers, math and calendar dates \u2014 all of which clearly add up not only to Swift being the podcast\u2019s \u201cVERY special guest\u201d but also that she will be there to announce something else very special, like perhaps a new album. (Reminder: This is only a fan theory; please remain calm.)\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time this summer that Swift has made an appearance during one of her boyfriend\u2019s projects. In June, she gave a surprise acoustic performance of her hit \u201cShake It Off\u201d at a concert linked to Kelce\u2019s Tight End University camp.\nCome to think of it, Swift was introduced onstage that night by singer Kane Brown as a \u201creally, really, really special guest.\u201d That\u2019s pretty darn close to \u201cVERY special guest,\u201d don\u2019t you think?\nHmmmm ..."
