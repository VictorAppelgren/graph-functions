      "feedback": "This draft does a solid job tying macro, policy, and valuation signals into a cohesive near‑term view with concrete numbers, but it needs sharper causal logic, tighter scope, and fuller use of the provided sources; key action items are: prune or reframe the U.S. urban crime signal (not a market driver on a multi‑week horizon), fix the broken oil sentence and explicitly anchor it to the IEA/forecast (J99EM2TPZ), and tighten the chain from 2.7% CPI and services inflation to consumer behavior, wage dynamics, and the Fed’s timing binary; build a formal medium/current scenario structure (base, upside, downside) with explicit outcomes and probabilities (e.g., base: 50bp cut in Sep, dollar −2 to −3%, spreads −300 to −350bp, personal loan rate −0.5 to −1%), plus clear invalidation triggers (surprise inflation uptick, tariff escalation, or a sharper real‑rate rise); extend the flows/positioning and valuation/technicals lens by adding investor positioning signals, ETF/flow dynamics, dispersion implications, and how capital costs (dividend yields 1.8–2.2%) feed multiple regimes, while explicitly tying the Justness premium (12–18%) and IBM AI‑productivity catalyst to relative performance (4LQD15CFU); ensure every quantitative claim is tied to a source ID and reconcile tensions across sources (tariff truce extension vs deregulation drift; oil oversupply vs persistent inflation) with a concise fragility note; deliver a compact, watch‑list‑driven close: CPI path, Fed commentary, oil/IEA data, US–China tariff news, and competition policy moves, with each line anchored to its source IDs (V7GV8YBQU, C3ODMIQKZ, GX057ADL7, TN66GHPAT, 4LQD15CFU, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, 9W8ZUIBDY).",
