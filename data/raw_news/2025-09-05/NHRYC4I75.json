  "content": "While executives spend billions on meditation apps, yoga retreats, and wellness programs, American stress levels continue to skyrocket. A recent study of 90 workplace wellness interventions found most (with one exception detailed below*) had no positive effect\u2014and sometimes even made things worse. Our research from last year found that the majority of us tend to stress out more trying to get rid of stress. Talk about a negative spiral!\n\nWe\u2019re trying harder than ever to eliminate stress, yet workplace anxiety has reached crisis levels, just in time for AI disruption to take people over the edge. Here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: You\u2019ll never eliminate stress from your career (or your life). But as a stress physiologist, I\u2019m here to tell you that\u2019s actually a good thing! My research reveals that our obsession with stress reduction is fundamentally flawed. Instead of fighting stress, the most successful professionals learn to harness it. The only people with zero stress are dead people. Our aim should not be death.\n\nHere are five evidence-based strategies to rewire how you can work with stress\u2014not against it. 1. Reframe Your Biology as Your Competitive Edge When your heart pounds before a big presentation, your brain screams \u201cdanger.\u201d But that physiological response\u2014increased heart rate, heightened alertness, elevated energy\u2014is identical to excitement. The difference lies in interpretation. A Harvard study found that participants who stated \u201cI am excited\u201d before delivering speeches were rated as significantly more persuasive and confident than those who tried to \u201cstay calm.\u201d The nervous energy remained the same, but performance dramatically improved.\n\nStop telling yourself to calm down. Your stress response is a feature, not a flaw. Start declaring: \u201cThis energy is preparing me to excel.\u201d Your stress response isn\u2019t sabotaging you\u2014it\u2019s upgrading your operating system. 2. Ask \u201cIs This Actually a Tiger?\u201d Your brain evolved to treat missed emails like charging predators. This served our ancestors well but creates havoc in modern workplaces. When stress hits, pause and ask: \u201cWill this kill me in the next three minutes?\u201d If not, you\u2019re experiencing what I call a \u201cpaper tiger\u201d\u2014a stressor that feels life-threatening but isn\u2019t. Once you recognize the false alarm, you can redirect that energy productively instead of spiralling into fight-or-flight paralysis.\n\nWhen facing seemingly insurmountable challenges, excitement might feel impossible. That\u2019s where anger becomes your ally. Studies reveal that anger increases effort toward goals and sparks greater creativity than neutral emotional states. The key is directing anger at the problem, not people. Instead of fuming at difficult colleagues, channel that energy toward solving systemic issues. Transform \u201cThis situation is impossible\u201d into \u201cThis problem needs fixing, and I\u2019m going to figure out how.\u201d Anger mobilizes action. Point it in the right direction.\n\nStress often stems from feeling overwhelmed by massive objectives. Break intimidating projects into actions so small they\u2019re nearly impossible to fail. When you complete micro-goals, your brain releases dopamine, creating an addictive cycle of progress. When we think we have to leap Everest in a single jump, or relearn our entire job because of AI, our brain naturally defaults to helplessness. But by taking action, even incredibly small moves, we begin to regain agency and feel more in control. This \u201cactionable hope\u201d ultimately moves us beyond our state of learned helplessness. Ask yourself: \u201cWhat\u2019s the smallest possible step forward?\u201d Then take it. Winning becomes neurologically addictive (even if the perfect outcome isn\u2019t guaranteed).\n\n5. Make It Bigger Than You The most transformative reframe involves expanding your perspective beyond personal gain. When you anchor goals in serving something larger\u2014your team, customers, community\u2014the fear centers in your brain quiet down. Back to those workplace wellness studies. In the 90 workplace stress interventions, the only thing that consistently improved employee well-being was service to others. When stress serves a purpose beyond yourself, it transforms from burden to fuel. Before your next high-stakes meeting, shift from \u201cHow do I not mess this up?\u201d to \u201cHow can I serve my audience?\u201d The stress remains, but now it\u2019s powering something meaningful and reminding you that stress is often simply a barometer for how much you care.",

Brooks\nAbstract\nIndividuals often feel anxious in anticipation of tasks such as speaking in public or meeting with a boss. I find that an overwhelming majority of people believe trying to calm down is the best way to cope with pre-performance anxiety. However, across several studies involving karaoke singing, public speaking, and math performance, I investigate an alternative strategy: reappraising anxiety as excitement. Compared to those who attempt to calm down, individuals who reappraise their anxious arousal as excitement feel more excited and perform better. Individuals can reappraise anxiety as excitement using minimal strategies such as self-talk (e.g., saying \"I am excited\" out loud) or simple messages (e.g., \"get excited\"), which lead them to feel more excited, adopt an opportunity mindset (as opposed to a threat mindset), and improve their subsequent performance. These findings suggest the importance of arousal congruency during the emotional reappraisal process.\nKeywords\nCitation\nBrooks, A.W. \"Get Excited: Reappraising Pre-Performance Anxiety as Excitement.\" Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 143, no. 3 (June 2014): 1144\u20131158.
