      "text": "In this article, we will take a look at some of the best unstoppable stocks that pay dividends.\nDividend-paying stocks are drawing increased attention from investors amid this year\u2019s market volatility. The S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, has climbed nearly 3% year-to-date, outperforming the broader market\u2019s 1.5% return. This rebound comes after two years of lagging, as tech-driven growth stocks had taken center stage. While this recent momentum may not last indefinitely, analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for dividend-focused investments.\nAs demand for dividend-paying stocks continues to climb, many companies have responded by steadily boosting their payouts. According to a report by Janus Henderson, global dividend distributions hit an all-time high of $1.75 trillion in 2024, marking a 6.6% increase on an underlying basis. The overall growth rate stood at 5.2%, slightly weighed down by a decline in special one-off dividends and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Among the 49 countries examined, 17\u2014including economic powerhouses like the U.S., Canada, France, Japan, and China\u2014reached record dividend levels. Overall, 88% of companies either increased or maintained their dividend payments throughout the year. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best unstoppable dividend stocks to invest in.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this article, we first used a stock screener to identify stocks that have reported positive returns in the past 12 months. From this selection, we chose dividend stocks with 12-month gains of at least 8%, as of the close of May 16. The stocks were then arranged in ascending order of their 12-month gain.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)\n12-Month Return as of the Close of May 16: 8.94%\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a leading American healthcare company that provides a range of services, from pharmacy operations and health insurance to wellness programs. In one of the recent developments, Rite Aid has sold the pharmacy operations of more than 1,000 of its U.S. stores to major competitors, including CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens, Albertsons, and Kroger, as part of its ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy process.\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) emerged as the largest buyer, acquiring prescription records from over 600 Rite Aid locations across 15 states, and agreeing to purchase 64 physical stores in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. The deals are pending approval from the bankruptcy court. CVS has surged by nearly 9% in the past 12 months.\nDespite the asset sales, Rite Aid stated that its stores remain open and customers can continue using its pharmacy services without disruption. CEO Matt Schroeder said that the agreements will allow pharmacy customers to transition smoothly while also helping retain some employees. He emphasized that the move ensures customers will continue receiving the pharmacy care and services they need without any disruptions.\nThe added stores would help CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) expand its footprint in an area where it currently has fewer locations relative to the population compared to other parts of the country. This offers a strategic expansion opportunity for the company. Alongside strengthening its foothold in the retail pharmacy market, CVS is also drawing investor interest thanks to its consistent dividend payments. The company has maintained consistent payments since 1997 and currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share. As of May 18, the stock has a dividend yield of 4.25%.\n9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n12-Month Return as of the Close of May 16: 15.07%\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is an American multinational beverage company. The company, in partnership with Adobe, has launched Project Fizzion\u2014an innovative design intelligence platform that reimagines traditional brand guidelines as smart, flexible assets. This new system allows creative teams to generate content up to ten times faster while maintaining quality, originality, and brand integrity. Though still in its pilot stage, Fizzion reflects a forward-looking approach to scaling brand consistency without sacrificing creative control.\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) runs one of the most intricate marketing systems globally, making it challenging to consistently deliver creative content that\u2019s both brand-aligned and locally relevant. Fizzion aims to solve this by acting as a design-first AI tool that supports\u2014rather than replaces\u2014human creativity. It learns from designers as they work within Adobe Creative Cloud tools like Illustrator and Photoshop, capturing their design choices and converting them into machine-readable StyleID. This allows brand guidelines to be automatically applied across various formats, platforms, and markets. Rapha Abreu, Global Vice President of Design, made the following comment about this development:\n\u201cWith Fizzion, our design elements become smart. Logos, type, imagery\u2014brand guidelines now live intelligently inside them. Each asset understands how it should behave, adapt, and scale across any context. This is about embedding AI at the heart of our brand system so creativity can move faster, without losing its soul.\u201d\nIn addition to its commitment to innovation, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is also a financially healthy company. The company\u2019s sound financial position is reflected in its impressive 63-year history of increasing dividends. It pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.83%, as of May 18."

      "text": "In this article, we will take a look at some of the best Dow stocks according to hedge funds.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, often called the Dow Jones or just the Dow, is a stock market index that tracks 30 major publicly traded companies in the United States. It\u2019s one of the oldest and most widely recognized benchmarks for the US stock market.\nStocks showed mixed movement on June 11 following the release of inflation figures that came in lower than anticipated, alongside news of a preliminary trade deal between the US and China.\nThe DJIA gained 158 points, or 0.4%, while the broader market remained mostly unchanged and the Nasdaq Composite slipped by 0.2%. The S&P index has now risen in six of the past seven sessions and is trading less than 2% below its February record high. Earlier this year, it had fallen nearly 20% from that peak.\nMeanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose just 0.1% in May compared to April, coming in below the 0.2% increase forecasted by economists. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, also rose by 0.1%, falling short of expectations.\nAlexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global co-CIO of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, made the following comment regarding the current market:\n\u201cInflation in May was lower than anticipated, suggesting the tariffs aren\u2019t having a large immediate impact because companies have been using existing inventories or slowly adjusting prices due to uncertain demand. As we wait for the 90-day tariff pause to pass, the market will be caught between inflation and job prints. If inflation stays under control or the job market weakens, the Federal Reserve will likely consider cutting interest rates down the road.\u201d\nGiven this market situation, we have compiled the list of 20 best Dow stocks according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology\nFor this list, we scanned a list of 30 Dow stocks and picked 20 that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s Q1 2025 database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n20. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is one of the best Dow stocks to invest in. On June 10, the company revealed that it\u2019s working on a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer named Quantum Starling as part of its broader quantum roadmap.\nA key component of this effort is the upcoming IBM Quantum Nighthawk processor, which is expected to launch later this year, according to a company blog post.\nLike several other tech giants and well-funded startups, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is racing to advance quantum computing. The core challenge they all face lies in qubit reliability\u2014while qubits can perform rapid calculations, they tend to generate significant errors. Researchers often dedicate some qubits to correcting these errors, but that leaves fewer available for practical computation.\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) shifted its strategy in 2019, and now claims it has developed a new algorithm that could dramatically reduce the number of qubits required for error correction.\nJay Gambetta, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) vice president of quantum initiatives, explained that, unlike the company\u2019s earlier approach, where theory dictated chip design, the current strategy focuses on building chips that are feasible first and then designing the error-correction method around them. This more pragmatic path has given IBM the confidence to roll out a series of increasingly advanced systems through 2027, paving the way for much larger quantum machines.\nIBM has surged by over 25.6% since the start of 2025.\n19. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 65\nOn June 6, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.6775 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend.\nWhile the company didn\u2019t raise its dividend this time around, it has maintained a consistent track record, increasing it for 18 straight years. This steady growth has been supported, in part, by its strong cash position. In the most recent quarter, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) posted solid financial results, with operating cash flow rising to $7.8 billion, up from $7.1 billion in the same period last year. Free cash flow also improved, climbing from $2.7 billion to $3.6 billion.\nChairman and CEO Hans Vestberg made the following comment regarding the company\u2019s dividend policy:\n\u201cAs the nation\u2019s leader in mobility and broadband for consumers and businesses, we create great experiences for a broad and high-quality base of customers. This allows us to continue paying our dividend even in uncertain economic environments, while investing in our business to extend our network leadership, enhance America\u2019s communications infrastructure and meet the present and future needs of all our customers.\u201d\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is maintaining a focused and thoughtful strategy to reach its financial objectives by concentrating on specific customer groups and tailoring its services for a more personalized experience. With a solid financial foundation, the company keeps reinvesting in its operations and advancing innovation to enhance customer service.\nVZ has surged by nearly 10% since the start of 2025.\n18. McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is one of the best Dow stocks to consider. Morgan Stanley suggested that the company may soon start feeling some of the broader challenges affecting the fast food industry. On June 9, the firm downgraded the stock from \u201cOverweight\u201d to \u201cEqual Weight\u201d and lowered its price target from $329 to $324 per share, indicating a potential upside of about 5% from last Friday\u2019s closing price.\nAnalyst Brian Harbour made the following comment:\n\u201cMCD is a top quality business but hasn\u2019t been, and probably will not be, insulated from some structural pressures on fast food.\u201d\nHe further said:\n\u201cYTD, the stock is up 6% and has behaved defensively, 5% off all time highs despite fundamental headwinds for over a year. Simply, we see more balanced risk/reward skew today, weighing MCD\u2019s leadership position in the [quick service restaurant] segment against what we think are some structural headwinds that could continue.\u201d\nThe analyst pointed to economic uncertainty affecting lower-income consumers and changing preferences toward health and wellness as key challenges. While McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) has outperformed its competitors so far, the firm noted that its momentum may begin to taper off.\nMCD is up by nearly 3% since the start of 2025."

      "text": "In this article, we will take a look at the best residential REITs to buy in 2025.\nThe US housing market is most likely to lag through 2025, according to JP Morgan, with home price growth expected to remain below 3%. Existing home sales are at an all-time low, and although inventory is slowly increasing, it\u2019s still below average. While underbuilding is often blamed for supply issues, long-term data suggests that new household formations and housing completions have mostly balanced out over the past 30 years. Even so, home prices are expected to grow modestly. That is largely due to the wealth effect: homeowners with strong equity positions and renters with gains from the stock market are helping sustain prices, despite broader affordability challenges.\nThe U.S. housing market remains stuck in a prolonged slowdown through 2025, with new data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) highlighting ongoing weakness. Business Insider reported that pending home sales dropped 0.8% from May to June and declined 2.8% year-over-year, reflecting continued buyer hesitation. While housing inventory has increased, many sellers are choosing to withdraw listings rather than reduce prices. This has kept home prices at record highs, worsening affordability, particularly for first-time and younger buyers.\nThe real estate sector is under pressure from rising interest rates, increasing construction costs, and stricter regulatory requirements, according to Jonathan Rose, CEO of the Jonathan Rose Companies. Despite these challenges, recent federal legislation has provided developers with renewed support by expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). The bill increases states\u2019 9% credit allocation by 12% and eases financing requirements. These measures are expected to accelerate affordable housing development. While the US still faces a significant housing shortage, estimated at around 10 million units, Rose sees the bill as a meaningful step forward and an opportunity for impact-focused investment.\nHowever, concerns remain over a proposed $27 billion cut to federal rental assistance, which has already prompted some lenders to scale back. Rose remains cautiously optimistic, noting bipartisan support in Congress for affordable housing.\nWith this outlook in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best residential REITs to buy in 2025.\nOur Methodology\nWe used the Finviz stock screener to filter residential REIT stocks. The 10 chosen stocks were some of the best residential REITs that also received positive coverage from Wall Street analysts and mainstream media outlets recently. These stocks were favored by top hedge funds in the first quarter of 2025 as well, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s Q1 2025 database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n10. UMH Properties, Inc. (NYSE:UMH)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 10\nUMH Properties, Inc. (NYSE:UMH) is one of the best residential REITs to buy. In the beginning of July, UMH revealed operating results for the second quarter of 2025. The REIT made progress in both operations and finances, turning 188 homes from its inventory into rental units that now generate income. This brought the total number of rental homes to around 10,600, with a high occupancy rate of 94.4% in Q2. In addition, UMH\u2019s same-property occupancy rose by 76 units during the second quarter and by 251 units over the past year, reaching 88.2%.\nUMH Properties, Inc. (NYSE:UMH) also saw a boost in home sales, with gross sales revenue increasing to $10.3 million, up from $8.8 million last year. Given the higher occupancy and rent increases throughout 2024 and into 2025, same-property rental and related charges for July 2025 rose by 9.2% compared to July 2024. Overall rental and related charges for the second quarter came in at $55.9 million, up 8.5% from $51.5 million the year before.\nUMH also refinanced ten of its communities, which have about 2,000 sites, under a Fannie Mae credit facility. This refinancing provided $101.4 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.855%. The certified appraisal valued these properties at $163.5 million or about $82,000 per site. Since UMH invested $66.6 million in these communities, their value has gone up by about $96.9 million, or 146%, which shows the properties have appreciated a lot.\nThe company also sold around 1.8 million shares of common stock through its At-the-Market program. These shares sold at an average price of $17.60, raising about $31.0 million in total.\nPresident and CEO of UMH Properties, Samuel A. Landy, commented:\n\u201cOur communities continue to experience strong demand which we are converting into occupied sites through our rental home and sales programs. We are proud to announce that our second quarter sales set a new quarterly sales record.\u201d\nUMH Properties, Inc. (NYSE:UMH) is a real estate investment trust that was founded in 1968. It owns and operates manufactured home communities across 12 states, with around 26,000+ homesites, including rental homes and self-storage units."

Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy?
