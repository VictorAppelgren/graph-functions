  "title": "Judge Strikes Down Florida Book Ban Law",
  "description": "\"None of these books are obscene\"",
  "content": "In 2023, Florida\u2019s legislators passed HB 1069, a bill that allowed for the removal from schools of any book that \u201cdepicts or describes sexual conduct,\" requiring the book to be pulled from the school once an objection was filed by any county resident. It also protected the right to read excerpts from challenged works at board meetings.\n\nThe law is vague and broad and included no room for considering the literary merit of the work, and so the result was a wave of book bans across the state. One district banned the Maurice Sendak classic \u201cIn The Night Kitchen\u201d because one illustration includes a boys bare butt. The Orange County Sentinel reported on an astonishing list of 673 books that Orange County Schools pulled. The list includes popular authors like John Green and Stephen King as well as classics such as the plays of Aristophenes and John Milton\u2019s epic Paradise Lost.\n\nSix publishers, the Author\u2019s Guild, five suthors, two students, and two parents filed suit against the law in 2024, and a decision was issued by Judge Carlos Mendoza of the U.S. Middle District Court of Florida on August 13.\n\nMendoza landed heavily in favor of the plaintiffs, finding several problems with the law.\n\nOne is that the law is so very broad and severe that it gave extraordinary power to any resident of the school district. As Mendoza notes, \"The vagueness of the provisions only serves to expand their sweep.\" What counts as a depiction of sexual conduct, exactly? By allowing \u201cI\u2019ll know it when I see it\u201d to be the sole standard for a book\u2019s banworthy status, Mendoza noted, the law \u201cwould unconstitutionally empower those who would limit speech to arbitrarily enforce the law.\u201d In other words, a school district could be at the mercy of a single extreme individual. Just a few months after HB 1069 was passed, the Tampa Bay Times reported that over half of the book challenges filed in Florida came from just two individuals. One man in Clay County challenged hundreds of books.\n\nMendoza notes that obscene materials are already illegal for school libraries.\n\nDefendants also attempted to argue that removal of books was a sort of protected government speech. But Mendoza points out that the case is not talking about a librarian curating a collection as an agent of the government, but about the application of a blanket rule constructed in such a way that the bans are parental speech, not government.\n\n[T]he statute here mandates the removal of books that contain even a single reference to the prohibited subject matter, regardless of the holistic value of the book individually or as part of a larger collection. Moreover, many removals at issue here are the objecting parents\u2019 speech, not the government\u2019s.\n\nParents certainly have the right to object to \u201cdirect the upbringing and education of children,\u201d but the government cannot \u201crepackage their speech and pass it off as its own.\u201d\n\nMendoza points to the Miller Test, guidelines for obscenity cases that offer three prongs. First, would the work as whole be seen as prurient by an ordinary person using community standards. Second, does the work describe the sexual material in an offensive way. Third, does the work lack any scientific, literary, artistic, or political merit. In the Miller Test, all three prongs must be met to qualify a work as obscene. Mendoza finds the Florida law lacking, especially when it comes to considering the work as a whole.\n\nOn question of obscenity, Mendoza finds the law failing:\n\nPlaintiffs have established multiple unconstitutional applications of the\n\nstatutory provisions at issue. The following books, among others, have been\n\nremoved: The Color Purple, Half of a Yellow Sun, Cloud Atlas, The Splendid and\n\nthe Vile, I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter, The Freedom Writers Diary:\n\nHow a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them, On the Road, Nineteen Minutes, Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska, How the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents, The Kite Runner, Slaughterhouse-Five, Shout, Last Night at the Telegraph Club, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Native Son, Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth\u2019s Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa, Water for Elephants, Beloved, Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye, and Homegoing. None of these books are obscene.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what comes next. The administration of Governor Ron DeSantis has not yet commented on the ruling, but an appeal seems likely. In the meantime, do school districts need to return books that have been fremoved under this law (or, in some cases, in anticipation of threats under this law)?",

      "text": "Woods: Clay County parent targets Captain Underpants, Stephen King and \"120 Banned Books\"\nThere\u2019s a copy of a book called \u201c120 Banned Books\u201d in the library at Orange Park High School. Or at least it has been there in the past.\nIf one Clay County parent has his way, when nearly 40,000 students return to the county\u2019s public schools next month none of them will be able to go to a school library and find a copy of \u201c120 Banned Books\u201d \u2014 a book that traces the censorship histories of everything from \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d to \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d the Bible and the Harry Potter series.\nBeyond that, if one parent has his way, none of Clay County\u2019s K-8 students will be able to read \u201cCaptain Underpants and the Sensational Saga of Sir Stink-A-Lot\u201d at their schools, and none of Clay County\u2019s high school students will be able to find four of Stephen King\u2019s books in their school libraries.\nThis summer Bruce Friedman has filed formal challenges with the school district for dozens of books.\nOn each challenge form, when asked to give a reason for the request, Friedman wrote: \u201cProtect Children!!\u201d\nAnd in each case, when asked what he believes could be the result of a student reading this material, he wrote two words in all caps: \u201cDAMAGED SOULS.\u201d\n'We'll take them down one book at a time'\nThis is a continuation of what Friedman started doing last year, not long after moving from New York to Northeast Florida and becoming president of the Florida chapter of No Left Turn in Education.\nDuring the last school year, Friedman told a Florida Department of Education group tasked with recommending library rules that he had compiled a list of 3,600 books that contained \u201cconcerning content.\u201d He said that, because of such content, he prohibited his son from going to his high school library.\n\u201cOur libraries have more than a little poison in them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s porn, critical race theory, social-emotional learning, fluid gender. Pick your poison. None of it is OK for my boy.\u201d\nHe told the group to \u201cclean up this mess or like I\u2019m doing locally, we\u2019ll take them down one book at a time.\u201d\nFriedman spent quite a bit of time during the school year trying to do that \u2014 and, to a certain degree, he and others around the state succeeded.\nState laws passed by the Florida Legislature and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis made it easier for parents (or even community members who aren\u2019t parents) to challenge books. Not only did this lead to an increase in book challenges across the state, when coupled with the fear of repercussions, it led districts to \u201cdeselect\u201d some books on their own, removing them from circulation.\nClay County ended up with more than 400 titles on its \u201creconsideration list\u201d last school year \u2014 and more than 90 percent of the challenges were filed by Friedman.\nThese challenges, at least temporarily, removed these books from shelves. Per state statute, when books are challenged, they must be removed within seven days. Once books are reviewed, they either go back on the shelf or they\u2019re removed for good.\nThis process, of course, takes time and money. A Clay County district spokesperson said that on average, individuals have been spending about 25 hours a week handling challenges. Last school year, after reviews, hundreds of challenged books returned to shelves. But more than 100 ended up with their status as \u201cremove from ALL libraries.\u201d And at least 50 more were either \u201cdeselected\u201d or \u201cweeded,\u201d including Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved\u201d and Khaled Hosseini\u2019s \u201cThe Kite Runner.\u201d\nNot that this led Friedman to take the summer off from his mission to create what he has described as \u201cclean\u201d school libraries.\nAs of a few days ago, Clay County had received 45 book challenges this summer \u2014 all from, according to the district, one individual.\nTrying to ban book about banned books\nThe latest challenges included \u201c120 Banned Books: Censorship Histories of World Literature.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I recognize the irony here,\u201d Friedman wrote.\nWhen prompted on the form to answer whether this book violates F.S. Chapter 847 regarding Obscenity \u2014 a 2022 state law about exposing minors to harmful materials \u2014 he circled \u201cyes\u201d and added \u201cof course.\u201d\n\u201cThere is often good reason to keep a book away from a child,\u201d he added. \u201cThis book is (by its name) filled with such horrors.\u201d\nSpeaking of horrors, his most-challenged author this summer was Stephen King.\nAbout \u201cApt Pupil,\u201d Friedman wrote, \u201cIT\u2019S PORN.\u201d He attached pages with examples of explicit descriptions in it and, in several other challenges of King's books, \u201cCarrie,\u201d \u201cElevation\u201d and \u201cIt.\u201d\nHe wrote that King is \u201cprolific and problematic\u201d and, at the end of one of these submissions, concluded: \u201cPlease consider removing ALL Stephen King from our schools.\u201d\nA sample of some of the other challenges:\n\u2014 \u201cCaptain Underpants and the Sensational Saga of Sir Stinks-A-Lot,\u201d by Dav Pilkey.\nAfter giving the usual reason for the challenge (\u201cProtect Children!\u201d) and feared repercussions of exposing students to it (\u201cDAMAGED SOULS\u201d), he provided the specifics about what he says is objectionable about the 12th and final book in this wildly popular series \u2014 \u201cPage 111, Harold and his husband.\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cHatchet,\u201d by Gary Paulsen.\nA wilderness survival novel about a 13-year-old son of divorced parents, traveling on a small plane to Canada to spend the summer with his father, the pilot suffering a heart attack, the plane crashing. The book was awarded a 1986 Newbery \u2013 a fact Friedman criticized in his challenge, calling the American Library Association honor \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d\nIn this case, Friedman circled \u201cno\u201d about the obscenity law, adding that there are \u201cother concerns\u201d in the boy\u2019s story \u2014 \u201cwith a suicide attempt, secrets, parental infidelity, divorce \u2026 airplane pilots\u2019 fish-eaten/decomposed head, self-harm (cutting).\u201d\n\u2014 \u201cAmerican Street,\u201d by Ibi Zoboi\nReviews of the 2017 National Book Award finalist describe it as the gritty and haunting tale of a Haitian teenage immigrant. Friedman said it is not fit for Clay County high school or junior high students because of \u201cCRT/racism/anti-police, drugs, dealing, overdose, prostitution, violence, homelessness.\u201d\nIn his challenges for the 45 books, he noted graphic accounts of violence, sex, rape, child abuse, and numerous other potentially disturbing scenarios \u2014 which also is what a South Florida rabbi cited when, to make a point about book banning, he recently challenged one book: the Bible.\nWhen the new bills were passed last year, the governor\u2019s office said this isn\u2019t about banning books. It\u2019s about preserving \u201cthe rights of parents to make decisions about what materials their children are exposed to in school.\u201d\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Some parents want their children exposed to the books that are being challenged and, in some cases, removed. Some parents are happy that their kids are gobbling up John Green books (among those targeted in Green\u2019s hometown of Orlando). Some parents are glad their kids get excited about at a young age by reading James Patterson\u2019s \u201cMaximum Ride\u201d series (among the books challenged last spring by a Moms for Liberty member in Stuart County).\nTwenty of Jodi Picoult\u2019s books also were challenged in Martin County, described as \u201cadult romance.\u201d\nPicoult responded by saying she was surprised to see her work described that way \u2014 particularly \u201cThe Storyteller,\u201d which chronicles the growth of anti-Semitism and facism in Nazi Germany.\nBut beyond that, she made a broader point \u2014 one that some parents keep sharing, posting on social media.\n\u201cThere is absolutely nothing wrong with a parent deciding a certain book is not right for her child. There is a colossal problem with a parent deciding that, therefore, no child should be allowed to read that book.\u201d \u2013 Jodi Picoult\nAmong the books a parent has decided no child should be allowed to read in Clay County schools: \u201cPicture Perfect,\u201d by Jodi Picoult.\n\u201cRepeat offender,\u201d Friedman wrote in his latest batch of challenges.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that last year Clay County offered an \u201cindividualized\u201d school library access plan, giving parents a variety of ways to control or monitor what their children read \u2014 everything from receiving emails about books their children checked out to completely banning library access.\nThat wasn\u2019t what Friedman and others around the state were looking for when talking about parental rights.\nHe hasn\u2019t just decided no child in Clay County public schools should be allowed to read \u201c120 Banned Books.\u201d He has decided to try to ban hundreds of books from schools, to keep them out of the hands of tens of thousands of other parents' children.\nmwoods@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4212"

      "text": "The topics came up again and again in hundreds of book complaints received by Florida school districts over the last year. Indoctrination. Pedophilia. The LGBTQ+ agenda. Those who submitted the complaints say the books in question can harm children, and they want them removed from school libraries.But while their movement has grabbed headlines, it may not be widespread. Most of Florida\u2019s 67 school districts didn\u2019t log a single formal complaint about a book. That\u2019s based on a Tampa Bay Times analysis, the most comprehensive review of book complaints across the state.Of the roughly 1,100 complaints recorded in Florida since July 2022, more than 700 came from two counties \u2014 Escambia in the western Panhandle and Clay near Jacksonville. Together the two districts make up less than 3% of the state\u2019s total public school enrollment.About 600 of the complaints came from two people \u2014 a Clay County dad and an Escambia County high school teacher.The data illustrates how a tiny minority of activists across the state can overwhelm school districts while shaping the national conversation over what books belong on school library shelves.The Times requested all book complaints received by Florida school districts since July 1, 2022, when guidelines governing the challenges went into effect. Sixty-two districts responded, representing nearly 99% of public school students.The law required districts to report complaints to the Florida Department of Education no later than June 30. The data, once compiled by the state, is intended as a reference for school districts to consider as they decide which books to keep. The complaints reviewed by the Times involve 680 books by more than 480 authors.The state\u2019s 10 largest districts, including Hillsborough, Pinellas and Pasco, each reported complaints on fewer than 15 titles.Bruce Friedman, a 57-year-old New York City transplant, is responsible for more than 400 complaints received by the Clay County school district. He told Fox News that his interest in education stems from the \u201cconsiderable harm\u201d done to his now-15-year-old son while attending New York\u2019s public schools.He founded the Florida chapter of No Left Turn in Education, which opposes \u201cprogressive indoctrination\u201d in schools, after watching a segment about the group on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show.Friedman garnered his own appearance on Fox News after his mic was cut at a November school board meeting as he prepared to read a passage from \u201cLucky,\u201d Alice Sebold\u2019s 1999 memoir of her own sexual assault.Since then, Friedman said he has spent hundreds of hours combing through a database of more than 5,000 titles scoured from the internet and filing complaints for those he finds objectionable. He declined to be interviewed for this story.Many of Friedman\u2019s written complaints provide little more explanation than \u201cProtect Children!\u201d and \u201cDamaged Souls!\u201d Some of his filed complaints appear to be direct photocopies with only the title and authors changed, the Times found.\u201cWe have probably spent more resources on Bruce than anyone else in the history of the school district,\u201d said Roger Dailey, Clay County\u2019s assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction. He said Friedman contacts the district nearly every day. Dailey received two messages from Friedman while on a phone call with the Times.\u201cI\u2019ve had weeks totally hijacked by this book thing,\u201d said Dailey, who personally reviews each of the complaints received by the school district \u2014 a task that typically takes 10 to 15 hours per week.More staffing would help, but the budget is tight and few would want the job anyway, Dailey said. Whatever his decision on a book complaint, he said he\u2019s branded as either a \u201cjack-booted censor\u201d or an enabler who put the \u201cbad book back on the shelf.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a responsibility I feel comfortable delegating,\u201d he said.Dailey conceded that Friedman has found objectively problematic books, clearly in violation of state law. As a parent of three, he said he often gets where Friedman is coming from.The district removed 181 titles as of June 30, including \u201cWatchmen,\u201d Alan Moore\u2019s 1986 graphic novel depicting often ultraviolent and morally ambiguous superheroes.But recent complaints have gotten harder to comprehend, Dailey said. Friedman filed one against the children\u2019s picture book \u201cArthur,\u201d complaining that it depicted a game of \u201cspin the bottle.\u201dBook challenges like that \u201cundermine Bruce\u2019s credibility,\u201d Dailey said. \u201cIt makes you wonder what would satisfy someone who takes umbrage with those titles.\u201dMost frustrating to Dailey is that removing even clearly inappropriate books addresses a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. Most parents have zero interest in the subject, he said. When the district of 39,000 students allowed parents to limit library access for their kids last year, only six opted to.\u201cThe circulation of these books for high school kids is essentially zero,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish we had a problem of kids reading so many books that they\u2019re coming across problematic subjects. And it breaks my heart to say that.\u201dIn Escambia County, flanked on the north and west by Alabama, high school teacher Vicki Baggett has submitted at least 178 complaints, accounting for 80% of those reported by the district.Some of Baggett\u2019s complaints include some \u201cpretty adult stuff,\u201d said Pensacola Methodist pastor Rick Branch, a frequent school board attendee who supports library access. It\u2019s worth discussing which books should be reserved for older students, he said, but many of Baggett\u2019s complaints amount to vague allegations of \u201cindoctrination.\u201dBaggett did not respond to multiple requests for comment.In her complaint against \u201cAnd Tango Makes Three,\u201d a children\u2019s picture book about two male penguins in the Central Park Zoo who raise an adopted hatchling, Baggett wrote that the story promoted an \u201cLGBTQ agenda using penguins.\u201dThe mostly white and working-class county in the stretch of coast locals call \u201cFloribama\u201d is deeply religious and very conservative, Branch said. But Baggett is still an extreme minority, he added, garnering more annoyance than approval among even the county\u2019s most traditional-values Republicans.Baggett\u2019s supporters equate books like \u201cTango\u201d with putting Playboy magazines in elementary schools, Branch said. \u201cI think they are completely misunderstanding what the issue is, maybe intentionally.\u201dOn each of her 178 complaints, Baggett indicated she had read \u201cthe material in its entirety.\u201d But the Times found that language in many of the complaints appears to be pulled from reviews published by the website BookLooks.org , which flags titles for \u201cobjectionable content, including profanity, nudity, and sexual content.\u201dAccording to a state filing, the website was launched last year by Emily Maikisch, a member of Moms for Liberty, an increasingly influential group that has been active in the movement to challenge books. BookLooks.org claims no affiliation with Moms for Liberty and does not support book bans, according to its website.The line between what is objectionable and what are grounds to remove a book isn\u2019t difficult, said Dailey, the Clay County assistant superintendent. The definition of obscene content is clearly laid out in Florida statute 847.012 , which describes it as any \u201cvisual representation or image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts nudity or sexual conduct, sexual excitement, sexual battery, bestiality, or sadomasochistic abuse and which is harmful to minors.\u201dWhile the 2022 \u201cParental Rights in Education\u201d bill bars any discussion of gender or sexuality in classroom instruction, that does not extend to the library, Dailey said.But ambiguous legislation, overwrought rhetoric and even willful ignorance has so muddled the discourse around books that both sides tend to conflate the laws to suit their own interests, he said.Straying from a strict adherence to the laws can have consequences.In Escambia County, the school board\u2019s decision to repeatedly overrule the district\u2019s own media specialists is the basis of a lawsuit from free-speech advocate PEN America and Penguin Random House , the nation\u2019s largest book publisher. The suit, filed in May, alleges that books \u201csingled out for possible removal are disproportionately books by non-white and/or LGBTQ authors, which address topics related to race or LGBTQ identity.\u201dWhile books discussing race and LGBTQ+ issues have captured headlines, a large share of complaints submitted to school districts targeted titles with explicit violence, sex and drug use, records show.\u201cSold\u201d by Patricia McCormick received complaints in 11 districts. The book tells the story of a 13-year-old Nepali girl who is sold by her family into sexual slavery. Multiple complaints cited passages depicting her rape and abuse at the hands of her captors.McCormick did not respond to a request for comment. But in a May op-ed in The New York Times she wrote that banning her book is \u201cdisrespectful to the teenagers who want and in some cases need to read it.\u201dThe depictions of sexual violence in the book were not meant to \u201carouse\u201d or \u201cstimulate\u201d readers, she said, citing her research interviewing abused women and girls in India and Nepal, as well as her own experience with assault.Novelist Ellen Hopkins said in an interview that she\u2019s used to receiving complaints about her books but had not been called a pedophile until recently. Parents would occasionally call or email with concerns, she said. \u201cNow you have people who\u2019ve never read the book showing up at school board meetings making all kinds of crazy accusations.\u201dHopkins\u2019 books received 66 complaints across 18 titles in 13 Florida counties, records show. Her novel \u201cTricks,\u201d which follows five teenagers who fall into prostitution, received complaints in 10 districts and was banned or restricted in at least five.Her 2004 novel \u201cCrank,\u201d loosely based on her daughter\u2019s addiction to crystal meth, received complaints in nine districts and was banned or restricted in at least four.Most of the complaints against Hopkins\u2019 books reviewed by the Times point to depictions of drug use, violence and teenage sex. Their graphic nature is meant to help kids make better decisions by showing them consequences of bad choices, Hopkins said.At the end of every book is a page listing resources where kids can get help, she added. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to tens of thousands of kids,\u201d she said, \u201cand I know my books help people.\u201dWhile most districts received no book complaints during the 12 months starting in July 2022, there are other ways to make books disappear.Administrators and school boards across the state reported selectively \u201cweeding\u201d controversial titles from libraries, citing lack of circulation or poor condition of the books.The Lake County schools system received only one objection, but district officials \u201cadministratively removed\u201d 22 books in the past year, according to spokesperson Sherri Owens.In Flagler County, at least nine titles were weeded before receiving a complaint, records show. The district did not provide a full list of books removed and did not give a reason for those decisions.In March, St. Lucie Superintendent Jon Prince pulled the graphic novel \u201cGender Queer\u201d by Maia Kobabe after Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized the book in a news conference.School districts are overly cautious when facing ambiguous directives from the state, said Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education programs at the free-speech organization PEN America.That environment of uncertainty empowers activists like Bruce Friedman and Vicki Baggett to lodge book complaints, he said. Administrators can either restrict access to controversial books to preempt or mollify activists, or face the overwhelming task of reviewing and processing potentially hundreds of complaints.Rather than trusting librarians and media specialists, he said, many counties have given way to a vocal minority, effectively banning books without expert input and with little transparency or accountability.Without guidance and clarification from state lawmakers, districts will remain in deadlock. And Escambia County isn\u2019t the only district that halted their deliberations in the face of an overwhelming volume of complaints.In Jefferson County, all school media are closed until the district can inventory the catalog, said Superintendent Eydie Triquet. Santa Rosa County quarantined all books that received a complaint, according to the district\u2019s website.Hillsborough County has received only two formal complaints: \u201cThis Book is Gay\u201d by Juno Dawson, which the school board voted to remove from middle schools in March , and \u201cBeing a Girl\u201d by Hayley Long, which they kept. That excludes dozens of informal complaints submitted by the group Citizens Defending Freedom in Hillsborough.Despite the group\u2019s claims that the district had \u201cquarantined\u201d controversial books, the district\u2019s policy is to keep books available until the board makes a ruling, district spokesperson Tanya Arja said.As complaints pile up and districts remain in deadlock, specialists like Michelle White have had enough.White, who left her job as Escambia County\u2019s media service coordinator in June, said the lack of guidance and school boards\u2019 constant overruling of specialist recommendations made her work at the district untenable.One of her last recommendations to the board was to cover library shelves with black paper until specialists could review the more than 100,000 titles in the district\u2019s 49 schools. When students arrived for the first day of class earlier this month, the libraries were closed. ( Editor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly reported the home city of teacher Vicki Baggett and the publication date for \u201cLucky\u201d by Alice Sebold. In both instances, correct information has been added.)"

Page 2 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 3 of 50 PageID 1114 I. BACKGROUND When J.H., a junior at an Orange County public high school, went to the school library to check out On the Road by Jack Kerouac, it was nowhere to be found. (J.H. Decl., Doc. 107-58, at 3). It was not checked out; it had been removed from the shelves. (Id.). The same thing happened to R.K., a senior at a Volusia County public high school, who tried to check out The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. (R.K. Decl., Doc. 107-57, at 3). Other removed books include Looking for Alaska by John Green, Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas, How the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents by Julia Alvarez, and Shout by Laurie Halse Anderson. (Doc. 107-21 at 2 (Green); Doc. 107-41 at 4 (Picoult); Doc. 107-41 at 3 (Thomas); Doc. 107-15 at 39 (Alvarez); Doc. 107-23 at 8 (Halse Anderson)). These books were removed from the shelves\u2014not because school librarians had, using their expertise, deemed them unsuitable for children but because fragments of their content were prohibited under HB 1069. H.R. 1069, 2023 Leg., 125th Reg. Sess. (Fla. 2023). The bill amended section 1006.28 of the Florida Statutes. Id. The relevant portions of the statute are set forth below with the sections added by HB 1069 italicized. Each district school board must adopt a policy regarding an objection by a parent or a resident of the county to the use of a specific material, which clearly describes a process to handle all objections and provides for Page 3 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 4 of 50 PageID 1115 resolution. The objection form, as prescribed by State Board of Education rule, and the district school board\u2019s process must be easy to read and understand and be easily accessible on the homepage of the school district\u2019s website. The objection form must also identify the school district point of contact and contact information for the submission of an objection. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2. (emphasis added as to amended language). Relevant here, parents may object to any material \u201cmade available in a school or classroom library\u201d containing content that: (I) Is pornographic or prohibited under s. 847.012; (II) Depicts or describes sexual conduct as defined in s. 847.001(19), unless such material is for a course required by s. 1003.46 or s. 1003.42(2)(o)1.g. or 3., or identified by State Board of Education rule; Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2.b. (emphasis added as to amended language). \u201cAny material that is subject to an objection on the basis of sub-sub-subparagraph b.(I) or sub-sub-subparagraph b.(II) must be removed within 5 school days after receipt of the objection and remain unavailable to students of that school until the objection is resolved.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). The statute also requires the district school boards themselves \u201cdiscontinue use of the [proscribed] material\u201d if they find in contains the above prohibited content. Id. Pursuant to the statute, State Defendants promulgated the Template Objection Form, in which the text relevant here \u201cmust not be modified by school districts.\u201d Fla. Admin. Code r. 6A-7.0714. Among the bases on which a parent may object, the Page 4 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 5 of 50 PageID 1116 Template Objection Form lists the following: \u201c[t]he material is pornographic\u201d; \u201c[t]he material is prohibited under Section 847.012, F.S.\u201d; and \u201c[t]he material depicts or describes sexual conduct as defined in Section 847.001(19), F.S.\u201d (Specific Material Objection Template, Doc. 107-59, at 3). Plaintiffs include book publishers (Penguin Random House LLC, Hachette Book Group, Inc., HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Macmillan Publishing Group, LLC, Simon & Schuster, LLC, and Sourcebooks LLC (collectively, \u201cPublisher Plaintiffs\u201d)) and authors (Julia Alvarez, John Green, Laurie Halse Anderson, Jodi Picoult, and Angie Thomas (collectively, \u201cAuthor Plaintiffs\u201d)) whose books have been removed from school libraries through this process, as well as The Authors Guild, which is a non-profit professional association for authors. Plaintiffs also include parents (Heidi Kellogg and Judith Anne Hayes (\u201cParent Plaintiffs\u201d)), bringing claims on behalf of their children who are students that were unable to access books from school libraries due to their removal. Plaintiffs bring seven counts seeking declaratory relief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, against Defendants. Counts I, IV, and VII challenge the prohibition of material that \u201cdescribes sexual conduct\u201d as an overbroad content-based restriction in violation of the First Amendment. These are brought against State Defendants, Volusia County Defendants, and Orange County Defendants, respectively. Counts II and V seek a declaration that the term \u201cpornographic\u201d is synonymous with Page 5 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 6 of 50 PageID 1117 \u201charmful to minors\u201d against State Defendants and Volusia County Defendants, respectively. Counts III and VI\u2014which are pled in the alternative to Counts II and V, respectively\u2014assert that if the term \u201cpornographic\u201d is not synonymous with \u201charmful to minors,\u201d then the prohibition of material that is \u201cpornographic\u201d is an overbroad content-based restriction in violation of the First Amendment. These counts are also brought against State Defendants and Volusia County Defendants, respectively. (See generally Compl., Doc. 1). The Court previously denied State Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss. (Doc. 106). Plaintiffs, State Defendants, and School Board Defendants all move for summary judgment. II. LEGAL STANDARD \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute is genuine \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A fact is material if it may \u201caffect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\u201d Id. \u201cThe moving party bears the initial burden of showing the court, by reference to materials on file, that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided at trial.\u201d Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Educ., 495 F.3d 1306, 1313\u201314 (11th Cir. 2007). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court construes the facts Page 6 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 7 of 50 PageID 1118 and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000). But when faced with a \u201cproperly supported motion for summary judgment,\u201d the nonmoving party \u201cmust come forward with specific factual evidence, presenting more than mere allegations.\u201d Gargiulo v. G.M. Sales, Inc., 131 F.3d 995, 999 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248\u201349 (1986)); see also LaRoche v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., 62 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 1371 (S.D. Fla. 1999) (\u201cThe law is clear . . . that suspicion, perception, opinion, and belief cannot be used to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u201d). \u201c[A]t the summary judgment stage the judge\u2019s function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. \u201c[T]he proper inquiry on summary judgment is \u2018whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d Stitzel v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 361 F. App\u2019x 20, 22 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251\u201352). Put another way, a motion for summary judgment should be denied only \u201c[i]f reasonable minds could differ on the inferences arising from undisputed [material] facts.\u201d Pioch v. IBEX Eng\u2019g Servs., 825 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Allen v. Tyson Foods Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997). Page 7 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 8 of 50 PageID 1119 III. ANALYSIS A. Article III Standing Article III standing is a \u201cbedrock constitutional requirement,\u201d United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023), and it is Plaintiffs\u2019 burden to establish standing, Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014). \u201c[A] plaintiff must demonstrate (i) that she has suffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact, (ii) that the injury likely was caused or will be caused by the defendant, and (iii) that the injury likely would be redressed by the requested judicial relief.\u201d FDA v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024). \u201cWhen First Amendment protections are implicated, [courts] apply \u2018most loosely\u2019 the injury-in-fact requirement \u2018lest free speech be chilled.\u2019\u201d Dana\u2019s R.R. Supply v. Att\u2019y Gen., Fla., 807 F.3d 1235, 1241 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting Harrell v. The Fla. Bar, 608 F.3d 1241, 1253\u201357 (11th Cir. 2010)). \u201cThe second and third standing requirements\u2014causation and redressability\u2014are often \u2018flip sides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d FDA, 602 U.S. at 380\u201381 (quoting Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co. v. APCC Servs., Inc., 554 U. S. 269, 288 (2008)). This means a judgment against a defendant who causes an injury is likely to redress that injury. See id. at 381. Here, the four sets of plaintiffs\u2014Parent Plaintiffs, Publisher Plaintiffs, Author Plaintiffs, and The Authors Guild\u2014must establish all three prongs of the standing inquiry, and The Authors Guild, an organization, must meet further requirements as outlined below. Page 8 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 9 of 50 PageID 1120 First, injury in fact. Parent Plaintiffs sue on behalf of their minor children who have tried to access books that were removed from their school libraries, alleging a violation of the right to receive information. (Kellogg Decl., Doc. 107-55, at 2\u20133; Hayes Decl., Doc. 107-56, at 2\u20133). The right to receive information is protected by the First Amendment. See Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969). This right \u201ccomes from both the sender\u2019s right to provide it and the receiver\u2019s own rights under the First Amendment.\u201d Pernell v. Fla. Bd. of Governors of the State Univ. Sys., 641 F. Supp. 3d 1218, 1244 (N.D. Fla. 2022). Under this right, the Supreme Court \u201cha[s] identified a cognizable injury only where the listener has a concrete, specific connection to the speaker.\u201d Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 75 (2024) (citing Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 762 (1972)). Unlike in Murthy, where the plaintiffs could \u201cnot point to any specific instance of content moderation that caused them identifiable harm,\u201d here, the parents have identified removals of specific books that their children sought to access. Id.; (Doc. 107-55 at 3; Doc. 107-56 at 3); see also ACLU of Fla., Inc. v. Mia.-Dade Cnty. Sch. Bd., 557 F.3d 1177, 1195 (11th Cir. 2009) (finding parent had standing to sue on behalf of his child over the removal of a particular school library book). Each Author Plaintiff has had at least one of their books removed from the shelves, which prevents them from reaching their target audience. (Alvarez Decl., Doc. 107-50, at 6; Green Decl., Doc. 107-51, at 5; Anderson Decl., Doc. 107-52, at Page 9 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 10 of 50 PageID 1121 6; Picoult Decl., Doc. 107-53, at 4\u20135; Thomas Decl., Doc. 107-54, at 7\u20139). Likewise, the same harm has been suffered by Publisher Plaintiffs, which have all had at least one book they published be removed. (Skye Decl., Doc. 107-2, at 5). Their speech has thus been chilled, establishing an injury in fact. Second, causation. State and School Board Defendants point fingers at each other. But it is apparent both sets of Defendants caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Indeed, it is School Board Defendants that remove the books on the local level. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2.b. But the Template Objection Form itself is \u201cprescribed by State Board of Education rule,\u201d so Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries can be readily traced back to State Defendants. Id. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2. Moreover, State Defendants also have final reviewing authority over removal decisions. Id. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)6. And if School Board Defendants fail to adequately comply with the statute, the State Defendants may penalize them. See id. \u00a7 1012.796; Fla. Admin. Code r.6A-10.081. Third, redressability. State Defendants argue that a declaration against them will not bind School Board Defendants and will ultimately be ineffectual. On the other hand, School Board Defendants argue that a declaration against them will not cause any removed books to be reshelved, they are powerless to change the Template Objection Form, and they do not interpret the statute. But that is not quite right. Counts I, III, IV, VI, and VII seek to declare portions of the statute unconstitutional. A finding against State Defendants would require the Template Page 10 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 11 of 50 PageID 1122 Objection Form be altered. A finding against School Board Defendants, as they correctly note, would not. Contrary to their assertion though, if they do not reshelve the books removed under the provisions at issue, they will have removed the books on unconstitutional grounds. School Board Defendants are also incorrect that they do not interpret the statute. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2. (\u201cIf the district school board finds that . . . any other material contains prohibited content under sub-sub-subparagraph b.(I), the school district shall discontinue use of the material. If the district school board finds that any other material contains prohibited content under sub-sub- subparagraphs b.(II)-(IV), the school district shall discontinue use of the material for any grade level or age group for which such use is inappropriate or unsuitable.\u201d). These findings require interpretation of the statutory language to determine what \u201cdescribes sexual conduct\u201d and what is \u201cpornographic.\u201d This interpretive power brings the Court to Counts II and V, which ask the Court to construe the statute in a way that saves it but deems the interpretation advanced by the Template Objection Form unconstitutional. A finding against State Defendants on Count II\u2014that \u201cpornographic\u201d is synonymous with \u201charmful to minors\u201d\u2014does not necessitate a change in the form. It requires a change in the way the form is interpreted. That is where Count V is also necessary. If bound by Count V, School Board Defendants that removed books under an incongruous reading Page 11 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 12 of 50 PageID 1123 would be required to reshelve those books and be bound by the interpretation. Thus, Publisher, Author, and Parent Plaintiffs have all established standing to bring their claims. Finally, The Authors Guild is an organization and asserts it has standing as a representative of its members. See Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 199 (2023). \u201cTo invoke [organizational standing], an organization must demonstrate that \u2018(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)). The Authors Guild counts Author Plaintiffs John Green, Jodi Picoult, and Angie Thomas among its members. (Rasenberger Decl., Doc. 107-49, at 3). Given the authors have standing, the first prong is met. As for the second prong, it seeks to protect interests germane to its purpose because the organization \u201cserves as a collective voice of American authors and has long supported the rich and diverse literary culture of our country.\u201d (Id. at 2). \u201cCensorship efforts obstruct the right to read and publish freely by suppressing free speech and freedom of expression and by making it harder for authors to sell copies of their work\u201d and thus earn their livelihood. (Id. at 3). These claims also do not require the participation of each Page 12 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 13 of 50 PageID 1124 member because The Authors Guild only seeks declaratory relief that does not require individualized proof. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515 (1975) (\u201cIf in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that the remedy, if granted, will inure to the benefit of those members of the association actually injured.\u201d). The Author\u2019s Guild has established standing. B. Eleventh Amendment Defendants renew their argument that Counts II and V, which seek a declaration that the term \u201cpornographic\u201d is synonymous with \u201charmful to minors,\u201d are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. First, they argue that the Declaratory Judgment Act does not create a standalone cause of action. Second, they assert any declaration as to how a state statute is interpreted violates the Eleventh Amendment because it directs that the state to conform to state law. As this Court has explained, Count II and V seek \u201cneither an advisory opinion nor relief that violates the Eleventh Amendment\u201d because \u201cthe declaratory relief sought would resolve the case or controversy [as to the alleged First Amendment violations] before the Court,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny declaration issued would ultimately instruct State Defendants on how to conform their conduct to the restrictions imposed by the First Amendment.\u201d (Doc. 106 at 12\u201314). The Court will briefly review. Page 13 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 14 of 50 PageID 1125 The Declaratory Judgment Act provides that \u201c[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, . . . any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. The controversy must \u201cadmi[t] of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u201d MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 127 (2007) (alteration in original) (quoting Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937)). Plaintiffs seek a declaration that \u201cState Defendants\u2019 construction of the term \u2018pornographic\u2019 under [s]ection 1006.28 infringes on the First Amendment rights of publishers, authors, parents, and students\u2014including Plaintiffs\u2014there is sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment finding that the term \u2018pornographic\u2019 as used in [s]ection 1006.28 is synonymous with the term \u2018harmful to minors.\u2019\u201d (Doc. 1 at 68 (Count II); see id. at 81 (Count V against Volusia County Defendants for their enforcement of the interpretation)). This declaratory relief is rooted in the alleged First Amendment violation. Plaintiffs do not seek to assert some sort of freestanding right or manufacture a cause of action out of nothing. Defendants also take issue with the Court\u2019s statement that a finding for Plaintiff in Count II, and similarly Count V, would find that State Defendant\u2019s Page 14 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 15 of 50 PageID 1126 interpretation is unconstitutional. They argue, instead, that is the relief sought in Count III, and by extension Count VI. They are wrong. Counts III and VI ask this Court to find that section of the statute unconstitutional wholesale. An extreme remedy indeed. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 689 (2001) (\u201cIt is a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation, however, that when an Act of Congress raises a serious doubt as to its constitutionality, this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\u201d (cleaned up)). On the other hand, Counts II and V seek to save the statute by finding the interpretation unconstitutional. See HM Fla.-ORL, LLC v. Governor of Fla., 137 F.4th 1207, 1248 (11th Cir. 2025) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting) (\u201c[W]e could apply ordinary tools of statutory construction to read the statute narrowly and avoid unnecessary constitutional conflict[.]\u201d). Counts II and V do not break new ground, they merely invoke the canon of constitutional avoidance. In asserting the Eleventh Amendment bars Counts II and V, Defendants advance an argument that this Court cannot interpret state law to determine if it is constitutional. Whether the law at issue is state or federal is a distinction without a difference when it comes to compliance with the Constitution. League of Women Voters of Fla., Inc. v. Detzner, 314 F. Supp. 3d 1205, 1212 (N.D. Fla. 2018) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that federal courts can review state or local laws alleged to be unconstitutional.\u201d (citing District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 636 (2008), Page 15 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 16 of 50 PageID 1127 and Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967))). \u201cSimply put, a federal court can review a state official\u2019s interpretation of\u2014or gloss over\u2014state law when it is alleged to violate the United States Constitution. Otherwise, state legislatures could pass ambiguous statutes, giving cover for state officers to interpret vague laws in manners contrary to the U.S. Constitution.\u201d Id. The Court is not attempting to direct the state to comply with state law. A declaration in favor of Plaintiffs would direct Defendants to conform to the United States Constitution\u2014not state law. See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2 (\u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . .\u201d). C. Prudential Standing Defendants then argue that Plaintiffs lack prudential standing to bring an overbreadth challenge. Prudential standing is \u201ca doctrine not derived from Article III\u201d and covers \u201cthe general prohibition on a litigant\u2019s raising another person\u2019s legal rights.\u201d Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 126 (2014). Challenging a statute as overbroad necessarily implicates prudential standing concerns. That is because \u201cthe overbreadth doctrine instructs a court to hold a statute facially unconstitutional even though it has lawful applications, and even at the behest of someone to whom the statute can be lawfully applied.\u201d United States v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, 769 (2023). Page 16 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 17 of 50 PageID 1128 Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs lack prudential standing because the statute at issue regulates school districts, not Plaintiffs. But that is the wrong question. The issue is not what entity the statute directly regulates; it is whose constitutional rights the statute violates. In advancing their argument, Defendants rely on Mata Chorwadi, Inc. v. City of Boynton Beach, 66 F.4th 1259 (11th Cir. 2023). There, however, the plaintiffs were hotel owners who were attempting to assert the constitutional rights of the non-party hotel guests. Id. at 1264. The plaintiffs themselves suffered no violation of their own constitutional rights. Id. Not so here. As explained in the Article III standing analysis, the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs themselves are implicated here. The mere fact that other non-parties\u2019 constitutional rights may also be implicated is of no import. Indeed, this is exactly the type of circumstance the overbreadth doctrine was intended to address. See id. (\u201c[T]he overbreadth doctrine [ ] allows a litigant to challenge a statute not because it is unconstitutional as applied to him but because it may deter others from engaging in protected expression.\u201d Id. at 1265 (citing Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973))). Defendants then argue that Plaintiffs cannot bring a facial challenge because they did not bring an as-applied challenge. While the Supreme Court has commented that \u201cthe lawfulness of the particular application of the law should ordinarily be Page 17 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 18 of 50 PageID 1129 decided first,\u201d that is not a binding requirement. Bd. of Trs. of State Univ. of New York v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 485 (1989). In fact, as Justice Scalia explained earlier in the same opinion, \u201c[i]t would make little sense to . . . preclude [Plaintiffs] from attacking that restriction on grounds that the statute is overbroad (because they have standing to attack its overbroad applications directly and therefore cannot invoke the overbreadth doctrine)\u2014and then, next week, to permit some person whose [ ] speech is not restricted (so that he has no standing to attack that aspect of the statute directly) to succeed in his attack . . . because the statute is overbroad.\u201d Id. at 484. This argument is also foreclosed by recent Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit authority. Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 603 U.S. 707, 718, 745 (2024) (permitting a facial challenge without an as-applied challenge, with Justice Barrett noting in her concurrence that there can be difficulties in bringing facial, as opposed to as-applied, challenges but not prohibiting parties from doing so); HM Fla.-ORL, 137 F.4th at 1247\u201348 (majority opinion) (\u201c[W]e disagree that courts cannot reach an overbreadth challenge until they have evaluated an as-applied one.\u201d (citing United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460 (2010), and Ams. for Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. 595 (2021))). Defendants\u2019 prudential standing argument fails. D. Shotgun Pleading The first argument in the State\u2019s Motion is that State Defendants are entitled to summary judgment because the Complaint is a shotgun pleading. But State Page 18 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 19 of 50 PageID 1130 Defendants have cited no case law that the appropriate remedy is granting summary judgment in their favor if the Complaint was a shotgun pleading. It is not. \u201c[A] shotgun pleading is a shotgun pleading and the remedy is repleading.\u201d Cardinal v. Haines City, No. 8:19-cv-3137-KKM-TGW, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146679, at *3 n.1, 4 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 5, 2021) (denying motion for summary judgment as moot, striking shotgun-pleading complaint with leave to refile an amended complaint); see also Magluta v. Samples, 256 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cIn the past when faced with [shotgun] complaints like this one, we have vacated judgments and remanded with instructions that the district court require plaintiffs to replead their claims.\u201d). Because State Defendants make no new arguments on this point and this argument essentially seeks dismissal of the Complaint, the Court need not dwell here long. The Court incorporates by reference that portion of its Order on State Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss that addresses the shotgun pleading argument. (Doc. 106 at 14\u201317). As explained there, while the Complaint is perhaps longer than it needed to be, it is not a shotgun pleading. E. Government Speech \u201cThe First Amendment prohibits Congress and other government entities and actors from \u2018abridging the freedom of speech\u2019; the First Amendment does not say that Congress and other government entities must abridge their own ability to speak Page 19 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 20 of 50 PageID 1131 freely.\u201d Matal v. Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 234 (2017). \u201cBut while the government-speech doctrine is important\u2014indeed, essential\u2014it is a doctrine that is susceptible to dangerous misuse. If private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints.\u201d Id. at 235. Thus, this Court \u201cmust exercise great caution\u201d before deeming the speech at issue here government speech. Id. Defendants frame this case broadly as the government curating the selection of books in the library and argue that is government speech. That is problematic for two reasons. First, it is unclear whether, even under that broad umbrella, this would constitute government speech. And second, Defendants\u2019 framing ignores the narrower reality of the statutory scheme at issue here. As to the broader concept, the Eleventh Circuit has not determined whether selecting and removing books from a library constitutes government speech. There is some conflicting authority among other circuits, but the argument that it is government speech has yet to obtain endorsement by a majority opinion. The Eighth Circuit has soundly rejected the argument, stating: \u201cif placing these [disparate] books on the shelf of public school libraries constitutes government speech, the State \u2018is babbling prodigiously and incoherently.\u2019\u201d GLBT Youth in Iowa Sch. Task Force v. Reynolds, 114 F.4th 660, 668 (8th Cir. 2024) (quoting Matal, 582 U.S. at 236). Page 20 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 21 of 50 PageID 1132 Recently, the Fifth Circuit\u2014sitting en banc\u2014held in Little v. Llano County that the plaintiffs could not challenge library book removals, but the holding amounted to a finding the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their claim. 1 138 F.4th 834, 836 (5th Cir. 2025). Earning only a plurality\u2019s support, Part IV of the opinion concluded library collection decisions are government speech. Id. at 865 (plurality opinion). Critical to the plurality in Little was that \u201clibraries curate their collections for expressive purposes.\u201d Id. at 837\u201338 (majority opinion). Expressive activity was also of paramount importance in the cases upon which Little relied: United States v. Am. Libr. Ass\u2019n (\u201cALA\u201d), 539 U.S. 194, 204 (2003) (plurality opinion) (\u201cThe librarian\u2019s responsibility . . . is to separate out the gold from the garbage[.]\u201d); City of Pleasant Grove v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 473 (2009) (\u201cThe City has selected those monuments that it wants to display for the purpose of presenting the image of the City that it wishes to project to all who frequent the Park[.]\u201d); and Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 603 U.S. at 728 (2024) (\u201c[E]xpressive activity includes presenting a curated compilation of speech originally created by others.\u201d).2 1 As discussed above, the Eleventh Circuit has taken a different track, see ACLU of Fla., 557 F.3d at 1195, and Plaintiffs have established standing. 2 Notably, ALA and NetChoice are not government speech cases. ALA also involved internet filtering, and ultimately, patrons could still access the restricted content if they requested the filter be turned off. See 539 U.S. at 209. Here, there is no \u201crestricted section\u201d of the library. The books are entirely off-limits. Compellingly written as that portion of the Little opinion might be, it is inapposite here. Page 21 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 22 of 50 PageID 1133 Here, the government is not engaging in expressive activity. Despite Defendant\u2019s best efforts to frame it as such, the statutory provision at issue does not involve discretion of government employees in curating an appropriate collection of library books that are \u201cworth reading.\u201d Little, 138 F.4th at 837. Unlike Little, where librarians were using their discretion to remove books that they felt were no longer worthwhile additions to the library, id. at 839, the statute here mandates the removal of books that contain even a single reference to the prohibited subject matter, regardless of the holistic value of the book individually or as part of a larger collection. Moreover, many removals at issue here are the objecting parents\u2019 speech, not the government\u2019s. Having addressed the persuasive authority regarding the issue of selecting and removing library books generally, the Court turns to binding precedent addressing the government speech analysis. The Supreme Court outlined a \u201cholistic inquiry\u201d guided by consideration of the following factors: (1) \u201cthe history of the expression at issue\u201d; (2) \u201cthe public\u2019s likely perception as to who (the government or a private person) is speaking\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe extent to which the government has actively shaped or controlled the expression.\u201d Shurtleff v. City of Boston, 596 U.S. 243, 252 (2022). The Eleventh Circuit has considered a corresponding list of factors: history, endorsement, and control. See Gundy v. City of Jacksonville Fla., 50 F.4th 60, 76 (11th Cir. 2022). But, in line with the Supreme Court\u2019s holistic inquiry, the Eleventh Page 22 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 23 of 50 PageID 1134 Circuit made clear that \u201c[t]hese factors are neither individually nor jointly necessary for speech to constitute government speech,\u201d and that a court\u2019s \u201creview is not mechanical; it is driven by a case\u2019s context rather than the rote application of rigid factors.\u201d McGriff v. City of Miami Beach, 84 F.4th 1330, 1334 (11th Cir. 2023) (first quoting Leake v. Drinkard, 14 F.4th 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. 2021), then quoting Shurtleff, 596 U.S. at 252). The Eleventh Circuit applied those factors in McGriff, when an artist sued after the city removed his painting from a city art exhibit over concerns about the painting\u2019s message. Id. at 1333. Applying the factors, the court held \u201cthe City was speaking when it selected some artwork, but not others, to display[.]\u201d Id. at 1333\u2013 36. When compared to this case, however, McGriff is readily distinguishable. That is because the city removed the painting in its own discretion\u2014not an outsider\u2019s input\u2014and after considering the artwork in its entirety\u2014not based on a single criterion excised from the work as a whole. See id. at 1333. (\u201cAfter viewing the painting, the City Manager told the artists to remove [it] from the exhibition.\u201d). Both parties miss the boat with their arguments as to parental removals. Under Shurtleff, the first inquiry in this case is not whether public school librarians\u2014state employees certainly\u2014have a history of selecting school library books. They do, of course. It is whether parents have. Page 23 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 24 of 50 PageID 1135 As to the second Shurtleff factor, in the abstract, the public may believe the state is speaking through its the curation of school library books, but the statutory scheme here requires the school boards to advertise on the school district website that parents have the power to have books removed. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2. (\u201cThe objection form . . . must be easy to read and understand and be easily accessible on the homepage of the school district\u2019s website.\u201d). If, historically, the state has actively controlled the selection of school library books as Defendants claim, the instant statute repudiates that role. Furthermore, it is unclear what the government seeks to express by allowing a book to be removed on the given statutory grounds without any consideration of the book\u2019s holistic value. Following an objection, the book \u201cmust be removed within 5 school days after receipt of the objection and remain unavailable to students of that school until the objection is resolved.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2.b. (emphasis added). Then, if it is determined that the book contains content falling within any of the listed categories, \u201cthe school district shall discontinue the use of the material in the school district.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Such strictures conflict with the sound discretion of school librarians necessary for the expressive activity emphasized in Little and the Supreme Court\u2019s government speech precedents. To be sure, parents have the right to \u201cdirect the upbringing and education of children,\u201d Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, Page 24 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 25 of 50 PageID 1136 534 (1925), but the government cannot repackage their speech and pass it off as its own. That is exactly what Justice Alito warned of in Matal. See 582 U.S. at 235. Turning to removals carried out by the school district, the problem of expressive activity remains. Defendants cite no case law for the proposition that that the government may impose a blanket prohibition on non-obscene material in school\u2014or even public\u2014libraries. Even the plurality in Little did not go that far because, there, only a few books were removed through the library\u2019s \u201cweeding\u201d process. 138 F.4th at 839. In fact, case law bears out the opposite. See W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943) (\u201cIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion[.]\u201d). The functions of the statute cut against the first and third Shurtleff factors. Historically, librarians curate their collections based on their sound discretion not based on decrees from on high. (Doc. 109 at 23 (\u201cBut by 1920, standard practice required \u2018[b]ook selections\u2019 to \u2018be made by the librarian with the approval of the principal.\u2019\u201d (citing Am. Library Ass\u2019n, Standard Library Organization and Equipment for Secondary Schools of Different Sizes 21 (1920)))). As to the second factor, it is unclear whether the public would assume the government is speaking when they find the school library shelves emptier than before or if they would assume parents had spoken under this statutory scheme. See also Reynolds, 114 F.4th Page 25 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 26 of 50 PageID 1137 at 668 (\u201c[I]t is doubtful that the public would view the placement and removal of books in public school libraries as the government speaking.\u201d). Either way, the inquiry is holistic one, and it is clear to the Court that the removal of library books without consideration of their overall value cannot be expressive activity amounting to government speech. See also Shurtleff, 596 U.S. at 262 (Alito, J. concurring) (\u201c[T]reating those factors as a test obscures the real question in government-speech cases: whether the government is speaking instead of regulating private expression.\u201d). This outcome is also consistent with Justice Alito\u2019s concurrence in Shurtleff, which was joined by Justices Thomas and Gorsuch. \u201cFacilitating speech by private persons cannot constitute government speech unless the government assigns a power to speak to those persons or appropriates the products of their expressive activity to express its own message. When the government\u2019s role is limited to applying a standard of assessment to determine a speaker\u2019s eligibility for a benefit, the government is regulating private speech, and ordinary First Amendment principles apply.\u201d Id. at 271. The statute here imposes a standard that librarians must apply blindly to determine whether an author is eligible to have their works shelved in school libraries. \u201cFor the adopted expression to qualify as the government\u2019s, the private party must alienate control over the medium of expression to the government. And Page 26 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 27 of 50 PageID 1138 government actors must put the medium to use to intentionally express a government message.\u201d Id. at 270. A blanket content-based prohibition on materials, rather than one based on individualized curation, hardly expresses any intentional government message at all. Slapping the label of government speech on book removals only serves to stifle the disfavored viewpoints. See id. at 264 (\u201cCensorship is not made constitutional by aggressive and direct application.\u201d). That way, the Supreme Court has warned, lies danger. Matal, 582 U.S. at 235. F. Government Benefit Defendants renew their argument that the government does not violate the First Amendment in withdrawing a benefit facilitating the exercise of a constitutional right. Indeed, the government \u201cis not required to assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas[.]\u201d Ysursa v. Pocatello Educ. Ass\u2019n, 555 U.S. 353, 358 (2009). But \u201cthe Government may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected . . . freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.\u201d Agency for Int\u2019l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc\u2019y Int\u2019l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214, (2013) (internal quotation omitted). Thus, it does not matter that school libraries are not compulsory. It also does not matter that a student may obtain the books elsewhere. See Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 880 (1997) (\u201c[O]ne is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged Page 27 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 28 of 50 PageID 1139 on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.\u201d (quoting Schneider v. State of N.J. (Town of Irvington), 308 U.S. 147, 163 (1939))). \u201cUnlike the present case, [most] decisions on which [Defendants] rel[y] all involved cash subsidies or their equivalent.\u201d Matal, 582 U.S. at 240. Wisely, Defendants mostly rely on Ysursa, which involved a non-cash subsidy. When Idaho passed a law preventing \u201cpayroll deductions for political purposes,\u201d unions sued because employers could previously deduct union dues and fees for union political activities. 555 U.S. at 356. Critical to the Court\u2019s holding there was that the unions were not prevented from making political speech, the law merely prevented them from \u201cenlisting the State in support of that endeavor.\u201d 555 U.S. at 359. Here, speech itself is being abridged. Even if Ysursa was on point, this law goes further because it discriminates based on content. \u201cDifferential subsidization \u2018of First Amendment speakers\u2019 raises constitutional concerns \u2018when it threatens to suppress the expression of particular ideas or viewpoints,\u2019 or \u2018if it targets a small group of speakers.\u2019\u201d Alachua Cnty. Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Carpenter, 741 F. Supp. 3d 1202, 1243 (N.D. Fla. 2024) (footnote omitted) (quoting Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S. 439, 447 (1991)). The Carpenter Court explained how Leathers, which addressed tax exemptions, applied in the context of subsidies, and this Court agrees with its analysis. See id. at 1243 n.24. Because parents are permitted to object to materials that \u201ccontain[ ] content\u201d the Page 28 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 29 of 50 PageID 1140 statute lists and district school boards must also assess if the \u201cmaterial[s] contain[ ] prohibited content,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2.b., it is the content of the speech, not the speaker, that determines if the law applies. The Court next turns to determining if this violates the First Amendment and what standard of scrutiny applies. G. First Amendment Violation Incorporated against the states though the Fourteenth Amendment, the First Amendment commands that states \u201cshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I.; see Va. State Bd. of Pharm. v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 749 n.1 (1976). Plaintiffs argue that Florida has done so with HB 1069. In First Amendment cases involving facial challenges, \u201c[t]he question is whether \u2018a substantial number of the law\u2019s applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019\u201d NetChoice, 603 U.S. at 723 (alteration adopted) (quoting Bonta, 594 U.S. at 615). \u201cSo in this singular context, even a law with \u2018a plainly legitimate sweep\u2019 may be struck down in its entirety. But that is so only if the law\u2019s unconstitutional applications substantially outweigh its constitutional ones.\u201d Id. at 723\u201324. 1. Standards of Scrutiny First, the Court must determine what standard of scrutiny applies here. \u201cThe question of what standard applies to school library book removal decisions is Page 29 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 30 of 50 PageID 1141 unresolved.\u201d ACLU of Fla., 557 F.3d at 1202. There are three possible standards of scrutiny that the Court could apply here: (1) the standard set forth in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 273 (1988), (the \u201cHazelwood standard\u201d); (2) the standard set forth in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969) (the \u201cTinker standard\u201d); and (3) the non-public forum standard. Defendants argue for the Hazelwood standard, which states that \u201ceducators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\u201d 484 U.S. at 273 (emphasis added). That is, Defendants ask for rational basis review because the school is entitled to greater deference as to the selection of its own materials. But that is just an attempt to sneak the previously rejected government speech argument past the Court under another name. The Hazelwood standard is even more out of place where, as here, it is not students speaking. At least one other district has agreed that the Hazelwood standard is inappropriate to address a state law authorizing the removal of school library books that contain \u201cdescriptions\u201d of a \u201csex act.\u201d See Penguin Random House LLC v. Robbins, 774 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1018 (S.D. Iowa 2025) (\u201cHere, the \u2018speakers\u2019 are not students, but rather the authors and publishers of the books that are subject to Page 30 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 31 of 50 PageID 1142 removal under [the challenged law].\u201d). There, as here, \u201cthe First Amendment analysis revolves around the rights of those authors to have their books reach their intended audiences and of students to receive the information set forth in those books.\u201d Id. The court in Robbins also distinguished Hazelwood because it \u201cinvolved student speech that necessarily was (or would have been) disseminated to other students in captive settings.\u201d Id. Like the situation in Robbins, should students here not wish to read a book that runs afoul of this statute, they need not. Otherwise, \u201cthe books remain harmlessly on the shelves except with respect to students who want to read them.\u201d Id. Thus, the Court declines to apply the Hazelwood standard. 3 On the opposite end of spectrum is the Tinker standard. As noted in Tinker, \u201c[i]t can hardly be argued that . . . students . . . shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\u201d 393 U.S. at 506. \u201cTinker held that student expression may not be suppressed unless school officials reasonably conclude that it will \u2018materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.\u2019\u201d Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 403 (2007). 3 The Robbins Court went on to apply the standard in Board of Education v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853 (1982), but the Eleventh Circuit has found \u201cPico is of no precedential value,\u201d ACLU of Fla., 557 F.3d at 1200. Nevertheless, the Pico standard is quite similar to the non-public forum standard that, as discussed below, the Court will apply here. See GLBT Youth in Iowa Sch. Task Force v. Reynolds, 709 F. Supp. 3d 664, 696 (S.D. Iowa 2023), rev\u2019d and vacated on other grounds, 114 F.4th 660 (8th Cir. 2024). Page 31 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 32 of 50 PageID 1143 Justice Alito explained the lay of the land in this area of law as follows: \u201cIn addition to Tinker, the decision in the [Morse] case allows the restriction of speech advocating illegal drug use; Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, permits the regulation of speech that is delivered in a lewd or vulgar manner as part of a high school program; and Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, allows a school to regulate what is in essence the school\u2019s own speech, that is, articles that appear in a publication that is an official school organ.\u201d 551 U.S. at 422\u201323 (Alito, J. concurring) (internal citations omitted). He went on to explain that he joined the Morse majority \u201con the understanding that the opinion does not hold that the special characteristics of the public schools necessarily justify any other speech restrictions.\u201d Id. at 423. Here, it is apparent that the statute covers none of those applications that the Supreme Court has found previously impermissible. See also Saxe v. State Coll. Area Sch. Dist., 240 F.3d 200, 214 (3d Cir. 2001) (Alito, J.) (\u201cUnder Fraser, a school may categorically prohibit lewd, vulgar or profane language. Under Hazelwood, a school may regulate school-sponsored speech (that is, speech that a reasonable observer would view as the school\u2019s own speech) on the basis of any legitimate pedagogical concern. Speech falling outside of these categories is subject to Tinker\u2019s general rule: it may be regulated only if it would substantially disrupt school operations or interfere with the right of others.\u201d). Page 32 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 33 of 50 PageID 1144 Further tilting the scales towards applying the Tinker standard, this is also not a situation like Little, which involved the removal of a few books, or like ACLU of Florida, which involved just a single book. The statute here imposes a statewide prohibition on vast swathes of the literature. That is quite different. See Robbins, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 1007\u201308. As such, it appears the Tinker standard might be warranted here. Nevertheless, because the statute at issue here fails even under the lower level of scrutiny contained in the non-public forum standard, the Court will use that standard. See also Kreimer v. Bureau of Police for Town of Morristown, 958 F.2d 1242, 1261 (3d Cir. 1992) (explaining a library \u201cconstitutes a limited public forum\u201d). So, the Court assumes that a public school library is a non-public forum. \u201cThe government may reserve [a non-public] forum \u2018for its intended purposes, communicative or otherwise, as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker\u2019s view.\u2019\u201d Minn. Voters All. v. Mansky, 585 U.S. 1, 12 (2018) (quoting Perry Ed. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 460 U.S. 37, 46 (1983)). Here, the statute does not discriminate as to viewpoint. Instead, as in Mansky, the inquiry would be if the statutory prohibitions are \u201creasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.\u201d Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806 (1985). \u201c[T]he traditional purpose of a library is to provide information on a broad range of subjects and viewpoints[.]\u201d Pen Am. Ctr., Inc. v. Escambia Cnty. Sch. Bd., Page 33 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 34 of 50 PageID 1145 711 F. Supp. 3d 1325, 1331 (N.D. Fla. 2024)); (see also Hackey Decl., Doc. 107-48, at 5 (\u201cThe Florida Department of Education Library Media Reading Guidelines state that one of the goals of the school library media program is to \u2018provide intellectual and physical access to a broad range of literature and informational reading materials for personal pleasure and curriculum support.\u2019\u201d)). 2. Overbreadth Now, applying the non-public forum standard, the Court turns to the Supreme Court\u2019s process for assessing a law as facially overbroad. \u201c[E]ach court must evaluate the full scope of the law\u2019s coverage. It must then decide which of the law\u2019s applications are constitutionally permissible and which are not, and finally weigh the one against the other.\u201d NetChoice, 603 U.S. at 744. Plaintiffs bear a heavy burden because, as Defendants warn, facial invalidation for overbreadth is \u201cstrong medicine.\u201d See Hansen, 599 U.S. at 784. a. Applications of the Challenged Provisions As relevant here, and as discussed more thoroughly below, to have a constitutionally permissible application of the statute, the banned content must be obscene as that term is understood in First Amendment jurisprudence. To assist courts in determining what constitutes obscenity, the Supreme Court set forth the \u201cMiller test,\u201d which \u201cdefines speech as obscene if it satisfies three requirements: (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a Page 34 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 35 of 50 PageID 1146 whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1228. However, \u201cthe concept of obscenity or of unprotected matter may vary according to the group to whom the questionable material is directed or from whom it is quarantined.\u201d Id. at 1230 (quoting Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 636 (1968)). Thus, when applying the obscenity analysis to minors, courts employ \u201c[t]he Miller-for-minors test,\u201d which \u201ctakes the Miller prongs but adjusts the second and third standards (and sometimes the first) \u2018for minors.\u2019 So the \u2018patently offensive\u2019 requirement becomes \u2018patently offensive for minors,\u2019 and the \u2018serious value\u2019 exception becomes \u2018serious value for minors.\u2019\u201d Id. (internal citations omitted). As the Florida Supreme Court has explained, \u201cthe \u2018societal value\u2019 requirement in the third Miller prong is \u2018particularly important\u2019 because it \u2018allows appellate courts to impose some limitations and regularity on the definition [of \u201charmful to minors\u201d] by setting, as a matter of law, a [uniform] floor for socially redeeming value.\u2019\u201d Simmons v. State, 944 So. 2d 317, 329 (Fla. 2006) (alteration in original). \u201cBut the Miller-for-minors test does not do away with Miller\u2019s procedural requirement that obscene content must be specifically identified to remove it from First-Amendment protection.\u201d HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1230. \u201cAnd content Page 35 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 36 of 50 PageID 1147 that is obscene as to minors may differ from its adult equivalent only in quality, not in kind[.]\u201d Id. \u2018As for obscenity, only depictions of \u2018\u201chard core\u2019\u201d sexual conduct\u2019 can satisfy that term.\u201d Id. at 1228. With this context in mind, the Court turns to the substance of the statute. To differentiate permissible applications from impermissible ones requires a degree of statutory interpretation. See id. at 1226 (\u201c[W]hen [courts] assess a statute\u2019s sweep in an overbreadth challenge, [they] evaluate the ambiguous as well as the unambiguous scope of the enactment.\u201d). Here, the law covers all library materials that \u201cdescribe[ ] sexual conduct\u201d and that are \u201cpornographic or prohibited under [section] 847.012.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2.b.(I), (II). 4 As applied here, section 847.012 prohibits content that is \u201charmful to minors.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 847.012(3)(b). \u201cSexual conduct\u201d and \u201charmful to minors\u201d are defined with specificity. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 847.001(19), 847.001(7). However, \u201cdescribes\u201d and \u201cpornographic\u201d are not. To begin with, banning content because it is prohibited under section 847.012\u2014i.e., harmful to minors\u2014is plainly a constitutional application. Indeed, the definition of \u201charmful to minors\u201d under Florida law incorporates the Miller-for- minors standard.5 See Simmons, 944 So. 2d at 329 (\u201c[T]he term \u2018harmful to minors\u2019 4 Plaintiffs, wisely, do not challenge that part of the law that references visual depictions of sexual conduct. Thus, the \u201c[m]aterials in Florida school libraries that are implicated by the Challenged Provisions primarily consist of books, but may occasionally include magazines, newspapers, and audiobooks.\u201d (Hackey Decl., Doc. 107-48, at 7\u20138). 5 Florida law defines \u201charmful to minors\u201d as: Page 36 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 37 of 50 PageID 1148 [in Fla. Stat. \u00a7 847.001(7)] is adequately defined by reference to the three-prong Miller standard, albeit modified to apply to minors.\u201d). This also means that everything that could be constitutionally censored because it constitutes obscenity already falls within the portion of the statute that bans content under section 847.012\u2014i.e., content that is harmful to minors. This leaves the Court to grapple with the other categories banned under the statute\u2014material that \u201cdescribes sexual conduct\u201d and that is \u201cpornographic.\u201d By leaving these items undefined, Florida has given parents license to object to materials under an \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d approach. Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964) (Stewart, J. concurring). There is a reason that was not the standard the Supreme Court adopted for defining obscenity then. See id. at 191 (majority opinion); see also HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1213 (\u201cAn \u2018I know it any reproduction, imitation, characterization, description, exhibition, presentation, or representation, of whatever kind or form, depicting nudity, sexual conduct, or sexual excitement when it: (a) Predominantly appeals to a prurient, shameful, or morbid interest; (b) Is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material or conduct for minors; and (c) Taken as a whole, is without serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors. A mother\u2019s breastfeeding of her baby is not under any circumstance \u201charmful to minors.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 847.001(7). Page 37 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 38 of 50 PageID 1149 when I see it\u2019 test would unconstitutionally empower those who would limit speech to arbitrarily enforce the law. But the First Amendment empowers speakers instead.\u201d). Here, neither a prohibition on content that \u201cdescribes sexual conduct\u201d nor that which is allegedly \u201cpornographic\u201d takes the third Miller prong into account. Both prohibitions lack the specificity required in identifying obscene material. Given that obscene material as to minors is already prohibited under Florida law, these terms must, therefore, target non-obscene material. Thus, the applications of the law plainly slip into those barred by the First Amendment. Both provisions \u201cthreaten[ ] a broad range of protected speech, even if the law has some permissible applications at its core. These provisions turn the Act into an \u2018I know it when I see it\u2019 law. But the Constitution requires more clarity.\u201d HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1225. Thus, leaving these terms undefined results in impermissible applications. So, the Court turns to the question of whether these terms can be construed in a manner that results in a constitutional application. As a reminder, the text of the statute groups together in one sub-sub-subparagraph \u201cpornographic or prohibited under [section] 847.012\u201d and then lists \u201c[d]epicts or describes sexual conduct\u201d in a separate sub-sub-subparagraph. Additionally, as discussed above, what is prohibited under section 847.012 is all content that can constitutionally be categorized as obscene because it is harmful to minors under the Miller-for-minors standard. As such, the Page 38 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 39 of 50 PageID 1150 provision that prohibits material that \u201cdescribes sexual conduct\u201d must mean something different than the \u201charmful to minors\u201d content that is prohibited under section 847.012\u2014i.e., different than what is permissibly censored as obscenity by the Miller-for-minors standard. Any other \u201cinterpretation would . . . violate the \u2018basic premise of statutory construction . . . that a statute is to be interpreted so that no words shall be discarded as being meaningless, redundant, or mere surplusage.\u2019\u201d Aspen Am. Ins. Co. v. Landstar Ranger, Inc., 65 F.4th 1261, 1271 (11th Cir. 2023) (quoting United States v. Canals-Jimenez, 943 F.2d 1284, 1287 (11th Cir. 1991)). The Court must conclude that there is no constitutional application of a prohibition against books containing material that \u201cdescribes sexual conduct.\u201d Interpreting \u201cpornographic\u201d as synonymous with \u201charmful to minors,\u201d however, as Plaintiffs invite the Court to do in Counts II and V, does not suffer the same problem. \u201cPornographic\u201d here is in the same sentence as \u201cprohibited under [section] 847.012\u201d and is connected by the word \u201cor.\u201d \u201cThe word \u2018or\u2019 commonly introduces a synonym or \u2018definitional equivalent.\u2019 That construction may be an example of the \u2018ill-conceived but lamentably common belt-and-suspenders approach\u2019 to legal writing, but it is the better reading of the text when the terms share the same ordinary meaning.\u201d McCarthan v. Dir. of Goodwill Indus.-Suncoast, Inc., 851 F.3d 1076, 1088 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal citations omitted). Thus, the Page 39 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 40 of 50 PageID 1151 prohibition against \u201cpornographic\u201d content can be constitutionally applied when it is construed as meaning harmful to minors. b. The Unconstitutional Applications of the Challenged Provisions Outweigh the Constitutional Applications Finally, the Court turns to determining whether the law\u2019s unconstitutional applications substantially outweigh its constitutional ones. In its constitutional application, the statute must not unreasonably restrict the library\u2019s purpose of providing students information on a broad range of subjects and viewpoints. Although there is some support that \u201c[t]he purpose of public school libraries is to advance the school curriculum\u2014that is, to facilitate the pedagogical mission of the school, which may involve some limitation of expression.\u201d Reynolds, 114 F.4th at 670. Even Plaintiffs do not challenge that some limits may be placed on what lines a school library\u2019s shelves. Justice Alito has warned, however, of taking this view too far when it comes to even student speech. \u201cThe \u2018educational mission\u2019 of the public schools is defined by the elected and appointed public officials with authority over the schools and by the school administrators and faculty.\u201d Morse, 551 U.S. at 423. \u201cThe \u2018educational mission\u2019 argument would give public school authorities a license to suppress speech on political and social issues based on disagreement with the viewpoint expressed. The argument, therefore, strikes at the very heart of the First Amendment.\u201d Id. Page 40 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 41 of 50 PageID 1152 By enacting HB 1069, the Florida legislature sought to prohibit material from entering or remaining in school libraries that is not obscene for minors. That is apparent because the Miller-for-minors test is already baked into Florida law, see Simmons, 944 So. 2d at 329, which means that material was already prohibited before the legislature sought to amend the law, see Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28 (2022). Before HB 1069, \u201cany book that described sexual conduct was evaluated in its entirety in relation to the age and maturity of students who may read it under the \u2018harmful to minors\u2019 provision[.]\u201d (Doc. 107-48 at 8). To amend the law to say the same thing or effectuate the same purpose would be a pointless endeavor. \u201cSpeech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.\u201d Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 213\u201314 (1975). \u201cIt is . . . essential that legislation aimed at protecting children from allegedly harmful expression\u2014no less than legislation enacted with respect to adults\u2014be clearly drawn and that the standards adopted be reasonably precise.\u201d Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dall., 390 U.S. 676, 689 (1968) (quoting People v. Kahan, 206 N.E.2d 333, 335 (N.Y. 1965) (Fuld, J., concurring)). And \u201c[e]ven when a statute only indirectly limits protected adult speech\u2014such as . . . by forcing speakers to \u2018err on the side of caution\u2019 because of statutory ambiguities\u2014the law still must do so narrowly and in proportion to the Page 41 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 42 of 50 PageID 1153 government\u2019s interest in shielding children from speech that is unprotected as to minors.\u201d HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1230 (internal citation omitted). The law here fails all these tests. Plaintiffs provide the unrebutted declaration of Christina Hackey\u2014an Education Media Specialist in the Volusia County School District to establish that \u201c[she] ha[s] never seen pornography or obscene materials in a public school library, including any of the libraries in [her] District.\u201d (Doc. 107-48 at 13). Defendants are thus incorrect that Plaintiffs have provided the Court with no evidence for the argument that it is rare that obscene material would be found in Florida public school libraries. Rather, it is Defendants speculating that surely a plethora of obscene materials must exist in Florida school libraries if the legislature passed HB 1069. Defendants then argue Plaintiffs must catalogue the books in public school libraries that might be implicated by the statute to determine which are and are not obscene as to minors. That is, Defendants demand Plaintiffs and the Court read thousands of pages to determine which books, if any, are indeed obscene as to minors. That burden is beyond the requirements of NetChoice. As the Robbins Court detailed, courts \u201chave essentially taken judicial notice of the contents of artistic works.\u201d 774 F. Supp. 3d at 1026 (citing Ashcroft v. ACLU, 535 U.S. 564, 584 n.16 (2002) (Thomas, J.); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dall., 493 U.S. 215, 251 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring); Couch v. Jabe, 737 F. Supp. 2d 561, 567\u201369 & n.4\u201314 (W.D. Va. Page 42 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 43 of 50 PageID 1154 2010); and Cline v. Fox, 319 F. Supp. 2d 685, 692\u201393 (N.D. W. Va. 2004)). The Court would be comfortable keeping such company. Even without that, the evidence shows that Ms. Hackey must grapple with the \u201cvague and ambiguous\u201d statutory language to determine which library books run afoul of the provisions and that through it all she has not encountered a single piece of obscene content. (Doc. 107-48 at 8, 13 (\u201cAuthors frequently employ literary devices like symbolism and metaphors to convey messages or themes or to advance the plot of the work. Given those literary devices, it\u2019s not clear how the State expects Educational Media Specialists, educators, or other school officials to know exactly what crosses the line in the State\u2019s eyes.\u201d)). The vagueness of the provisions only serves to expand their sweep. See HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1237 (\u201cThe vagueness of the \u2018lewd conduct\u2019 term only exacerbates its breadth.\u201d). The Hackey Declaration, taken together with Declarations of R.K. and J.H., establishes that many non-obscene books have been removed from public school libraries to the dismay of students that deeply identify with these books. (Id. at 4\u20135, 12\u201313, 14, 15\u201316; Doc. 107-57; Doc. 107-58). Plaintiffs have also submitted the declarations of Author Plaintiffs attesting that their novels are not obscene. (See Doc. Nos. 107-50; 107-51; 107-52; 107-53; and 107-54; see also Doc. 107-2 at 4 (\u201cPenguin Random House does not publish pornography.\u201d)). Defendants have Page 43 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 44 of 50 PageID 1155 pointed to no obscene books that have been removed. The Court returns to the provisions. The first challenged provision prohibits material that \u201cdescribes sexual conduct.\u201d As outlined earlier, the first problem with this provision is that it does not evaluate the work to determine if it has any holistic value. Further, as established in the Hackey Declaration, the statute does not specify what level of detail \u201cdescribes sexual conduct.\u201d As Plaintiffs note, it is unclear what the statute actually prohibits. It might forbid material that states characters \u201cspent the night together\u201d or \u201cmade love.\u201d Perhaps not. Defendants do not attempt to explain how the statute should work. The Florida Department of Education (\u201cFLDOE\u201d) also directs educators to \u201cerr on the side of caution,\u201d which has \u201cled many Educational Media Specialists and other educators and school officials to err on the side of removing books based on fear that they and their school districts will be punished.\u201d (Doc. 107-48 at 9). But even a reading of the statute that excludes allusions to sexual activity nevertheless requires the removal of any material that contains even a single sentence that is prohibited by the statute\u2014with no consideration of its overall value. The second challenged provision prohibits material that is \u201cpornographic.\u201d Without further definition, this provision treats all minors as if they are the same, rendering content that is obscene as to younger children also obscene as to older children. The law demands the opposite. The Eleventh Circuit has held that \u201c[a]s Page 44 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 45 of 50 PageID 1156 applied to a Ginsberg-type adaptation of the adult obscenity test . . . if any reasonable minor, including a seventeen-year-old, would find serious value, the material is not \u2018harmful to minors.\u2019\u201d Am. Booksellers v. Webb, 919 F.2d 1493, 1504\u2013 05 (11th Cir. 1990). Thus, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of typical \u2018harmful to minors\u2019 statutes protects older children\u2019s rights. But it means that younger children may encounter material suitable for kids a few years older.\u201d HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1240; see also Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 847.001(7); 847.012. \u201cIn Webb, [the Eleventh Circuit] noted that \u2018only a minimal number of works will have serious value for reasonable adults but not for reasonable older minors.\u201d HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1244 (quoting Webb, 919 F.2d at 1506). \u201cThe burdens on speech purveyors and consumers alike [there] were minimal.\u201d Id. The statute here imposes a much greater burden on all. The statute\u2019s provision requiring districts to only \u201cdiscontinue use of the material for any grade level or age group for which such use is inappropriate or unsuitable\u201d does little to rescue it. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28(2)(a)2.b. In fact, that language compounds the issues with the law. See HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1245 (\u201cThe Act\u2019s age-variable standard poses as a well-tailored limit on its application. But in practice it is yet another \u2018I know it when I see it\u2019 provision.\u201d). Educators must again perform statutory interpretation on the fly to determine what exactly is \u201cinappropriate\u201d or \u201cunsuitable\u201d because those terms go undefined. All the while, the Page 45 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 46 of 50 PageID 1157 specter of harsh penalties looms in the background. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1012.796; Fla. Admin. Code r.6A-10.081. Educators are already able account for this across school levels. (Doc. 107-48 at 14 (\u201cOur professional training requires books that are appropriate and valuable for high school students but that may be too mature for elementary school students not be made available to elementary school students, and I take my professional responsibilities seriously.\u201d)). Ultimately, the statute forces educators to make a \u201cseries of difficult judgment calls about what is obscene for children of different ages.\u201d HM Fla.-ORL, LLC, 137 F.4th at 1242. It also flies in the face of Webb. See id. at 1244. There is also evidence that the statute has swept up more non-obscene books than just the ones referenced here. (Doc. 107-48 at 7 (\u201cBecause school districts are not required to report any books removed without an objection to the FLDOE under Section 1006.28, school district reports to the FLDOE probably do not identify all books that schools have removed under the Challenged Provisions, meaning that the effect of those provisions is far more pervasive than the reports suggest.\u201d)). And the harms extend beyond that of chilling of speech. The Hackey Declaration also establishes that the provisions \u201crestrict [her] capacity to respond to the educational needs of [her] students, especially students who have experienced sex or sexual abuse.\u201d (Id. at 7). She explains that \u201c[t]he Challenged Provisions force [her] and [her] colleagues to remove from [their] library Page 46 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 47 of 50 PageID 1158 collections popular and award-winning books that allow students to understand and process consensual or abusive sexual experiences that are common among both young and maturing teens.\u201d (Id. at 12). \u201cIn no way do the descriptions of a sex act in these books make them \u2018pornographic\u2019 or obscene as to students who may read them.\u201d (Id. at 13). Plaintiffs have established multiple unconstitutional applications of the statutory provisions at issue. The following books, among others, have been removed: The Color Purple, Half of a Yellow Sun, Cloud Atlas, The Splendid and the Vile, I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter, The Freedom Writers Diary: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them, On the Road, Nineteen Minutes, Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska, How the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents, The Kite Runner, Slaughterhouse-Five, Shout, Last Night at the Telegraph Club, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Native Son, Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth\u2019s Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa, Water for Elephants, Beloved, Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye, and Homegoing. None of these books are obscene. (See Doc. Nos. 107-2; 107-50; 107-51; 107-52; 107-53; and 107-54); see also Robbins, 774 F. Supp. 3d at 1034\u201335 (finding the removal of many of these books as unconstitutional and noting many are classics, modern award winners, and tested on AP exams). The restrictions placed on these books are thus unreasonable in light of the purpose of school libraries. And if so, the Page 47 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 48 of 50 PageID 1159 presence of these books in school libraries certainly does not materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school. Defendant\u2019s final salvo bewilderingly argues that Plaintiffs have failed to show that the statute would not survive strict scrutiny. But Plaintiffs established it would not survive an even weaker form of scrutiny. To put it another way, if the statute cannot clear a three-foot hurdle, there is no need to demonstrate whether it can clear a six-foot hurdle. Strict scrutiny is the least favorable standard of review for the government. To make this argument even more baffing, the burden there is on the government. See Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 171 (2015) (explaining strict scrutiny \u201crequires the Government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest\u201d). Therefore, it is readily apparent to the Court that the statute fails strict scrutiny. The statute\u2019s prohibition of material that \u201cdescribes sexual conduct\u201d is overbroad and unconstitutional. Thus, Plaintiffs will prevail on Counts I, IV, and VII. As for Counts III and VI, Plaintiffs request too much. To hold a law facially overbroad as Defendant\u2019s have repeatedly reminded this Court is an extreme remedy and strong medicine. So, the Court will take up Plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to save the law under Counts II and V. The Court finds that the term \u201cpornographic\u201d is synonymous with \u201charmful to minors\u201d under section 847.012. See In re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244, 1268 n.22 (11th Cir. 2021) (\u201c\u2018Doublets and triplets abound in legalese,\u2019 especially Page 48 of 50 Case 6:24-cv-01573-CEM-RMN Document 129 Filed 08/13/25 Page 49 of 50 PageID 1160 given that Congress often uses a \u2018belt-and-suspenders\u2019 approach when drafting statutes.\u201d (quoting Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 176\u201377 (2012))). Beyond the constitutional avoidance issue, the interpretation advanced by Defendants runs counter to another canon of statutory interpretation. Under \u201cthe principle of noscitur a sociis\u2014a word is known by the company it keeps\u2014to avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving unintended breadth to the [a]cts of [legislatures].\u201d Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 543 (2015) (internal quotation omitted). The reading prescribed by the Objection Form unmoors the word \u201cpornographic\u201d from any context and expands its scope into unconstitutional applications. Construed in that way, it becomes an \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d provision. Furthermore, that portion of the statute was not amended by HB 1069, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 1006.28 (2022), and the harm to Plaintiffs only stems from the new interpretation of the statute advanced by the Template Objection Form. So, an interpretation of section 1006.28 of the Florida Statutes that finds \u201cpornographic\u201d synonymous with \u201charmful to minors\u201d under Florida law keeps the statute well within the constitution\u2019s purview. Therefore, Plaintiffs will prevail on Counts II and V, and necessarily because they were alleged in the alternative, judgment will be entered in favor of Defendants on Counts III and VI.
