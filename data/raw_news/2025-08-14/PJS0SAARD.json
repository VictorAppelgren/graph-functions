  "content": "NEED TO KNOW\n\u2022 None Taylor Swift fans have connected the dots between a look featured in the singer's new era and a past red carpet outfit of hers\n\u2022 None The album art for The Life of a Showgirl depicts Swift in a red corset look by The Blonds, which fans are saying draws similarities to the Vivienne Westwood dress she wore to the 2025 Grammys\n\u2022 None Swift revealed the concept photos for TS12 the same day she appeared on the New Heights podcast\n\nLeave it to Taylor Swift fans to leave no stone unturned.\n\nSince the singer rolled out new details of her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, Swifties have been locked in finding what fashion breadcrumbs Swift left leading up to the big announcement. Now that art for TS12 has been revealed, there's been a lot more to dive into.\n\nThe Grammy winner's 12-track record is accompanied by images of Swift in \"Viva Las Vegas\" mode. The outfits are camp, glam and what you'd expect to see if a showgirl's wardrobe busted at the seams \u2014 and, most of all, point to a brand new aesthetic for Swift. But has it been in front of our eyes this whole time?\n\nWhen Sarah Chapelle, the fan behind the popular Instagram account @taylorswiftstyled, began rolling out the details on the clothes worn for the shoot, her followers began pointing out similarities between Swift's current fashion choices and her recent red carpet looks, alluding to the pop star channeling her Life of a Showgirl era before it was announced.\n\nFor one of the shoots, stylist Joseph Cassell Falconer outfitted Swift in a bejeweled ruby red bodysuit with an exaggerated scooped neckline. The design was pulled from The Blonds' Fall 2024 collection and was styled with equally glitzed-up gloves and fishnet tights, very much like how it was on the runway. It drew comparisons to the Vivienne Westwood mini she wore to the 2025 Grammys, especially with the mirrored necklines.\n\nWhen she opened up about the album on Travis and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast, Swift revealed that she was working on it last spring and summer when she was on the Eras Tour. So between then and now, it's completely possible that Swift drew inspiration from her very own photos for her big red carpet moment.\n\nFans also pointed out that that night, Swift wore Lorraine Schwartz earrings with 12 rubies on each, possibly planting another Easter egg.\n\nAfter all, she did leave fans in mystery when she attended the 2024 Grammys in an academia-coded Schiaparelli gown and custom Lorraine Schwartz watch necklace that alluded to The Tortured Poets Department, which she announced that night.\n\nHer stylist also dressed Swift in a skin-baring crystal chainmail look from the Area 2022 collection, a costume that jogged our memories of Swift's 2022 MTV VMAs equally sexy entrance.\n\nThat year, the Miss Americana star wore an Oscar de la Renta dress with draped crystal beading akin to the former outfit. She then changed into a starry and very performer-esque Moschino romper to celebrate her wins. Yes, the awards show may have been a month out from Swift releasing Midnights, however we can't help but hope that Swift was always channeling her inner showgirl.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nIf you're wondering if someone as busy as the global superstar has the time to map out clues this detailed, she said in her New Heights interview that's it's actually something she really enjoys to get fans involved with.\n\n\"There's dos and don'ts. Right? Like, I'm never gonna plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life. It's always gonna be towards music or a musical something I'm coming up with.\" She added that she loves scheming ideas that will leave those who are following to \"be like, oh my god.\"",

Credit : Bob Levey/TAS23/Getty; TAS2024/Getty NEED TO KNOW Taylor Swift announced her 12th album The Life of Showgirl on Aug. 12 on her boyfriend Travis Kelce's New Heights podcastNews of the pop star's record has left Swifties deep-diving into all her past style choices that may have hinted at her new orange-themed eraHere's what Swifties are decoding so far about Swift's wardrobe, lipstick and more Taylor Swift's new era has arrived \u2014 and as always there is a lot to unpack. On Aug. 12, the Grammy winner, 35, announced TS12 otherwise known as her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, alongside her boyfriend Travis Kelce on the New Heights podcast. And shortly after the news broke, it didn't take long for eagle-eyed Swifties to piece together all the clues pointing towards the theme of the pop star's 12th record. Spoiler: there's orange \u2014 tons of it. Over the years, Swift's albums have taken on a life of their own and it's all thanks to the meticulous attention she puts into her color-coded catalog that she references on and off stage, often through her outfits. Speak Now is purple, 1989 is blue, Reputation is black mixed with green, Red is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 red, and so on. So, when Swift brought out a mint-green and orange briefcase to reveal Life of a Showgirl, the internet went wild over all the style hints carefully planted by Swift in the recent past. Taylor Swift performs onstage during night four of \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" at La Defense on May 12, 2024, in Paris, France. Kevin Mazur/TAS24/Getty A Showgirl Wardrobe Some Swifties believe that she started Showgirl-ing her wardrobe during her record-breaking Eras Tour, but more specifically when she introduced a slew of new orange looks during the European leg last spring. At that time, the \"Fortnight\" singer debuted a fiery lineup of orange outfits, including a new tangerine Versace bodysuit with Christian Louboutins to match, a coral Versace blazer, a sunset-hued ruffled dress and an ombr\u00e9 yellow and orange Roberto Cavalli set. Offstage, Swift found ways to include orange in her night out outfits too, the most loudest sartorial moment being when she stepped out for dinner in London in a $2,000+ Vivienne Westwood plaid skirt suit with hints of the bold colorway. Mastermind Beauty Moves Other fans have noticed Swift making tweaks to her signature glam too. While there have been a few times she's appeared publicly without her famous bold red lipstick, her switch to a warmer cinnamon-toned coral shade has been more noticeable in Swift's beauty choices as of late. In October 2024, Lorrie Turk, the makeup artist behind Swift's most-talked glam moments, confirmed that her go-to lipstick for the Miss Americana star has been The Original Lipstick in the shade Morocco by Nars. The warm terracotta shade is what topped off Swift's grunge-core makeup for that year's MTV Video Music Awards last year and the finishing touch to the face she wore for Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs match on Sept. 5. Swift cheekily swiped a similar color lipstick on her pout for her appearance on New Heights too, signaling a change for the superstar's makeup bag. Taylor Swift at the 2025 Grammys. Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Bejeweled Details Next up, we have a numerical fashion Easter egg, which isn't surprising for someone's who's masterminded her brand around her lucky number 13. As a fan on X pointed out, Swift began repping the number 12 as early as the 2025 Grammys in February. The two-digit number is significant to the album, not only representing the date it was announced, but also in its placement in her lineup of records, which she possibly weaved into her jewelry selection for the awards show that night with her pair of 60-carat Lorraine Schwartz earrings that each featured 12 gleaming natural rubies. Could the \"T\" on her internet-breaking thigh chain stand for the album's first initial, even though we all thought it was a dedication to her man? Maybe, although the letter's symbolism is still up for interpretation. Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter. TAS2024/Getty Working Late Teasing Potential Collabs The next best question is who might feature on Swift's album. After all, the performer doesn't just lean into clues with her style \u2014 she's also forged some of the most powerful musical crossovers of all time, which leads us to what \u2014 or shall we say who \u2014 might show up on The Life of a Showgirl. So far, Swifties are predicting a potential crossover between Swift and her pal Sabrina Carpenter. The \"Espresso\" singer, 26, first opened for the Eras Tour in Latin America in 2023 then made a surprise appearance during Swift's show in New Orleans in October 2024. Fans on X and TikTok have been resharing concert clips of Swift's opening monologue for Carpenter that night. One line that screams collaboration? \"Put on some clothes,\" which is exactly what Carpenter captioned a recent Instagram post promoting her album, Man's Best Friend, which drops on Aug. 29. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. David Eulitt/Getty Images; Dustin Satloff/Getty Images Why Orange? Call it coincidence or calculation, but it's safe to say that all of this leads us to another big question: Why orange? Fans have been coming up with theories on that too and a plausible one points to Swift's love story with a certain Kansas City athlete. Thanks to color analysis Swifties (and yes our very own PEOPLE editors) are convinced that Kelce's football team's red and yellow colors make up Swift's new color scheme. And if you couple that with how smitten the two are with each other, well, it makes for one solid era! Close Leave a Comment Read more: Lifestyle Beauty & Style Celebrity Fashion"

The details fans were waiting for finally arrived during her appearance on New Heights, when Swift revealed that The Life of a Showgirl will be released on Oct. 3. The new project comes on the heels of Swift re-acquiring the masters of her first six albums in May 2025, when her announcement included a sneaky hint: 12 \"i's\" on the word \"thiiiiiiiiiiiiis,\" which fans took as a nod toward her 12th album, dubbed \"TS12\" by Swifties. From the Easter eggs she teased to the album's collaborators, here's everything to know about Taylor Swift's 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl.

Taylor Swift and her cat in October 2024. Taylor Swift/Instagram (2) As Swifties know, color coding, word searches, cryptic hints and Easter eggs are all part of Swift's \"Mastermind.\" In October 2022, she told The Washington Post that it's about \"turning new music into an event for my fans and trying to entertain them in playful, mischievous, clever ways.\" \"As long as they still find it fun and exciting, I\u2019ll keep doing it,\" Swift said \u2014 and that she did. Now that Swift has revealed her album, fans are tracing the clues she seemed to have been leaving for months. One hint that fans caught on to came as early as Aug. 12, 2024 \u2014 exactly one year before she announced the new album \u2014 when Swift stepped out in London wearing an orange and mint green plaid outfit. Related Stories Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s Relationship Timeline 13 Easter Eggs in Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department Spotify Exhibit Then, in October 2024, Swift posted a video from the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla., where she was making a stop on her Eras Tour, captioned, \"Back in the office\u2026 \ud83d\ude0e .\" In the video, there is a clear \"A12\" sign in the background, which fans suspect was her way of hinting at the Aug. 12 announcement. Perhaps one of the biggest Easter eggs came during her final stop on the Eras Tour. As the show came to a close, Swift told the crowd she would see them \"next era\" and exited the stage, walking through an orange door, which she confirmed was an Easter egg during her appearance on New Heights. Will The Life of a Showgirl have any collaborators? Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter perform during The Eras Tour on Oct. 26, 2024, in New Orleans.

When the Taylor Nation account teased a new album on Aug. 11, the post included 12 photos \u2014 11 of the pop star by herself, and one with the \"Espresso\" singer. But, that's not all: When Swift introduced her on the New Orleans stop of the Eras Tour with a playful phone call, she told her to \"put on some clothes,\" \u2014 the same phrase that Carpenter captioned an Instagram post just days before the reveal of The Life of a Showgirl.

And if you're looking to replicate that bold red lip, you'll need LiquiLUST Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick in Elson 4. Swift is up for a handful of awards at this year's ceremony. She's nominated for video of the year for \"All Too Well\" (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version), best longform video for \"All Too Well\" (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version), best cinematography for \"All Too Well\" (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version), best direction for \"All Too Well\" (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) and best editing for \"All Too Well\" (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version). Taylor Swift Shares Details on Upcoming 'Midnights' Album: 'The Stories of 13 Sleepless Nights' Dia Dipasupil/Getty Swift dropped her \"All Too Well\" (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) in November last year as part of the re-release of her music following the loss of her masters. The extended \"All Too Well,\" which originally appeared on Swift's 2012 album Red, has everything the original did with a more mature flair \u2014 plus a brand new short film starring O'Brien and Sadie Sink. As legend has it, \"All Too Well\" was inspired by a devastating breakup Swift weathered over a decade ago, and over the years, it has become a fan-favorite and one of the Grammy winner's most acclaimed songs, thanks to its vivid, cinematic storytelling. That storytelling is finally brought to the screen in All Too Well The Short Film, in which Sink plays a young Swift and O'Brien portrays her ex-lover, whom Swifties have long suspected to be Jake Gyllenhaal. Jeff Kravitz/Getty This appearance of Swift's comes after she popped up at Haim's London concert in July, wearing a matching look with the trio of sisters. Swift shared a TikTok video of the performers getting ready backstage, where fans can see Este, Danielle and Alana Haim wearing their signature black bikini tops and baggy black leather pants. The camera then pans to Swift who is sporting a similar outfit including a buckled Louis Vuitton crop top and matching black leather pants. Alongside the video \u2014 set to the tune of the children's song \"Copycat\" \u2014 Swift wrote, \"Hitting copypaste on your friends' looks like @haimtheband.\" Arturo Holmes/FilmMagic Look Back at the MTV VMA Vanguard Award Winners Through the Years The 2022 VMAs are airing live Sunday night from the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.

The 12-time Grammy winner is back at music's biggest night, this time nominated for six awards. And here are so many Reputation-era Easter eggs in her look, we're busy decoding them all. Swift nodded at her Reputation Taylor's Version re-release as she stepped out at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in a show-stopping black-and-white look featuring a strapless Schiaparelli gown with a thigh-high slit, worn with black opera gloves, and a number of telling accessories. Her custom made Lorraine Schwartz vintage watch that was turned into a choker appeared to be set to midnight, which could nod at the release time of the album drop. In fact, Swift piled on 300 carats of Lorraine Schwartz Diamonds. There are six chains on her necklace which lines up with Reputation being her sixth album and the black-and-white of it all nods to the original album's black-and-white cover. She wore her hair swept to the side in textured waves and completed the look with a vampy red lip. Kayla Oaddams / Getty Images At this year's show, Swift, 34, is being recognized for her work on Midnights, which is up for album of the year. (And if she wins, she'll become the first performing artist to win the category four times.) The pop superstar's single, \"Anti-Hero,\" is also recognized in the record of the year and song of the year categories. Gilbert Flores/Billboard via Getty Swift attended the Grammys last year, where she was nominated for four awards, rocking head-to-toe midnight blue in a Roberto Cavalli two-piece set, featuring a crystal-embellished long-sleeve crop top and matching floor-length skirt.
