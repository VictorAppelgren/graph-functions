  "description": "A stronger-than-anticipated inflation reading reminded investors that Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset just hours after the digital currency soared to another record high.",
  "content": "Bitcoin has been steadily rising for most of the past year as a result of the friendly legislative climate in Washington.\n\nA stronger-than-anticipated inflation reading reminded investors that Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset just hours after the digital currency soared to another record high.\n\nThe original cryptocurrency fell more than 4% in the minutes after a government report showed US wholesale inflation accelerated in July by the most in three years.\n\nThat sent stocks lower and tempered expectations for a reduction in interest rates, sending Bitcoin down from a high of $124,515 set late Wednesday in New York. The previous record was reached in July.\n\nHelping to fuel the shift in sentiment were comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Fox Business that the US would not be buying additional Bitcoin for President Donald Trump\u2019s crypto strategic reserve. Bitcoin was trading at about $118,100 as of 3:06 p.m. in New York.\n\nBitcoin has been steadily rising for most of the past year as a result of the friendly legislative climate in Washington ushered in by Trump. Public companies, led by Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy, have boosted the demand by following an increasingly popular corporate tactic of stockpiling the original cryptocurrency. The playbook has recently spread to smaller competitors, like Ether, leading to a broad rise across digital assets.\n\nStill, the retreat was quick Thursday. Leveraged bets on digital assets saw over $1 billion liquidations in the past 24 hours with $770 million and $269 million in long and short positions respectively, according to data complied by Coinglass.\n\n\u201cThe recent pullback in crypto prices following a hotter-than-forecast reading on core PPI seems to have shaken broader confidence in a Fed rate cut next month,\u201d said Thomas Perfumo, global economist at Kraken. \u201cFundamentally, elevated inflation continues to underscore the long\u2011term appeal of crypto assets with fixed or programmatic supply, which are structurally better positioned to preserve, and even grow in value.\u201d\n\nThe recent coordinated move between stocks and Bitcoin underscores how speculative market corners and mainstream benchmarks are drawing from the same well of optimism. Earlier this week, US inflation data landed in line with expectations this week \u2014 and strengthened bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, easing financial conditions and encouraging capital to flow from blue-chip equities to volatile digital tokens. Traders pared those bets Thursday.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s January executive order did say that the government will acquire more Bitcoin via \u201cbudget neutral\u201d strategies, many crypto bulls assumed this would actually involve buying more tokens, not just getting them through confiscations in criminal cases. Some even speculated that the US would revalue its gold reserve and use that to buy more tokens. Bessent threw cold water on that idea.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be buying that, but are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up. We\u2019re going to stop selling that,\u201d Bessent said on \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d on Fox. \u201cYou know, I believe that the Bitcoin reserve at today\u2019s prices is somewhere between $15 and $20 billion.\u201d\n\nBitcoin\u2019s market cap rose to around $2.5 trillion and Ether\u2019s to nearly $575 billion when prices peaked, according to CoinGecko. Ether was trading just below its almost four-year old record on Thursday, changing hands at around the $4,600 level.\n\nEther\u2019s rise has been propelled by sustained demand from newly active treasury firms, while Bitcoin\u2019s steadier climb has leaned on persistent exchange-traded inflows even as it has faced technical resistance. However, the second largest token has seen most of the liquidations in leveraged bets amid the sharp drawdown.\n\n\u201cCrypto has been positively correlated to equities with the relationship stronger for ETH than BTC,\u201d said Chris Newhouse, director of research at Ergonia. \u201cGeneral sentiment looks positive.\u201d",

      "text": "Here are the EVs you can buy for less than $35,000\n- Share via\nAs steep tariffs threaten to drive up car prices and an incentive for buying electric vehicles nears its expiration date, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are becoming harder to afford.\nFor those looking to make the switch to electric on a budget, there are just a few low-cost options. Here\u2019s a look at those available for under $35,000.\nIn the second quarter, 703 high-speed public charging stations opened in the U.S., close to the record. Chargers are showing up even in very rural areas.\nNissan Leaf\nThe 2025 Nissan Leaf starts at $28,140, according to the company website. The four-door compact sport-utility vehicle has a range of 212 miles and tops the list of the most affordable all-electric cars available in the U.S.\nThe Leaf, which originally hit roads in 2010, was the first mass-market electric vehicle, according to Nissan. It helped spur global interest in EVs and was the top-selling plug-in electric car until 2020, when it was surpassed by the Tesla Model 3.\nAccording to the auto industry site Edmunds, a major disadvantage of the Leaf is its charging port, which is not compatible with many public chargers. Known as a CHAdeMO, the technology was once more common but is being phased out.\nEdmunds also criticizes the Leaf for its small storage capacity and limited range, but lists comfort and a quiet ride as part of the car\u2019s appeal. Nissan also sells the Ariya, an electric crossover SUV with a range of 289 miles and a starting price around $39,000.\nHyundai Kona Electric\nThe 2025 Kona Electric has a manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price of $32,975. The SUV has a range of 261 miles and can charge from 10% to 80% in as little as 43 minutes with a direct current fast charger.\nThat\u2019s slower than some of its rivals, according to Edmunds, which also cites the Kona for \u201clackluster\u201d handling. The vehicle is easy to drive and park, however, and is a good value for its price, the site\u2019s reviewer said.\nHyundai has been working on all-electric vehicles since 1991, when the automaker developed the Sonata Electric Vehicle for testing. Its first commercially available EV was the Hyundai BlueOn, in 2010.\nChevrolet Equinox EV\nThe 2025 Equinox EV starts at $33,600, according to Chevrolet\u2019s website. It has a 319-mile range and touts itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s most affordable 315+ mile range EV.\u201d\nThe Chevrolet Blazer, another EV option from the American manufacturer, is one of this year\u2019s top-selling EVs. At Camino Real Chevrolet in Monterey Park, electric vehicles make up about 20% of sales, according to dealership President Robb Hernandez.\nEdmunds rated the Equinox EV a 7.5 out of 10 for performance, 8.5 out of 10 for comfort and a 10 out of 10 for range and efficiency. The car has more than 15 safety and driver assistance features.\nToyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid\nThe 2025 Prius Plug-in Hybrid is priced at $33,375 and has 44 miles of battery power. After that, the car switches to gasoline.\nThe Prius Plug-in Hybrid is a particularly good value for drivers who don\u2019t go more than 40 miles in one day and can charge frequently, said iSeeCars.com analyst Karl Brauer. Drivers without a home charger would have to navigate the public network, which can have long wait times. Imperfect charging infrastructure is a deterrent for some considering the switch to electric, Brauer said.\nToyota has revamped its Prius model, which once had a bad reputation for its appearance and low power. The Prius Plug-in has 220 horsepower and can accelerate from zero to 60 mph in less than 7 seconds.\nEdmunds rated the Prius Plug-in Hybrid an 8.5 out of 10 for performance, 7.5 out of 10 for comfort and a 9.5 out of 10 for fuel economy.\nKia Niro Plug-in Hybrid\nThe 2025 Niro Plug-in Hybrid has an all-electric range of 33 miles and a starting price of $34,490. It is one of Kia\u2019s three plug-in hybrid options, which also include the Sportage and the Sorento.\nAccording to Edmunds, the Niro Plug-in Hybrid has impressive fuel economy and stylish interior design, but lacks all-wheel drive. Edmunds rated the model an 8 out of 10 for performance, an 8.5 out of 10 for comfort and a 8.5 out of 10 for technology.\nKia debuted its first EV for the commercial market in 2015 with the release of the electric Kia Soul.\nAre more options coming?\nThe price of an EV is a significant barrier to a more complete transition to electric vehicles in the U.S., experts said.\nThe average price of a new electric vehicle in the U.S. is $56,910, according to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, while the average price of a gas-powered car was $49,740 in late 2024.\nDealerships are still waiting to see the full effects of new auto tariffs, which are expected to jack up the price of imported parts. Kelley Blue Book predicted overall vehicle prices could increase as much as $6,000 as a result of the tariffs.\nA $7,500 tax credit for buyers of new electric vehicles and one worth $4,000 for used EVs expire in September.\nThe higher price tag on EVs stems from expensive batteries and manufacturing. It can be pricier to insure an EV too \u2014 data collected by Insurify shows that EVs cost more than $4,000 to insure per year, 49% more than gas-powered cars. For first time EV owners, it can also cost up to $2,000 to install a home charger.\nStill, depending on where you live and the type of driving you do, it can be cheaper in the long run to own an EV. The cost of electricity is generally less than filling up at the pump, experts said.\nVehicles that burn gasoline or diesel are a major contributor to human-caused climate change, experts said, and transitioning away from fossil fuels is key to a healthy climate. Drivers hoping to reduce their reliance on gas also have the option of a plug-in hybrid, which runs on both gas and electricity.\nCar buyers will bear the brunt of the $30-billion cost of President Trump\u2019s tariffs, driving up already high U.S. auto prices by almost $2,000 per vehicle, consultant AlixPartners said.\nChinese automaker BYD sells ultra low-priced fully electric models, but they are not available in the U.S. The BYD Seagull starts at less than the equivalent of $8,000.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this perpetual challenge for automakers trying to price EVs competitively, at a compelling price point that average people would go and buy them,\u201d said Brauer, the analyst. If automakers are smart, he said, \u201cthey will keep it under $30,000, because with the loss of the incentive, there\u2019s a real psychological benefit to be able to say you\u2019re under $30,000.\u201d\nFord\u2019s answer to cheap Chinese EVs is a $30,000 electric pickup truck the company hopes to launch in 2027. The automaker this week said it will invest nearly $5 billion to build the truck and develop a smaller, lighter battery.\nAside from Tesla, no other major manufacturer will meet the state\u2019s 35% threshold for zero-emission vehicles in the 2026 model year, a trade group leader says.\nSlate Auto, a relatively new American automaker backed by Jeff Bezos, says it\u2019s building a basic EV with a starting price between $20,000 and $30,000 before customization. The company originally advertised the vehicle at less than $20,000, but had to backtrack after President Trump eliminated a $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles. The incentive expires Sept. 30, and Slate says the vehicles will be available in late 2026.\nTesla analyst Dan Ives said he expects several less expensive EV models to drop in the next six months, including Tesla\u2019s stripped down Model Y. Tesla has not confirmed the release date or price for the new Model Y.\nThe most affordable EVs already on the market usually don\u2019t go as far on a charge as higher-priced ones, Ives said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re still worth buying,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a very good value.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump\u2019s deal with Nvidia puts our national security up for sale to the highest bidder\n- Share via\nOne thing that can be said about Donald Trump\u2019s transactional approach to policy-making is that, as destructive as it might be to our economic health, it gives business leaders clear options to get what they want out of the White House.\nThe latest case-in-point are the deals struck by chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to secure licenses to export their products to China. The White House named the price \u2014 15% of their revenues from such sales \u2014 and the companies assented willingly.\nNever mind that the exports originally had been banned \u2014 by the Biden administration and Trump himself \u2014 because of national security concerns. Never mind that the U.S. Constitution explicitly prohibits charging any tax or duty on exports.\n\u2018Anybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed.\u2019\n\u2014 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\nNever mind that a stack of U.S. laws, including the Export Control Reform Act of 2018, which Trump signed, don\u2019t provide a pay-to-play escape clause from export restrictions.\nNever mind that the exports may strengthen the domestic industry and even the military of China, a country that has been the consistent target of Trump trade policies.\nDespite all that, Trump treated the deals as a win for the U.S. Explaining his side of the conversation when Nvidia asked for relief from the export ban, he related, \u201cI said, \u2018If I\u2019m going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something, because I\u2019m giving you a release.\u2019 \u201d\nUnder the circumstances, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that some trade professionals and investors see something corrupt in the arrangements. Among them is Christopher Padilla, an export control official under George W. Bush, who told the Washington Post: \u201cExport controls are in place to protect national security, not raise revenue for the government. This arrangement seems like bribery or blackmail, or both.\u2019\u2019\nNvidia, as it happens, has a written anti-corruption policy stating, \u201cWe do not tolerate bribery or corruption in our business.\u201d The policy bars \u201cpromising, offering, providing, or authorizing the provision of money or anything of value ... to obtain, retain, or direct regulatory approvals, contracts, business, or other benefits.\u201d\nLaw firms, universities, judges \u2014 they\u2019re all bowing to Trump\u2019s threats, even though they\u2019re almost surely illegal and his term is finite.\nWhen I asked Nvidia about the deal, the company referred me to the sole comment it has made in response to questions about it: \u201cWe follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.\u201d AMD didn\u2019t respond to my request for comment.\nThese deals are unprecedented; as the Financial Times observed, citing trade experts, \u201cno US company has ever agreed to pay a portion of their revenues to obtain export licenses.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no question that Nvidia lobbied ferociously for a lifting of the export ban. The company made a $1-million contribution to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Its CEO, Jensen Huang, met directly with Trump to discuss the ban; media reports say that Trump initially demanded a 20% fee, but Huang negotiated it down to 15%.\nAs has been the case with other Trump-negotiated trade deals, the details of this one are murky in the extreme. The terms haven\u2019t been reduced to writing.\nIndeed, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that its \u201clegality ... is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce,\u201d with an eye toward replicating it with other companies.\nAmong the questions is how the fee would be paid, and how the money would be spent.\nStill, what\u2019s known has caused concern for export regulators, experts and legislators.\n\u201cExport controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security,\u201d tweeted Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), chair of the House select committee on the Chinese Communist Party, \u201cand we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the Government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities.\u201d\nTwo federal judges in the same courthouse came to different opinions on whether AI firms are breaching copyrights, signaling more legal confusion.\nThe effect of this deal on other companies also raises the hackles of economists and trade experts.\n\u201cOther American semiconductor companies like Qualcomm and Intel may say, \u2018If we develop this cutting-edge chip and the government decides that it has some national security interest in that chip, we might have some of our revenue taken away as well,\u2019 \u201d says Kyle Handley, a trade economist at UC San Diego, \u201cso they may decide not to do the R&D investments and the innovation and hire the workers to develop those things.\u201d\nThe revenue payback \u201cwill certainly have a chilling effect,\u201d Handley told me, because the government fee \u201cmight make the initial investment appear uneconomical.\u201d That\u2019s especially so if the administration tries to apply the arrangement to industries such as software or pharmaceuticals. The export charge could become a particular burden on startups \u2014 Nvidia plainly has enough money to pay the fee, but many other innovative companies wouldn\u2019t.\nWhether or how the export tax can be stopped is an open question. For one thing, it\u2019s unclear who would have standing to bring a lawsuit to stop it. Nvidia and AMD have accepted the deal, so they presumably wouldn\u2019t file a case. Companies that fear the imposition of export fees on their own products might have to wait until they could show concrete damage to their own interests in order to bring a case in federal court.\nAs long as manufacturers such as Nvidia are willing to bow to Trump\u2019s demands, he may have a clear field.\nIf a legal challenge does emerge, the administration has tried to characterize the export fee as something other than a tax in order to circumvent the constitutional prohibition.\nNvidia developed the H20 chip at the heart of its deal specifically to address an export ban the Biden administration imposed on the company\u2019s sales to China in 2023.\nThe Chinese government, however, isn\u2019t enamored of the chip. Chinese regulators have been pressuring domestic companies to avoid the chips out of cybersecurity concerns, including suspicion that the chips could contain hidden code that could subject them to outside control. (Nvidia has denied that the chips contain any such back-door exposure.)\nThe chips also are outmoded for some AI applications compared with the company\u2019s top-of-the-line Blackwell series, which are still subject to a U.S. export ban.\nPlummeting sales at Target show that DEI is a lot more popular than businesses think.\nAs my colleague Queenie Wong reported, Trump seems to think that he and Nvidia\u2019s Huang had put something over on the Chinese. Trump called the H20 chip \u201cobsolete\u201d and said Huang was \u201cselling a essentially old chip.\u201d\nBut others say the H20s may yet be preferable to Chinese-designed chips for Chinese firms, although Chinese products are consistently improving.\n\u201cThe H20 is a potent accelerator of China\u2019s frontier AI capabilities, not an outdated AI chip,\u201d as 20 former government trade officials told Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who oversees trade policy, in a July 28 letter.\n\u201cIf the U.S. backs off of export controls to China, we believe that China\u2019s next generation of frontier AI will be built on the backs of the H20,\u201d the officials wrote. The chip \u201cwill not simply power consumer products or factory logistics; they will enable autonomous weapons systems, intelligence surveillance platforms, and rapid advances in battlefield decision-making.\u201d\nHow the export deal may affect Nvidia\u2019s top or bottom lines is murky, though its immediate effect doesn\u2019t seem all that significant.\nIn May, the company announced a $4.5-billion writedown of unsold H20 inventories in the first quarter ended April 27 because of the U.S. ban on H20 sales. But it still recorded $23.3 billion in operating profit for the quarter on sales of $44.1 billion. For its last full fiscal year ended Jan. 26, Nvidia reported a pre-tax profit of $84 billion on sales of $130.5 billion.\nIn stock market terms, Nvidia is the world\u2019s most valuable company, with a market value of $4.4 trillion; its price-earnings multiple is a robust 58.4. With a gain in share price so far this year of nearly 35%, it\u2019s one of a handful of AI-related companies that has kept the market buoyant despite investor concerns about a developing economic slowdown due in part to Trump\u2019s trade policies.\nBut the company is looking ahead to further incursions into the China market over the long term. \u201cThe China market is about $50 billion a year,\u201d Huang told Taiwan-based technology strategist Ben Thompson in May, bemoaning the need to leave behind \u201cthe profits that go with that, the scale that goes with that, the ecosystem building that goes with that\u201d while the export ban was in place. So it made sense to allow Nvidia to extract revenue and profits from the cross-border trade.\nChina is sure to power ahead on AI technology with or without Nvidia\u2019s chips, Huang said \u2014 \u201canybody who thought that one chess move to somehow ban China from H20s would somehow cut off their ability to do AI is deeply uninformed.\u201d\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nThe Trump administration\u2019s deal with Nvidia and AMD represents a fundamentally corrupt \u201cpay-to-play\u201d approach to national security policy that treats export restrictions as revenue opportunities rather than security measures. The arrangement circumvents laws designed to protect national security by allowing companies to buy their way out of export restrictions through a 15% revenue share with the government.\nThis precedent-setting deal violates constitutional prohibitions against export taxes and undermines existing export control laws, including the Export Control Reform Act of 2018. The arrangement lacks legal foundation and proper documentation, with the White House admitting its \u201clegality is still being ironed out.\u201d\nThe agreement will have a chilling effect on innovation and research investment across the semiconductor industry. Other companies may avoid developing cutting-edge technologies if they fear the government will later demand revenue shares as the price for export licenses, making initial investments appear uneconomical.\nDespite Trump\u2019s characterization of the H20 chips as \u201cobsolete,\u201d former government trade officials warn these processors remain potent accelerators of China\u2019s frontier AI capabilities. The chips will enable autonomous weapons systems, intelligence surveillance platforms, and rapid advances in battlefield decision-making, directly undermining the national security justifications for the original export restrictions.\nThe arrangement essentially puts national security considerations up for sale, allowing companies to override security-based export restrictions through financial payments rather than addressing the underlying security concerns that prompted the restrictions in the first place.\nDifferent views on the topic\nThe deal represents a pragmatic policy shift that acknowledges the reality of global semiconductor competition while generating revenue for the United States government. Trump confirmed that Nvidia and AMD agreed to give 15% of their China sales to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses, creating a new revenue stream from international trade[2].\nThis approach has fundamentally redefined Washington\u2019s export control policy in a way that balances national security concerns with economic interests. The arrangement allows U.S. companies to maintain their competitive position in crucial global markets while ensuring the government receives compensation for the strategic concessions[2].\nThe policy change reflects an understanding that complete export restrictions may be counterproductive, as China will continue developing AI capabilities regardless of U.S. chip access. Rather than losing all influence and revenue from this inevitable development, the deal ensures American companies and the government benefit from the trade relationship[1]."

      "text": "California\u2019s burger wars heat up as Habit Burger & Grill trolls In-N-Out with new billboard\n- Share via\nHabit Burger & Grill has doubled down on its provocative marketing strategy, updating its billboard trolling of burger giant In-N-Out for a second consecutive year after once again beating the chain in a national ranking.\nHabit has updated its existing billboard near Los Angeles International Airport, directly across from an In-N-Out location on Sepulveda Boulevard, to reflect its rival\u2019s drop to fourth place in USA Today\u2019s 10 Best fast-food burger rankings. The same sign from last year has been recycled, with the \u201c#2\u201d crossed out in red and replaced with \u201c#4.\u201d\nIn-N-Out CEO Lynsi Snyder moves her family east to Tennessee, citing California\u2019s difficult environment for raising kids and business operations.\nThe company \u2014 which took first place for the best fast-food burger (the Double Char) \u2014 also earned top rankings from USA Today for best fast casual restaurant and best fast-food side dish for its tempura green beans.\n\u201cWe congratulated In-N-Out on being #2 last year with a billboard,\u201d Jack Hinchliffe, chief marketing officer at Habit, said in a press release. \u201cThis year, we were going to send a gift but couldn\u2019t afford the postage to Tennessee, so we saved a few bucks and reused the same billboard. We just had to swap out the 2 for a 4.\u201d\nThe Tennessee reference is a pointed jab at In-N-Out\u2019s eastward expansion. In January 2023, the company announced plans to establish an Eastern territory office in Franklin, Tenn., by 2026. Last month, billionaire owner and Chief Executive Lynsi Snyder announced on a conservative podcast that she is personally leaving California for Tennessee.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great things about California, but raising a family is not easy here. Doing business is not easy here,\u201d Snyder said during her appearance on a conservative podcast. She specifically cited COVID-19 pandemic-era restrictions as particularly challenging for business operations.\nSnyder\u2019s departure represents a seismic shift for the leader of a brand that has been a pillar of California fast-food culture for more than 75 years.\nThe move places In-N-Out among a growing list of major companies relocating from California, including electric car maker Tesla, financial services firm Charles Schwab, and oil giant Chevron, all citing regulatory challenges, operational costs and policy disagreements.\nDespite a growing narrative that California is hostile to businesses, experts say the state still has unmatched advantages.\nThe timing of Habit\u2019s latest marketing gambit coincides with In-N-Out\u2019s continued decline in the annual USA Today rankings. In-N-Out ranked sixth in 2023, second in 2024, and fourth this year.\nUSA Today\u2019s 10 Best contests rely on expert panels to select nominees, followed by public voting to determine winners. While not scientific, the rankings have gained attention among consumers.\nThe billboard campaign represents an asymmetric marketing battle between two companies of vastly different sizes. In-N-Out operates more than 400 locations across eight states, while Habit has more than 385 restaurants across 14 states and international markets since opening its first location in Santa Barbara in 1969.\n\u201cWe were born in Santa Barbara in 1969, remain proudly Californian and we\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Hinchliffe said.\nBoth chains maintain their headquarters in Irvine, located about seven miles apart, though In-N-Out plans to consolidate its California operations in Baldwin Park, where Harry Snyder, Lynsi Snyder\u2019s grandfather, co-founded the company in 1948.\nThe In-N-Out billboard is part of a broader campaign by Habit targeting multiple competitors. The company has deployed mobile billboards to locations near other chains that made the USA Today rankings, including Chipotle, Five Guys, Shake Shack and Panera Bread, offering congratulatory messages on their lower rankings.\nIn-N-Out did not respond to a request for comment."
