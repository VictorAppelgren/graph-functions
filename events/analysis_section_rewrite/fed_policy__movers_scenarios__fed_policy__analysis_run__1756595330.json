      "feedback": "The draft meets the format and handle‑mapping requirements but can be tightened for clarity and precision: 1) Collapse each driver chain into a single, linear causal sentence (e.g., “Fed Sep 16‑17 rate cut → 10‑20 bp yield drop (97MD1FHW8) → 30 bp equity discount (B1KYJ1GPU) → 200 bp DXY fall (Z7O1DCHS7) → spx +3‑5 % (B1KYJ1GPU)”). 2) Shorten the “What to watch” field to one concise clause (e.g., “Watch Sep 5 payrolls, Sep 16‑17 Fed minutes, Aug Q3 tech earnings”). 3) Adjust probabilities to reflect relative likelihoods (e.g., first Up 50 %, second Up 45 %, first Down 55 %, second Down 35 %) and cite the same IDs used in the driver chain. 4) Ensure each line’s catalyst window is explicit and tied to the causal path; for the second Down line, separate the two scenarios or combine them into a single driver phrase (“Fed holds/raises rates or tariffs reinstated → …”). 5) Remove redundant watch items that duplicate drivers already listed. These edits will preserve the 4‑item structure while enhancing coherence, reducing verbosity, and aligning each line with the strict “Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %” template.",
