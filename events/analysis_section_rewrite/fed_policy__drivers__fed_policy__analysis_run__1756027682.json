      "feedback": "Strong base-case and clear numeric anchors (21.2% CAGR to 2030; CPI 2.7%; dividend yield 1.8–2.2%; 12–18% justness premium; oil path via 2.5 mbpd supply in 2025) are the draft’s core strengths, but the piece needs a sharper causal chain linking macro, policy, flows/positioning, and valuation; it should replace the single base-case with a small, explicit scenario framework (base, upside, downside) that maps how inflation, cost of capital, and policy shifts drive earnings visibility and multiples, including explicit WACC/EV/FCF or P/E sensitivities (e.g., how a 50–100bp wage-inflation shock or a 50bp–150bp rise in discount rates would compress multiples). Strengthen first-principles grounding by decomposing the 21.2% long-run CAGR into AI-driven productivity, cloud capex intensity, and data moat advantages, and attach concrete channel mechanics to the labor-market premium; then translate those channels into quantifiable valuation implications. Expand the cross-topic synthesis to 5–7 decisive signals: next CPI/wage prints, 10Y yield moves, cloud-capex demand or AI adoption metrics, oil-price path (IEA 2.5 mbpd 2025) and its inflation/risk-sentiment implications, and regulatory policy updates on competition/tariffs (with explicit thresholds for when they would shift the view); add near-term catalysts (IBM’s hiring pause, major cloud provider earnings) and clear invalidation cues (persistent inflation/shock to cost of capital, or a policy reversal that meaningfully lowers discount rates). tighten the narrative by removing non-core noise (crime dynamics; marijuana/ieb intel stories) or explicitly tying them to channels if retained; ensure every assertion ties to a cited ID (0G3A676BP, V7GV8YBQU, TN66GHPAT, 4LQD15CFU, J99EM2TPZ, 9W8ZUIBDY) and reconcile potential conflicts (oil oversupply versus inflation risk premia) within the base-case. Finally, deliver a concise watch-list with numeric triggers and thresholds, and present the conclusion as a directional stance with its fragility and the most material near-term pivot points.",
