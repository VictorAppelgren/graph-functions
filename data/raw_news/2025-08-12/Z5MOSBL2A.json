  "description": "Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier faces first-ever indictment under Magnitsky Act for human rights violations.",
  "content": "U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro on Tuesday announced an indictment in Washington, D.C., accusing Jimmy \u201cBarbecue\u201d Ch\u00e9rizier and Bazile Richardson, a naturalized U.S. citizen, of conspiring to send U.S. funds to finance Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s Haitian gang.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) said Ch\u00e9rizier is a fugitive and is believed to be in Haiti.\n\nHis co-defendant, Richardson, who also goes by \u201cFredo,\u201d \u201cFred Lion,\u201d \u201cLeo Danger,\u201d and \u201cLepe Blode,\u201d was arrested in Pasadena, Texas on July 23.\n\nPirro said Tuesday that Ch\u00e9rizier is a gang leader who orchestrated and committed various acts of violence against Haitians.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. sanctioned Ch\u00e9rizier under the Magnitsky Act for his alleged human rights violations. His indictment makes it the first of its kind for an individual sanctioned under the international Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, Pirro added.\n\nRichardson and Ch\u00e9rizier grew up together in Haiti, though the former later became a naturalized U.S. citizen and was living in North Carolina.\n\nRichardson was indicted for allegedly sending money to Ch\u00e9rizier, knowing that he had been sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act.\n\n\u201cI want to let the public know that anyone who was giving money to Ch\u00e9rizier, also known as Barbecue, because of his violent acts in his home country, cannot say \u2018I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know that he was sanctioned by the U.S government,\u2019\u201d Pirro said. \u201cThey will be prosecuted, and we will find them because they are supporting an individual who was committing human rights abuses. And we will not look the other way.\u201d\n\nThe State Department\u2019s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program announced Tuesday that it is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Ch\u00e9rizier. Anyone with information about his whereabouts is encouraged to contact the State Department.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good reason that there\u2019s a $5 million reward for information leading to Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s arrest. He\u2019s a gang leader responsible for heinous human rights abuses, including violence against American citizens in Haiti,\u201d Pirro said. \u201cThe U.S. government sanctioned Ch\u00e9rizier in 2020 because he was responsible for an ongoing campaign of violence, including the 2018 La Saline massacre, in which 71 people were killed, more than 400 houses were destroyed, and at least seven women raped by armed gangs.\u201d\n\nCourt documents show that Ch\u00e9rizier is a former officer in the Haitian National Police and leader of a gang known as the Revolutionary Forces of the G9 Family and Allies, which helped create a gang alliance called Viv Ansanm. The alliance united many of Haiti\u2019s criminal gangs in opposition to the legitimate government of Haiti.\n\nThe indictment alleges Ch\u00e9rizier and Richardson, after Ch\u00e9rizier was sanctioned, led a wide-ranging conspiracy with people in the U.S., Haiti and other places to raise money for Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s gang activities, in violation of the sanctions.\n\nSpecifically, the two men solicited money from members of the Haitian diaspora in the U.S.\n\n\u201cAfter sending funds to intermediaries in Haiti for Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s benefit, the U.S. and Haitian co-conspirators would send Ch\u00e9rizier images of receipts from money transfers,\u201d the DOJ said. \u201cCh\u00e9rizier used these funds principally to pay salaries to the members of his gang and to acquire firearms from illicit firearms dealers in Haiti.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration, in May, designated Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif \u2013 two of Haiti\u2019s most powerful gang networks \u2013 as foreign terrorist organizations and specifically designated terrorists.\n\nThe move was aimed at disrupting the gangs\u2019 operations and supporting efforts to restore order in the troubled Caribbean nation.\n\nThe designations brought serious legal consequences. Individuals or entities that provide material support to Viv Ansanm or Gran Grif could face criminal charges, loss of immigration benefits or removal from the U.S.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been sidelined from peace talks between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday because the Russian leader extended the invitation to meet, according to the White House.\n\"The president is agreeing to this meeting, at the request of President Putin,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday. \"And the goal of this meeting for the president is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.\"\n\"I think the president of the United States getting in the room with the president of Russia ,sitting face-to-face rather than speaking over the telephone will give this president the best indication of how to end this war and where this is headed,\" Leavitt said.\nVLADIMIR PUTIN TO RETURN TO US FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE\nMeanwhile Zelenskyy has remained firm that any decisions to end the war made without Ukraine will prove futile.\n\"Any decisions made against us, any decisions made without Ukraine \u2014 they are simultaneously decisions against peace,\" Zelenskyy said in a Saturday statement. \"These are dead decisions; they will never work. And what we all need is a real, living peace, one that people will respect.\"\nOther European allies have Ukraine's back. A group of European leaders issued a statement Saturday claiming that the \"path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\"\nTrump told reporters Monday that he predicted he\u2019d know within minutes whether Putin was serious about hashing out a deal or not. He also acknowledged that Russia and Ukraine would have to navigate some \"land swapping\" issues as part of an agreement.\nSUMMIT WITH PUTIN SET TO TOP TRUMP\u2019S AGENDA THIS WEEK AS UKRAINE WAR TAKES CENTER STAGE\nTrump also said he would be in contact with Zelenskyy and other European leaders following the meeting with Putin.\n\"If it\u2019s a fair deal, I will reveal it to the European Union leaders and the NATO leaders and also to President Zelenskyy,\" Trump said. \"I may say, \u2018lots of luck, keep fighting,\u2019 or I may say we can make a deal.\"\nWhen asked if the meeting would pave the way for a peace deal, or whether the meeting would simply serve as an opportunity for Trump to feel out if a deal was even possible, Leavitt said the administration wasn\u2019t ruling out either option.\nTRUMP, PUTIN WILL HOLD FIRST IN-PERSON MEETING SINCE UKRAINE INVASION NEXT WEEK IN ALASKA\n\"I think both can be true, right?\" Leavitt said. \"The president has always said he wants a peace deal. He wants to see this war come to an end. But this bilateral meeting is a bilateral meeting between one party in this two party war. Right. You need both countries to agree to a deal. The president is accepting this bilateral meeting with Putin on Friday, and I will let him speak further to it after it concludes about how he felt it went.\"\nTrump and Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, Friday \u2014 despite the president's comments in recent days that the two would meet in Russia.\n\"There were many sites discussed, but of course, Alaska is a state within the United States of America,\" Leavitt said. \"So the president is very honored and looks forward to hosting President Putin on American soil.\""

      "text": "Gang leader named \u2018Barbecue\u2019 is now most powerful man in Haiti \u2014 as US evacuates Americans\nHaiti\u2019s most notorious gang leader, known as \u201cBarbecue,\u201d may be the most powerful man in the nation as the prime minister remains unable to return home.\nOn Sunday, the US announced that troops had evacuated Americans from the US Embassy and additional forces were brought in to secure the diplomatic compound in Port-au-Prince.\nJimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, leader of the notorious \u201cG9 and Family\u201d gang, is in command of the bulk of the gunmen stirring anarchy in the capital \u2014 and he vowed to fight until embattled Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigns.\n\u201cI am ready to make an alliance with the devil, ready to sleep in the same bed as the devil,\u201d Ch\u00e9rizier told his supporters last week as his fighters destroyed police stations and other government facilities.\nSome claim that the rifle-wielding 47-year-old mobster\u2019s nickname comes from his penchant for setting his victims on fire \u2014 though he says it\u2019s an old moniker his mother gave him as a boy.\nHe likened himself to Martin Luther King Jr. during an interview with the New Yorker last year, and was previously a member of the Haitian national police.\nHe was expelled from the force in 2018 for alleged ties to a number of horrific crimes, including the slaughter in the La Saline slums in which 71 people were killed, seven women were raped and 400 homes were burned down, according to official reports.\nCh\u00e9rizier, who denied any wrongdoing, went on to take over the G9 Family, which controls many of the slums and streets of Port-au-Prince.\nThe gang leader\u2019s influence in the capital is so large that many view him as the man who will take the reins as Henry\u2019s administration struggles to maintain order.\n\u201cUnfortunately, Barbecue is now the most powerful man in Haiti,\u201d Judes Jonathas, an independent consultant based in Port-au-Prince, told the Guardian.\nAfter Haiti\u2019s government declared a state of emergency last Sunday, videos and images from social media have shed light on how Port-au-Prince has deteriorated into a war-torn city on the edge.\nOne such viral video from the Associated Press shows dozens of civilians running for their lives, screaming and ducking as gunshots are heard behind them.\nWhat to know about the violence in Haiti:\n- Haiti has declared a state of emergency after gang violence and anarchy broke out in the Caribbean nation.\n- Thousands of inmates have taken to the street after two separate prison breaks in Port-au-Prince.\n- Gang leader Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier \u2014 a former national police member who is known as \u201cBarbecue\u201d \u2014 seized power and has vowed to continue fighting until Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigns.\n- Henry is currently in Kenya where he was on an official trip. He has promised to resign once a transitional council is established.\n- The US military has airlifted embassy workers out of Haiti, but some Americans and other foreigners remain trapped in the embattled country.\n- US missionaries have told The Post that the embassy hasn\u2019t been helpful during the crisis.\n- \u201cMy fear is that we will be caught in the middle of something really dangerous. We\u2019re already on the front lines of it, we\u2019re in a bad area,\u201d Jill Dolan, who runs an orphanage, said.\nOther images show armored vehicles patrolling the streets and heavily armed military personnel escorting a group of civilians through a nearly deserted part of the city.\nAs the situation continues to escalate, the US military said Sunday it has deployed additional security forces to the US Embassy and called for all nonessential personnel to evacuate.\nUS Southern Command said an aircraft had conducted an evacuation at the embassy building, noting that only Americans were aboard.\n\u201cThis airlift of personnel into and out of the Embassy is consistent with our standard practice for Embassy security augmentation worldwide, and no Haitians were on board the military aircraft,\u201d according to the Southcom statement.\nUS officials have said proposals for sending a UN-authorized security force to Haiti have been unsuccessful so far, with Henry failing to secure a deal in January while in Kenya.\nThe embattled prime minister remains unable to return home as he arrived in Puerto Rico last Tuesday.\nLuis Abinader \u2014 president of the Dominican Republic, which borders Haiti on the island of Hispaniola \u2014 warned Henry that he was not welcome in the neighboring country.\n\u201cGiven the current situation, the presence of the Haitian prime minister in the Dominican Republic is not considered appropriate,\u201d Abinader said in a statement Saturday. \u201cThis decision reflects the firm position of the Dominican government to safeguard its national security and stability.\u201d\nThe violence in Haiti has been mainly aimed at Henry, who was appointed prime minister following the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021.\nAlthough Henry had pledged to step down by early February, he later said the nation\u2019s security needed to be re-established first in order to ensure free and fair elections by mid-2025.\nWith Post wires"

His indictment makes it the first of its kind for an individual sanctioned under the international Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, Pirro added.\nRichardson and Ch\u00e9rizier grew up together in Haiti, though the former later became a naturalized U.S. citizen and was living in North Carolina.\nRichardson was indicted for allegedly sending money to Ch\u00e9rizier, knowing that he had been sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act.\nLEGAL IMMIGRANT'S STATUS REVOKED OVER \u2018CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE, GANG SUPPORT\u2019 IN HAITI: ICE\n\"I want to let the public know that anyone who was giving money to Ch\u00e9rizier, also known as Barbecue, because of his violent acts in his home country, cannot say \u2018I didn't know. I didn't know that he was sanctioned by the U.S government,\u2019\" Pirro said. \"They will be prosecuted, and we will find them because they are supporting an individual who was committing human rights abuses. And we will not look the other way.\"\nThe State Department\u2019s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program announced Tuesday that it is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Ch\u00e9rizier. Anyone with information about his whereabouts is encouraged to contact the State Department.\n\"There\u2019s a good reason that there\u2019s a $5 million reward for information leading to Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s arrest. He\u2019s a gang leader responsible for heinous human rights abuses, including violence against American citizens in Haiti,\" Pirro said. \"The U.S. government sanctioned Ch\u00e9rizier in 2020 because he was responsible for an ongoing campaign of violence, including the 2018 La Saline massacre, in which 71 people were killed, more than 400 houses were destroyed, and at least seven women raped by armed gangs.\"\nCourt documents show that Ch\u00e9rizier is a former officer in the Haitian National Police and leader of a gang known as the Revolutionary Forces of the G9 Family and Allies, which helped create a gang alliance called Viv Ansanm. The alliance united many of Haiti's criminal gangs in opposition to the legitimate government of Haiti.\nThe indictment alleges Ch\u00e9rizier and Richardson, after Ch\u00e9rizier was sanctioned, led a wide-ranging conspiracy with people in the U.S., Haiti and other places to raise money for Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s gang activities, in violation of the sanctions.\nSpecifically, the two men solicited money from members of the Haitian diaspora in the U.S.\n\"After sending funds to intermediaries in Haiti for Ch\u00e9rizier\u2019s benefit, the U.S. and Haitian co-conspirators would send Ch\u00e9rizier images of receipts from money transfers,\" the DOJ said. \"Ch\u00e9rizier used these funds principally to pay salaries to the members of his gang and to acquire firearms from illicit firearms dealers in Haiti.\"\nThe Trump administration, in May, designated Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif \u2013 two of Haiti\u2019s most powerful gang networks \u2013 as foreign terrorist organizations and specifically designated terrorists.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe move was aimed at disrupting the gangs\u2019 operations and supporting efforts to restore order in the troubled Caribbean nation.\nThe designations brought serious legal consequences. Individuals or entities that provide material support to Viv Ansanm or Gran Grif could face criminal charges, loss of immigration benefits or removal from the U.S."

      "text": "Haiti\u2019s top gang leader \u2018Barbeque\u2019 threatens politicians as fires break out in capital\nA powerful gang leader in Haiti has issued a threatening message aimed at political leaders who would participate in a planned transition council, as fires broke out amid a fresh surge of violence in the Caribbean nation\u2019s capital.\nNearby countries bolstered their border security and withdrew staff from embassies while plans to send a long-awaited international security force remain uncertain.\nAfter unpopular Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced on Monday he would step down once the council was in place, the capital, Port-au-Prince, was initially quieter, but violence appeared to be flaring up again as of late Wednesday, with a shootout in one neighborhood and an attack on the police academy early on Thursday.\nA fire broke out at the main penitentiary, emptied of prisoners by armed men earlier this month.\nThick black smoke earlier billowed out from the facility, but the fire appeared to be out by Thursday afternoon, when local media showed heavily armed police entering the partially blackened site filled with mounds of trash.\nReuters could not immediately establish if any people had remained in the jail or what sparked the blaze.\nA police union said the national police chief Frantz Elbe\u2019s house had also been set on fire on Thursday.\nIt did not say whether anyone had been hurt or give details on Elbe\u2019s whereabouts.\nHaiti is struggling to resolve a long-running political and humanitarian crisis.\nHeavily armed gangs have taken over much of the capital, and rights groups have reported widespread killings, kidnappings and sexual violence.\nHundreds of thousands of people have been displaced.\nHenry, who was never elected, had been appointed prime minister by President Jovenel Moise in 2021, shortly before Moise was assassinated.\nHenry repeatedly postponed elections.\nThe comments from gang alliance head Jimmy \u201cBarbeque\u201d Cherizier were recorded on Wednesday and distributed via a rambling seven-minute audio message widely shared on Thursday morning on messaging platform WhatsApp.\nWhat to know about the violence in Haiti:\n- Haiti has declared a state of emergency after gang violence and anarchy broke out in the Caribbean nation.\n- Thousands of inmates have taken to the street after two separate prison breaks in Port-au-Prince.\n- Gang leader Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier \u2014 a former national police member who is known as \u201cBarbecue\u201d \u2014 seized power and has vowed to continue fighting until Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigns.\n- Henry is currently in Kenya where he was on an official trip.

We\u2019re already on the front lines of it, we\u2019re in a bad area,\u201d Jill Dolan, who runs an orphanage, said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have any shame?\u201d said Cherizier, directing his remarks at politicians who he said were looking to join the council. \u201cYou have taken the country where it is today. You have no idea what will happen,\u201d he added.\n\u201cI\u2019ll know if your kids are in Haiti, if your wives are in Haiti \u2026 if your husbands are in Haiti,\u201d he said in an apparent threat to their families. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna run the country all your family ought to be there.\u201d\nIn his remarks, Cherizier said the resignation of Henry was only \u201ca first step in the battle\u201d for the island nation of around 11 million.\nHaiti\u2019s government again extended a nightly curfew through Sunday, in an order signed by acting Prime Minister Michel Boisvert.\nHenry has been stranded abroad since trying to return from a trip to Kenya to secure support for a security mission.\nRegional bloc CARICOM has detailed the political parties and other social sectors set to make up the nine-member transition council that will take over from Henry.\nNegotiations over the council were brokered by Caribbean leaders and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but formal appointments are yet to be made.\nOn Wednesday, the leader of a party declined an offer of a voting member of the council, backing instead an alternate three-member transition council that would empower former coup leader Guy Philippe, who was recently imprisoned in the United States and is seeking an amnesty for gang leaders.\nEMBASSY REDUCTIONS\nWith Haiti\u2019s political future in limbo and the timing of the long-delayed Kenyan-led security mission unclear, the already sparse international presence in Haiti has been further receding.\nCanada announced a reduction to its embassy staff that will leave only essential employees in the country, and said the embassy was temporarily closed to the public.\nThat follows similar drawdowns by the United Nations and at the US embassy.\nThe country\u2019s main cargo port said that despite military reinforcements, it would not receive vessels until further notice, as it assesses damages to containers and infrastructure.\nMajor passenger cruise line Royal Caribbean Group also suspended for a week its regular visits to Labadee, its private resort in northern Haiti.\nFearing a spread of instability in the region, Britain said it was bolstering security in the Turks and Caicos Islands, an overseas territory, as did the governor of the US state of Florida.\nThe Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispanolia with Haiti, closed its shared border with Haiti last year and has regularly deported Haitians.\nThe US southeast coast guard said, \u201cAt this time, irregular migration flows through the Caribbean remain low.\u201d\nDominican media reported that aviation authorities in a press conference rejected a UN statement claiming that an airbridge would be set up from the country to bring humanitarian aid to Haiti, maintaining the airspace would remain closed.\nAid group Mercy Corps said Port-au-Prince residents were being reduced to \u201cforced nomads,\u201d seeking refuge from shootings in temporary shelters with family or strangers and battling constant uncertainty, food shortages, trauma, illness and overcrowding.\nMarie Love Elucien, 25, who lost her home and shop due to gangs, told Mercy Corps that she was most afraid for her young daughter: \u201cI\u2019m worried she\u2019s going to have a fit and become paralyzed because every time she hears the shots she jumps and screams.\n\u201cShe cries incessantly and no one can touch her; she becomes hysterical and uncontrollable,\u201d she said.\nMore than 360,000 people are internally displaced in Haiti, according to UN estimates.\nGina Antoine, a 43-year-old pregnant mother of three, told Mercy Corps that she was exhausted from moving between neighborhoods and could not run anymore.\n\u201cWe face inhumane situations daily, walking among corpses. Gangs can attack at any moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI have nowhere else to go. I wish everything could return to normal.\u201d"
