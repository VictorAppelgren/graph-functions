  "title": "Analysis-India's ethanol drive imperils its push for edible oil self-sufficiency",
  "description": "NASHIK, India (Reuters) -India's drive to produce more ethanol is leading its farmers to switch away from growing oilseeds, undermining government efforts in the world's largest buyer of cooking oils to reduce costly imports.  Helped by record corn and rice harvests, New Delhi is using more of the grains to make ethanol and meet its target of blending 20% of the biofuel additive with gasoline.  The process, however, produces Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS), a protein-rich byproduct that is flooding the animal feed market.",
  "content": "NASHIK, India (Reuters) -India's drive to produce more ethanol is leading its farmers to switch away from growing oilseeds, undermining government efforts in the world's largest buyer of cooking oils to reduce costly imports.\n\nHelped by record corn and rice harvests, New Delhi is using more of the grains to make ethanol and meet its target of blending 20% of the biofuel additive with gasoline. The process, however, produces Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS), a protein-rich byproduct that is flooding the animal feed market.\n\nThe DDGS glut is weakening demand for oilmeals, depressing oilseed prices and prompting farmers in the South Asian nation to plant more corn and rice in place of soybeans and groundnuts - despite New Delhi's push to grow more of the oilseeds to ease imports.\n\nDDGS production in India has soared some 13-fold over the past two years to an estimated 5.5 million tons by 2025, according to industry officials.\n\n\"DDGS is a pain in the neck,\" said Aashish Acharya, vice president at Patanjali Foods Ltd, a leading soybean processor. \"Feed makers are substituting oilmeals with DDGS since it is cheaper.\"\n\nThe shift is visible in government sowing data. As of August 8, oilseed acreage - including soybean and groundnut - was down 4% from last year, while corn area jumped 10.5% to a record high.\n\nMadhukar Londhe, a farmer in Nashik in the western state of Maharashtra, said he had cut his soybean area to one acre from six, planting the rest with corn - which has the added benefit of providing fodder from its stalks for his five milking cows.\n\nNearly two dozen farmers in the area that Reuters spoke to said they had made a similar switch.\n\n\"Soybean prices were too low, so I couldn't even cover my costs in the past two years. Corn did better for me last year, so I've decided to grow more of it,\" Londhe said.\n\nThe reduction in oilseed planting is a concern for a country that spent more than $17 billion on edible oil imports last year and is making concerted efforts to reduce that dependence.\n\nRising demand for fried foods and sweets by a growing and increasingly prosperous population has driven consistent growth in edible oil consumption at 3%-4% annually, said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India.\n\nEdible oil imports have climbed to 16 million tons in 2023-24 from 4.4 million tons two decades ago, making India the world's largest buyer of vegetable oils such as palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and soyoil and sunflower oil from Argentina, Brazil, Russia, and Ukraine.",
