  "title": "The Beats Studio Pro are almost half off at Amazon \u2014 save $170 on Labor Day",
  "description": "It's the perfect excuse to upgrade.",
  "content": "SAVE $170: As of Sept. 1, Beats Studio Pro headphones are on sale for $179.95 at Amazon. That's a saving of 49% on list price.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting for the right time to upgrade your headphones, Labor Day might be it. As of Sept. 1, Amazon has dropped the price of the Beats Studio Pro headphones by more than $100. What's stopping you from upgrading this Labor Day?\n\nBeats Studio Pro headphones are now priced at $179.95 on Amazon. This deal is specific to the navy headphones, but for just $20 more, you can choose from the whole range of options.\n\nThere's a lot to like about these headphones, but as with all Beats products, the premium sound quality with noise cancellation and spatial audio support makes everything else just a bonus. Depending on the level of sound immersion you want, you can choose from Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode. Transparency mode still gives you that great Beats sound, but also keeps you alert to any outside noises happening around you.\n\nThe built-in voice-targeting mics also do a solid job of cutting through background noise, so whether you\u2019re taking work calls or sending a long voice note, everything comes through crisp and clear.\n\nBattery life is another win; enjoy up to 40 hours on a single charge, and if you\u2019re running out the door, a 10-minute Fast Fuel top-up gets you four extra hours of playback. Perfect for those of us who are constantly forgetting to plug in overnight.\n\nGet this Labor Day deal from Amazon before the day is done.",

      "text": "My Beats Fit Pro made it through two marathons. Here\u2019s why I still love them.\nI've tested many earbuds over the years and always struggled to find that perfect pair. I wanted something that doesn't fall out as soon as you pick up the pace, something that doesn't run out of battery in just a few hours, and something with the durability to last more than a couple of months. It truly was a fruitless mission.\nThat was until I discovered the Beats Fit Pro. My attention was drawn to their unique design, with the sharp-looking silicon tip piquing my interest. As a runner, my key focus is finding earbuds that fit securely. Could these earbuds offer what I was looking for?\nIn short, yes.\nWhy the Beats Fit Pro work for runners\nThe silicon tip makes for the best, most comfortable-designed earbud I've ever tried. It perfectly lodges into your ear and stays put, no matter what.\nIn over two years, I can confidently say they have never dislodged in my ear during a run (there was that one ill-fated treadmill run when I tried to pause, pulled an earbud out, and swifty face planted the moving conveyor, but that's on me), no matter what the intensity. These earbuds have endured two marathons, countless speed sessions, and the most tiresome gym workouts. Trust me when I say, these are truly workout approved.\nAnd even better, they\u2019re rated IPX4 for sweat and water resistance. So while they\u2019re not fully waterproof, they\u2019re ready for tough workouts, sweaty runs, and wet weather.\nAnd I can only praise the battery life. I'm a chronic 'forget to charge devices' kind of girl, so in the past this has meant many a run without music (it's as bad as it sounds). But the Beats Fit Pro often lasts me weeks without needing to be charged.\nAnd while running with music is often a necessity, so is the need to stay safe and aware of your surroundings. That's why another of my favorite features is the noise cancelation. You get full noise cancelation, transparency mode, and the option to switch it off entirely. The transparency mode lets me listen to my music but doesn't block anything else out. It's like the music is playing on a speaker rather than directly in my ears.\nThey also benefit from Apple's H1 chip, and you can tell. The bass is punchy but not overwhelming, vocals are clear, and the quality is generally just great. They also support Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, which I didn\u2019t expect to care about. But when I\u2019m not running and just wearing them around town, it makes everything feel more immersive.\nCan you use the Beats Fit Pro every day?\nWhile I primarily use the Beats Fit Pro as workout earbuds, they\u2019ve ended up being my go-to pair for everything. Phone calls, Louis Theroux's latest podcast episode, and long rambling voice notes, the Beats Fit Pro truly hold their own. The physical button controls are easy to use and fully customizable. Skip, pause, answer a call, all without having to reach for your phone.\nThey also pair remarkably well with Apple products and are trackable via the Find My app. And while they\u2019re designed with Apple in mind, they work just as well with Android, so don't let that put you off.\nWhere to buy the Beats Fit Pro\nThe Beats Fit Pro are available to buy at many retailers, and often sport impressive discounts. At Amazon, the Beats Fit Pro are $199.95 (although on sale for $169.95 as of July 20). Find them at Best Buy for $199.99 or $199.95 at Walmart (but on sale for $149.99 as of July 20).\nLois Mackenzie is a freelance reporter at Mashable.

      "text": "The best noise-cancelling headphones we use and love\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nWhether you work from home, spend a lot of time on airplanes, or simply want to turn down the volume of the outside world, noise-cancelling headphones are a worthwhile investment.\nEven the best value headphones will feel lacking if they don't come equipped with halfway decent noise cancellation. Besides, there are simply too many headphones on the market (our testing pool gets bigger by the month) for you to pay hundreds only to get subpar ANC.\nTo help you wade through the top options from brands like Apple, Beats, Bose, Sony, and Sonos, Mashable editors and reviewers tested dozens of headphones and earbuds. From flagship models to budget buds, we picked out the best noise-cancelling headphones of 2025.\nHow do noise-cancelling headphones actually work?\nEven cheap headphones can block some noise from the outside world. And you can always blast your music loud enough to drown out nearby conversations and street noise via passive noise cancellation. However, if you really want to turn the volume of the world down to the limit, then you need headphones with active noise cancellation.\nActive noise-cancelling headphones electronically cover up the sounds coming from your surroundings. They use internal microphones to listen to the world around you, then invert the noise and send it to the speakers. The idea is that both the output and the input will cancel out, leaving you with near-silence. The best over-ear headphones also create a tight seal around your ears, providing an extra layer of passive sound blocking.\nIf you've tried a pair of noise-cancelling headphones before and haven't been impressed, don't be discouraged, as not all ANC performs equally. For instance, cheaper ANC headphones may have a more noticeable hissing sound that you'll hear when the noise cancellation is turned on, which can be distracting for some folks.\nOther headphones may be great at blocking at low tones, but more prone to letting in high-pitched tones. Typically, premium headphones will yield better results all around, but we have budget picks below that still do a solid job.\nIn the past, not many wireless earbuds featured active noise cancellation that was comparable to over-ear headphones, but newer iterations like the AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds hold their own in the ANC space. However, even these earbuds can't quite get the same seal (or fit as many mics) that headphones can, so if you're looking for maximum silence, stick with over-ear headphones.\nWhat are the best noise-cancelling headphones?\nBose is often a top name (and in our top picks) when it comes to noise-cancelling audio, often leading the industry for the best ANC available.\nWith that said, it's not the only brand worth checking out. If you want top-notch ANC with great sound quality, Sony makes excellent options. On the other hand, folks looking for a more affordable option might be drawn to EarFun, which brings great value to the noise-cancelling space. Essentially, what makes the best noise-cancelling headphones depends on what other features and price range you're looking for in a pair of headphones \u2014 our guide below lays out where each of our picks shines.\nEvery single pair of headphones we included in this guide was hands-on tested by a Mashable reporter or editor. You can learn about our in-depth process by taking a look at our standardized testing methodology we developed for headphones and earbuds.\nWe pulled these recommendations from our existing pool of headphones reviews and from hands-on testing performed specifically for this buying guide. A couple of options that didn't make our updated guide include the AirPods Max, which do have good ANC and sound quality but also a less impressive feature-to-price ratio, especially compared to options from Sony and Bose.\nFor a condensed version of what exactly makes good noise-cancelling headphones, here's what we considered:\nThough we always weigh this feature when testing headphones, we paid extra attention to it for the purposes of this guide. For the headphones tested specifically for this guide, we made sure to use them indoors and outdoors, to wear them while someone was trying to speak to us, while playing loud music externally, and while going about our usual workdays. (Many headphones not specifically tested for this guide, including the AirPods Pro and Sony WH-1000XM5s underwent very similar testing conditions).\nThough this category can be extra subjective due to different user preferences and head and ear sizes, we also look at how adjustable headphones are in terms of suiting different wearers, whether with earbud ear tips or headphone band adjustments. A good fit can also factor in improved noise cancelling in headphones, so we made sure to pay extra close attention to how these headphones wore.\nWhile testing headphones, we listen to music across a variety of genres, as well as podcasts to tell how they perform in different audio settings. Where applicable, we test out different equalizer presets and play around with equalizer settings to see how they affect headphones' performance.\nWe considered all the above features combined in relation to the headphones' price points, and compared them against each other to determine which products are worth it. Where applicable, we noted where the value for one feature made sense and where it didn't \u2014 for instance, in the case of the Bose QC Ultra headphones, their price point makes sense for something seeking incredibly comfortable headphones, and less so for someone who wants the best sound experience possible. We also looked at where headphones justified higher price points, whether it be in more premium features like well-thought-out companion apps or especially long battery life.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra\nBest headphones for most people\nThe Good & The Bad\n- The most comfortable headphones on the market (for most people)\n- Good noise cancelling\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Ear cups fold in, making the headphones easier to take on the go\n- All day-battery life, even with ANC on\n- Plenty of color options available\n- On sale relatively often\n- Multipoint connection can be touch and go, especially at this price point\n- On-ear controls could be better\n- No passive playback available\n- Noise-cancelling isn't as strong for higher pitched sounds\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones.\nWho it's for\nOver-ear headphones can be great for blocking out noise, but less great for comfort when they're too heavy or squeeze your head too much. If you're someone who wants to wear your headphones all day, the Bose QuietComfort line was made for you. We've previously tested the QuietComfort 35 IIs and the QuietComfort 45s, and the QuietComfort Ultra was easily the most comfortable of the three. They're also the most expensive at $429, so you will be paying a premium \u2014 we recommend grabbing them on sale, if you can.\nWhy we picked this\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones are the latest flagship headphones from Bose, giving you all-day wear, active noise-cancellation, and spatial audio. The QuietComfort line has been popular for years, but the Ultras truly up the ante.\nWe wore these headphones for hours \u2014 on flights, with glasses on, all day at work \u2014 and they never felt heavy or squeezed the head. To drop the royal Mashable \"we\" for just a moment, I (Lead Shopping Reporter Bethany Allard) can attest that I can easily wear these headphones all day, and I'm not the only one who feels that way. Shopping Reporter Sam Mangino also tested these headphones and found that their biggest draw was their comfort, noting that she didn't experience the same earaches she gets after wearing her Sony WH-1000XM4 for the same amount of time.\nShe did say that their active noise cancellation and sound profile were good, but not great. In her opinion, she found them to be a bit lacking, noting that the ANC \"is really good at blocking out low-pitched noises, [but] it can't wholly block high-pitched sounds unless you turn up the sound to unhealthy volumes.\" Personally, I found the ANC to do the job for me, but most of the noise I block out on a day-to-day basis isn't super high-pitched.\nWhere Mangino and I really agreed is that the ear cup controls and multipoint pairing leave much to be desired, especially at this price point. It can be difficult to easily connect with the button that acts as the Bluetooth pairing button \u2014 sometimes it's immediately responsive, and sometimes you have to press it a few times, and wait in between for it to properly turn on and connect. Like past QC headphones, these are also touch and go with multipoint pairing, but I found them to function better than my old QC 45 headphones, which often made audio have small skips with more than one device connected.\nFinally, these headphones weirdly don't offer passive playback, so you will need to keep them charged whether you're listening wired or wirelessly. Thankfully, I found that it's surprisingly hard to run down the battery on the Ultras, even if you're regularly using ANC and spatial audio. Ultimately, if what you prize above all else is comfort, we think these flaws will feel worth the trade-off.\nDetails\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds\nBest noise-cancelling earbuds\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Some of the most comfortable earbuds we've ever tried\n- Some of the best active noise cancellation we've seen on a pair of earbuds\n- Immersive audio feature\n- Good battery life\n- Multipoint connection can be hit or miss\n- Can be difficult to get out of the case\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds.\nWho it's for\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds are for anyone who wants top-of-the-line ANC, sound quality, and comfort in the form of a pair of earbuds. You'll have to shell out for them, but these earbuds earned the Mashable Choice Award for a reason, and wowed both Mashable Tech Editor Timothy Beck Werth and Shopping Reporter Sam Mangino.\nWhy we picked this\nWhen we were considering the best of the best noise-cancelling earbuds, the Bose QuietComfort Ultras stood out as offering an excellent all-around package. First and foremost, the active noise cancellation works, as Werth writes in his review, \"Do they offer 100 percent sound dilution? No, but all but the loudest and closest sounds should disappear. On airplanes, they significantly reduced noise, making it much easier to take a nap. I have to warn my partner when I'm putting on these earbuds, otherwise, she'll think I'm giving her the silent treatment.\"\nAs for the audio quality, these earbuds come with Bose's immersive audio, which is essentially the brand's version of spatial audio. While both Mangino and Werth enjoyed the feature, it's not necessarily the selling point of these earbuds. In fact, Mangino noted that \"it felt like the music was all around me even when I wasn't using [immersive audio]\" when she used the earbuds.\nStill, even earbuds that sound great are of little use if they don't stay in your ears. Again, both of our testers found these earbuds to be incredibly comfortable, thanks to the combination of the various ear tip sizes and stability bands. Mangino wrote of her experience: \"Whenever I wear earbuds on a walk, I constantly push them in, but I swear I didn't have to adjust these once on my entire three-mile loop.\"\nThe only real downsides of these earbuds are that they can sometimes be difficult to get out of the case, and more significantly, that they suffer from one issue that you'll find on other Bose headphones: Their Bluetooth connection isn't always as automatic as what you'd get from earbuds like AirPods, especially when it comes to multipoint pairing. If all of the above is worth disconnecting and reconnecting your earbuds every now and then, then you'll likely be more than happy with these earbuds, but if it's a deal breaker, you'll probably want to check out other options on our list.\nDetails\nSony WH-1000XM6\nBest for audiophiles\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Incredibly balanced sound\n- Excellent equalizer in companion app (even for folks who aren't audio savvy)\n- Comfortable enough for all day wear\n- Great battery life\n- Ear cups fold in\n- Great call clarity thanks to 12 microphones\n- Price increase from previous generation\n- Very minimal customization for on-ear button controls with app\n- ANC isn't the absolute top of the line\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones.\nWho it's for\nWe loved the Sony WH-1000XM4s, the XM5s, and now we love the XM6s. They come with a higher price point of $450, so these are for anyone genuinely interested in premium quality audio and ANC. If you already own a pair of XM5s, however, we wouldn't say these are different enough to justify an upgrade.\nWhy we picked this\nBetween these headphones and the Bose QC Ultras, our top pick is a bit better at blocking out sound, but we're comparing the highest levels of ANC. And for what it's worth, the XM6s still do an excellent job with significantly blocking or dampening environmental sounds, whether you're near a busy street or working in an office space, thanks to their 12 microphones (which also help with call clarity).\nThat said, Sony headphones tend to shine the most in the sound category, and the XM6s are no exception. Whether we listened to classical music, classic rock, or electronic music, the XM6s brought a level of clarity, balance, and depth that few other headphones in this price range match. Out of the box, they sound great, but with a little fine-tuning on their equalizer, they sound excellent.\nLike the XM5s, they come with the same long-lasting 30-hour battery life. Unlike the XM5s, the earcups fold up, in a return to form of the XM4 model. For anyone who regularly takes their headphones on the go, this genuinely makes a difference \u2014 the XM6 case is noticeably smaller than the XM5 case, both in height and depth. Sony also gave the power button a small upgrade with a circular design, making it easier to differentiate by feel alone from the other on-ear noise cancellation button.\nDetails\nSony WF-1000XM5\nBest sounding earbuds\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Fit might be more comfortable for folks who typically don't like AirPods\n- Great multipoint pairing\n- On the pricier side for earbuds\nWho it's for\nLove high-quality audio but not so fond of the feeling of headphones over your ears? These Sony earbuds are the earbud model of the flagship WH-1000XM5 headphones we recommended above.\nWhy we picked this\nThese earbuds deliver a rich, well-balanced sound profile, without the weight of over-ear headphones. The ear tips material is not the usual silicone found on AirPods and other earbuds, but a more foam-like material you'd find on an ear plug, allowing for all-day wear that creates a firm seal without sacrificing comfort. People who aren't fans of the stemmed design made popular by AirPods will appreciate that Sony didn't attempt to make a carbon copy. Plus, these Sony earbuds still offer functional touch controls.\nThe Sony companion app allows for a ton of customization, including for those aforementioned touch controls, paired devices, and of course, an equalizer. Those who feel a bit intimidated by a completely custom equalizer will appreciate the \"Find Your Equalizer\" feature, which gives you two rounds of options to select from while listening to music to narrow down what settings actually sound the best. Once you've made your selection, a final before and after sound test confirms you're happy with the mix, making it easier than ever to get the most out of your music.\nWe also enjoyed the Adaptive Sound Control, which switches the earbuds automatically from noise-cancelling to ambient sound transparency modes based on whether you're sitting or walking around (settings that can be adjusted). Multipoint pairing also lets you switch between two devices with next to zero lag. If you hate using transparency mode because of how it amplifies outside sounds, you can adjust that, too.\nDetails\nSony ULT Wear\nBest for bass lovers\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Same battery life as the more expensive Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones\n- Sound quality comparable to Sony flagship headphones\n- Budget-friendly price\n- Microphone quality could be better\n- Definitely on the clunkier side\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Sony ULT Wear headphones.\nWho it's for\nIf you don't need a fancy custom equalizer to know you like punching up the bass ten out of ten times, the new Sony ULT Wear headphones are made for you. Our reviewer praised these headphones for offering balanced sound and powerful bass, a rare combo. These are also a great pick for those looking for a more affordable alternative to the WH-1000XM5s.\nWhy we picked this\nSony released the ULT line in April 2024 (and added to it in April 2025), and considering the price, they're some of the best Sony headphones ever made. They're designed for anyone who's a fan of bass. In addition to the equalizer in the app, the headphones have a dedicated ULT button that lets you bump up the bass on demand. The 40-millimeter driver keeps it sounding clear and not crispy, making these headphones a worthy competitor to the WH-1000XM5s, our top pick for the best-sounding noise-cancelling headphones.\nWhen testing the two headphones side by side, Kern found that while both headphones sounded great, \"the ULT Wear\u2019s sound was fuller and felt more like surround sound. And even on the standard setting, the bass sounded richer on the ULTs.\" We still stand by the WH-1000XM5s as a better pick for audiophiles, but Kern makes a strong case for buying these over the XM5s. \"[To] the average person, I\u2019d say the ULT Wears are the winners \u2014 especially for those who prioritize bass and fullness in their audio.\" For $100 cheaper, these are a more than fair alternative to Sony's flagship headphones.\nDetails\nApple AirPods Pro\nBest noise-cancelling earbuds for Apple users\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Super portable\n- Pair seamlessly with Apple products\n- Conversation Aware mode makes it easy to switch between total ANC and talking\n- USB-C compatible charging\n- Some of the best ANC you can find on earbuds\n- Active noise cancellation can't compare to over-ear headphones\n- Lossless audio only supported with Apple Vision Pro\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Apple AirPods Pro (Generation 2).\nWho it's for\nIf you want ANC without all the bulk, the AirPods Pro are small, discreet, and (thanks to the long-awaited USB-C charging port) easier to charge. Though over-ear headphones typically provide superior ANC, these AirPods have impressive noise cancellation for a pair of buds. You'll probably enjoy them a little extra if you have other devices within the Apple ecosystem.\nWhy we picked this\nAre they pricey? Absolutely. Is their ANC worth it? Here's what Mashable Senior Editor Stan Schroeder had to say: \"These are the first pair of earbuds I'd actually consider taking on an airplane (instead of my much larger and clunkier over-ear headphones).\" Though these aren't the only Apple headphones with ANC, we highly prefer these over the AirPods Max, which we think are way overpriced (they're double the cost of these Pros) and don't have the performance to justify that price tag.\nOther than that killer ANC, AirPods are great for travel because they take up minimal space in your carry-on, they sound great, and they have a Conversation Awareness mode which automatically lowers the volume when you're talking, so placing a drink order is easy as can be. And with their new USB-C port, you can charge them directly from an iPhone 15.\nTo get a perfectly snug fit to maximize your listening experience, you'll have your choice between four ear tips. Apple claims these buds support lossless audio, but as of right now, only with the Apple Vision Pro, so you'd have to shell out an additional $3,500 for that experience.\nYou can find AirPods on sale with some regularity if you shop from Amazon or Walmart \u2014 we recommend waiting until they at least drop down to $199 at either retailer before buying a pair during any time of year.\nDetails\nEarFun Air Pro 4\nBest earbuds under $100\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Some of the best noise-cancelling you can get under $100\n- Different levels of noise cancellation available\n- App offers similar customization to earbuds at higher price point\n- Great EQ functions\n- Functional multipoint pairing\n- Great battery life\n- Touch controls are just OK\n- Case is on the bulky side\nWho it's for\nThe EarFun Air Pro 4 earbuds may not come from one of the more well-known audio brands, but they have some of the best battery life and noise cancellation we've experienced on any earbuds, not just those in the budget price range. That said, these are our pick for budget shoppers.\nWhy we picked this\nFrankly, these earbuds have no business offering as many features as they do while costing less than $100.\nWhile it is possible to use them straight out of the box, with the app, these earbuds offer more, including five different levels of noise cancellation. While the differences between some modes were negligible, the \"strong ANC\" setting didn't mess around (even if it did have the slightest detectable hiss without music), and the \"wind noise cancellation\" setting actually diminished the sound of a bathroom fan and hair dryer even more than the standard ANC. Basically, the noise cancellation worked \u2014 we found it outperformed the Beats Studio Buds+ (our former mid-range pick priced at $169.95) easily on the ANC front, and felt on par with headphones and earbuds that cost double their price. Plus, having different levels of ANC isn't a common feature on cheaper or more expensive earbuds \u2014 neither the Apple AirPods line nor Bose QuietComfort lines offer these features.\nAlong with the impressive ANC, these earbuds fit comfortably, staying in place even during runs (which isn't always a given for earbuds without stems). The battery life lasted an impressive amount of time, leaving us only recharging the case once after a week of regular use. A light indicator on the case also easily shows you how much juice you have left. While waiting for these earbuds to start showing their price point, we thought they might struggle with their multipoint connection, but they easily connected and switched between two devices, and toggled easily between two selected devices with the help of the app. Oh, and they sounded great, with the app offering a custom and preset equalizer (which is, again, very much not a given feature at this price point, or price points $50 higher).\nSo were there any downsides? The case was a little bulky, and the touch controls remained finicky, even after we got used to how they worked (but you can toggle them off). If EarFun switched to a button for on-ear controls instead, these might just be perfect earbuds, but as they stand at their price now, we're really not complaining.\nDetails\nAnker Soundcore Life P3i\nBest noise-cancelling earbuds under $50\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Sound quality is impressive for price point\n- Companion app has a nice equalizer\n- Comfortable\n- Switching between devices requires you repairing the device (even when not using multipoint)\n- ANC is just okay\nWho it's for\nIf you're on a tight budget but still want to enjoy noise cancellation, the Anker Soundcore Life P3i earbuds offer a surprisingly solid performance. Don't expect elite ANC, but these affordable earbuds don't require too much of a sacrifice in sound quality.\nWhy we picked this\nWe're going to start with the major hitch of these earbuds: switching between devices sucks. They don't have multipoint pairing, and if you want to use them with your phone after using them with your laptop, you have to manually disconnect them (or in our experience, sometimes outright unpair them), with your laptop first. It's easily their biggest flaw, and where we most obviously felt their price point during testing.\nWith that out of the way, these earbuds still have a lot going for them. For starters, they cost $50 and can often be found on sale for even less. Though inexpensive, these earbuds are comfortable to wear all day, have a custom equalizer in the app plus 21 presets (we're fans of the Treble Booster), customizable touch controls for each earbud, and a battery life that outdoes the Apple AirPods Pro. You won't have extras like spatial audio, and the ANC leans on background hiss more than premium models, but not terribly so.\nFor a pair of $50 earbuds, we're impressed. We recommend them for anyone who doesn't want to shell out $100 plus for a pair of noise-cancelling earbuds.\nDetails\nDyson OnTrac\nBest battery life\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Incomparable battery life\n- Excellent noise cancellation\n- Top-of-the-line sound quality for mids, highs, and lows\n- Super comfortable\n- Way too expensive\n- Design could be less Dyson-forward\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Dyson OnTrac headphones.\nWho it's for\nThe Dyson OnTrac headphones aren't perfect, but if long-lasting battery life is your top priority and you're willing to pay for it, these provide the best battery life we've ever seen on a pair of noise-cancelling over-ear headphones. They're also extremely comfortable, too.\nWhy we picked this\nShort answer: 55 hours of battery life with noise-cancelling turned on.\nThat's what Dyson claimed with these headphones, and what Werth confirmed when he tested them out over the period of a month. And that noise cancellation works well.\nAs for the longer answer, let's begin with a couple of questions: Are these headphones Dyson-level expensive? Yes (though they're still $50 cheaper than AirPods Max, which max out at 20 hours of battery life). Is the Dyson logo on the headband kind of tacky? Also yes. And the multipoint pairing is lacking, which really shouldn't be an issue on a pair of $500 headphones. However, if you can live with that, you'll get headphones that Werth called \"the best...I've tested yet,\" with excellent sound quality, solid ANC, swappable ear plates (for a price), and again, 55 full hours of battery life with the active noise cancellation turned on.\nThey certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea (or in everyone's budget), but if you want the best battery life money can buy, Dyson's OnTrac headphones are for you.\nIf you're into the battery life but can't justify the price, we also found that the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones boasted an impressive 60 hours of battery life with ANC turned on, plus clock in at a good $120 cheaper than the Dyson headphones (and are often on sale). The main drawback is that their ANC is good but not great, but if you're willing to sacrifice that (and get some excellent sound quality in the process), the trade-off might be worth it.\nDetails\nRecent testing updates\nAs of July 2025, we replaced the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones with their newer counterpart, the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones.\nOur testing in February 2025 saw the addition of the EarFun Air Pro 4 earbuds as our favorite earbuds pick under $100. We decided that they deserved to knock the Beats Studio Buds+ off the list (after the Apple-owned earbuds beat out the newer AirPods 4), due to the Air Pro's superior noise cancellation, battery life, and value. We also added the Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones as an alternate pick for the best battery life headphones in March 2025.\nIn September 2024, we tried out the JBL Live Beam 3 earbuds, and we enjoyed their sound, unique design, and touchscreen case that made it easy to check the headphones' battery life and control audio. However, their noise cancellation wasn't quite up to par for $200 earbuds. We've also added the Dyson OnTrac headphones as our pick for the best battery life, thanks to the impressive 55-hour battery life.\nIn August 2024, we said goodbye to the Bose 700 headphones as our recommendation for the best noise-cancelling headphones with adjustable ANC. This was a long time coming \u2014 these headphones have technically been discontinued since the release of the Bose QC Ultra headphones in September 2023, but remained available from retailers other than Bose. We'll be on the lookout for any new models that match the adjustable noise cancellation that these Bose headphones once offered.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAbsolutely. While some people prefer to stay more in-tune with their surroundings, virtually all ANC headphones come with a transparency mode that makes this possible. In recent years, we've seen huge improvements in the quality of ANC from top brands like Bose, Sony, and Apple. So, even though flagship noise cancellers are usually a minimum of $300, we think they justify the investment.\nThe quick answer is that pretty much any headphones, even the best of the best active noise-cancelling headphones, will let in some sound, but they can significantly dampen down sounds in your environment. With more constant hums of sound like folks talking or loud fans, good ANC headphones are more likely to provide better cancellation.\nIf you're looking for the most insulation from the outside world possible, we recommend giving your headphones an ANC boost by playing music or a video. That extra bit of audio will make it even harder to hear your surroundings.\nWearing noise-cancelling headphones for long stretches of time is safe, sound-wise. However, we do recommend being careful with what situations you use ANC \u2014 if you're walking around in a city, for instance, spatial awareness doesn't hurt. You'll also want to avoid blasting music all day to spare your eardrums from damage.\nLikely, the bigger issue you'll run into is comfort. We recommend trying out a pair from the Bose QuietComfort line if you're particularly sensitive to the sensation of wearing headphones or earbuds for long stretches of time.\nIn our testing, we preferred headphones from Bose and Sony, with Bose often coming out on top for providing the most comprehensive noise cancellation, and Sony offering the best balance between sound quality and noise cancellation.\nBethany Allard is a Los Angeles-based shopping reporter at Mashable covering beauty tech, dating, sex and relationships, and headphones.

RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20. Privacy Policy The applicable privacy policy will be made available on the property from which you accessed these Terms. Such privacy policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms.

That's not a bad thing, though. Besides the hefty new processor that unlocks Apple Intelligence, the M3 Air features better battery life, a more advanced Magic Keyboard (optional add-on), and pass-through charging. We think it's the best iPad option for more people, especially now that it's down to just $449 at Amazon.

While these don't offer noise cancellation (that'll cost you another $49), our reviewer was extremely impressed with their sound. They last a little longer than the noise-cancelling option at about five hours per charge (30 with the charging case), making them a great daily driver.

That's not a bad thing, though. Besides the hefty new processor that unlocks Apple Intelligence, the M3 Air features better battery life, a more advanced Magic Keyboard (optional add-on), and pass-through charging. We think it's the best iPad option for more people, especially now that it's down to just $449 at Amazon. That's its best price on record.\nGet this limited-time offer here.\nChristina Buff is a Nashville-based freelance writer for who covers shopping with a splash of entertainment.
