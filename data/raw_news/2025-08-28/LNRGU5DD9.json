  "title": "4 ways AI can support your creativity, not replace it",
  "description": "We gave a tattoo artist a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for 25 hours \u2013 here\u2019s what happened.",
  "content": "Managing work, downtime and day-to-day errands can feel like a juggling act - and for those working in a creative industry there\u2019s the added pressure to stay inspired and innovative. The tech we rely on every day \u2014 especially our smartphones \u2014 should support our creativity and productivity, not get in the way.\n\nSamsung's latest flagship, the , is more than up to this task. With some pretty impressive capabilities (notably Galaxy AI1 working like a pocket personal assistant), the phone\u2019s features have been designed to help people's days run more smoothly, for both work and play.\n\nBut don\u2019t just take our word for it. Tattoo artist, Jezz-Lee, spent 25 hours with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and took us along for the journey. For some creatives there is hesitation in working with AI, for worry it could replace their work.\n\nWe wanted to see if this powerhouse smartphone could make that positive difference to his working day. Here\u2019s a breakdown of some of the innovative features he tested out, and how they might also be useful in your daily routine.\n\nJezz starts his day with some morning mediation, and prefers not to immediately counteract it with unnecessary screen time. With the new Now Brief2, part of the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s Now Bar3 (a handy feature for controlling applications through your lock-screen), he can quickly check his personalised briefing for the day and get back to his morning. The Now Brief can be tailored with content for your lifestyle, so you can focus solely on the need-to-knows.\n\nFor Jezz, this was checking his upcoming schedule, but for you this may be last night\u2019s sleep stats, today\u2019s appointments or when your railcard expires. All ready and up-to-date for you, on your lock-screen.\n\nHome of your invaluable photos and videos, the Gallery App on the Galaxy S25 Ultra is now an organised utopia. With the new Gallery Search, scrolling is a thing of the past. Using Galaxy AI-powered voice search you can simply use dates or descriptors to find your photos.\n\nThis made locating Jezz\u2019s design references a breeze, \u201cFinding what I need can take a while, but using the Gallery Search made it super quick. I just asked for what I needed and it found the relevant photos straight away\u201d.\n\nEditing said pics couldn\u2019t be easier thanks to Photo Assist4, a Galaxy AI feature packed with useful tools. So no need to stress if you\u2019re not a Jezz-level artist; the Sketch to Image function can turn stick-like sketches into photorealistic parts of your picture.\n\nWith Generative Edit5, you can resize, remove and reposition in photos freely, knowing Galaxy AI will analyse and perfect your changes to suit the image best. Whether quickly grabbing images for a meeting, or removing photobombers from your next instagram, using your Gallery is a smooth experience.\n\nJezz highlighted the importance of taking time on his client\u2019s tattoo size and placement, which he found easy with the S Pen. This sleek pen slides out the bottom of the phone and doesn\u2019t need to be charged or paired.\n\nFrom turning messy handwritten notes from that brainwave moment into legible text, to creating live drawings (PENUP app) and elevating them into masterpieces (Galaxy AI Drawing Assist6), your creativity can run freely with this nifty stylus.\n\nLong days need long-lasting tech, because when you\u2019re busy the last thing you need to worry about is your phone battery. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a seriously enhanced battery life thanks to their most powerful processor yet.\n\nWith Galaxy AI working in the background to optimise which software is using precious power, the phone\u2019s battery could seamlessly take Jezz from his morning organisation through to his evening relaxation - charger free. With up to 31 hours of video playback, your long working days and wind down time can be handled in one fell swoop (even if you enjoy a film on that vibrant AMOLED screen in the evening).\n\nAfter his 25 hours with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Jezz had a positive take on using Galaxy AI to help his work, \u201cHuman emotions is what\u2019s needed for artistic innovation, AI can never replace that. But when it\u2019s used mindfully, it helps creatives like me get more out of their day.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a creative like Jezz, or you simply want a phone that works with you throughout the day, not against you, then this AI-powered smartphone might just be the new sidekick you\u2019ve been looking for.\n\nTo find out how the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra can help you get more out of your day, visit the .",
