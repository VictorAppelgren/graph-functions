  "title": "Ryan McMahon\u2019s worrying inconsistency at plate showing itself to Yankees",
  "description": "The biggest concern when the Yankees acquired Ryan McMahon prior to the trade deadline was whether his bat would provide enough at third base.",
  "content": "The biggest concern when the Yankees acquired Ryan McMahon from the Rockies prior to the trade deadline was whether his bat \u2014 inconsistent even with the benefit of playing half of his games in Colorado \u2014 would provide enough at third base.\n\nAfter a solid start with the Yankees, those concerns have proven to be warranted.\n\nThough the lefty-swinging McMahon went 8-for-20 with a pair of doubles in his first six games as a Yankee, the past few weeks have been significantly worse.\n\nAnd while he made several fine defensive plays at third base in Sunday\u2019s 7-2 win over the Red Sox, he also hitless in his last 14 at-bats with nine strikeouts.\n\nEntering Sunday\u2019s series finale against Boston in The Bronx, he was stuck in an 8-for-53 rut, with 19 strikeouts over that period.\n\nThere was hope McMahon would be able to take advantage of Yankee Stadium\u2019s short porch in right field.\n\nWhile he\u2019s pulling the ball more than ever, he failed to go deep in his first 52 plate appearances there.\n\nAt least McMahon\u2019s defense at third base has been elite, as expected.\n\nNonetheless, an American League scout, who praised the McMahon trade when it was made and believed he would be rejuvenated by his new surroundings, has been disappointed.\n\n\u201cThat first week was what I expected,\u2019\u2019 the scout said of his brief solid performance at the plate. \u201cBut I thought he would be able to be more consistent in such a potent lineup.\u201d\n\nMcMahon made no excuses when asked about his failure to produce entering Sunday\u2019s game.\n\u2022 CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND YANKEES STATS\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just struggling and not feeling great at the plate,\u2019\u2019 McMahon said. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna try and go compete. I don\u2019t really care what I do, as long as we win games.\u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much of that in Colorado, and he was looking forward to the intensity that comes with playing in The Bronx.\n\n\u201cThat part has been awesome,\u2019\u2019 McMahon said. \u201cFeeling the energy every day in the stadium, you need that in the later months. They want to win bad here, and that\u2019s definitely enjoyable.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d just like to be a part of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played the game a long time and had struggles worse than this,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cI know this game can be [tough] sometimes, so you\u2019ve got to roll with it and grind through it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing now and why I\u2019ve got blisters on my hands. I\u2019m gonna get this thing turned around.\u201d\n\nHitting coach James Rowson is trying to get him there, although the work he\u2019s done with McMahon so far has not been overly complicated.\n\n\u201cWhen you get a guy midseason, you never want to go all-out with a reconstruction of his swing,\u2019\u2019 Rowson said of McMahon, who is under contract through 2027 at $16 million each of the next two years. \u201cYou take his strengths \u2014 and his strengths are good. You try to keep things easy to get him more comfortable.\u201d\n\nRowson said he\u2019s been impressed with McMahon\u2019s attitude, as well as certain aspects of his offensive game.\n\n\u201cI love his athleticism and the way the ball comes off his bat,\u2019\u2019 Rowson said. \u201cHe puts a charge into a ball.\u201d",

  "summary": "Ryan McMahon, who was traded from the Rockies for the Yankees for $16 million each of the next two years, has been struggling at plate for the past few weeks. Despite a strong start with the Yankees, McMahon has been inconsistent at the plate and has been hitless in his last 14 at-bats with nine strikeouts. Despite this, McMahon's defense at third base has been considered elite, but he has been disappointed by his lack of consistency. His performance has been limited due to the short porch in right field and lack of playing time at Yankee Stadium. The team's hitting coach, James Rowson, is working to get him more comfortable and improve his performance. McMahon is under contract until 2027.",

They splintered the link that surely would\u2019ve grown if they\u2019d lost a fourth straight game to the Sox, at home, late in the season, a rusty chain linking 2025 and 1978 when it was the Yankees who turned that trick, still known in these part as the Boston Massacre.\nThey made sure they will not lie in state alongside the 1912 Yankees, then known as the Highlanders, who went 2-19 against the Sox and were outscored 149-76 in those games and finished a solid 55 games behind the 105-57 Sox. The worst they can do now is 2-11.\nHey, small steps before bigger ones, am I right?\nMostly, they made sure to ready-aim-fire at the inviting fences at Yankee Stadium and did what they do better than any team in baseball, launching four balls beyond those barriers, two apiece by Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Trent Grisham, good enough for six of those seven runs, good enough to take a game off the Red Sox."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

I am looking forward to getting him back.\u201d\nBefore going on the IL for the second time this season \u2014 he missed 15 days in late May with right shoulder inflammation \u2014 Cruz pitched to a 3.00 ERA with 54 strikeouts in 33 innings, most of them high-leverage outings.\nThe Yankees bullpen has largely struggled in Cruz\u2019s absence \u2014 entering Sunday with a 5.58 ERA since Cruz went on the IL, the second-worst mark in the majors during that span \u2014 even after adding reinforcements at the deadline in David Bednar, Camilo Doval and Jake Bird (who is now at Triple-A).\nBut Cruz\u2019s return should give Boone another late-inning option in his circle of trust as the Yankees head down the homestretch.\nIn the meantime, Paul Blackburn remained on the roster Sunday despite being unavailable after throwing 71 pitches in mop-up duty Saturday.\nJasson Dom\u00ednguez was out of the lineup for the fourth time in the last six games in order to get Giancarlo Stanton\u2019s bat \u2014 which went 2-for-3 with a double \u2014 into the lineup in right field.\n- CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND YANKEES STATS\nCody Bellinger manned left field with Trent Grisham in center, where he was starting for the 17th straight game and slugged two more homers.\nAustin Slater (hamstring strain) did some running in the outfield and on the bases Sunday afternoon as he tries to work back toward a September return.\nBoone did not have a time table for when the outfielder might advance to a rehab assignment, or at least taking live batting practice."

      "text": "The Yankees finally addressed their longstanding, and glaring, third-base problem.\nIt wasn\u2019t with the top option on the market, though.\nThey acquired Ryan McMahon from the Rockies on Friday in exchange for Griffin Herring and Josh Grosz \u2014 two pitching prospects.\nThe Yankees had strong interest in Diamondbacks slugger Eugenio Su\u00e1rez, but there was a sizable gap in compensation talks, The Post\u2019s Jon Heyman reported. Su\u00e1rez entered Friday leading the National League in RBIs (86) and second in home runs (36).\nMcMahon, 30, is a strong fielder, which the Yankees have increasingly needed as the their defensive woes kept worsening in recent days, particularly on the left side of their infield. He is tied for third among all third baseman in outs above average (four) this year.\nHe has largely struggled at the plate, however. He entered Friday with a .217/.314/.403 slash line along with 16 homers, 35 RBIs and a .717 OPS. His 127 strikeouts were also most in the National League and second-most in MLB. But as a lefty swinger, Yankee Stadium\u2019s short porch could benefit McMahon, who was an All-Star last year.\n\u201cI know there\u2019s real offensive potential in there,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said before Friday\u2019s series-opener against the Phillies at Yankee Stadium. \u201cI know he\u2019s had offensive success as well as some struggles there over the last calendar year or two. It seems like over the last month, he\u2019s really started to swing the bat like he\u2019s capable of, because he can impact the ball, he can control the strike zone. He\u2019s had some swing-and-miss that has probably hurt him a little bit.\n\u201cBut then he can really defend over there. The handful of times that we\u2019ve played against him and I watch him, you\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s what it should look like.\u2019 He moves really well and has that prototypical good third baseman [look].\u201d\nMcMahon also has stark home-away splits, which is always a concern surrounding players at the extremely hitter-friendly Coors Field. He has a lowly .189/.265/.324 slash line away from home, and his OPS (.589) is 267 points lower than his OPS (.856) at home.\n\u201cI think McMahon would flourish for them,\u201d a National League scout previously told The Post\u2019s Greg Joyce. \u201cHe\u2019ll be playing more meaningful games. He\u2019s a Gold Glove defender at third base, really, really good. \u2026 I think with the short porch, being a left-handed hitter, he could flourish there.\u201d\nThe Yankees are taking on the entirety of McMahon\u2019s contract, The Post\u2019s Joel Sherman reported. He is owed roughly $4.5 million for the rest of this year and $16 million each of the next two years.\nHerring, a southpaw, was the Yankees\u2019 No. 8-ranked prospect, according to MLB Pipeline. He owned a 2.22 ERA in eight starts at High-A Hudson Valley and a 1.21 ERA in eight starts at Single-A Tampa.\nGrosz, a righty, was the Yankees\u2019 No. 21-ranked prospect. He owned a 4.14 ERA in 15 starts with High-A Hudson Valley.\nThird base had become a major part of the Yankees\u2019 brutal fielding woes this year. Yankees third basemen entered Friday with a combined minus-6 in outs above average \u2014 tied for fourth-worst. They had a combined 0.6 WAR from third basemen \u2014 sixth-least in MLB. Offensively, Yankees third basemen entered Friday with a combined .646 OPS \u2014 eighth-worst in the league.\nDJ LeMahieu did not want to play there in order to ease the burden on his body, and manager Aaron Boone had opted to play Jazz Chisholm Jr., traditionally a middle infielder, there with rough results. After the Yankees DFA\u2019d LeMahieu earlier this month, Boone has largely moved Chisholm to second base \u2014 where he\u2019s better \u2014 and given Oswald Peraza a run of games at third base.\nBut Peraza, formerly a highly regarded prospect who started there again on Friday, did nothing to win the job, struggling both at the plate and in the field. Now, it\u2019ll firmly be McMahon\u2019s.\n\u201cReally excited,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHe\u2019s been an All-Star third baseman, really good defender. Has had some ups-and-downs offensively this year. \u2026 He\u2019s a presence and he can really defend over there at third and has for a number of years.\u201d"

      "text": "If nothing else, the Yankees saved face.\nBut they still have a long way to go to prove they can actually beat the Red Sox when it matters.\nAccess the Yankees beat like never before\nJoin Post Sports+ for exciting subscriber-only features, including real-time texting with Greg Joyce about the inside buzz on the Yankees.\nTry it freeFor now, the Yankees avoided what would have been a disastrous four-game sweep by their rivals, snapping an eight-game losing streak against the Red Sox by taking the finale Sunday night, 7-2.\n\u201cWe knew we had to come out here and win,\u201d said Carlos Rod\u00f3n, who held the Red Sox to two runs over 5 \u00b2/\u2083 innings.\nJazz Chisholm Jr. clubbed a pair of two-run homers that bookended the scoring and Trent Grisham blasted a pair of solo shots to pull the Yankees (70-60) back within a half-game of the Red Sox (71-60) for the top AL wild-card spot.\nIn the process, the Yankees avoided being swept by the Red Sox in a series of four or more games at home for the first time since 1939.\n\u201cWe definitely needed this win tonight,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cA little momentum going into the next series. We\u2019re trying to make it to the playoffs, but we\u2019re definitely just trying to take it day by day and win by win.\u201d\nAfter mustering just four runs through the first three games of this series, the Yankees beat up on Red Sox right-hander Dustin May for five runs Sunday before Chisholm added his second two-run shot off Walker Buehler in the eighth inning.\nThe Yankees now return to the JV portion of their schedule Monday with a series against the Nationals before a four-game set against the lowly White Sox.\nThey will see the Red Sox again at Fenway Park at the end of a brutal stretch that includes series against the Astros, Blue Jays and Tigers.\n\u201cI always want to play Boston,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cThe energy in the game, the way our fans come out, the way their fans come out, it\u2019s a real intense game. Every game against Boston here has felt like a playoff game. For me, I know that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to have and what we\u2019re going to need to get ready for the playoffs. I know a lot of guys in here feel that, too.\u201d\nRod\u00f3n gave up just one hit while cruising into the sixth inning, but walked five \u2014 the third time he has done so in his last seven starts.\nThree of those free passes came in the sixth inning as Rod\u00f3n loaded the bases with two outs and was relieved by Luke Weaver, who allowed a bloop two-run single to pinch-hitter Nathaniel Lowe that made it a 5-2 lead.\nBut Weaver struck out Jarren Duran to limit the damage and then tossed a scoreless seventh inning.\nDevin Williams entered for the eighth to face the heart of the Red Sox\u2019s lineup and retired it in order, getting Alex Bregman to ground out and striking out Roman Anthony and Trevor Story.\nCamilo Doval then worked around a pair of hits in the top of the ninth to finish off the win.\nChisholm got the scoring started with a two-run shot in the second inning, which was the 100th homer of his career.\nHe said it felt \u201csurreal\u201d because his best friend died Saturday, which made for an emotional trip around the bases and return to the dugout after the milestone home run.\n- CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND YANKEES STATS\nGrisham made it 3-0 in the third inning when he led off with a 406-foot blast, then led off the fifth with a 413-footer that made it 5-0.\nThe two-homer game \u2014 the center fielder\u2019s second in his last five games \u2014 gave Grisham 25 on the season, which is second on the team behind only Aaron Judge.\nGiancarlo Stanton, starting in right field for the third time in four days with Judge still not ready to play the field, led off the fourth inning by smoking a 117.8-mph double to center field.\nHe eventually came in to score on a sacrifice fly from Jos\u00e9 Caballero, who was starting at shortstop for the scuffling Anthony Volpe, who will be out of the lineup Monday as well.\n\u201cDefinitely not the weekend we wanted to have, especially coming off a really good road trip, but a good win nonetheless,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cAlways good to play a clean brand of baseball, especially when you\u2019ve had a tough weekend and you\u2019ve lost three to your rivals. To come out and do it in all facets with Carlos setting the tone, defense, power, adding on, getting a guy over, sacrifice fly, it was good to see all that.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The Yankees\u2019 midseason acquisition of third baseman Ryan\u202fMcMahon has not lived up to expectations offensively; after a brief 8\u2011for\u201120 start, he has struggled with a .151 average, 19 strikeouts in 53 at\u2011bats, and no deep hits in Yankee Stadium\u2019s short porch. Despite his elite defense, a scout and manager Aaron Boone have expressed disappointment, noting his inconsistent swing and lack of power. McMahon\u2019s contract is fully assumed by New York, and the team hopes his defensive presence will help the Yankees\u2019 struggling infield as they chase a playoff spot.",
