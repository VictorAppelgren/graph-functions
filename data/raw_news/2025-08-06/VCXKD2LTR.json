      "text": "Teacher arrested for Arkansas double murder admits to killing married couple: Police\nClinton and Cristen Brink were killed in a state park, police said.\nA 28-year-old teacher has admitted to murdering the married couple found stabbed to death on a walking trail in an Arkansas park over the weekend in what appears to be a \"completely random\" attack, police said.\nAndrew James McGann, 28, of Springdale, Arkansas, was charged with two counts of capital murder in the killings of 43-year-old Clinton David Brink and his wife, 41-year-old Cristen Amanda Brink, Arkansas State Police announced Wednesday evening.\nThe Brinks were \"fatally attacked\" while out hiking with their two daughters at Devil's Den State Park on July 26, police said. The \"horrific\" assault occurred about a half mile into the park, with the husband attacked first, police said.\nThe children, ages 7 and 9, were not harmed in the incident thanks to the actions of their mother, police said.\n\"We believe that the mother took them to safety, and then returned to help her husband,\" Maj. Stacie Rhoads with the Arkansas State Police said during a press briefing Thursday.\nFollowing a dayslong manhunt for the suspect, McGann was arrested shortly before 5 p.m. local time Wednesday at a barbershop in Springdale, about 30 miles north of the park, police said.\nDuring an interview with police, he admitted to killing the couple, Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar said during Thursday's press briefing.\nDNA from blood recovered from the crime scene also matched McGann's DNA, Hagar said. The suspect had sustained cuts on his hands during a struggle with the victims, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation.\nItems recovered from his residence were \"consistent with being involved in this particular crime,\" Hagar said.\nMcGann had recently moved to the area from Oklahoma and had been hired to work at a local school, officials said.\nHe was hired to teach in the Springdale Public Schools district this upcoming school year but had not yet begun employment, according to the district's superintendent, Jared Cleveland.\n\"This individual has not at any time come into contact with Springdale students or the families we serve,\" Cleveland said in a statement, adding that no additional information is available at this time due to the ongoing investigation.\n\"Our entire team extends our deepest condolences to the Brink family. Their children are especially in our thoughts and prayers,\" he said.\nMcGann was a fifth grade teacher in Broken Arrows, Oklahoma, during the 2023-2024 school year, the school district said. He passed required background checks, a Broken Arrow Public Schools spokesperson said.\nThe prior school year, he was employed at an elementary school in Flower Mound, Texas, the Lewisville Independent School District confirmed. He was placed on administrative leave in the spring of 2023 \"following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgment, and student favoritism,\" and he ultimately resigned, the school district said.\n\"An internal investigation found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students,\" the school district added.\nAsked about a motive in the double homicide, Hagar said it remains under investigation, though he did say it appeared to be a \"completely random event.\"\n\"We have no reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspects and our victims,\" Hagar said.\nThe victims died from stab wounds, and the murder weapon was a knife, Hagar said Thursday. Knives were recovered from the residence's home, but it is unclear if any was the murder weapon, Rhoads said.\nHagar said police received over 500 tips and credited the public's help with bringing the suspect into custody.\nArkansas State Police had also released a composite sketch and photo from behind of a man who was seen in Devil's Den State Park on Saturday, the day of the killings. Police asked for the public's help in identifying the man, who they said was wanted for questioning in connection with the double homicide.\nPolice previously said the suspect was seen leaving the area of the park in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda, with a license plate covered by tape, police said. The vehicle description was \"critical\" in identifying the suspect, Rhoads said.\nThough he took steps to conceal his identity, the suspect was \"very sloppy,\" Rhoads said.\nOnce they identified the suspect, McGann was arrested within an hour at the barbershop, she said.\nPolice do not believe the suspect was trying to alter his appearance in getting a haircut, according to Rhoads, saying, \"Could chalk that up to school starts next week.\"\nThe Brinks had recently moved to Prairie Grove from North Dakota, police said.\nThe children are safe and in the custody of relatives, according to police.\n\"Our entire state is grieving for the tragic loss and senseless and horrific crime that's taken place,\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"One of the worst experiences that certainly I've ever had was making a phone call to the Brink family earlier this week. Nothing like that should ever have taken place.\"\nHagar said the Brinks were a loving couple, and credited their two young daughters with helping in the case, saying they are \"in awe\" of them.\n\"The information that they were able to provide to start us down this path, to be able to make this arrest, it all started with those two little girls,\" he said. \"It's incredible.\"\nHagar said the couple has a third daughter who wasn't at the trail that day.\n\"It is my intention to use the full weight of my office to bring this defendant to justice for the Brinks family,\" Brandon Carter, the prosecuting attorney for Washington County, said at Thursday's press briefing.\nThe prosecutor's office will not be waiving the death penalty in the case, Carter said.\nMcGann is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Friday, with an arraignment expected next week.\nAll trails at Devil's Den State Park, which were closed following the killings, will remain closed for now, Arkansas Secretary of Parks Shay Lewis said.\nABC News' Sasha Pezenik contributed to this report."

These are people who are all still my friends, even if they're no longer alive on the show, and I can't say that about a lot of other jobs I've had.\"\n\"Dead City\" is the first sequel to \"The Walking Dead\" franchise. It centers around Negan and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) who are \"travelling into a post-apocalyptic Manhattan, long ago off from the mainland,\" according to a press release.\n\"The crumbling city is filled with the dead and denizens who have made New York City their own world full of anarchy, danger, beauty, and terror,\" the press release continues. \"In season two, in the growing war for control of Manhattan, Maggie and Negan find themselves trapped on opposite sides. As their paths intertwine, they come to see that the way out for both is more complicated and harrowing than they ever imagined.\"\nMorgan, who joined \"The Walking Dead\" in season 6, which aired in 2015, said that he feels like \"one of the veterans\" of the franchise now.\n\"I feel like I've earned my stripes,\" he said. \"[Ten] years is a long time. This is not an easy show to do in any way, mentally and certainly physically, so I'm amazed by the fact that I'm still able to pull off my part of it.\"\n\"The Walking Dead: Dead City\" season 2 premieres Sunday, May 4, on AMC at 9 p.m. ET/PT and will be available to stream on AMC+."

Residents in these ZIP codes can continue to drink water, bathe, shower, cook, and use your air conditioner.\"\nThe New York City Health Department said earlier it was investigating the cluster and said that \"the remediation required by the Department has been completed for the 11 cooling towers with initial positive screening results showing the presence of Legionella pneumophila, a type of bacteria that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\"\nLegionnaires\u2019 disease can be caused by plumbing systems where conditions are favorable for Legionella growth, such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, hot water tanks and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems, health officials said.\nPeople can get Legionnaires\u2019 disease by breathing in water vapor that contains Legionella bacteria, but the disease does not generally spread from person to person and can be treated with antibiotics.\nThe respiratory disease takes its name from an outbreak at the Pennsylvania American Legion convention held at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in July 1976 and the bacterium believed to be responsible is found in soil and grows in water, such as air-conditioning ducts, storage tanks and rivers.\nNo details about the three people who died have been released by officials as of Tuesday.\n(ABC News' Youri Benadjaoud contributed to this report)"

He said Baillie, Leach and Palm were all patrons of The Owl Bar.\nThe attorney general said local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, are searching for Brown.\n\"We've got air assets, ground assets. We're going to catch this guy. This is absolutely still priority No. 1,\" Knudsen said.\nOn Saturday, investigators released a surveillance photo of Brown that Knudsen said was taken shortly after the shooting, in which the suspect appeared to have stripped off most of his clothes and was just in his underwear and his socks.\n\"We have very good reason to believe that he is clothed. He does have shoes and he's probably able to get around,\" said Knudsen, adding that investigators suspect Brown stole a vehicle after the shooting that contained camping equipment and clothes.\nBrown lived next door to the bar and was not a stranger to the area and establishment, authorities said. Knudsen said investigators believe that Brown was familiar with most of the victims, including the bartender.\n\"From what I gather, it sounds like he was a regular at this establishment. He literally lives next door,\" Knudsen said. \"I think it's likely that he knew the bartender and these patrons, which even makes it more heinous.\"\nKnudsen said investigators believe Brown used a rifle in the shooting.\nA motive remains under investigation.\nBrown was in the Army from 2001 to 2005 and the National Guard from 2006 to 2009, an Army spokesperson said. He spent one year deployed in Iraq and left the service in the rank of sergeant, the Army said.\nPolice said they found the 2007 white Ford F-150 pickup that Brown was last seen driving on Friday, but Brown remains at large.\nNumerous local, state and federal agencies are searching the area via ground and air, authorities said."
