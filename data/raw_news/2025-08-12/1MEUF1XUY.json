  "description": "It\u2019s looking highly likely",
  "content": "We are pretty much a week away from the expected launch of the Google Pixel 10 and its Pro and Fold stablemates, and while the rumors don\u2019t suggest big upgrades, there\u2019s something else to tickle one\u2019s fancy: potentially cheaper Google Pixel 9 phones.\n\nThe current-generation Pixel phones ushered in a neat suite of design changes and a decent bout of improvements, making it our smartphone of 2024. For the Pixel 10, it doesn't look like that\u2019ll be the case, with some small updates tipped and more likely to be done on the software and AI tools side than any big hardware upgrades.\n\nAs such, that could make the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL and even the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (priced at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,349, $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699, $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,849, $1,799 / \u00a31,799 / AU $2,699 respectively) still seem like rather compelling phones a year after their release. And with their successors coming, it\u2019s likely that they could get a price cut.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this with the Samsung Galaxy S25 range, which, after it launched earlier this year, had the knock-on effect of making the rather good Galaxy S24 family drop in price. Right now, Google is selling the Pixel 8 models for some $100/\u00a3100 (no such luck for Australia, where only the Pixel 8a is still listed), and a rather healthy $400 off the price of the Pixel 8 Pro for US shoppers.\n\nSo I\u2019d very much expect the Pixel 9 series to follow the example of its predecessors and drop in price once the Pixel 10 gets released.\n\nGiven what the Pixel 9 phones offer, especially the Pixel 9 Pro, they are compelling phones to buy right now, but they will have even more appeal with a price cut.\n\nWe have seen them drop in price during various sales this year so far. But a fixed discount and then likely some other price cuts from Google and retailers like Amazon, could see the Pixel 9 phones drop to bargain prices for devices that offer great cameras, solid performance, and a lot of smart software.\n\nWith that in mind, if I were looking for a new Android phone, I\u2019d hold fire for August 20 to see what the Pixel 10 series officially brings to the table and if there\u2019ll be a decent price cut for the Pixel 9 series.\n\nHowever, there is a slight caveat in that Google could simply discontinue the Pixel 9 series, other than the Pixel 9a, given that it\u2019s set to be very similar to the Pixel 10 series, and then keep select Pixel 8 models as the cheaper mid-range Pixel options.\n\nNow that would still leave third-party retailers with Pixel 9 phones, which I\u2019d be very confident in expecting them to discount in order to clear the way for the Pixel 10. But once these sold out, such a situation could mean it\u2019s game over for the Pixel 9.\n\nWe\u2019ll find out rather soon, but the crux of this article is that the Pixel 9 series is highly likely to get a price cut. So, my advice is to wait until August 20 before buying, as this will give you a chance to score a good price or avoid buyer\u2019s remorse if the Pixel 10 proves to be a bigger upgrade than expected.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 5 ways the Google Pixel 10 Pro can get ahead of the iPhone 17 Pro and Galaxy S26 Ultra\n\u2022 The Google Pixel 10 might let you edit photos with your voice (yes, really)\n\u2022 Which foldable is the thinnest? I measured the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Honor Magic V5, and Oppo Find N5 to find out",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is here, and Pixel fans can rejoice at the premium new look and incredible feel. Google\u2019s AI can be fun and even useful, if you don\u2019t think too hard about it, with camera tricks that add you to photos and a live AI voice that you can converse with. Don\u2019t make the Pixel 9 Pro think too hard, though, because the Google Tensor G4 chipset inside can barely keep up, leaving the next seven years of updates in question. But don\u2019t worry about that for now; just have fun taking the best photos and videos, chatting to the AI, and peering into the future \u2013 the Pixel 9 Pro leaves you wondering what\u2019s next.\nPros\n- +\nFantastic Pixel redesign with premium materials and finish\n- +\nExcellent cameras rival the best camera phones\n- +\nAI tricks are unique and creative without crossing lines\nCons\n- -\nPerformance lags significantly behind other flagship phones\n- -\nSome AI tricks feel a bit fake when you use them\n- -\nPrice is high compared to high-performance rivals\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro: Two-minute review\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro is the first flagship AI phone, but what does that mean? It means that AI isn\u2019t just powering cool editing tools in Photos or writing new messages in WhatsApp; AI is everywhere. It\u2019s the heart, and the recurring theme, of the Pixel 9 Pro. So what is it like to use the first AI flagship phone every day? It\u2019s kind of like living next to Disney World.\nLet\u2019s start with the design of the Pixel 9 Pro, which is just as polished and thoughtful as an expensive theme park. No detail is overlooked. This is the first phone I think I\u2019ve seen with a SIM card lid that\u2019s curved to match the corner of the phone. With its smoothly polished edges and premium materials, the Pixel 9 Pro feels better and more refined in my hand than any other phone I own \u2013 better than the iPhone 15 Pro Max or Galaxy S24 Ultra.\nNow let\u2019s go on some rides. When the Pixel 9 Pro is great, it\u2019s really thrilling. The new multi-modal Google Gemini AI can look at a photo and answer questions based on what it sees. Gemini Live gives you a conversational assistant that helps you brainstorm and create ideas in the most natural way you\u2019ve experienced with a computer. The new AI photography features create exciting, creative, and nearly flawless photos, whether real or imaginary.\nSometimes, it\u2019s all a bit much. Everywhere you turn there\u2019s a new AI feature asking to help. Open Google Keep to make a shopping list and Gemini will ask if it can help. Open Gmail to read your email, and Gemini will ask if it can summarize for you. Make a phone call and Gemini will ask if it can take notes.\nOnce you\u2019ve purchased a ticket to the Google Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s magic AI kingdom, there\u2019s no escaping it. In fact, it\u2019s only going to get bigger.\nI don\u2019t want this review to seem negative, because just like a big theme park the Google Pixel 9 Pro is incredibly well-designed, with thoughtful touches throughout, while remaining simple enough that a child or a harried parent could navigate through its menus.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLike that theme park, you might also wonder at the high cost of admission. The Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU $1,699 with a paltry 128GB of storage, which is like traveling to Disney World with only $128 in your wallet. You can manage, but only if you keep all of your stuff somewhere else, like Google\u2019s cloud.\nThankfully, Google is offering a year of Google One AI Premium with your Pixel 9 Pro, and that includes 2TB of cloud storage, in addition to Gemini Advanced access. That\u2019s a very big deal. In fact, if you were going to consider a Pixel 9 instead of a Pixel 9 Pro, and you were planning on paying for a year of the service, it would cost less to buy the Pixel 9 Pro and get the season pass for a year of One AI Premium from Google.\nEven when the AI features on the Pixel 9 Pro feel fake, they still feel fun. I can add myself to a group photo using Add Me in the camera, even though I wasn\u2019t part of the group. Using Pixel Studio, I made a movie poster for an inside joke between me and my friends. Using Gemini with Google\u2019s keyboard (er, Gboard), I turned mundane text messages into Shakespeare\u2026 ish.\nIs it all real? It\u2019s real cool, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s not always realistic, and sometimes it offers embarrassing suggestions, but isn\u2019t that the point of having fun at an amusement park?! We all know it\u2019s a bit fake, so maybe I should just stop complaining about realism and have a good time.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the Pixel 9 Pro is perfect. The phone has heat issues, which is worrisome considering the Pixel line\u2019s questionable history with overheating. My Pixel 9 Pro warned me that it was overheating on a fairly mild, sunny day, and it got so hot while taking pictures that it insisted on reducing my photo resolution.\nI was also left unimpressed by the meager performance of the Tensor G4 chipset. Like me at the end of a long day of rollercoasters and cotton candy, the Tensor G4 could be sluggish and unresponsive, and I don\u2019t just mean the AI features. Running a bunch of apps all at once could cause delays longer than the line for Splash\u2026 okay, you get it.\nThat said, the Pixel 9 Pro is undeniably exciting. It\u2019s a great-looking phone that I was happy to pick up every morning, and it takes such reliably great photos that I\u2019m thrilled to take it with me on my travels.\nThe best AI features are so useful that I sometimes struggle to remember the old way of doing things. I won\u2019t ever use another recording device for meetings or interviews, not while I have the Pixel Recorder app. I\u2019ve given up on annoying recipe websites in favor of the goodies Gemini Advanced helps me bake.\nEven better, some of the newest features on the Pixel 9 Pro feel like more than just features; they feel like a glimpse at the future. When I talk to Gemini Live and get interesting advice, or when I see the potential of the new Screenshots app, I feel like AI could create an entirely new mobile experience some day. Not yet, but some day.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Price and availability\n- Costs $999 / \u00a3999 / AU $1,699 for 128GB of storage\n- Rose Quartz only available in 256GB version or below in some regions\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699 for 128GB of storage, and you should consider more storage if you plan on recording a lot of video. Google is offering Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL buyers a year of Google One AI Premium, which includes 2TB of cloud storage and Gemini Advanced privileges (a necessary subscription for Gemini Live), a great deal that should have been extended to Pixel 9 buyers as well.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro comes in a nice array of natural colors, including a delightful pink Rose Quartz, a surprisingly appealing gray Hazel, the refined off-white Porcelain, and the boring old black Obsidian that I got as my review sample. The black is nice, if you like black or need a business look, but I\u2019m partial to more color and brightness.\nOddly, you may find that the Rose Quartz model is only available with 256GB of storage or less. The 1TB model is only available in the US, and it only comes in boring Obsidian.\nIf you\u2019re balking at the price, I\u2019d note that last year\u2019s Pixel 8 Pro launched in October, and by November it was already on sale with a significant discount. I suspect we\u2019ll also see discounts on the Pixel 9 Pro, but probably not until November.\nI don\u2019t think the phone is worth the asking price. The design is excellent, and it has the durability, and longevity with software updates, to make it last; I just don\u2019t think the poor performance and possible heat problems justify Google charging pretty much the same price as the Apple iPhone 15 Pro. That said, if you get a good deal, like a free storage upgrade or a bundle with Pixel Buds Pro, it\u2019s a much easier decision, and I\u2019d then recommend the Pixel 9 Pro without hesitation.\n- Value score: 4/5\n| Storage | US Price | UK Price | AU Price |\n| 128GB | $999 | \u00a3999 | AU $1,699 |\n| 256GB | $1,099 | \u00a31,099 | AU $1,849 |\n| 512GB | $1,219 | \u00a31,219 | AU $2,049 |\n| 1TB | $1,449 | Row 4 - Cell 2 | Row 4 - Cell 3 |\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Specs\nIn some ways the Pixel 9 Pro is a real specifications winner, but in one major way it falls behind. In terms of the Super Actua display and the new camera setup, the Pixel 9 Pro is a leader. It has the best display around, and the cameras are superlative. It also includes 16GB of RAM, which is a massive dose of memory for any phone that isn\u2019t made for hardcore gamers.\nThe Tensor G4 chipset is the bottleneck. We know the processing cores that Google used in building the Tensor G4, and the low-level performance isn\u2019t surprising. This chip is barely fast enough to compete with an iPhone 12 from 2020, let alone a Galaxy S24 or iPhone 15 Pro. And that\u2019s not just on paper; you can feel the sluggishness when you multitask with this phone.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro supposedly can support 45W charging, but we have questions about this claim \u2013 our power meters never registered more than 25W when the Pixel 9 Pro was charging. The charging times match Google\u2019s claims, but I wonder if the phone is really taking advantage of the faster charging.\n| Row 0 - Cell 1 | |\n| Dimensions: | 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm |\n| Weight: | 199g |\n| Display: | 6.3-inch Super Actua display |\n| Resolution: | 1280 x 2856 |\n| Refresh rate: | 1-120Hz |\n| Peak brightness: | 3,000 nits |\n| CPU: | Google Tensor G4 |\n| RAM: | 16GB |\n| Storage: | 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB |\n| OS: | Android 14 |\n| Cameras: | 50MP wide; 48MP Ultrawide; 48MP 5X zoom |\n| Selfie Camera: | 42MP |\n| Battery: | 4,700mAh |\n| Charging: | 45W |\n| Colors: | Obsidian, Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel |\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Design\n- Biggest Pixel redesign since 2020\u2019s Pixel 6\n- Fantastic materials and finish feel more premium than ever\nThe first thing I do with a gorgeous phone is flip it over in my hand. I hold it sideways, and flip the phone again and again to feel any grooves or unpleasant edges, and sharp corners where my skin catches. The Pixel 9 Pro is the smoothest, most polished phone I\u2019ve felt in years. It feels more pleasant to grip than my iPhone 15 Pro.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro doesn\u2019t have the uniquely shimmering depth of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but it matches Samsung\u2019s attention to material details, with great color options that fit perfectly with the matte glass and polished metal.\nThe most exciting detail about the Pixel 9 Pro is that it\u2019s\u2026 small? Is a 6.3-inch display really a small phone? It is when you have small pockets or smaller hands, and have been craving a high-end phone for years. If you wanted to buy a small phone before the Pixel 9 Pro, you couldn\u2019t get the best phone available. The Pixel 9 Pro changes that trend. It\u2019s a relief, and hopefully a trendsetter.\nTo wit: the iPhone 15 Pro is almost as good as the iPhone 15 Pro Max, except it doesn\u2019t have the same zoom lens camera or 3-axis image stabilization (not to mention the larger screen and battery). The humongous Galaxy S24 Ultra is in another class compared to the smaller Galaxy S24, which doesn\u2019t come close to the Ultra\u2019s camera capabilities, not to mention it has the S Pen (and larger screen and battery).\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is the same phone as the Pixel 9 Pro XL; the only thing it lacks is the XL. The screen is smaller, and so is the battery, and that\u2019s it. Same camera, same performance, same features \u2013 same everything else. This is the way it should be.\nGoogle says the Pixel 9 Pro is twice as durable as last year\u2019s Pixel 8 Pro, but I didn\u2019t put that claim to the test. I kept the phone in its matching silicone case, protecting its beauty. It has a Gorilla Glass Victus 2 front, and it has IP68 resistance against dust and water. Still, I didn\u2019t want any dings or scratches \u2013 it\u2019s just too pretty.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Software\n- Google pushes its AI to the limits, but doesn\u2019t cross any red lines\n- Some features are amazing, some are useless, some feel weird\nBefore I get to all of the AI features on the Pixel 9 Pro, I\u2019ll talk about the rest of the phone, and whether you must engage with AI to enjoy the Pixel 9 Pro. Google keeps a simple, elegant version of Android on its Pixel phones; the interface is clean and easy to understand, and doesn\u2019t have too many hidden shortcuts, or strange pop-up windows, or unique gestures that you need to learn. In fact, Google has taken more away from Android in recent years than it seems to have added, at least up top, on the home screens.\nThe Settings menu still grows needlessly complicated, with too many features shoved into corners and long lists of meaningless tech jargon. Surprisingly, Samsung does a much better job of turning its phone controls over to its Bixby AI. On my Samsung I can ask Bixby to do just about anything the phone can do, but on the Pixel 9 Pro, Gemini can be hit or miss when it comes to the phone features it can toggle.\nThings aren\u2019t as bad as you may have heard, though. Google Gemini can set a timer, just not from Gemini Live, the new conversational AI mode. It can toggle the Wi-Fi hotspot and turn on the flashlight, among other settings. It can adjust my home thermostat and get me local search results from Google Maps. It couldn\u2019t do any of these things a few months ago when it launched.\nIs Google Gemini ready to replace Google Assistant? Sure, why not? I don\u2019t think many people relied on Google Assistant as the most valuable feature of their phone, but it\u2019s possible that some day Gemini could be the part of your Pixel you use the most.\nGemini Live will be a stepping stone to this future. This is the new conversational AI built into Google Gemini Advanced. It isn\u2019t easy to find, though \u2013 you can\u2019t just press a button and start a conversation with Gemini. You have to open Gemini, then tap a small button near the text box. Then the chat begins.\nTalking back and forth with Gemini was surprisingly natural, if I was patient \u2013 that\u2019s because the time delay between responses is still very long. If a human responded this slowly I would think that I\u2019d had a bad phone connection. When Gemini Live does respond, though, the responses are excellent. The voice is immaculate, not at all robotic. The content it provides is useful and measured, depending on what you ask.\nTalking to Gemini Live is like talking to a polite friend who\u2019s noncommittal and doesn\u2019t want anybody to get into trouble. Its personal advice is cautious, with disclaimers and warnings. It makes suggestions that are often inaccurate. I asked for a good place to take my dog where we could see wildflowers and it suggested spots that were decidedly not dog-friendly. I asked for an interesting local date night and it suggested a scenic railroad dinner tour\u2026 that closed 20 years ago.\nWorst of all, Gemini Live simply failed during every conversation \u2013 after a few minutes it just quit talking.\nSome of the AI features are very good, often when the Pixel 9 Pro is taking transcription. The Pixel Recorder is the best voice recorder I\u2019ve ever used, and I\u2019ve been a journalist for decades. The new Call Notes feature is also clever and useful. I might complain about privacy, but the Pixel 9 Pro announces itself loudly to everybody on the call before it starts listening and taking notes.\nEven the photo features are surprisingly good, if you can get past the ick factor. The Add Me camera mode is amazing. You can add yourself to a group photo after the shot was taken. The result looks perfect, like you were there. Bodies don\u2019t overlap in weird ways, and the phone even gets shadows and lighting right.\nThe new Reimagine tool in the Magic Editor actually does a great job of changing photos to add new elements. You can add a herd of bunnies to your picnic, or a waterfall beneath your feet, and the end results are incredibly good. Are they real photos? No, but if you approach them with creativity and with tongue firmly planted in cheek, they can be fun and unique.\nI even like Google\u2019s AI image-generation tool, Pixel Studio. Google has wisely chosen to forbid its tool from making images with humans; it can make robots, and it can anthropomorphize animals into human poses, but it won\u2019t make an actual human being. Amen. I\u2019m so tired of image generators producing stereotypical people. Better to just avoid the topic, and let humans be creative without placing other humans in the picture.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Cameras\n- Amazing image quality with versatile camera features and editing\n- Settings can be very difficult, making it harder to use key features\nWithout question, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is a contender for the top spot on our list of the best camera phones you can buy. The image quality is excellent, and not just from the main camera, or the primary Photo mode. Google has made worthy improvements across the board to many different camera features.\nThe new night-time panorama mode is a game changer if you enjoy panoramic shots. Other phones don\u2019t come close; they hardly try. The Pixel 9 Pro can take real panorama photos at night, and I\u2019m excited to try this in every city I visit.\nGoogle says its video modes have gotten a serious boost, but I didn\u2019t test these features. I assumed, incorrectly, that Video Boost would be active by default. In fact, it\u2019s hidden under a special video settings menu that\u2019s only available when you have the video camera active. If you don\u2019t go into video mode and enable Video Boost, you\u2019ll never take advantage of Google\u2019s AI improvements to your video fidelity.\nThe same is true for Super Res video. If you haven\u2019t enabled the Video Boost feature, which as mentioned is turned off by default, you\u2019ll never see the new Super Res video feature in action.\nFor most photographs, though, the Pixel 9 Pro did a fantastic job, and was equal in quality to my iPhone 15 Pro Max, if not better in some cases. The Pixel 9 Pro had less of a problem with lens flare, which is caused when strong sunlight hits the lens and smears the image with bright artifacts. That\u2019s a win for the camera bar, in my opinion.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro also handled colors perfectly, where the iPhone 15 Pro Max would create photos with cooler tones than I saw in reality. For the night panorama, it isn\u2019t even a contest. The iPhone gave me a black bar instead of a photo, while the Pixel 9 Pro gave me a clear panorama.\nIf you\u2019re considering the Pixel 9 because you heard (from me!) that it has the exact same main camera and ultrawide camera as the Pixel 9 Pro, you may still want to pay more for the Pro Pixel. The Pixel 9 Pro has a Pro mode in the Camera app that the Pixel 9 lacks. That gives you access to full 50MP photos, while the Pixel 9 only produces 12MP images.\nIn fact, there are a number of Camera app advantages the Pixel 9 Pro has over the Pixel 9, thanks to more advanced software and AI. The Pixel 9 Pro can shoot videos in 8K resolution, while the Pixel 9 is limited to 4K videos. You can also enable Video Boost on the Pixel 9 Pro, but not the Pixel 9, and that includes the new Super Res Zoom Video feature.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro also just made better choices than the Pixel 9 in a given situation. In macro photos, the Pixel 9 Pro gave me better bokeh and depth, isolating my subject nicely. The brighter display also makes the Pixel 9 Pro just that much easier to use for photos in bright sunlight (which is surely how I overheated my phone).\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Camera samples\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Performance\n- If you were worried about Tensor G4 performance, you were right\n- Will this phone really last through seven years of updates?\nDoes performance matter on the best phones today? If you simply look at processor cores, which is like comparing car engine cylinders, the Pixel 9 Pro appears to use a slower engine than Galaxy S24 or Apple iPhone 15. How much slower? Quite a bit, actually.\nIn our Future Labs benchmark tests, the Pixel 9 Pro results were abysmal. On the Geekbench Multicore test, which runs all of the processing cores together, the Pixel 9 Pro averaged a score under 4,800. The Galaxy S24, with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset, averaged more than 6,900. That\u2019s a massive difference.\nWe saw similar deficits between the Tensor G4 and the latest Snapdragon and Apple A17 Pro chipsets when it came to gaming, video processing, and every other performance benchmark test. The big problem is that those benchmark scores correlate to my experience in the real world. The Pixel 9 Pro is slow. It can\u2019t handle a heavy workload.\nThere was no single task that choked the Pixel 9 Pro, but when I had multiple apps running together, things got sticky. If I had Spotify playing music, Waze navigating the roads, and Gemini giving me life advice, all at the same time, I could watch the Pixel 9 Pro freeze completely. Buttons on-screen simply stopped responding. I couldn\u2019t scroll my music playlist. The music kept playing, but the screen stalled for a few seconds. Not moments, actual seconds \u2013 one one-thousand, two one-thousand\u2026\nI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening, and I hope these are software problems that get smoothed out over time. The Pixel 9 Pro has an obscene amount of RAM; where is it all going if the phone can\u2019t multitask? I\u2019d hoped that 16GB of RAM would make the Pixel 9 Pro future-proof, but now I\u2019m a bit worried the phone isn\u2019t today-proof.\nAdditionally, my Pixel 9 Pro overheated the first time I took it out to take photos on a sunny day. It wasn\u2019t hot, it was only 79F / 26C, and it had just rained, so the weather was a bit cool, not too humid. I was using the Pixel 9, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and Pixel 9 Pro, with the same settings on each camera. The screens were all set to maximum brightness. The Pixel 9 Pro complained within minutes, and forced the camera resolution lower. Neither the Pixel 9 nor the iPhone had any trouble.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Battery\n- Fast charging meets Google\u2019s promises\n- Could be faster still, compared to the competition\nIn my real world testing, battery life was no problem, and the Pixel 9 Pro lasted all day on a normal day of use. I never had to charge the phone before bed time unless I used the camera extensively, which I did a few times during my testing period. The camera drains the battery fast, especially in bright sunlight with the screen brightness cranked all the way up.\nWe got more than 13 hours and 15 minutes of battery life in our rundown test with the Pixel 9 Pro. This phone has better battery life than the iPhone 15 Pro, which is a similarly-sized phone. The Samsung Galaxy S24 lasted a half-hour longer in our tests, but that still makes the Pixel 9 Pro a respectable competitor.\nAt least the Pixel 9 Pro charges faster than before. Google says the Pixel 9 Pro is the fastest-charging Pixel phone ever. Oh, wait, that\u2019s the Pixel 9 Pro XL, with its other very subtle advantage over the Pixel 9 Pro. The Pixel 9 Pro still wins with better battery life than its larger XL sibling. I\u2019m guessing that the bigger display simply requires more power, and that\u2019s why the Pixel 9 Pro got 13.5 hours of battery in our rundown tests, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL couldn\u2019t last more than 13 hours in the same test.\nGoogle says you can use a 45W charger to get better charging speeds. I\u2019m not so sure. I definitely saw the 45W charger make a difference when charging the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but the Pixel 9 Pro did not seem to charge any faster with a 45W charger than it did with a 25W charger. I asked Google to clarify, and they confirmed that this was the case.\nIf you plug a Pixel 9 Pro into a 45W charger, it will charge at\u2026 27W?! So, it won\u2019t come close to charging at full speed. The Pixel 9 Pro XL can manage 37W, which is why it\u2019s the fastest-charging Pixel ever. Even with a larger battery inside, it charges to full faster than the Pixel 9 Pro.\nCharging wattage weirdness aside, you can believe Google\u2019s charging claims. It says the Pixel 9 Pro charges to 55% in 30 minutes and that\u2019s exactly the result I saw.\nShould you buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value | It\u2019s a great phone all around, but performance lags significantly versus other phones in this price range, so maybe wait for a discount or a bundle deal. | 4 / 5 |\n| Design | Excellent new design; the biggest change to Pixel phones in four years. Fantastic materials and a more modern look. | 5 / 5 |\n| Display | Google offers the best smartphone screens around on the Pixel 9 Pro, and it\u2019s surprising the company doesn\u2019t crow louder. Super-bright \u2013 be careful to not overheat. | 5 / 5 |\n| Software | With a grain of salt and a sense of humor, the AI stuff is A-Okay. Google avoids bad AI stereotypes, and gives us a nice glimpse of the future for mobile AI. | 4 / 5 |\n| Camera | Fantastic cameras rival the best camera phones you can buy. Great new features, including Add Me for AI group photos. Camera settings are too difficult to manage. | 5 / 5 |\n| Performance | Performance lags significantly, both in benchmark testing and the real world. This phone lags if you push too hard, and Google wants you to push too hard. Seven years ahead? We\u2019ll see. | 3 / 5 |\n| Battery | Solid battery life beats the iPhone, and the phone has no trouble lasting all day. You\u2019ll want to use the cameras, so pack an extra charger, but if you\u2019re careful this phone lasts no problem. I wish the charging was as fast as Google makes it seem. | 4 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou like the look of the new Pixel\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has a great new look and feel that really delivers on the premium smartphone experience. You\u2019ll have a love-hate relationship with the case you\u2019ll buy to protect it.\nYou want great photos, both real and unreal\nDo you want to take great photos or do you want to create cool images? The Pixel 9 Pro does both. You can take the best pics, then change them with AI.\nYou\u2019ve always wanted to talk to a computer\nWith Gemini Live, you can have a real conversation with your phone. It doesn\u2019t do a great job at making recommendations, but it\u2019s good at just chatting.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou care that new iPhones are coming very soon\nIf you\u2019re aware that Apple launches a new iPhone like clockwork in September, then maybe you should wait to see what this year brings.\nYou like to save a little money around the holidays\nI have a strong feeling that this phone will get a discount towards the end of the year, just like the Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel 7 Pro before. Wait a little and you may save a lot.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Also consider\nGoogle Pixel 9\nThe Google Pixel 9 has most of the same cameras as the Pixel 9 Pro, with the same Tensor G4 chipset inside for all those AI features, including Gemini Live.\nSamsung Galaxy S24\nThe Galaxy S24 offers far superior performance, if you need to multitask, get a lot of work done, or just play hardcore mobile games. It also has slightly better battery life.\n| Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 | Samsung Galaxy S24 | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Price (at launch): | $999 / \u00a3999 / AU $1,699 | $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,349 | $799.99 / \u00a3699 / AU $1,399 |\n| Display | 6.3-inch Super Actua | 6.3-inch Actua | 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED |\n| Cameras | 50MP main; 48MP ultra-wide; 48MP 5x telephoto | 50MP main; 48MP ultra-wide | 50MP main; 12MP ultra-wide; 10MP 3x telephoto |\n| Processor | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy |\n| Battery | 4,700mAh | 4,700mAh | 4,000 mAh |\nHow I tested the Google Pixel 9 Pro\nI received the Pixel 9 Pro from Google and spent one week with the phone before writing this review. Another Pixel 9 Pro was also tested by Future Labs for benchmark and lab tests. I used the Pixel 9 Pro as my primary work phone, testing every feature, including calling and Call Notes, messaging, and web browsing. I also played games, listened to music, and played more games.\nI used the Pixel 9 Pro in my car for music and navigation, using Bluetooth and Android Auto. I also used the Pixel 9 Pro with a number of accessories, including the Pixel Buds Pro, Pixel Watch 2, Meta Ray Ban smart glasses, and other Bluetooth devices. I streamed video to my Google Chromecast connected to my TV.\nI tested the Google Pixel 9 Pro cameras alongside a Pixel 9 and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, taking photos under the exact same conditions and comparing results. For each camera, I used the mode that produced the highest-resolution image with the best image quality, and compared the full-size images on a professional Dell monitor.\nFuture Labs tests phones using a mix of third-party benchmark software and proprietary, real-world tests. We use Geekbench, CrossMark, JetStream, WebXPRT and Mobile XPRT, and 3DMark for performance testing. We test a phone's performance on tasks using Adobe Premiere Rush. We also measure display color output and brightness.\nFor battery testing, we have proprietary rundown tests that are the same for every phone, and we determine how long it takes for the battery to run down.\n\u2611\ufe0f 100s of smartphones reviewed\n\u2611\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nFirst reviewed August 2024\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronics reviews, starting more than 20 years ago at eTown.com.

      "text": "Google Pixel 8a: price, features, specs, and everything you need to know\nEverything you need to know about Google's new mid-ranger\nThe Google Pixel 8a has landed at a busy time, having been unveiled on the same day as the iPad Pro (2024) and the iPad Air (2024), but it deserves some attention, as this cheaper alternative to the Google Pixel 8 has quite a lot going for it.\nIn fact, it has many of the same highlights as its pricier sibling, including a Tensor G3 chipset, various AI features, and a 120Hz screen.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find an overview of every key aspect of the Google Pixel 8a, including just how affordable it actually is, and when you\u2019ll be able to buy it.\nCut to the chase\n- What is it? The latest mid-range Pixel phone\n- When is it out? Shipping on May 14\n- How much does it cost? It starts at $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849\nGoogle Pixel 8a: release date and price\nThe Google Pixel 8a was announced on May 7, 2024, and you can pre-order it now, with the phone set to ship on May 14.\nIt starts at $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849, which gets you 128GB of storage, and rises to $559 / \u00a3559 / AU$949 for a model with 256GB of storage. That\u2019s notable, because the Pixel 7a was limited to128GB.\nThe Pixel 8a also has the same starting price as that phone in the US, so Google hasn\u2019t pushed the cost up there, though it costs slightly more in the UK and Australia.\nGoogle Pixel 8a: design and display\nThe Google Pixel 8a looks a lot like the standard Pixel 8, as you might expect. Like that phone, it has an aluminum frame and a distinctive camera visor, along with more rounded corners than its predecessor.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHowever, Google has cut costs by cladding the phone in plastic rather than the glass of the Pixel 8, and giving it a slightly lower water resistance rating of IP67.\nThe Pixel 8a comes in at 152.1 x 72.7 x 8.9mm and 188g, and you can get it in a choice of Aloe (a light pastel green), Bay (light blue), Obsidian (black), and Porcelain (white) shades.\nAs for the screen, the Google Pixel 8a has a 6.1-inch 1080 x 2400 OLED display with a punch-hole camera at the top. The screen has a 120Hz refresh rate (up from 90Hz on the Pixel 7a), and a peak brightness of 2,000 nits.\nThe pixel density is 430 pixels per inch, and the screen size on paper sounds very similar to that of the Pixel 8. It's just 0.1 inches smaller, with larger bezels around it.\nGoogle Pixel 8a: cameras and battery\nThe Google Pixel 8a has a dual-lens rear camera, with a 64MP f/1.9 main sensor and a 13MP f/2.2 ultra-wide one (with a 120-degree field of view), along with a 13MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera on the front.\nThat\u2019s the same camera hardware as boasted by the Google Pixel 7a, and notably different to the standard Pixel 8, which has the same number of lenses but different sensors.\nThe Pixel 8a can shoot video in up to 4K quality at up to 60fps, and it has various AI features inherited from the Pixel 8, such as Magic Editor to make AI-powered edits, Best Take to include the best combination of facial expressions in group photos, Magic Eraser to remove unwanted features from images, and more. It\u2019s basically the full suite of Pixel 8 AI skills.\nAs for the battery, it's a 4,492mAh cell (up from 4,385mAh in the Pixel 7a), and it supports 18W wired charging, plus wireless charging.\nGoogle claims that the Pixel 8a offers over 24 hours of life, or up to 72 hours in Extreme Battery Saver mode, but we\u2019ll let you know whether it lives up to that in our full review, so keep a look out for that.\nGoogle Pixel 8a: specs and features\nThe Pixel 8a has a Tensor G3 chipset, just like the standard Pixel 8 and even the Google Pixel 8 Pro. This chipset is exclusive to Pixel phones, and it\u2019s fairly powerful \u2013 especially for a mid-ranger like the 8a \u2013 though no match for the top smartphone chipsets.\nIt\u2019s paired here with 8GB of RAM, and the phone runs Android 14, complete with various AI capabilities. We\u2019ve detailed some of these in the camera section, but it also includes the likes of Circle to Search, which lets you circle something on screen to search the internet for it, and Call Assist, which can screen calls, and sit on hold for you and alert you when you\u2019re up.\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini assistant is also included, and a day-one update should also bring AI generated wallpapers to the Pixel 8a.\nThe Pixel 8a also has an under-display fingerprint sensor, 5G, and comes with the promise of seven years of Android updates.\nYou might also like\n- Best Pixel phones: we've ranked all the Google Pixel handsets worth buying\n- Google Pixel 8 review: full of surprises\n- Google Pixel 8 Pro review: making more out of your phone\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "Which foldable is the thinnest? I measured the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Honor Magic V5, and Oppo Find N5 to find out\nHow does each supposedly record-breaking foldable measure up in practice?\nWhile features, camera capabilities, and raw performance are always at the top of the list when it comes to the defining characteristics of any decent smartphone, this year, thickness has been a big part of the conversation too.\nSamsung\u2019s wafer-thin Galaxy S25 Edge finally made it to market (and the iPhone 17 Air is seemingly on the way soon), but the battle for the title of \u201cworld's thinnest phone\u201d has been hottest among the best foldable phones.\nAs far as book-style foldables go, Oppo has held the crown for most of 2025 with the Oppo Find N5. It\u2019s an exceptional smartphone that might utilize the unique benefits of its form factor better than even the new Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nBut for everything I love about Oppo\u2019s entry, it isn\u2019t the thinnest anymore, at least not according to the companies behind these fresher-faced rivals (the Huawei Mate XT tri-fold notwithstanding).\nAlongside the Samsung, there's the upcoming Honor Magic V5, which is scheduled to go on sale internationally at the end of August.\nHonor proudly proclaims that the V5 is the \u201cworld\u2019s thinnest phone\" in the \"book-style\" foldable category, but some have suggested that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is, in fact, the design king.\nSo, in this article, I've decided to compare all three phones \u2013 the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the Magic V5, and the Find N5 \u2013 to see which is *really* the thinnest.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nI bought digital calipers specifically to fact-check these devices' dimensions, running the same measurement points across all of them; including ones the manufacturers don\u2019t mention \u2013 like thickness with the camera bump \u2013 because, if a phone\u2019s going in your pocket, or you\u2019re placing it down on a flat surface, that bump matters.\nLet's get into it...\nOppo Find N5\nStarting with the marginally older Find N5, Oppo states that it's 8.93mm thick when closed and just 4.21mm when open. Immediately, I wasn\u2019t able to get close to these numbers.\nIn my tests, my closed Find N5 clocked in at 9.17mm \u2013 that\u2019s 0.24mm thicker than Oppo\u2019s claims. Factor in the phone\u2019s circular triple camera bump, and that measurement grows to 13.8mm.\nFold the N5 open, and you\u2019re presented with the largest and sharpest display of these three phones. In this orientation, the Oppo clocked in at 4.36mm at its thinnest, while factoring in the surrounding frame raised the thickness to 4.43mm. Not numbers that Oppo cites, but still undeniably slim, regardless.\nHonor Magic V5\nNext up is the Magic V5. Honor has not stopped shouting about its new foldable since its initial unveiling, and despite an impressive-sounding (and record-breaking) 4.1mm thickness on the Ivory White model \u2013 which was, thankfully, the unit provided to me \u2013 the company has already had to defend this claim numerous times.\nAs such, I wasn\u2019t expecting to reach that magic number, but I also wasn\u2019t ready for V5 to come in thicker than the Oppo. The best measurement I managed to get was 4.47mm; 0.11mm thicker than what I recorded for the N5 when open. Account for the frame, and that figure rose to 4.5mm.\nClosing the V5, I logged a thickness of 9.39mm, which rose to a whopping 16.53mm when you take into account that deep triple rear camera array.\nOn the one hand, these numbers actually render the V5 the thickest of the three phones. But practically speaking, provided you can get on with the bump in your pocket, they allow for a great grip, especially when gaming and the like.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nFinally, the newcomer \u2013 the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. In the flesh, it looks distinctly different from the other two rivals; it's far sharper and more squared, in contrast to the rounded forms and curved edges of the Oppo and Honor. It looks slimmer by eye, too.\nDespite Samsung not really making any bold claims, and despite my measurements falling short of the phone\u2019s official quoted thickness, the Z Fold 7 still came in as the thinnest of these three foldables, at 4.35mm when open and 9.16mm when closed; pipping the Find N5 to the post in each instance by just 0.01mm (without making any allowances).\nAdd in that camera bump \u2013 which is led by a new 200MP sensor \u2013 and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 falls to the middle of the pack. However, the sensors' offset positioning does make the phone far more unbalanced than the other two entries when placed on a flat surface, which might bother some people in certain situations (users on Reddit have already come up with some novel ideas to combat the Fold 7's significant wobble).\nIt's also worth noting that Samsung ditched stylus support on the Fold 7 to deliver improved durability, which is something neither the Honor nor Oppo had to sacrifice with their latest foldables.\nResults\nLooking at the final results, you can see that \u2013 despite Honor\u2019s claims \u2013 based on my measurements, the Magic V5 actually proved to be the thickest, with the Oppo and Samsung in a close-fought battle for the title of \u2018world\u2019s thinnest\u2019, which the Z Fold 7 won by a hair.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Oppo Find N5 | Honor Magic V5 | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 |\n|---|---|---|---|\nOfficial thickness (open): | 4.21mm | 4.1mm (white model only) / 4.2mm | 4.2mm |\nMeasured thickness (open): | 4.36mm | 4.47mm | 4.35mm |\nOfficial thickness (closed): | 8.93mm | 8.8mm (white model only) / 9.0mm | 8.9mm |\nMeasured thickness (closed): | 9.17mm | 9.39mm | 9.16mm |\nMeasured thickness (closed inc. camera bump): | 13.8mm | 16.53mm | 14.68mm |\nConclusion\nOf course, you\u2019re probably not buying any of these phones for their wafer-thin profiles alone, and as such, there are practical reasons to opt for all three.\nSamsung\u2019s latest foldable comes with the cleanest-looking hardware, the longest software support \u2013 at seven years \u2013 the widest global availability, and the most dependable customer service, which is important in the event that something goes awry.\nEven though it\u2019s harder to get ahold of (at the time of writing, it's only available in Asia), the Find N5 gets my vote as the overall best foldable of the three, as I think the Oppo makes the best use of the foldable form factor.\nYou get ColorOS' excellent Open Canvas-powered multitasking, macOS interoperability with Remote Control via O+ Connect, and some of the smartest dynamically-surfaced AI features out there; not to mention stylus support.\nAnd if you\u2019re after the best specs and the biggest numbers, the Magic V5 has the most bombast. It boasts an impressive-looking camera setup, the largest battery, and the most diverse set of colorways to choose from.\nWe'll be posting our full review of Honor's latest foldable later this month, so stay tuned to see how it stacks up against the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Find N5 in terms of both hardware and software.\nYou might also like...\nAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL is just a bigger Pixel 9 Pro, but that's good enough. It doesn't have exclusive camera features or extra RAM for a boost, it's just got a bigger display and a bigger battery. That means the Pixel 9 Pro is an even better pick this year, but it also means that you can choose your Pixel based on the size you like, not the features you need.\nPros\n- +\nGreat new design is durable and sleek\n- +\nHuge amount of RAM should future-proof this Pixel\n- +\nBigger display and battery, faster charging\nCons\n- -\nNew AI features will require deep trust in Google\n- -\nExpensive compared to more powerful phones\n- -\nFast charging but no charger included\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL: Three-minute review\nIf you feel like new Pixel phones arrived sooner this year, you're right. Google's August Pixel hardware event gave us not a duo, but a quartet of new phones; starting at one end with the new baseline Pixel 9, and freshly topped with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nInto larger phones? Then the 'XL' nomenclature should tip you off as to where you might want to spend your money. This is the direct successor to last year's 6.7-inch Pixel 8 Pro.\nIt's the biggest (flat) Pixel yet and it sports a new design that marks a relatively significant shift in the series' aesthetic; the camera bar introduced with the Pixel 6 series is gone and instead we have the camera 'pill.'\nThe fit and finish have unquestionably been elevated, with the phone's polished frame adopting a much flatter form that's decidedly iPhone-like in its execution, and Google says new construction methods and material choices make it twice as durable as its predecessor.\nIn reality, the Pixel 9 Pro XL feels great, with the best build quality I've seen from Google to date; not to mention it looks superb, thanks to an updated Super Actua Display that boasts higher peak brightness than anything Apple or Samsung has to offer. The move to an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is welcome too, delivering on Google's promised speed improvement.\nThe same seven-year commitment to OS and security updates helps the Pixel 9 series stand apart from rivals from Apple and Motorola. The phones' earlier-than-usual arrival in the calendar year means that this is the first generation of Pixel in a long time that doesn't debut with a new build of Android. It will benefit from the same future releases of Android as the Pixel 8 line, and likely no more.\nBeyond the usual fare of a clean Pixel experience, AI is all Google is talking about. With an updated Gemini Nano model that is multi-modal and three times more capable running on-device, you'll find AI-generated features throughout the user experience.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMost notably, there are three new apps to play with: a new Weather app that's richer and more customizable, with AI-generated weather reports; a new Screenshots app that \u2013 as well as helping organize your captures \u2013 allows for semantic search; and Pixel Studio, which allows for on-device text-to-image generative AI that Google pitches as a new creative tool. Feel free to reconcile your feelings about using AI-generated imagery in your own time.\nThe cost of the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL also includes a year's access to Google One AI Premium with Gemini Advanced and its new Gemini Live feature. Gemini Live is a decidedly ChatGPT 4o-like conversational experience with Google's off-device AI. It works well for things like how-to guidance and recipe help, but still comes with limitations surrounding how it can actually action on-device tasks for you.\nAll the on-device AI experiences are powered by Google's new Tensor G4 SoC, paired with a new higher RAM ceiling of 16GB. Previous Pixels already felt fast in day-to-day use, but existing users will notice speed improvements for things like image processing and app load times; even if these gains are seemingly slight. Benchmarks only put the Tensor G4 about 10% ahead of the G3, in terms of CPU performance, with more noticeable graphical gains and, of course, NPU gains for AI tasks.\nThe other big aspect of any modern, AI-enhanced Pixel phone is the camera experience. The hardware looks, for the most part, similar to the Pixel 8 Pro, albeit with a much higher resolution selfie snapper and a tweaked ultrawide on the back. However, Google claims to have reworked its HDR+ pipeline end-to-end, meaning more true-to-life imagery.\nIn daylight, I had few complaints, and the Pixel 9 Pro delivers great detail and accurate colors and with dynamic range. Night Sight ensures low-light shooting is almost always rescued from unusable to usable, even if it can still be a little heavy-handed in its post-processing.\nThe expansion of that HDR+ pipeline to panoramas (paired with a new capture UI), means much better results, especially as Night Sight is now supported here too, although I do wonder whether this upgrade will simply manifest as a Feature Drop update for previous Pixel models in the near future.\nAnother Pixel 9 Pro exclusive is Video Boost, which can now scale 4K footage up to 8K and proves particularly useful when zooming up to the phone's 20x limit.\nThere's another side to the imaging experience on recent Pixels: Magic Editor. Beyond moving elements around in a shot or turning a blue sky to golden hour, the new Reimagine button lets you enter text to generate completely new elements in a shot. It's unquestionably fun and creative, but it also throws out any semblance of authenticity to shots you've captured yourself. Unlike Samsung, there's no AI watermarking going on with edited images, either.\nAlthough that Tensor G4 chipset doesn't mark a huge leap forward in raw horsepower, it certainly has helped with power efficiency, with the Pixel 9 Pro XL serving up almost 70% more screen-on time compared to the Pixel 8 Pro.\nThe jump from 30W to 37W wired fast charging speeds is a small but welcome bump too, although it looks like you'll have to grab Google's 45W charger for the absolute quickest recharge times, based on my testing with similar chargers.\nPerhaps the biggest benefit the Pixel 9 Pro line offers is that \u2013 beyond the XL's larger screen and physically bigger battery \u2013 there's no compromise across both sizes. If you're happy with the premium, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is the most unapologetic, bombastic Pixel experience you can have right now, outside of foldable land.\nEven if the jump from the Pixel 8 Pro isn't as significant as I would have liked, and it feels like this is more a means for Google to cultivate new Gemini Advanced subscribers, I can't help but appreciate the Pixel 9 Pro XL for being greater than the sum of its parts. It may only be just enough of an upgrade, but it is enough.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL review: Price and availability\n- Priced from $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,849\n- On sale from August 22, 2024\n- Pro Pixels now start above $/\u00a31,000\nWhile Google announced four phones at its August 2024 event, the standard Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL are the two that hit the market first, on August 22. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Fold arrive on the scene September 4.\nIn the UK, you can pick up the Pixel 9 Pro XL directly from Google, with double the storage at no extra charge on purchases made before September 5. US buyers can nab $200 in-store credit if ordering before August 28, and Australian buyers can pick up a limited edition poster with purchases made before August 25 (tough break, Australia).\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Pixel 9 Pro XL | Pixel 9 Pro | Pixel 8 Pro |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 128GB | $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,849 | $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699 | $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699 |\n| 256GB | $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$1,999 | $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,849 | $1,059 / \u00a31,059 / AU$1,799 |\n| 512GB | $1,319 / \u00a31,319 / AU$2,199 | $1,219 / \u00a31,219 / AU$2,049 | $1,179 / \u00a31,179 / AU$1,999 |\n| 1TB | $1,549 / \u00a31,549 / AU$2,549 | $1,449 / Unavailable in UK & Australia | $1,399 / Unavailable in UK & Australia |\nThe addition of the new smaller Pro model this year (which starts at a similar launch price to the larger Pixel 8 Pro), helps Google justify its decision to render the Pixel 9 Pro XL the most expensive candy bar Pixel to date: it starts at $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,849. It's practically like for like, when compared to equivalent storage options of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, truly putting an end to the notion that the Pixels are the 'affordable' flagship option.\nFor the asking price, you also get a year's access to a Google One AI Premium (2TB) plan which, as well as granting access to Gemini Advanced (which leverages the Gemini Pro 1.5 model) and Gemini Live, includes more general Google benefits like Fitbit Premium access, Nest Aware, 10% back on Google Store purchases, and unlimited Magic Editor saves in Google Photos.\n- Value score: 4 / 5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL review: Specs\n| Row 0 - Cell 1 | |\n| Dimensions: | 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm |\n| Weight: | 221g |\n| Display: | 6.8-inch 1344 x 2992 1-120Hz 'Super Actua' LTPO OLED |\n| Chipset: | Google Tensor G4 |\n| RAM: | 16GB (LPDDR5) |\n| Storage: | 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB (UFS 3.1) |\n| OS (at launch): | Android 14 |\n| Primary camera: | 50MP, f/1.68, 82\u00b0 FoV, 1/1.31-inch sensor w/ OIS |\n| Ultra-wide camera: | 48MP, f/1.7, 123\u00ba FoV, 1/2.55-inch sensor |\n| Telephoto camera: | 'New' 5x 48MP, f/2.8, 22\u00b0 FoV, 1/2.55-inch sensor w/ OIS |\n| Front Camera: | 42MP, f/2.2, 103\u00ba FoV |\n| Battery: | 5,060mAh |\n| Charging: | 37W wired, 23W wireless (2nd-gen Pixel Stand), 12W wireless (Qi) |\n| Colors: | Porcelain, Obsidian, Hazel, Rose Quartz |\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL review: Design\n- New Pixel aesthetic: the camera bar is dead\n- 100% recycled aluminum frame\n- Improved build quality\nA Pixel in iPhone font \u2013 that's the shorthand I keep coming back to with the new Pixel 9 series' design language. The size and feel of the XL's new squared aluminum frame immediately reminds me of Apple's current iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro Max in the hand. Does that polished metal attract fingerprints? Absolutely, but not anywhere near as badly as expected.\nThis new squared form, paired with the heaviest build of any candy bar Pixel yet (221 grams, the same as an iPhone 15 Pro Max), leads to a more premium look and feel overall. This is helped further by the Pixel 9 Pro XL's slimmer profile compared to the Pixel 8 Pro, and side by side with my wife's old Pixel 6 Pro, the jump in build quality is truly impressive.\nOne update I'm not sure I love quite so much is the loss of the camera bar, which is replaced in this generation with a camera 'pill' that protrudes out of the phone's rear panel at 90 degrees. It makes for a more bold and confident aesthetic, but it's not as quickly identifiable as the bar.\nAs well as the cosmetic changes, Google also claims that the Pixel 9 Pro XL's new mid-frame design, not to mention its 100%-recycled aluminum outer frame, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 front and rear panels, and IP68-certified protection against dust and water ingress, make the new phone twice as durable as its predecessor. In my time with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, by trying to keep it out of harm's way as much as possible, the finish has remained unscathed, but whether it'll age as gracefully as its titanium-clad competition from Apple and Samsung remains to be seen.\nBoth sizes of Pixel 9 Pro come in four colorways, with Obsidian pictured most prominently in this review. The Hazel finish most closely apes the iPhone 15 Pro's Natural Titanium look and the Galaxy S24 Ultra's Titanium Gray, while Porcelain and Rose Quartz offer decidedly more vivacious options.\n- Design score: 4.5 / 5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL review: Display\n- 6.8-inch Super Actua LTPO OLED\n- Improved HBM and peak brightness\n- New ultrasonic fingerprint sensor\nThe Pixel 8 Pro's Super Actua Display felt like a noteworthy upgrade from the panel on its predecessor and while not as earth-shattering an improvement this generation, the Pixel 9 Pro XL's screen is a great refinement, yet again.\nAlthough it sports the same resolution as the Pixel 8 Pro's panel (technically not as sharp as the Pixel 9 Pro), both high brightness and peak brightness levels have been cranked up to 2,000 and 3,000nits, respectively, meeting or beating key rivals in a spec-for-spec comparison.\nAdd to that the panel's flat design, its thin, equally-proportioned bezels on all sides, and its excellent viewing angles, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL's Super Actua display is a thing to behold.\nAs before, the use of an LTPO OLED panel facilitates a dynamic refresh rate from 1 to 120Hz, making it ideal for always-on display functionality, thanks to the implied power saving benefits, while also still serving up a snappy user experience when swiping around the UI.\nOne of the more prominent changes you might not immediately notice is the fingerprint sensor. Instead of the optical module used since the Pixel 6 series, Google has gone the way of Samsung and instead kitted the Pixel 9 Pro XL's display with an ultrasonic sensor. I didn't notice a huge difference when making the switch from my Pixel 7 Pro, but in side by side comparison is lives up to the promise of a 2x speed improvement. Perhaps more useful is the greater reliability, especially with damp fingers or when used in the rain.\n- Display score: 4.5 / 5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL review: Software\n- Seven years of OS & security updates\n- Launches with Android 14\n- Gemini AI is woven throughout the user experience\nOne side effect of this latest-generation Pixel launch happening earlier than usual is that the whole series runs Android 14. Typically, Google times the arrival of its latest smartphones to coincide with the release of the next Android, but the Pixel 9 debuts on the same Android 14 foundation as the Pixel 8.\nAt least the company's ever-impressive commitment to seven years of updates persists, meaning the phone's price tag includes excellent long-term support for both future releases of Android and subsequent security patches, an area where many rivals still fall short.\nAs a long-time Pixel user, the look and feel of Android on the Pixel 9 Pro XL is characteristically clean, easily navigable, pleasantly customizable (without being overwhelming), and dressed with helpful everyday features that aren't guaranteed on other phones.\nThat said, the Pixel 9 Pro XL does get some Pixel-exclusive additions that up the ante, all of which lean on Gemini AI.\nThere's a new dedicated Weather app that generates dynamic weather reports to make insights into each day's weather more digestible than ever. The ability to drag and drop the various in-app widgets for things like UV index, ten-day forecast, and air quality is a nice perk too.\nNext up is the new Pixel Screenshots app, which seems like an odd addition at first, but for list-makers, students, and journalists (like yours truly), it offers surprising depth. You can add notes to individual screenshots and group them into Collections, too. The app can index screenshot content across text and images, making it searchable. This allows for semantic search and object recognition, as well as recognizing WiFi passwords and QR-code information.\nPixel Studio uses an on-device variant of Imagen 3's diffusion-based text-to-image generative AI, allowing you to create imagery seemingly from scratch. You can remix results using pre-defined style prompts, or sculpt a completely original prompt if you prefer.\nAt launch, Pixel Studio won't render people, but it's fine with objects and animals. It also managed to render legible text without much artifacting, a challenging test that I've seen other image generators fail. Right now, the application proves novel enough but there's scope for everything from messaging to graphic design work, depending on your feeling towards the use of AI-generated imagery.\nGoogle Gemini\nThe price of the Pixel 9 Pro XL also includes a year's access to Gemini Advanced, meaning you can interact with its latest off-device model in Gemini 1.5 Pro and gain access to Gemini Live: Google's conversational AI experience.\nMy family tested it's abilities on a bean salad recipe \u2013 including suggestions on preparation and accompaniments \u2013 all without any obvious breaks in conversation or AI hallucinations. I also had it explain how to change various Gemini and Android settings, although its inability to take actions on many features feels like a missed opportunity, or at least an area that Google should focus on as its expands the assistant's functionality.\nA couple of other sprinkles of AI magic on the Pixel 9 Pro XL include text-based summaries of YouTube videos that I didn't have time to watch and Zoom Enhance image upscaling (although results were mixed). I'm also intrigued by the Call Notes feature shown off at launch, that'll summarize phone calls, however, this wasn't ready during review.\nThe most obvious criticism of Gemini on the Pixel 9 Pro is that it feels consistently slower when asked to carry out the same tasks I would have previously asked of Google Assistant. The trade-off is much richer results and more insight, provided you trust the source data Gemini's pulling from.\n- Software score: 5 / 5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL review: Camera\n- 50MP-led triple rear camera setup\n- New 42MP front-facing camera\n- New AI-supported features like Add Me and Reimagine\nNowhere is AI more prevalent across the Pixel 9 Pro XL's user experience than the camera. While it might have gone by 'machine learning' in the early days of the Pixel camera experience, AI-powered post-processing has been the secret sauce that has helped elevate the reputation of the Pixel cameras over the past four years, to the point where they regularly sit among the best camera phones.\nAs Google has focused its efforts on AI more directly, the proposition of a Pixel camera has changed somewhat, with capture and editing becoming two distinct facets of the experience.\nIf you're looking for a great all-round camera phone, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is right up there. A revised HDR+ pipeline puts into practice the company's learnings from previous entries, paired with new training data to create images with a more true-to-life appearance, better exposure, dynamic range, detail, contrast and color.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL camera samples\n0.5x zoom\n1x zoom\n2x zoom\n5x zoom\n30x zoom\n0.5x zoom\n1x zoom\n2x zoom\n5x zoom\n30x zoom\nMain sensor w/o macro\n5x zoom\nLow light manual control\nMain sensor\nMain sensor w/o macro\nSelfie\nSelfie w/ portrait mode\nAdd Me final result\nUltra-wide macro mode\nMain sensor w/o macro\nLow light selfie\nNight Sight selfie\nHigh contrast comparison shot on Pixel 9 Pro XL\nHigh contrast comparison shot on Pixel 7 Pro\nThere's a little inconsistency when shooting between the updated ultra-wide's macro mode and macro shots taken on the main 50MP wide sensor, for example, but results remain consistent in how appealing and usable they are. I'd have also liked a lighter hand with the default simulated bokeh when shooting portrait mode shots (something the likes of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra nails), but these are minor grievances and fixable on-device.\nNight Sight continues to impress in low light, while support has now been expanded to include the oft-overlooked panorama mode. Led by a new UI that ensures you hold the phone still enough for each shot it stitches together, the results generated are far more impressive than anything capable by previous entries; delivering much better detail and color capture than ever before.\nVideo Boost is another Pro Pixel-exclusive feature worth shouting about, thanks to the addition of 8K upscaling on 4K footage, the results of which can be quite staggering; especially when zooming in on the phone's 20x magnification. Even if you don't see the need for 4K or 8K footage natively, the extra wiggle room those added pixels afford you makes the experience of creating and editing content far more flexible.\nAdd Me is a great new addition this generation that solves the problem of getting a group shot, when there's no wall to rest your camera on or passer-by to accost and entrust with taking a photo with you and your friends in. If, like me, you're serially the photographer of your friendship group, this could prove to be a game-changer.\nThere was certainly trial and error involved, but once we and the phone both understood the goal, results improved until we had a usable shot seemingly taken by a fourth unseen photographer who was never there.\nA successful Add Me shot\nA failed Add Me attempt\nPart 1 of the successful Add Me shot\nPart 2 of the successful Add Me shot\nEven more so than the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's/ Galaxy Z Fold 6's Sketch to Image feature, the generative image tools on the Pixel 9 series unashamedly barge passed the line of authentic photography. At least personally, I'm fine with automated HDR bracketing and tone mapping, in order to produce a photo that's better than I could muster, even if I had full manual control. However, I start to feel uncomfortable with the idea of sharing images shot on the Pixel that have used the full might of the newly-enhanced Magic Editor.\nThe ability to change a blue sky to that of golden hour and remove unwanted people from the background were novelties that challenged my comfort level, but the new Reimagine feature within Magic Editor doesn't hold back in letting you endlessly rework a shot until it's something entirely different.\nIn one shot (above), I surrounded my friends and I with sunflowers and then added a scarecrow for good measure. The results don't hold up to close scrutiny, but like most AI-manipulated images, if you don't have prior context, you're less likely to question its authenticity.\nA more subtle edit that really impressed/unnerved me was Reimagine's ability to change the ground on a pebbled beach into more ocean (below); creating a rippled mirror surface with an accurate reflection of the clouds in the sky above.\nYour mileage with Magic Editor will vary, depending on how scrupulous you feel about using its image-doctoring abilities and whether or not you feel the need to contextualize the results when you share them.\n- Camera score: 4.5 / 5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL review: Performance\n- Debut of Google Tensor G4 SoC\n- New 16GB RAM ceiling\n- 128GB to 1TB storage (non-expandable)\nWhile the Pixel 9 Pro XL feels more than equipped for everything you throw at in right now, including high-fidelity mobile games, there's no getting around the fact that Tensor chips continue to lag behind Apple's iPhone chips and Qualcomm's top-tier Snapdragons in terms of raw processing and graphical grunt.\nWhether it's a matter of the shorter turnaround between generations of Pixel, or the fact that it's not Google's focus, the new Tensor G4 chipset powering all of the Pixel 9 series doesn't pack that much more horsepower, even compared to the Tensor G3.\nIt's built on a similar 4nm process as the Tensor G3, but with new core architecture and one fewer high efficiency cores than its predecessor. The switch from an Immortalis to a Mali GPU means no more ray tracing, a small but notable loss for mobile gamers.\nIn testing, the Tensor G4 processor produced a 10% bump to CPU performance, a 15% graphical performance improvement and a 16% uptick in NPU performance over the last generation, however, the biggest gains look to be in power efficiency (more on that later).\nAs with its predecessor, the Pixel 9 Pro XL can be had in four storage variants, however, the 1TB ceiling appears to be a US exclusive, while other markets, including the UK and Australia, top out at 512GB. Its 16GB of RAM is a range-wide upgrade, likely driven by the phone's newfound AI capabilities, but spec-heads will note that Google isn't using the latest available standards of either LPDDR memory or UFS storage, compared to Samsung's Galaxy S24.\n- Performance score: 3.5 / 5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL review: Battery\n- 5,060mAh battery\n- Improved 37W wired charging\n- Impressive 9.5 hours of screen-on time per charge\nGoogle has propelled the Pixel 9 Pro XL from a one to a two-day phone. While Pixel batteries have gotten larger over the years, battery life has never really been a positive talking point for the line. Through presumed optimization led by the new Tensor G4, however, the Pixel 9 Pro XL serves up superb longevity by comparison; significantly longer than any previous Pixel we've tested.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL got 9.5 hours of screen-on time, which clocks in at around 65% longer than the 5.75 hours the Pixel 8 Pro was able to muster, despite packing a battery that's around 10mAh smaller (5,050mAh).\nGoogle hasn't stopped there, with faster 37W charging, promising up to 70% charge in just 30 minutes. The company has introduced a new 45W Pixel charger to facilitate the 9 Pro XL's new top charging speed (which is faster than the smaller 9 Pro's 27W charging), however, this was unavailable during review. Instead, I tried Google's previous 30W wired charger \u2013 which pushed the Pixel 9 Pro XL to 55% charge in 30 minutes, while a 65W PD PPS charger got closer to Google's quoted speeds, with 65% charge in 30 minutes, and a full charge in 1 hour 20 minutes.\n- Battery score: 4 / 5\nShould you buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value | The priciest (candy bar) Pixel yet but with a price that includes the latest AI features and 7 years of software support, it seems like decent value. | 4 / 5 |\n| Design | Less original than its predecessors but excellent build quality and improved durability are hard to argue with. | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Display | A nice upgrade on the previous Super Actua Display that's brighter than key rivals | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Software | Launched with Android 14 like its predecessor but with 7 years of support and loaded with helpful features, plus heaps of AI tools to put to the test. | 5 / 5 |\n| Camera | A familiar Pixel camera experience, with even more powerful AI editing tools, if you like that sort of thing. | 4.5 / 5 |\n| Performance | The Tensor G4 is a mild update that undermines an otherwise-excellent phone, but it still delivers where it needs to. | 3.5 / 5 |\n| Battery | A huge improvement for the Pixel line that means the 9 Pro XL is something of a battery champ. | 4 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want the richest mobile AI experience\nSamsung's Galaxy AI is great, but Google's execution with Gemini Advanced is easier, richer, and more fun to use.\nYou want an excellent camera phone\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL's camera system is a small but appreciated upgrade on its predecessors, highlighted by a new bag of AI-supported tricks you can't get outside of the Pixel family.\nYou plan on using this phone for a long time\nStill among the best there is, Google's commitment to seven years OS and security updates is, once again, hard to argue with.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want fast charging\nBattery life is greatly improved but despite a bump in speed, the Pixel 9 Pro XL's 37W wired charging is still well behind what rivals like OnePlus and Xiaomi offer.\nYou want the best RAM and memory\nWhile Samsung forges ahead, Google seems reluctant to move to the latest, fastest and most power efficient RAM and storage in its phones, which stings when they cost about the same.\nYou want to play a lot of games\nGoogle's mobile silicon isn't built for gaming, and while the Tensor G4 handles intense games well, you'll get a much better experience with a recent iPhone or any flagship rival running the latest Snapdragon chipset.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL review: Also consider\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL is a superb large-screened Android phone with a great camera and decent battery life (finally), but its AI-heavy blend won't suit everyone.\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\nA sharper screen, faster charger, faster storage and memory, more horsepower and stylus input for good measure; not to mention the same impressive software commitment as the Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nApple iPhone 15 Pro Max\nIf you want much of what the Pixel 9 Pro XL has to offer but prefer a phone with more performance and gaming prowess, and less of a focus on AI, the latest and greatest iPhone is your best choice.\nGoogle Pixel 8 Pro\nEven without the price drop, the gap between the 8 Pro and the 9 Pro XL isn't that massive, especially where software promise and performance are concerned. If you can live with the weaker battery life, most other upgrades are likely to make it to the 8 Pro in time via software updates.\n| Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra | Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max | Google Pixel 8 Pro | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Price (at launch): | From $1,299 / \u00a31,249 / AU$2,199 | From $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,199 | From $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699 |\n| Dimensions: | 162.3 x 79.0 x 8.6mm | 159.9 x 76.7 x 8.25mm | 162.6 x 76.5 x 8.8mm |\n| Weight: | 232g | 221g | 213g |\n| OS (at launch): | Android 14 | iOS 17 | Android 14 |\n| Display: | 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X | 6.7-inch Super Retina OLED | 6.7-inch Super Actua OLED |\n| Chipset: | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy | Apple A17 Pro | Google Tensor G3 |\n| RAM: | 12GB | 8GB | 12GB |\n| Storage: | 256GB / 512GB / 1TB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\n| Rear Cameras: | 200MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 50MP periscope (5x), 10MP telephoto (3x) | 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 12MP telephoto (5x) | 50MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide, 48MP 5x zoom |\n| Front camera: | 12MP | 12MP | 10.5MP |\n| Battery: | 5,000mAh + 45W wired, 15W wireless | 4,441mAh + 27W wired charging | 5,050mAh + 30W wired, 23W wireless (2nd-gen Pixel Stand), 12W wireless (Qi) |\nHow I tested the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL\n- Review test period: one week\n- Testing included: everyday use including web browsing, social media, photography, video calling, gaming, streaming video, music playback\n- Tools used: Geekbench 6, Geekbench ML, Geekbench AI, GFXBench, 3D Mark, native Android stats, Google Pixel 30W USB-C charger, Samsung 65W trio charger\nI received the Pixel 9 Pro XL sample directly from Google, the day after the August Pixel hardware event concluded and was testing it as my daily driver everyday since.\nI kept track of battery usage each day and run several benchmarking apps for comparison to other devices, but otherwise used the phone as I would my own, in addition to taking time to test all of the key new features of the device.\nAs a reviewer with 13 years experience, and having reviewed numerous Pixels, not to mention mainlining a Pixel 7 Pro since its launch in late 2022, I felt confident assessing and scoring the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, both relative to other Pixels, and in the context of the wider smartphone market in which it competes.\nFirst reviewed August 2024\nAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables.

      "text": "A fresh leak means we may have pricing details for the Google Pixel 10\nAs you were.\n- We have leaked prices for the Pixel 10\n- They mostly match the Pixel 9 prices\n- These phones could appear in August\nIf Google sticks to its expected schedule then we could see the Pixel 10 phones make their debut sometime next month, and a new leak has provided some pointers on how these flagship handsets might be priced when they do appear.\nAccording to well-known tipster Roland Quandt, the Pixel 10 will start at \u20ac899, the Pixel 10 Pro at \u20ac1,099, the Pixel 10 Pro XL at \u20ac1,299, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold at \u20ac1,899, with larger capacities costing more in each case.\nThere's not much point giving you currency conversions for those figures, as they won't match the eventual prices, but the corresponding prices for last year's phones match up exactly \u2013 so it seems Google has managed to avoid any price hikes.\nThe only caveat is with the Pixel 10 Pro XL: the \u20ac1,299 leak is for 256GB of storage. The Pixel 9 Pro XL originally cost \u20ac1,199 for 128GB of storage, \u20ac1,299 for 256GB, \u20ac1,429 for 512GB, and \u20ac1,689 for 1TB, so the 128GB option may be dropped this time around.\nThe price is right?\nIf Google does stick to last year's prices, that would be $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,349 for the Google Pixel 9, $999 / \u00a3999 / AU $1,699 for the Pixel 9 Pro, $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,849 for the Pixel Pro XL, and $1,799 / \u00a31,799 / AU $2,699 for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nOf course, international tariffs, taxes, and exchange rates may apply, as always. We may see some variation from country to country, but based on these leaked prices in euros, Google is aiming to hit the same price points as last year.\nConsidering these Pixel 10 phones could be launching next month, we haven't seen too many rumors and leaks about what to expect. Performance upgrades are certain, though they may not be huge ones.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWe've also seen some information about colors and storage options \u2013 and that leak does mention a 128GB version of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, by the way \u2013 as well as hints that camera upgrades could be in the offing too.\nYou might also like\nDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

      "text": "5 ways the Google Pixel 10 Pro can get ahead of the iPhone 17 Pro and Galaxy S26 Ultra\nAhead of the game\nGoogle has announced that its annual Made by Google event will take place on August 20 this year, and we\u2019re expecting to hear all about the long-rumored Google Pixel 10 lineup.\nThough we\u2019re bound to see reveals for the full Google Pixel 10 family, I\u2019ve got my eye on one model in particular \u2013 the Google Pixel 10 Pro.\nOne thing you may notice is that this list doesn\u2019t highlight the Tensor G5 as a standalone upgrade \u2013 that's because the current-gen Apple A18 Pro and Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy are so far ahead of Google\u2019s chipsets that it\u2019s very unlikely Pixels could catch up in a single generation.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro was our phone of the year in 2024, so I\u2019m keen to see if Google can outdo not only itself, but upcoming competition from Apple and Samsung. With the iPhone 17 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra tipped to be perhaps the most powerful phones ever released, Google will need to step up its game to get ahead of these unreleased rivals.\nWith that said, here are 5 ways the Pixel 10 Pro could get ahead of the iPhone 17 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra.\nFaster charging\nAs it stands, none of the big-name flagships charge particularly quickly. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra leads the pack with a maximum 45W power draw, while the Google Pixel 9 Pro clocks in at a 27W maximum. Apple, in typical fashion, hasn\u2019t shared the power draw for the iPhone 16 Pro, but testing has revealed a top-end charging power of around 30W.\nIf the latest rumors are to be believed, this could change with the next generation of flagships. The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is rumored to ship with support for 60W charging, while MacRumors reports the iPhone 17 Pro could get 35W wired charging.\nAs for the Google Pixel 10 Pro, Android Authority reports that Google\u2019s next flagship could have its charging speed upped to 60W, which keeps up with Samsung\u2019s rumored charging improvements, and firmly beats Apple\u2019s.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThat leaves wireless charging as Google\u2019s chance to best Samsung when it comes to battery top-ups. The Google Pixel 10 Pro is expected to support 15W wireless charging, while the Galaxy S26 Ultra is tipped to get 25W wireless charging (via GSMArena). Both phones are rumored to support the Qi2 wireless charging standard, though, so Google could surprise us yet.\nEven better cameras\nGoogle Pixel phones are known for their excellent camera systems, and often make their way onto our list of the best camera phones \u2013 while you will find iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones on that list too, the Pixel series has made a name for itself by offering an intuitive camera app, well-calibrated image processing, and exceptional night photography.\nWith the Google Pixel 10 Pro, I basically want to see Google do more of the same.\nIn terms of software, I think some image processing improvements and some cool new photo and video modes would do the trick (the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s night panorama mode was very impressive). As for hardware, there\u2019s always room for bigger sensors or wider apertures.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro has been tipped to get a new 8x zoom lens, while the Galaxy S26 Ultra is tipped to get wider apertures for its main and 5x telephoto camera. There\u2019s no need for Google to match these specs exactly, though \u2013 so long as the Pixel 10 Pro continues to refine its photography experience, we\u2019ll have a reason to recommend it against the competition.\nA new button (or two)\nIn a world of customizable buttons, shutter buttons, ringer switches, and more, the Google Pixel 9 series stands out for its simplicity \u2013 a volume rocker and power button is all you get.\nWhile we\u2019ve not heard any rumors about new buttons for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, the iPhone 17 Pro is likely to come equipped with the same Action Button and Camera Control capacitive button as the iPhone 16 Pro.\nAs mentioned, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is a great camera phone \u2013 perhaps a shutter button would give it an edge over the iPhone for those who appreciate the Pixel\u2019s more natural image processing but prefer a tactile experience.\nOn the other hand, a customizable button like the ones seen on iPhones or recent OnePlus phones could give Pixel users a hardware link to the phone\u2019s AI features. Google Pixel phones get new Android features first, so giving power users an instant way to access tools like Gemini could give Google an edge.\nMore cohesive AI\nSpeaking of AI, our in-depth Google Pixel 9 Pro review noted that Google\u2019s Gemini AI suite doesn\u2019t always feel like the cohesive experience it\u2019s designed to be, lacking the contextual awareness and in-app operability of, say, Samsung Bixby.\nAdmittedly, most AI features are tied to software rather than hardware, so it\u2019s likely that any improvements that come to Google Pixel 10 Pro will eventually reach the Google Pixel 9 Pro and select older models.\nWith that said, it\u2019s very likely the Google Pixel 10 Pro will get a performance boost over the Google Pixel 9 Pro thanks to the rumored Tensor G5 chipset, which could lend itself to exclusive AI features.\nStill, smartphones are marketed as AI devices these days, so launching the Google Pixel 10 in tandem with a refreshed, more coherent Google Gemini and some exclusive features could still give the phone an edge over Apple and Samsung.\nA new design (or an old one?)\nWe\u2019ve probably seen the final designs of the Pixel 10 lineup already thanks to Google accidentally sharing product images, but it\u2019s worth considering some aesthetic decisions that might give the Google Pixel 10 Pro the upper hand over its rivals.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are due to get a new bar-style camera housing that resembles the Google Pixel 9 series \u2013 though images and renders of the upcoming iPhone suggest a look that isn't quite as refined as Google\u2019s flagship offering.\nAs for the Galaxy S26 Ultra, the latest tips suggest a new Galaxy S25 Edge-style design focused on thinness, with a protruding camera housing similar to the Edge and Galaxy Z Fold 7. That design has already split opinions online, so there\u2019s no saying whether it\u2019ll be a popular change.\nThis is all to say that Google not changing up the design of the Pixel 10 Pro could be a winning choice. If the iPhone 17 Pro and Galaxy S26 Ultra are both due for possibly controversial design changes, then perhaps keeping things consistent will make the Pixel 10 Pro stand out in comparison.\nYou might also like\nJamie is a Mobile Computing Staff Writer for TechRadar, responsible for covering phones and tablets.

      "text": "2024 was a strange year for phones. Software packages like Galaxy AI, Google Gemini, and Apple Intelligence dominated keynotes and marketing campaigns, while hardware innovations were, for the most part, relegated to the sidelines.\nOn the outside, the best phones of 2024 were largely indistinguishable from their predecessors, with the exception of the Google Pixel 9 Pro, which felt properly different from the Pixel 8 Pro before it. Google refreshed its tired Pixel lineup with a more grown-up, modern-looking phone, and the Pixel 9 Pro also boasted the cleanest implementation of AI we\u2019d seen at the time (Samsung\u2019s Galaxy AI has arguably caught up since then).\nFor those reasons, the Pixel 9 Pro earned our Phone of the Year award for 2024. But judging by what I\u2019ve seen so far of the Pixel 10 Pro, I don\u2019t see Google\u2019s next flagship repeating the feat in 2025.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro is set to debut at this year\u2019s Made by Google showcase on August 20, but it\u2019s already been semi-unveiled in an official teaser video, and countless leaks and rumors have given us an almost nailed-on idea of what to expect.\nIt\u2019ll reportedly look almost identical to the Pixel 9 Pro, use a more powerful Tensor G5 chipset, and its battery will be marginally larger. We\u2019ll also, of course, get some new colors, including a fetching \u2018Moonstone\u2019 shade.\nOn the software side, the Pixel 10 Pro is rumored to launch with a new photography feature called Camera Coach, which will use AI to analyse images fed through the camera and offer contextual suggestions.\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much it.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhere the Pixel 9 Pro represented a major generational leap over the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro will seemingly be an iterative upgrade over the Pixel 9 Pro. It won\u2019t have the same feeling of newness or innovation, and as a result, I\u2019m not expecting it to scoop this year\u2019s Phone of the Year award on that basis alone.\nWeirdly, though, I don\u2019t see this as a bad thing. In all areas except raw power, the Pixel line has caught up to the best iPhones and best Samsung phones, and now Google can afford to do what both Apple and Samsung do so often: innovate iteratively.\nI know that sounds strange \u2013 don\u2019t we, as tech fans, hate iterative upgrades? \u2013 but we can\u2019t shower the Pixel 9 Pro with praise and then expect (or want) Google to bring an entirely new product to the table the very next year. It got so much right with the Pixel 9 Pro, and it\u2019s unrealistic to expect its successor to bowl us over in quite the same way.\nIf I were a Pixel fan, I\u2019d be OK with that. Heck, as an iPhone user, I\u2019ve already written about how the Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone will test my loyalty to Apple. I think the phone looks great \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t look particularly new.\nWho knows? Maybe those aforementioned upgrades will be enough to see the Pixel 10 Pro scoop our Phone of the Year award in 2025. I\u2019m simply suggesting that Google has made a rod for its own back with the success of the Pixel 9 Pro.\nAre you looking forward to the Pixel 10 Pro?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is my favorite new foldable phone, and it\u2019s all about the way it looks and feels. It looks like a normal phone, it feels thin and not bulky, and it\u2019s incredibly fun, whether I keep it open or closed. The AI features are powerful \u2013 maybe even too powerful \u2013 and the huge inner screen is the best canvas for the Pixel Studio image generator or the Reimagine photo editing. It falls short of the flat Pixel 9 Pro in many ways, but it makes up the difference when you open up the tablet hidden in your phone.\nPros\n- +\nThinnest foldable you can buy (depending on where you live)\n- +\nBiggest screen ever crammed into a phone\n- +\nAmazing design fulfills the foldable promise\nCons\n- -\nAI features make horrible images with no indication it\u2019s AI\n- -\nSeriously, I made a Pooh bear doing drugs off of Eeyore\n- -\nHas nobody considered that this AI stuff is really bad?!\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Two-minute review\nThe ideal foldable phone is a magic trick you can show your friends. \u201cLook at my phone, it looks totally normal\u2026 but wait!\u201d and then you surprise them by pulling a tablet out of your hat. The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the first foldable that nails the trick. Some others have come close, but the Pixel 9 Pro Fold gives you more on the outside, and it turns out that equals more on the inside as well.\nThe front display on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the same as the one on the Pixel 9, no more and no less. It isn\u2019t close-but-a-bit-smaller, as on the OnePlus Open. It definitely isn\u2019t slimmed to fit, as on the Samsung Galaxy Fold 6. It\u2019s perfect: it's incredibly bright and colorful, and except for the slightly larger bezel on the hinge side, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold looks exactly like a normal phone.\nOpen the phone and you get the largest screen ever hidden inside a foldable phone \u2013 or any phone, really. At a full eight inches, you actually get more screen space from the new Pixel Fold than you would from an 8.3-inch iPad mini, since the iPad is narrower.\nHidden is the name of the game, since the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the slimmest foldable phone you can buy (BIG ASTERISK). It\u2019s only 10.5mm thick when closed, which is less than two millimeters thicker than the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.\nWhat\u2019s the asterisk? The Honor Magic V2, a foldable phone you can\u2019t buy most places where Google sells the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, is 9.9 millimeters thick when closed. Its sequel, the Magic V3, is only 9.2 millimeters but that phone is only available in China at the time of writing.\nSo that\u2019s the pitch for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It\u2019s a normal Pixel on the outside, and an iPad mini on the inside. Frankly, if Apple had built this phone we would end the conversation right here, because you\u2019d be convinced to buy one no matter what it costs. (\"How much does it cost? Did I mention it\u2019s the thinnest foldable you can buy?!\")\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is loaded with AI features, and this might be the best phone for having fun with Google\u2019s AI. Sure, you can Magic Edit and Reimagine photos on a Pixel 9 Pro, but on the Pro Fold you get the biggest screen possible, and it makes a huge difference when you\u2019re selecting parts of your pics to change.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nUnfortunately, there just isn\u2019t much else to do with the unique screen options. Don\u2019t get me wrong; everything looks great when you see it on the inner display. Games are fantastic, and it's fun that top-tier games like Disney\u2019s Speedstorm have special modes just for foldable phones to give you a different view when you bend the screen. But\u2026 where\u2019s the rest?\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is too expensive to just be a phone and a mini tablet. It needs to be more than the sum of its parts. It needs to offer more unique experiences that take advantage of the dual-screen design, and the foldable inner screen.\nRight now, I can count the benefits on one hand \u2013 and you can count along, even if you speak a different language, thanks to the dual-screen translator. There, that\u2019s one feature. Une. Uno. \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d. I can use the second screen to make faces at kids when I take their picture. That\u2019s two. Duas. Due.\nI\u2019m hoping to see a lot more from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in the years to come. Like the rest of the Pixel 9 family (and unlike the Pixel Fold), the Pixel 9 Pro Fold gets seven years of Android updates, security patches, and Pixel feature drops. I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019re just seeing the beginning of what Google can do with multiple displays, because today the Pro Fold holds too much missed potential.\nOne final note: as I was putting the finishing touches on this review, my Pixel 9 Pro Fold's inner display broke. I was cleaning the inner display with a Zeiss Lens Wipe, a gentle, pre-moistened cloth made for delicate camera lenses. Afterwards, I noticed the crystal display was leaking and a black splotch appeared on screen.\nI reached out to Google for comment and I will update this review when I know more. Obviously this is very disappointing, but we have multiple review samples at TechRadar and across Future, and mine is the only Pixel 9 Pro Fold to have this problem. Still, this calls into question Google's claims that this phone is more durable than ever before.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Price and availability\n- Available for $1,799 / \u00a31,799 / AU $2,699 with 256GB of storage\n- Only two storage options and two colors available\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold costs $1,799 / \u00a31,749 / AU $2,699, and I wouldn\u2019t expect the price to drop precipitously the way the price of the original Pixel Fold did. That phone was a disappointment, and Google was motivated to sell it cheaper. You can no longer buy the Pixel Fold, which is highly unusual these days. The old phone generally sticks around to be the cheaper model, but the Pixel Fold is gone, and good riddance.\nGoogle\u2019s new foldable feels so much more advanced than its last one that I can\u2019t imagine its price will come down quickly. The materials feel very premium. This is the thinnest foldable you can buy in the US, at least, and thin doesn\u2019t come cheap. Neither does durability, and Google says this phone is much more durable than before. It looks and feels exponentially nicer than the last Pixel Fold.\nStill, is $1,799 / \u00a31,749 / AU$2,699 too much? Like I said, if Apple made this phone there would be no question that people would buy it. I\u2019ve seen a lot of folks comparing the Google Pixel 9 to Apple\u2019s phones, saying it\u2019s the most fun and refined Android design to compete with the Dynamic Island iPhone. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is one of the nicest-looking foldable phones I\u2019ve seen (I still prefer the OnePlus Open), with the best combination of hardware and software, and no disappointments hidden in the crevices.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 can do more \u2013 a lot more. You can use a stylus with Samsung's latest foldable flagship, but you have to buy an S Pen, and it has to be the one for the Z Fold. The Galaxy has more productivity software, and frankly more software all around. A lot of it is extraneous, but at least Samsung gives you plenty to do on its large inner display. Google seems lost for ways to really take advantage of the big screen.\nThis is the foldable conundrum. I haven\u2019t yet seen anything that makes this concept unique and worth the high price tag. Google lets you translate between languages using the front display and the inner screen. That\u2019s amazing! What else can you do with both screens? Ummm, you can display funny faces for kid photos\u2026 ? And that\u2019s about it.\nIf you bought a Google Pixel 9 for $799 / \u00a3799 / AU $1,349 and an iPad mini (2021) for $499 / \u00a3479 / AU$749, you\u2019d save $501 / \u00a3471 / AU $601, and the only thing you would lose is the ability to keep both in your pocket at the same time. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold might be the best foldable phone I\u2019ve used. It\u2019s definitely the best design. I\u2019m still not sure it justifies the high price.\n- Value score: 3/5\n| Storage | US Price | UK Price | AU Price |\n| 256GB | $1,799 | \u00a31,749 | AU$2,699 |\n| 512GB | $1,919 | \u00a31,869 | AU$2,899 |\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Specs\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a weird hodge-podge of premium and basic parts. It has Google's latest Tensor G4 chipset paired with a whopping 16GB of RAM \u2013 premium like the Pixel 9 Pro. The outer display, though, is basic, as on the Pixel 9, and it can\u2019t match the brightness or the LTPO versatility of the Pixel 9 Pro's panel.\nThe inner display is top-notch. It uses LTPO tech for a variable refresh rate of 1-120Hz, and it can hit brightness levels up to 2,700 nits. But it isn\u2019t the sharpest display around \u2013 the OnePlus Open gives you more pixels per inch \u2013 and it has a large bezel by today\u2019s standards.\nThe cameras offer some impressive specs, like a 5x optical zoom lens that makes a big difference whether you\u2019re shooting photos or recording video. Unfortunately, it has smaller sensors with fewer megapixels than any other Pixel 9 phone.\nBetween the Tensor G4 and all that RAM, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold chugs along nicely. The phone may be underpowered compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 or the latest iPhone model, but Google relies on its cloud and its specialized processor for so many of its AI tasks that it hardly matters. So what if the Pro Fold takes a bit longer to make photo edits \u2013 it's making magic!\nIn all seriousness, I am worried about the long-term viability of this chipset, since Google is promising that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will get Android OS updates for the next seven years.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Row 0 - Cell 1 |\n| Dimensions (open): | 155.2 x 150.2 x 5.1mm |\n| Dimensions (closed): | 155.2 x 77.1 x 10.5mm |\n| Weight: | 257g |\n| Inner display: | 8-inch Super Actua display |\n| Cover display | 6.3-inch Actua display |\n| Resolution (Internal / External): | 2076 x 2152 / 1080 x 2424 pixels |\n| Refresh rate (Internal / External): | 1-120Hz / 60-120Hz |\n| Peak brightness (Internal / External): | 2,700 / 2,700 nits |\n| CPU: | Google Tensor G4 |\n| RAM: | 16GB |\n| Storage: | 256GB / 512GB |\n| OS: | Android 14 |\n| Cameras: | 48MP main; 10.8MP 5X zoom; 10.5MP ultrawide |\n| Selfie Camera: | 10MP |\n| Battery: | 4,650mAh |\n| Charging: | 21W |\n| Colors: | Obsidian, Porcelain |\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Design\n- Thinnest foldable you can buy* (*if you can\u2019t buy an Honor Magic)\n- It's a very bad sign when the review sample breaks\nGoogle is making three big claims about the Pixel 9 Pro Fold design. This is the thinnest foldable phone you can buy* (* in certain markets). The inside screen is the biggest display ever packed into a phone. This is also the most durable foldable Pixel phone yet. At least one of those claims seems highly suspect.\nWhen I showed the Pixel 9 Pro Fold to iPhone-toting friends and family they were all amazed, without fail. It\u2019s the first foldable that looks\u2026 normal, they all said. How normal? It isn\u2019t just that the front is the exact same size and shape as the Pixel 9. Being thin helps a lot \u2013 the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is so thin that it\u2019s less bulky than my iPhone 15 Pro Max if I keep the iPhone in a case.\nIt\u2019s not quite the thinnest foldable, no matter what Google says. The Chinese company Honor launched a Magic V2 phone last year that is a bit thinner, and the sequel, the Magic V3, is even more svelte. Unfortunately, Honor doesn\u2019t sell its phones in every country, and they're not available in the US. When Google said the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is \u201cthe thinnest phone you can buy,\u201d it might have been speaking to me, specifically.\nOn the other hand, that big cover display means the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has the biggest inner display on any foldable phone, even bigger than that of the Honor Magic V3 that I can\u2019t buy. It has a noticeable bezel, but it isn\u2019t thick or silly-looking, like the pool deck surrounding the original Pixel Fold.\nThe crease on the inner screen is still a crease, just as with every foldable phone I\u2019ve seen. The crease gets less noticeable with every new foldable, but it's still there. What can you do? The Pro Fold does have the nicest hinge I\u2019ve seen, with the fewest bits poking through the mechanism.\nI really wish the Pixel 9 Pro Fold came in more color options, but the Obsidian and Porcelain look professional, at least. I usually complain that these colors are boring, but for this price you don\u2019t want to be stuck with a loud color that you hate in six months. Sorry Peony \u2013 it\u2019s the Pixel 9 or bust for you.\nAfter a week with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, I was taking photos of the phone when I noticed the inner display was broken. It seemed to have an internal crystal leak, and a squishy, black blob appeared on screen (see up top). I had just cleaned the screen with a Zeiss Lens Wipe; Zeiss is a lens manufacturer, so I trust its wipes are gentle.\nThis gives me serious pause about recommending this phone. I have reached out to Google for comment, and I am hoping to replace my broken phone with a new sample so I can test the durability further (within reason). We have at least three other review samples at TechRadar and across Future, and no other reviewer has reported a similar issue.\nI hope this is a fluke. Mistakes happen in manufacturing, and as long as this is the only phone I see with this problem, and as long as Google has a fair way for you to get help with a broken phone if this happens to you, I won't change my review because of this one bad phone.\n- Design score: 5/5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Display\n- Inner display is the biggest, brightest, bestest around\n- Outer display is nice and normal, and normal is nice\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a \u2018normal\u2019 cover display \u2013 it\u2019s the same display as on the Pixel 9 \u2013 and sometimes being normal counts for a lot. On a foldable phone, it counts every time you don\u2019t feel like opening the phone. If the cover display is weird, the phone isn\u2019t as fun to use. The Pro Fold cover display is incredibly bright and colorful, and I could barely see the difference between this phone and my Pixel 9 Pro.\nThe inner display is like a dream. It\u2019s nearly a square, so unfortunately movies don\u2019t usually fill the big screen, but videos and shows still look bigger and better inside than out. Web pages are much easier to read and navigate. Maps are an entirely new world of navigation. But photo editing is the star of the show.\nIt\u2019s so much easier to edit photos on the big Pixel 9 Pro Fold inner display that I'm surprised Google doesn\u2019t show every AI demonstration on its foldable. If you were questioning the fun and utility of AI tools before, seeing them on the big display makes things more clear. Whether I\u2019m chatting with Gemini, writing an email in Gmail, or adding a volcano to my photos of Central Park, the Pro Fold is the best Google phone to use, by far.\nIn bright, outdoor light, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold excels. I used the phone extensively for photo work in bright sunlight, along with all of the other major foldable phones for comparison. The Pro Fold cover display was the easiest to see at full brightness, and it was the most intelligent when it came to activating the brighter screen modes.\nWhen it comes to foldable phone displays, more is better, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold gives you more screen on the outside and inside, plus more brightness. It\u2019s the best foldable display I\u2019ve used, among the phones I can buy.\n- Display score: 5/5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Software\n- Google AI software looks even better on the big screen\n- Still wishing for more unique dual-screen features\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold can do everything the other Pixel 9 phones can do, and that means a lot of AI. The coolest and most advanced new features are probably the image-making tools. You can now create images from scratch with Pixel Studio. There are limits on making images with humans, but anything else seems to be fair game.\nI love the suggestions Google offers in Pixel Studio. The results can be hit or miss, but they hit hard when they're on target. Following Google\u2019s lead, I made a fake CD, jewel case and all, to replicate the one my college a cappella group produced in the 90s. It was a total hit on my Facebook wall.\nI also made some violent images featuring Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse. I have Winnie the Pooh doing drugs with Eeyore, and Mickey Mouse in images that would be offensive to a number of religious groups. I won\u2019t publish them here because they are horrible and there should be no way to easily create them, but apparently Google isn\u2019t so concerned. We\u2019ll see if there are stronger guardrails eventually, but at press time this is still possible. Right now, it\u2019s so easy to make these images, I don\u2019t even have to write 'Mickey Mouse,' (though I can) I can just write 'Mickey' and get a near-perfect result.\nThere are also some very powerful image-editing tools in Google Photos on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, including the new Reimagine tool. The possibilities are really endless for this tool, but I have a simple concept to highlight below. I took a basic set of train tracks that I came across in Stamford, Connecticut. I used Google Photos to remove the tracks and I gave myself a nice pond with a swan, as well as an exclusive swimming pool. You can see the results below.\nActually, that\u2019s not entirely true. See, the original photo with the train tracks was also a fake. The original is the plain, open field at Fort Stamford, as seen below. I added the train tracks with the Reimagine tool. They're so real that Google was able to follow the curve of the hill, and Google added the shade from the tree onto the tracks. There\u2019s even a random fenced-off area I didn\u2019t ask Google to make.\nMy point is that this software is very good at what it does. It does a much better job than I ever could have managed using Photoshop. The images it creates are not labeled AI creations in any way. There's no EXIF data, the information that usually identifies the camera and lens used to create a photo. The images are stored as simple JPEG files with a nondescript filename. There's no easy way to know they're fake, unless you know they're fake.\nHonestly, I\u2019m tired of litigating AI every time a new phone comes out. Instead, I\u2019ll point you to my friends at The Verge, who used the Reimagine tool to add corpses and potential insurance fraud to photos. You can decide for yourself if this is bad.\n- Software score: 5/5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Cameras\n- Better than I expected, still not great\n- The AI camera features help and are not evil\nOne of the cool things about the Pixel 9 lineup is that the most affordable model has the same cameras as the Pro model. The Pixel 9 has the same 50MP main camera and 48MP ultra-wide as the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Unfortunately, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold wasn\u2019t invited to the party.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold gets a much smaller camera sensor than the Pixel 9. While the Pixel 9 uses a sensor that's around 3/4 of an inch diagonally, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold uses a half-inch sensor. That\u2019s a massive step down. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 gets a sensor that's somewhere in between.\nThis is important, because sensor size is the most important factor in smartphone camera quality. Megapixels hardly matter at all; it\u2019s the physical dimensions of the sensor that make all the difference. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a tiny main sensor.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean photos are bad. I was very impressed with some of the macro photos I took. The night panorama photos are head and shoulders above any other camera that isn\u2019t on a Pixel 9 phone. The iPhone gives you a black box, but the Pixel 9 Pro Fold can shoot a real Night Sight pano, if you have the patience.\nHaving a real 5x optical zoom lens is also terrific. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 only offers 3x zoom, though you can enhance that digitally on any camera these days. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold has more reach, and that means more versatility with the cameras.\nSadly, my images don\u2019t look as good as the photos I shot with the Pixel 9. And the Pro Fold definitely isn\u2019t as good as the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which has the best camera on a foldable phone. It still takes good photos, including pleasing selfies and great 4K videos, if you can figure out Video Boost. Unfortunately, Video Boost is not only hard to find, it turns off every time you close the Camera app, so you\u2019ll probably forget to use it like I did.\n- Camera score: 3/5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Camera samples\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Performance\n- Not as fast as the best flat phone or Galaxy phones\n- Fast enough for a foldable phone, and no problems running AI\nTake a deep breath. The Tensor G4 chipset is just fine. It isn\u2019t the fastest around, and it might feel slow sometimes, especially if you try to multitask and run AI tools all at once. Still, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The fastest games run just fine, and every app looks great on both the cover display and the inner screen.\nWhile the Pixel 9 can feel like a laggard among flagship phones, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold holds its own in the foldable world. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 uses the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy processor that Qualcomm overclocks just for Samsung, so that\u2019s the fastest foldable. The OnePlus Open, on the other hand, uses last year\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 platform, and in some ways it's faster than the Pixel\u2019s Tensor G4, while in other ways it isn\u2019t.\nIn raw performance, for instance, using Geekbench to test processing power, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was faster than the OnePlus Open. With single-core scores just under 2,000 for the Pixel versus just over 1,000 for the OnePlus, the Pixel may claim to be twice as fast \u2013 on paper, at least. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 scored around 2,200 on the same test. The winner is clear, but the difference isn\u2019t so stark.\nIn graphics performance, Samsung's foldable pulls further ahead. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold managed a decent frame rate of 35.6fps on the Basemark test: The Expedition. The OnePlus Open managed 38.7fps on the same test. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 dominated the pack with a frame rate of 55.9fps. Those scores are like the difference between two generations of gaming consoles.\nI\u2019m not worried at all about using the Pixel 9 Pro Fold right now; its Tensor G4 chipset is perfectly suited for today\u2019s Android and all of today\u2019s apps. I\u2019m a bit more worried about what happens over the next seven years of Android OS updates, as Google adds more and more AI features, and relies on the device to run more of the machine learning models.\nThankfully, the 16GB of RAM on board should at least keep the Pixel 9 Pro Fold afloat longer than most other phones. Google can also offload much of the work to its cloud servers. I have no reason to think the Pro Fold won\u2019t last seven years; I just wish it were a bit faster now, at the very start of the race.\n- Performance score: 3/5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Battery\n- Smaller battery than other Pixel 9 phones, and it shows\n- Slower charging than other Pixel 9s. Isn\u2019t this the expensive phone?!\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold packs the smallest battery of any Pixel 9 phone, even smaller than the base model. It also charges slower than the other recent Pixel phones, at only 21W versus 37W on the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Battery life was good, but the other Pixel phones, especially the Pixel 9 Pro XL, lasted longer.\nCompared to other foldable phones, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold offers just a bit more battery life. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 died a little more than 10.5 hours into our rundown test, while the Pixel 9 Pro Fold lasted an hour longer. To compare, the Pixel 9 Pro gave us 13.5 hours of battery life, which is two hours longer than the Pro Fold.\nIn my real-world testing, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold lasted all day if I used the big inner display more sparingly. If I used the inner display the majority of the time, I could burn through the battery before dinner. I don\u2019t blame the Pro Fold \u2013 the display is so big and bright and beautiful, I just had to use it more.\nThat makes me wish the Pixel 9 Pro Fold had much faster charging. In addition to having the smallest battery of the Pixel 9 family, the Pro Fold also charges the slowest.\nWhile Google advises buying a 45W charger for the other Pixel 9 phones (even though the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro only charge at 27W speed), the Pro Fold can\u2019t even charge up to the 25W speed of the older chargers \u2013 it hit 21W in my charging test. After 30 minutes of charging, the battery wasn\u2019t quite charged to 50%.\nShould you buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value | Very expensive, but you get the biggest screen ever on a phone, and a dramatically improved design. Still, you could have a Pixel 9 and two iPad minis for this price. | 3 / 5 |\n| Design | Fantastic design, one of the best looking foldable phones you can buy, and also the thinnest (if you can\u2019t buy Honor phones in your country). I wish there were more colors, but I appreciate the improved durability. | 5 / 5 |\n| Display | Inside and out, these displays are bright and beautiful. The cover display is easier to use in bright sunlight than any other foldable, and the inner display is simply the biggest, brightest foldable screen you can buy. | 5 / 5 |\n| Software | The AI is very good, maybe too good. The guardrails are missing, for now. While AI is fun, I wish there were a lot more features that use the unique foldable design \u2013 it would help justify the high price. | 5 / 5 |\n| Camera | The cameras aren\u2019t bad, especially if you focus on what Pixel does best \u2013 AI. That means night sight assistance, now in panorama, and video boost, if you remember to use it. Not the best foldable cameras, but the only one worth buying. | 3 / 5 |\n| Performance | Performance lags Samsung\u2019s beefy Snapdragon, but it isn\u2019t all bad news, and Pro Fold had no trouble playing games and running apps and AI. I worry about seven years from now, but we\u2019ll get there eventually. | 3 / 5 |\n| Battery | A thin phone means a smaller battery, and the Pro Fold has the smallest battery of any Pixel 9 phone. Battery life wasn\u2019t bad, but the flat phones last longer and charge faster, which is a disappointment. | 3 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want a real two-in-one phone\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a full-size, normal phone on the outside, and a full-size mini tablet inside. It\u2019s all of both worlds.\nYou want a thinner foldable phone\nIt may not be the thinnest in the whole world, but a naked Pro Fold is thinner than an iPhone 15 Pro Max wearing a case, and that\u2019s something.\nYou want to make pretty AI images\nAll of Google\u2019s Pixel 9 phones can make AI images and Reimagine your photos, but the Pro Fold has the huge inner screen on which to see every detail.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou don\u2019t want to spend rent on a phone/tablet combo\nYou can buy a Pixel 9 and an iPad mini and save hundreds of dollars without losing much besides a crease.\nYou want the best cameras and features\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the Pro in the name, this phone doesn\u2019t have the Pixel 9 Pro cameras, it doesn\u2019t even get the Pro-level Camera app.\nYou want the best-looking foldable phone\nNot gonna lie, I still think the OnePlus Open, especially the crimson Apex edition model, is a snazzier phone than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: Also consider\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a weird cover display that's too narrow for my taste, but it's undeniably more powerful, packed with features, and takes better photos.\nOnePlus Open\nFor much less money you can get the OnePlus Open, which is a nicer-looking foldable that doesn\u2019t have all the AI hubbub of the Pixel family.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 | OnePlus Open |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Price (at launch): | $1,799 / \u00a31,749 / AU $2,699 | $1,899.99 / \u00a31,799 / AU$2,749 | $1,699.99 / \u00a31,499 |\n| Display | 6.3 inches / 8 inches | 6.3 inches / 7.6 inches | 6.3 inches / 7.8 inches |\n| Cameras | 48MP main; 10.8MP 5x zoom; 10.5MP ultrawide | 50MP main; 10MP 3x zoom; 12MP ultrawide | 48MP main; 64MP 3x zoom; 48MP ultrawide |\n| Battery | 4,650mAh | 4,400mAh | 4,805mAh |\n| Charging | 21W | 25W | 67W |\nHow I tested the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold\nI received the Pixel 9 Pro Fold from Google and spent a week using the phone before writing this review. I used it as my only device as much as possible, for both work and personal use. Another Pixel 9 Pro Fold was tested by Future Labs for benchmark and lab tests\nI used the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as my primary work phone, testing every feature, including calling and Call Notes, messaging, and web browsing. I also played games, listened to music, and played more games.\nI used the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in my car for music and navigation, using Bluetooth and Android Auto. I also used it with a number of accessories, including the Pixel Buds Pro, Pixel Watch 2, Meta Ray Ban smart glasses, and other Bluetooth devices. I streamed video to my Google Chromecast connected to my TV.\nI tested the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold cameras alongside the best foldable phones, taking photos under the exact same conditions and comparing results. For each camera, I used the mode that produced the highest-resolution image with the best image quality, and compared the full-size images on a professional Dell monitor.\nFuture Labs tests phones using a mix of third-party benchmarking software and proprietary, real-world tests. We use Geekbench, CrossMark, JetStream, WebXPRT and Mobile XPRT, and 3DMark for performance testing. We test a phone's performance on tasks using Adobe Premiere Rush. We also measure display color output and brightness.\nFor battery testing, we have proprietary rundown tests that are the same for every phone, and which enable us to determine how long it takes for the battery to run down.

The phone is my perfect work phone, and it was my favorite phone of last year.\nYou probably know that Pixel phones all have great cameras with excellent photo editing capabilities, thanks to Google's AI. Did you know Pixel phones also have the best displays in their respective price range? Google has earned high marks for its Actua and Super Actua displays, and the screens are all incredibly bright and colorful, the best you can buy.\nGoogle is also first with most new AI features on a smartphone, with Samsung following close behind. That's part of what makes these the best Android phones. If you are interested in AI and getting those new features first, you don't just want a Pixel, you want the best Pixel, because Google doesn't offer the same features to every phones.\nDon't like the price of that Pixel 9? Wait a minute, it will change. Google loves to offer discounts on Pixel phones, and Amazon regularly drops the price on unlocked models. You won't find a great sale on the best iPhone, but with patience you can have a Google Pixel for $100 or more off the original price.\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronic reviews. He has been reviewing phones since before the first iPhone, and he even worked as an internal reviewer for Samsung, offering his opinion on top secret new models before launch. He has reviewed hundreds of phones and tablets, including all of the latest Samsung Galaxy, Apple iPhone, and Google Pixel phones.\nQuick List\nBest Overall\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has the same specs as the Pixel 9 Pro XL in a smaller package, and that's such a relief to have a compact phone that doesn't compromise, it's my favorite Pixel overall and the one I carry with me all the time.\nRead more below\nBest Cameras\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL have the exact same cameras, but it's easier to line up your shots on a larger display, so the Pixel 9 Pro XL is my pick for the best Pixel camera phone.

The first thing you notice is the look \u2013 the old camera bar has been swapped for this new rounded \"pill\" design. It feels sleek and modern. Plus, it's tougher this year with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. I also like that the regular Pixel 9 Pro and the Pro XL are basically the same phone except for size, so you just choose based on how big you like your screen.\nSpeaking of the screen: wow. Google calls it a Super Actua display, and honestly, it's incredibly bright and just looks fantastic. Colors really pop. It also has a smooth 1-120Hz refresh rate, which helps the always-on display not kill your battery. Trying to snap photos in bright sunlight wasn't an issue at all with this screen.\nCamera-wise, it's classic Pixel \u2013 which is a good thing! Photos looked great, and they've added an AI trick called Video Boost that did seem to improve my videos. While maybe not the absolute champ for hardcore photo buffs, the Pixel 9 Pro is super reliable, and you get those unique AI editing features inside Google Photos that only Pixel phones have, which are fun to play with.\nPerformance lags behind the top-tier competition. Google promises seven years of updates, which sounds great for longevity, but we'll see how the chip holds up over time. On the plus side, battery life was solid. I had no trouble getting through a full day. I do wish it charged faster when I needed a quick top-up, though the bigger Pro XL model does charge quicker if that's a priority for you.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is a bit pricey. However, Google throws in a free year of their Google One AI Premium plan (with 2TB of storage), which adds real value. Overall, it's a strong showing for Pixel with a killer screen and smart camera features, even if it has a few quirks.\nThe best Pixel cameras\n2. Pixel 9 Pro XL\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL has the fresh new Pixel design, with the sleek camera pill instead of the old bar look. Even with the makeover, it still felt like a Pixel during my review time with the phone, delivering on those things Google phones do well: useful AI, a really impressive camera, and a stunningly bright and vibrant display.\nSeriously, the screen is fantastic \u2013 it gets incredibly bright, making it easy to use even when I was shooting photos outside in the sun, and the smooth 1-120Hz refresh rate is great. Even though the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL have the exact same cameras, the larger display on the Pixel 9 Pro XL made it my go-to choice for photo work, which is why it's my favorite Pixel camera phone.\nThe cameras on the Pixel 9 Pro XL capture amazing photos \u2013 honestly, some of the best I\u2019ve tested. I did find the camera controls felt a bit fidgety at times, but the end results were usually spot-on. When it comes to editing, the AI tools in Google Photos are way ahead of what you get on an iPhone or any other Android.\nSurprisingly, Google's AI is also a standout. Even features found on other Android phones, like the recorder app that transcribes audio, just seemed to work much better and faster on this phone in my testing. For anyone prioritizing cutting-edge photography with an AI boost, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is my top recommendation.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review\nThe best Pixel for everybody\n3. Pixel 9\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Google Pixel 9 is the easiest Pixel to recommend, because it offers the performance of the Pixel 9 Pro, with the promise of seven years of Android updates, for hundreds less. The Pixel 9 showcases Google's striking new Pixel design and offers appealing color choices, like Peony, which I find even more vibrant than the Pro model colors.\nPowered by the same Google Tensor G4 processor as the Pro version, the Pixel 9 also delivers high-quality photos that are comparable to the Pro model's output, despite the lack of a dedicated zoom lens. Images are captured at a practical 12MP resolution, suitable for easy sharing, and video recording quality is also excellent.\nWhile the Pixel 9 Pro includes a year of premium AI services, Google has made its Gemini Live conversational AI available for free on all Pixel 9 devices. It has all of the best Google AI features, including the new Screenshots app, which is absent from the cheaper Pixel 9a. If you want all of the best of Google's Pixel world for the best price, the Pixel 9 is your top choice.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 review\nThe best Pixel for work\n4. Pixel 9 Pro Fold\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold offers a seamless user experience, and it feels natural whether I use it open or closed. Its cover display is sized perfectly, just like a standard Pixel 9 screen, so I can do everything I need without unfolding the big screen inside.\nOpening the Pixel 9 Pro Fold reveals its major advantage for productivity: an exceptionally large inner display, which was the largest available in a foldable at launch. This expansive screen real estate is ideal for multitasking, viewing documents or spreadsheets in detail, and reviewing presentations effectively. Also, it's fun for games, but don't tell the boss.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold has most of Google's advanced AI features, which might offer benefits for professional users. These capabilities can streamline workflows, assisting with tasks like transcription, translation, or summarizing your notes for dissemination. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold serves as a prime platform for leveraging Google's latest AI advancements in a work setting.\nIn terms of processing power, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold may not match every competitor, like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. However, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's blend of a larger cover screen, a huge productivity-enhancing inner display, access to advanced AI features, and an incredibly slim design makes it a compelling foldable for professionals.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review\nThe best Pixel under $500\n5. Pixel 9a\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nThe new Pixel 9a stands out as the value champion in the Pixel 9 family, making it an easy recommendation for anyone seeking a dependable, straightforward Android phone that excels at the essentials. If you want a phone that will \"just work\" for a long time, while still delivering core Pixel strengths, the Pixel 9a is a compelling choice.\nPerformance is solid, thanks to the inclusion of the same Google Tensor G4 processor found in the more expensive Pixel 9 Pro. You get Google's refined and easy-to-use version of Android 15, enhanced by the many clever AI features Pixels are known for. Tools like AI call screening and best-in-class voice recording transcription were incredibly convenient in my review time with this phone.\nCrucially, Google promises seven years of major Android OS and security updates, offering industry-leading software support and longevity in this price bracket.\nWhere the Pixel 9a truly punches above its weight is the camera. The colors are accurate and vibrant. Its standout feature, however, is the astonishingly capable new macro photography mode. The level of close-up detail achieved rivals much more cameras, providing a genuinely impressive tool for creative shots.\nIf you want a fantastic value, a great camera (especially for macro), useful AI smarts, and long-term software support, and you don't mind owning the ugliest Pixel phone of all time, the Pixel 9a is a top contender within the Pixel lineup.\nThe best cheap Pixel\nSpecifications\nAt first glance, you might shrug off the Google Pixel 8a, since the Pixel 9a is already available. Don't sleep on this phone, especially if you can find a great deal. It offers nearly the same level of performance, six more years of Android updates ahead, and it keeps the cool Pixel design instead of ditching the look, like the Pixel 9a.\nThe Pixel 8a also offers a range of slick colors and it comes packing a Google Tensor G3 chip. This is the same slice of silicon found in the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. That means the Pixel 8a can access most of Google's AI-powered features, from the capability to intelligently wait on calls for you, to using AI editing to completely rework your photographs. Google Gemini AI is even baked right into the Gmail app, so you can use AI to help compose emails for you.\nAdd to that a pair of solid rear cameras, with Google's excellent image processing, and you have an intelligent smartphone that was a compelling price when it was new, but now it should be available for even less.\nRead our full Google Pixel 8a review\nFAQs\nWhat is the best Pixel phone in 2025?\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL are essentially identical, so both of them would be the best Pixel phone to buy in 2025. I appreciate that Google didn't skimp on features with the smaller Pixel 9 Pro and I want to encourage this so I'm naming the Pixel 9 Pro the Best Pixel Overall. Since the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a larger display, it is easier to use for photography, making it the better Pixel camera phone, even though the Pixel 9 Pro has the exact same cameras.\nHow to choose the best Pixel phone for you\nWhen you are choosing a Pixel phone the important question is how much AI you want to use. The better the Pixel phone, the more AI features it will have, both now and into the future. If you want to always have the latest Google AI features, I would suggest a Pixel 9 Pro or Pro XL. On the other hand, if you want to avoid AI or Google AI isn't important at all, you can save a lot of money buying the Pixel 8a, which still has great cameras and the original Pixel look (unlike the uglier Pixel 9a).\nHow we test\nI've thoroughly reviewed every Pixel phone on this list, and I carry a new Pixel model at all times as one of my primary work phones, and to test alongside all of the best camera phones. I use Pixel phones with all of my work apps and tools, and with all of my favorite personal features, including games and social networks.\nI use these Pixel phones with the latest Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro 2 accessories from Google, and I connect the phones to my car's stereo for Android Auto and Bluetooth. I use an Xbox wireless controller to play games, and I connect other joysticks, wearables, headphones, and accessories as needed.\nI test these phones through intense normal usage, and all of the phones are tested in Future Labs using third-party benchmark software and our own proprietary lab tests. We conduct performance tests on the processor, graphics, display, battery, and much more.\nWe test phones for a minimum of one full week before we write a review, and usually at least two weeks or more. We update reviews and buying guides periodically as we conduct more testing, and as the phones are updated with new features. It really never ends.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

      "text": "Google Pixel 8: price, features, cameras, and everything you need to know\nCould this be the perfect Pixel?\nIt\u2019s been a busy year for phones, and as far as big launches go, the Google Pixel 8 and Google Pixel 8 Pro could be the final two names on the calendar. But if so, they\u2019re a good note to end on, because Google\u2019s newest handsets look set to rival the very best phones around.\nThese two top mobiles were officially unveiled at Google's latest Made by Google event \u2013 head over to our Google event live blog for a look at what else was announced \u2013 but it\u2019s the standard Google Pixel 8 that we\u2019ll be focusing on in this article. So, if you want to learn everything there is to know about the Pixel 8, you\u2019re in the right place.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find details on the phone's cameras, chipset, battery, design, screen, price, and more. We've also included a handy specs table to help you compare the key features of the Pixel 8 to those of its more premium sibling, the Pixel 8 Pro.\nAfter putting the Pixel 8 through its paces we have a conclusion on whether it's worth your attention, so check out our full Google Pixel 8 review. If you are curious about its larger sibling, then check out our Google Pixel 8 Pro review for a comprehensive look at how that flagship phone did in our testing.\nGoogle Pixel 8 cheat sheet\n- New Tensor G3 chipset offering more power than ever in a Pixel phone.\n- A higher 120Hz refresh rate, up from 90Hz on the Pixel 7.\n- A high peak brightness of 2,000 nits, beating last year\u2019s model.\n- Upgraded cameras offering better low light performance and new modes.\n- Seven years of updates, which is more than any other brand offers.\n- A refined design that\u2019s smaller and lighter than before.\n- Starts at $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,199 for 128GB of storage, tops out at 256GB.\n- Pre-orders are live now and it ships on October 12.\nModel comparison\nAs well as the Pixel 8, Google has also launched the Pixel 8 Pro. Here\u2019s how the two phones compare.\n| Google Pixel 8 | Google Pixel 8 Pro | |\n|---|---|---|\n| Dimensions: | 150.5 x 70.8 x 8.9mm | 162.6 x 76.5 x 8.8mm |\n| Weight: | 187g | 213g |\n| Display: | 6.2-inch Full HD+ (1080 x 2400) 60Hz to 120Hz 'Actua' OLED | 6.7-inch 1344 x 2992 adaptive 1Hz to 120Hz 'Super Actua' LTPO OLED |\n| Chipset: | Google Tensor G3 | Google Tensor G3 |\n| RAM: | 8GB (LPDDR5X) | 12GB (LPDDR5X) |\n| Storage: | 128GB, 256GB (UFS 3.1) | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB (UFS 3.1) |\n| Rear cameras: | 50MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | 50MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide, 48MP 5x zoom |\n| Front camera: | 10.5MP | 10.5MP |\n| Battery: | 4,575mAh | 5,050mAh |\n| Charging: | 27W wired, 18W wireless (2nd-gen Pixel Stand), 12W wireless (Qi) | 30W wired, 23W wireless (2nd-gen Pixel Stand), 12W wireless (Qi) |\n| Colors: | Obsidian, Hazel, Rose | Obsidian, Porcelain, Bay |\nGoogle Pixel 8 release date and price\n- Available to pre-order now and ships October 12\n- Starts at $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,199\nThe Google Pixel 8 was unveiled on October 4, 2023, and it\u2019s available to pre-order now. It will ship and appear on store shelves from October 12.\nYou\u2019re able to buy the Pixel 8 in the US, UK, and Australia, among other places, and prices start at $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,199, for which you\u2019ll get a model with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n| Storage | US price | UK price | AU price |\n| 128GB | $699 | \u00a3699 | AU$1,199 |\n| 256GB | $759 | \u00a3759 | AU$1,299 (only available in Obsidian) |\nIf you'd like to buy the Google Pixel 8, head to our Pixel 8 pre-orders page for all the latest and best deals.\nGoogle Pixel 8 colors\nThe Google Pixel 8 is available in three colors, which are as follows:\n- Hazel\n- Rose\n- Obsidian\nThe Hazel color is a dark, muted shade of green, which verges on gray, while Rose is a pale pink, and Obsidian is black. So, there aren\u2019t a huge number of colors available, but the options do at least include some interesting shades.\nGoogle Pixel 8 design and display\n- IP68 rated\n- 6.2-inch 1080 x 2400 OLED screen\n- 120Hz refresh rate and peak brightness of 2,000 nits\nThe Google Pixel 8 doesn\u2019t look a million miles away from the Google Pixel 7, with its iconic rear camera visor, polished glass back, metal frame, and tough Gorilla Glass Victus protecting the screen. It also has an IP68 rating, so it\u2019s dust proof and water resistant.\nThe Pixel 8 measures 150mm x 70.8mm x 8.9mm and weighs 187g, making it slightly smaller and lighter than the Pixel 7, although it\u2019s marginally thicker too.\nAs for the screen, the Google Pixel 8 has a 6.2-inch 1080 x 2400 OLED display with 428 pixels per inch, a 120Hz refresh rate (which can shift down to 60Hz when that extra smoothness isn\u2019t needed), a 20:9 aspect ratio, a peak brightness of 2,000 nits, and it supports always-on display features.\nThat makes it slightly smaller than the Pixel 7\u2019s 6.3-inch screen (hence the smaller dimensions), but the refresh rate has been improved from that phone\u2019s 90Hz, and the Pixel 8\u2019s peak brightness is higher.\nGoogle Pixel 8 cameras\n- 50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, and 10.5MP selfie cameras\n- Better in low light than the Pixel 7\n- Records in up to 4K at up to 60fps\nYou won\u2019t find huge changes to the cameras on the Google Pixel 8, with this phone having a 50MP f/1.68 main camera, a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (with a 125.8-degree field of view), and a 10.5MP f/2.2 front-facing camera.\nOn the hardware front, this isn\u2019t much changed from the Pixel 7, either, at least in terms of megapixels. But there are some small differences elsewhere, with the ultra-wide camera, for example, having a slightly wider field of view on the Pixel 8 and including autofocus, while the main camera has 21% more light sensitivity, for better low light shots.\nHowever, on the software and processing side of things, there seems to be bigger changes, with Google promising more advanced image processing, plus new modes like Best Take, Macro Focus, and Magic Editor.\nFor video, whether you\u2019re shooting with the front or rear camera, you can record in up to 4K resolution at up to 60fps.\nGoogle Pixel 8 specs\n- Tensor G3 chipset\n- 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage\n- Seven years of Android updates\nThe Pixel 8 is powered by a Tensor G3 chipset, which, unsurprisingly, is Google\u2019s most powerful chipset yet, and as usual is backed up by clever AI capabilities. It's worth noting, though, that Google\u2019s Tensor chipsets have never quite competed with the best chipsets from Qualcomm or Apple, and it remains to be seen just how powerful this new iteration will be.\nThe Pixel 8 also has a Titan M2 security chip, which helps keep your personal information safe, and it has 8GB of RAM paired with either 128GB or 256GB of storage.\nAdditional specs and features include an under-display fingerprint sensor, Face Unlock, and stereo speakers. Remarkably, Google is also promising seven years of software updates for the Pixel 8 \u2013 that includes operating system updates and security patches for this duration. That\u2019s well beyond what other Android phone makers offer, and even more than you\u2019ll typically get from iPhones, which have long put Android phones to shame on the longevity front.\nGoogle Pixel 8 battery and charging\n- A 4,575mAh battery\n- 27W wired charging or up to 18W wireless\nThe battery in the Google Pixel 8 has a typical capacity of 4,575mAh and a minimum capacity of 4,485mAh, though it\u2019s usually the first of those numbers that we talk about. That\u2019s up from 4,355mAh and 4,270mAh, respectively, in the Pixel 7, so the battery here is slightly larger.\nHowever, Google quotes the same life for both phones, specifically over 24 hours, or up to 72 hours when using Extreme Battery Saver mode.\nThe Pixel 8 can be charged at up to 27W, and Google claims that you can reach up to 50% charge in around 30 minutes when using a 30W charger. Note that, while this charging speed is the same as the Pixel 7, the actual charging power of the Pixel 8 is slightly higher, as the older phone only offers 20W charging.\nThe Pixel 8 also offers up to 18W wireless charging when using the Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen), or up to 12W with Qi-certified chargers. The first of those figures, interestingly, is marginally down on the 20W of the Pixel 7.\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

The main sensor also sports both optical and electronic image stabilization to keep shots steady, and it supports up to 8x Super Res Zoom (though this is a digital zoom rather than an optical one).\nOn the front, there\u2019s a 10.5MP f/2.2 selfie camera with a 95-degree field of view.\nOf these though only the ultra-wide is a real upgrade on last year\u2019s, as the 48MP sensor replaces a 12MP one on the Pixel 8. That said, the front-facing camera has at least gained auto-focus this year, for sharper selfies.\nThe Pixel 9 also has all sorts of camera modes such as Night Sight, Astrophotography, Macro Focus, and more. This being a Google phone there are numerous AI tools too, such as the Pixel 9\u2019s new Add Me feature, which lets you add the photographer to group shots.\nThere\u2019s also returning features like Best Take, to combine similar photos for a perfect group image, and Magic Editor, which lets you adjust the background, move or remove objects, and more.\nGoogle Pixel 9: performance and software\n- Tensor G4 chipset\n- 12GB of RAM\nThe Google Pixel 9 has a Tensor G4 chipset, which is faster and more power efficient than the Tensor G3 in the Pixel 8.\nThat\u2019s joined by 12GB of RAM (up from 8GB in the Pixel 8), so the Pixel 9 should be noticeably more powerful than its predecessor, but may still not match up to the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S24 or the iPhone 15 Pro, as Google\u2019s Tensor chipsets don\u2019t typically match rivals for power.\nPlus, a benchmark suggests that the Tensor G4 struggles to maintain its performance when being throttled.\nWhere Google does excel is software, and in the case of the Pixel 9, the company has gone big on AI. We\u2019ve detailed some of its AI features in the camera section above, but the Pixel 9 also has Google Gemini built in, allowing you to do things like snapping a photo to get help with what\u2019s shown \u2013 such as saving a dying plant or finding a recipe for the ingredients in your fridge.\nThere\u2019s also a Pixel Screenshots feature, which uses AI to save and organize key information in any screenshots you take.\nIt also has some new non-AI features of note, such as the ability to create a password-protected private space for apps and content that you want to keep private.\nIt runs Android 14 at launch (with an update to Android 15 expected soon), and comes with the promise of seven years of software updates.\nGoogle Pixel 9: battery\n- 4,700mAh battery\n- 27W wired and 15W wireless charging\nThe Pixel 9 has a 4,700mAh battery, which is a slight upgrade on the 4,575mAh one in the Pixel 8. Google claims it will last for 24 hours or more, or for up to 100 hours if you activate Extreme Battery Saver mode.\nIt charges at 27W, which is fast enough for it to power up to 55% in 30 minutes, and it also supports 15W wireless charging with the Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen) or 12W with a Qi-certified charger.\nAnd it supports reverse wireless charging, so you can use the Pixel 9 as a wireless charger for other devices.\nGoogle Pixel 9: outlook\nThe Google Pixel 9 has a number of key upgrades over its predecessor, including a new design, a new ultra-wide camera, more power, and a slightly bigger battery.\nOn paper it\u2019s a fairly substantial improvement, but it\u2019s also priced higher, so it remains to be seen whether all these improved specs will make enough difference to justify the inflated price tag.\nYou might also like\n- Best Pixel phones: these are the Google phones to buy right now\n- Android 15: latest news, rumors, and everything we know so far\n- Best Android phones: top Google-powered phones for every budget\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Google Pixel 9a is the latest A-series phone from Google, but this year the series takes an ugly turn, and the Pixel 9a doesn\u2019t look like the striking Pixel 9. That aside, it performs well and takes great photos, plus it comes with most, but not all, of the latest Google AI features. It\u2019s a solid bargain phone, if you don\u2019t mind the looks.\nPros\n- +\nCameras excel at macro and take nearly Pro-level shots\n- +\nMore durable than previous A-series Pixels\n- +\nRefined interface makes the best of Android\nCons\n- -\nImage generator resorts to stereotypes and reinforces bigotry\n- -\nBattery is bigger than 9 and 9 Pro, but doesn\u2019t last longer\n- -\nHave I mentioned that it\u2019s kinda ugly?\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nGoogle Pixel 9a: Two-minute review\nThe Google Pixel 9a is a solid Android phone that punches far above its weight in important ways, even if the new direction for A-series phone design is a letdown. I'll try not to spend this whole review dwelling on how ugly this phone is \u2013 the photos speak for themselves \u2013 but I was surprised that Google abandoned its excellent Pixel design for this phone.\nThe Pixel 9a performs as well as the Pixel 9 in almost every way. It takes photos that look nearly as good as the pics I get from my Pixel 9 Pro. It has most of the latest AI features that make the Pixel a compelling choice for Google fans. I just wish it looked like a Pixel.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; I love the color of the Peony review sample that Google sent me. Actually, TechRadar got two samples, and both were pink, so clearly Google likes this color as much as we do. The color is a perfect match with the Peony silicone case that Google supplied, and I kept the phone covered for most of my time testing it.\nPutting the phone in its case was like putting lipstick on a pig. For the Pixel 9a, Google took the sharp, stylish, distinctive design language it used the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro and threw it in the garbage.\nThis phone is flat and boring. The camera bump is apologetic, rather than the bold statement the bump on the Pixel 9 makes. You would be forgiven for mistaking this phone for a cheap Motorola or Nokia, or an off-brand phone you find in the back of your carrier store.\nI don\u2019t get it. The best explanation I can muster is that the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro camera bar is expensive to produce, and the A-series phones are supposed to be a bargain. But Google cut plenty of other corners on this phone that should have offset the cost of a better design.\nFor instance, the camera sensors are much, much smaller than the sensors on the Pixel 8a. The main sensor is less than half the size, and that\u2019s a massive drop for the most important spec in terms of camera quality. The Pixel 9a still manages to snap great photos, but this downgrade should have saved Google enough money to pay for a fancy new dress.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Pixel 8a also launched with the same 8GB of RAM as the Pixel 8. The Pixel 9a keeps the 8GB of memory, but the Pixel 9 now offers 12GB (and the Pixel 9 Pro packs 16GB!), which makes a difference when it comes to running all of the AI features on the phone.\nThe Pixel 9a has a larger battery than the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro, even though all three phones have a 6.3-inch display. However, in my time with the Pixel 9a, battery life was good but not extraordinary, and our Future Labs tests show that its battery life is somehow not measurably better with that larger cell inside.\nIs the Pixel 9a a letdown? Not at all! Google\u2019s AI features remain the most useful smartphone AI tools you\u2019ll find \u2013 I regularly use the AI phone call features to hang up on spammers, wait on hold for me, or record an especially important phone call.\nGoogle Gemini on the Pixel 9a has also gotten much better \u2013 and it even improved during my two weeks with the phone, as Google added the ability for Gemini to use the camera and discuss what it sees.\nFor the price \u2013 $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849 \u2013 you won\u2019t find a phone that feels so polished and capable. You may find more camera features on a phone like the Samsung Galaxy A56, but you won\u2019t get better photos than you\u2019ll take with the Pixel 9a, especially not macro shots, which is the Pixel 9a\u2019s new specialty.\nYou might find snappier performance elsewhere, but the Pixel 9a\u2019s Tensor G4 chip is powerful enough to for Google to guarantee seven years of major Android and security updates, and that\u2019s the best promise you\u2019ll get in this price range. If you need a bargain phone and you don\u2019t want to replace it, like, ever, the Pixel 9a would be the first phone I recommend.\nExcept for one small thing: the Pixel 8a might be just as good. The Pixel 9a isn\u2019t much faster, and it doesn\u2019t do anything the Pixel 8a can\u2019t do, other than offering the latest Google AI features. If the AI aspect of Google\u2019s phones isn\u2019t enticing, you might be just as satisfied saving even more money and getting the Pixel 8a, especially if it goes on sale again soon.\nActually, if you\u2019re considering the Pixel 9a and you want the best possible bargain, you may want to wait a bit longer. The Pixel 8a went on sale in May of 2024 and the price dropped by $100 for one deal in the US in August. The current global economic uncertainty aside, Google loves to goose sales of its A-series phones with a great deal, so look out for price drops on the Pixel 9a. Or just buy the Pixel 8a \u2013 because at least that phone looks like a Pixel.\nGoogle Pixel 9a review: Price and availability\n- Priced at $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849 for 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM\n- Available in Peony, Iris, Porcelain and Obsidian\nThe Pixel 9a is available now for $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849, after a delay caused by a mysterious 'passive component' issue. My review sample did not seem to have any performance problems or build-quality issues, so I guess we\u2019ll never know what held back the Pixel 9a for a few weeks.\nThe Pixel 9a costs the same as last year\u2019s Pixel 8a did at launch, but this year there's no competing iPhone SE at an even lower price to consider. Apple has effectively vacated the $500 phone market by selling the new iPhone 16e for a laughable $599 / \u00a3599 / AU$999.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a $500 phone, the Pixel 9a is one of your best options, along with the Samsung Galaxy A56. Samsung hasn\u2019t started selling that phone in the US as I write this, but we have reviewed it, and we know it\u2019s coming to the US later this year.\nYou might also consider the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, a quirky Android that costs $459 / \u00a3449 / AU$849, though it\u2019s only available in the US through a beta program.\nOf all the phones in this price range, the Pixel 9a should get software and security updates for longer than the rest. The Pixel gets a seven-year promise, while Samsung gives you six years, and the rest of the Android world promises three or fewer.\n- Value score: 5/5\nGoogle Pixel 9a review: Specs\nThe Pixel 9a uses the same Google Tensor G4 chipset as the Pixel 9 Pro and the rest of the Pixel 9 family. This is Google\u2019s biggest strength with its bargain phones, because the Tensor contains the magic sauce that lets Google promise seven years of major OS updates for its latest phones (though none of them have actually been around for seven years, yet).\nThe Tensor G4 isn\u2019t a performance beast, but it\u2019s good enough for the Pixel 9a to get by, albeit with a bit of sluggishness. The initial setup process especially was a slog, as the phone gets bogged down when you try to download a lot of apps and then, you know, use them.\nThe paltry 8GB of RAM inside became noticeable when I used the AI features, and the Pixel 9a inexplicably doesn't have the new Screenshots app that debuted on the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro. That app gathers all of your screenshots and runs them through the AI so you can ask questions about what it sees; I guess 8GB of RAM is not enough for that level of on-device processing.\nI'm very nervous about the next seven years with this phone, if we\u2019re already seeing Google omit features on day one that the rest of the Pixel 9 phones have. I suspect that whatever Android update the Pixel 9a gets in seven years will be only a portion of what the rest of the Pixel phones will receive, but at least security holes should be plugged.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Row 0 - Cell 1 |\nDimensions: | 154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9mm |\nWeight: | 185.9g |\nDisplay: | 6.3-inch Actua display |\nResolution: | 1080 x 2424 |\nRefresh rate: | 60-120Hz |\nPeak brightness: | 2,700 nits |\nCPU: | Google Tensor G4 |\nRAM: | 8GB |\nStorage: | 128GB / 256GB |\nOS: | Android 15 |\nCameras: | 48MP main; 13MP ultrawide |\nSelfie Camera: | 13MP |\nBattery: | 5,100mAh |\nCharging: | 23W |\nColors: | Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, Iris |\nGoogle Pixel 9a review: Design\n- A major departure from Pixel design\n- The ugliest Pixel phone ever\nLet\u2019s start with a compliment: I like the colors. I like the Peony pink and the lavender Iris hues, and even the Porcelain and Obsidian look premium, not basic. I also like that the cases match perfectly with the phone, giving the handset some needed dimension and texture.\nOkay, that\u2019s all the nice I have in me for this phone's design. I\u2019m only being mean to the butt-ugly Pixel 9a because I really liked the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro redesign, and I can\u2019t believe Google didn\u2019t carry the new look down to the bargain basement.\nThe Pixel 9a is just a flat slab of plastic broken by a round camera bump. It has no personality or character \u2013 it looks like somebody punched a Pixel 9 square in the nose and flattened its whole face.\nThe Pixel 9a has the same-size screen as the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro, but the bezels are noticeably thicker. The phone is nicely rounded, like the Pixel 9, but the back is a matte-finish plastic, not shiny glass. Google says 23% of the Pixel 9a is recycled materials, by weight.\nTo be fair, the Pixel 9a is thinner than the Pixel 9 if you count the camera bump \u2013 that bar adds 3mm to the thickness of the latter phone. If you really want a phone that is borin\u2026 er, flat, this is a good pick.\nGoogle also says the Pixel 9a is the most durable Pixel A-series phone yet. It can withstand a dunk in up to 1.5m of fresh water for 30 minutes, so feel free to drop it in the toilet and give it a flush, then rinse it in the sink.\n- Design score: 3/5\nGoogle Pixel 9a review: Display\n- Very bright and colorful display\n- Questionable Adaptive Display settings should be turned off\nThe Pixel 9a has an excellent screen that's very bright and colorful, continuing Google\u2019s dominance in this aspect of the smartphone world. This would be a great display for a phone at any price, but it\u2019s a standout feature on a bargain phone; you won\u2019t find a better or brighter screen on a phone this cheap.\nI was feeling a bit let down by the display for my first few days with the Pixel 9a, but then I turned off the Adaptive Display mode and things got much brighter. For some reason, Adaptive Display was keeping my phone very dark no matter where I used it, but when I took control the experience got exponentially better.\nThe screen can refresh at up to 120Hz, but frankly I\u2019m not sure the phone can keep up with any content moving that fast. Scrolling through the apps and settings menus felt more stuttery on the Pixel 9a than on the Pixel 9 Pro, and I can only assume that more RAM would pick things up.\nThe phone has Gorilla Glass 3 on the front, which is durable but not as scratch-resistant as the latest Gorilla Glass Victus materials. I noticed some hairline scratches on the screen after only a week of use, although these weren't distracting. The back of the phone is plastic, not glass, so it should be more durable.\n- Display score: 4/5\nGoogle Pixel 9a review: Software\n- A polished version of Android, with many updates to come\n- Doesn\u2019t have all the features of the rest of the Pixel family\nThe Google Pixel 9a launches with Android 15 on board, and it should get updates through Android 22 in 2032, if humanity survives that long. Google has only been making this seven-year promise for three years, so we can\u2019t be sure what those eventual updates will look like, but Google also regularly drops new features, or brings newer features to older phones, in software updates it calls Pixel Drops.\nGoogle\u2019s version of Android is the most refined you can get, with the fewest extraneous features. Where Android used to be known for its heavy customization options, now you\u2019d have to download a whole new launcher app if you want to organize your app list into folders or tweak the interface behavior. Today\u2019s Android is simpler, and better for it.\nGoogle also has some of the most useful AI tools on its smartphones; and, where other phone makers have the same features, Google does it better. For instance, Google\u2019s Voice Recorder app is the best at transcribing what it hears into text. It will label individual speakers, and you can simply tap on a word to jump to the moment in the recording when it was spoken. Samsung and other Android phone makers have similar software, but it doesn\u2019t work as well; not even close.\nI especially like Google\u2019s AI calling tools. When I get a mysterious phone call, I can have Google\u2019s AI answer and screen the call; spammers always hang up at this point. If I\u2019m on an important call that I need to remember details of, I can have the AI record and later transcribe the call. My caller will be alerted to the fact that they're being recorded, so there\u2019s no privacy concern.\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini Live conversation tool also got a nice boost on the Pixel 9a. Just before this phone launched, Gemini Live went multi-modal, so it can now talk to you conversationally while it looks through your camera. I pointed Gemini at the blank wall beneath my TV and asked for suggestions on how to decorate it. Gemini suggested that I add plants, then we switched the conversation to what plants I could buy that I wouldn\u2019t kill in a month.\nOf course, there are plenty of AI slop tools on the Pixel 9a as well. There's the standard image-generating tool that probably shouldn\u2019t exist, for legal and ethical reasons, and it can now create images of human beings, which was forbidden in the past.\nI have a big problem with these tools. They're bigoted by nature. If I ask Pixel Studio for an image of \u2018a successful person,\u2019 I get five images of young, able-bodied people. The selection may be racially diverse, but it still holds onto so many stereotypes that it should simply not be on a phone.\nIf I ask Pixel Studio for an image of \u2018a Jewish man,\u2019 I get the most stereotypical caricature of Jewish identity: an older man with a full beard and a head covering. If I ask for \u2018a Palestinian man,\u2019 it refuses to create anything, which is its own harmful erasure and stereotyping, as if any image of a Palestinian man should be considered potentially harmful.\nSorry, this Pixel has no business creating images of people if it resorts to stereotypes. I\u2019m not sure when it became acceptable for a smartphone to reinforce bigotry, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019ll ever be comfortable with. Google should remove this capability from Pixel Studio immediately.\n- Software score: 2/5\nGoogle Pixel 9a review: Cameras\n- Surprisingly good photos that look like Pixel 9 Pro pics\n- Astonishing macro capabilities that rival my DSLR \u2013 seriously\nI've been pleasantly surprised by the Pixel 9a\u2019s camera capabilities. This phone continues the A-series tradition of producing photos that look almost identical to the shots you\u2019d get from the Pro-series device, albeit at a much lower resolution.\nThe Pixel 9a has a 48MP camera, but it uses a pixel binning technique and will only produce images that are 12MP. Even the raw files it produces are 12MP or less.\nThat\u2019s fine by me! I think 12MP is the perfect size for sharing, whether you send photos to friends or post them to your favorite social app. You won\u2019t be able to zoom in later, and you might miss the fine details, but 12MP is a good compromise for a bargain phone. To be fair, the Pixel 9 has a 50MP camera and that phone also limits its photo output to 12MP.\nI was expecting the Pixel 9a cameras to be much less capable, because the sensors have been reduced in size compared to the Pixel 8a, and are much smaller that the sensors you\u2019ll find on the Pixel 9 or Pixel 9 Pro. The Pixel 9a uses a half-inch sensor for the main camera, compared to the three-quarter-inch sensor on the Pixel 9.\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like much, but that\u2019s the diagonal measurement, and the actual area of the sensor in the Pixel 9a is 57% smaller than that of the sensor the Pixel 9. That means it captures much less light, which affects every other aspect of photography.\nThankfully, Google\u2019s AI photography magic has never been more powerful. Photos look great, nearly identical to Pixel 9 Pro photos, until you zoom in close. Then things get muddy, but the Pixel 9a produces images with accurate colors and good lighting. The iPhone 16e might be a little bit better, but it\u2019s also much more expensive, and it lacks some of the Pixel 9a\u2019s great features.\nI was blown away by the new macro photography capabilities on the Pixel 9a. I shoot macro photos often with my Nikon D750 and Tamron 100mm macro lens, so I broke out the full-frame camera for a comparison test. The results were truly shocking.\nWithout a flash, the Pixel 9a totally outperformed my Nikon. I couldn\u2019t hold the camera still enough for the 1/4 second exposure that it required, but the Pixel 9a had no trouble grabbing a sharp shot in the same dim light. Even with a flash attached, my Nikon wasn\u2019t much more sharp than the Pixel 9a. The Pixel even managed to expose a wider swath of the subject than my Nikon at f/16.\nThis macro shot was taken with the Pixel 9a\nThis macro shot was taken with a Nikon D750 DSLR with a Tamron 100mm macro lens\nUsually, macro photography on smartphones is a gimmick performed with a pathetic 3MP camera, but on the Pixel 9a it\u2019s so good, at full resolution, that it offers a whole reason to consider this phone. If you like shooting macro, you\u2019ve probably never seen a smartphone that can get this close and take photos this sharp.\n- Camera score: 3/5\nGoogle Pixel 9a review: Camera samples\nGoogle Pixel 9a review: Performance\n- Adequate performance but not what I\u2019d call fast\n- The AI features always slow things down\nThe Pixel 9a performs as well as the Pixel 9, for better and for worse. It was able to handle all of my favorite apps and all of Google\u2019s features with little trouble, as long as I wasn\u2019t asking the AI for anything. Except for some hiccups during my initial setup, when the interface ground to a halt while installing numerous apps and backup data, I had no trouble using the Pixel 9a as my primary work phone.\nIt\u2019s still slow, objectively and subjectively. The menus and interface do not feel as snappy on the Pixel 9a as OneUI does on the Galaxy S25, for instance. It isn\u2019t as smooth and responsive as iOS on any recent iPhone. Some apps take a bit longer to open, and when switching between apps it takes longer for the screen to populate.\nI was still able to run all of my necessary apps, take video calls while browsing the web, and play my favorite games, including Call of Duty Mobile \u2013 I had to turn the settings down for better performance, but I had fun playing.\nThe Pixel 9a sends much of its AI computing to the cloud, and this slows down whatever process you're engaged in. Pixel Studio, for instance, generated images much faster on the Pixel 9, and it was even faster on the Pixel 9 Pro. Apparently RAM does make a big difference with these AI features.\n- Performance score: 3/5\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro review: Battery\n- The larger battery doesn\u2019t translate to longer life\n- Charging speeds are also slower, but there\u2019s wireless\nOne of the big advantages Google highlights with the Pixel 9a is the larger battery \u2013 a 5,100mAh cell that's bigger than the batteries in the similarly-sized Pixel 9 or Pixel 9 Pro. I didn\u2019t see any benefit, though.\nThe phone lasted through a full day of use most of the time, except on days when I did a lot of work with the AI tools and cameras. Even then, battery life was acceptable, if not exceptional.\nI\u2019m not sure why this phone isn\u2019t lasting much longer than the Pixel 9, even though its battery is 8.5% larger. Our Future Labs testing concurs. In our battery rundown test the Pixel 9a lasted at most 13 hours and eight minutes, while the Pixel 9 lasted 13 hours and 18 minutes in the same test.\nThat\u2019s not terrible, but you can find longer-lasting phones in this price range. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro lasted more than an hour longer in Future Labs. The OnePlus 13R is only a bit more expensive, and it\u2019s our battery-life champion, with hours more battery life than the competition.\nThe Pixel 9a does include wireless charging, which isn\u2019t common on a bargain phone. Nothing Phone and OnePlus omit wireless charging on their budget models, though they do have much faster wired charging than Google offers.\nThe Pixel 9a can only charge up to 23W, which isn\u2019t very fast. The battery wasn\u2019t even halfway charged after 30 minutes, and it took more than an hour to get to 100% from 1%.\n- Battery score: 3/5\nShould you buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | A great phone at this price, with incredible longevity thanks to seven years of updates.

      "text": "Google Pixel 10 pricing and on-sale dates have just leaked \u2013 and it\u2019s good news all round\nA price freeze, and instant availability\n- The Pixel 10 could cost the same as the Pixel 9, according to a new leak\n- Preorders are tipped to open up right away\n- These new devices will be unveiled on August 20\nWe're seeing plenty of leaks and rumors in the run up to the official unveiling of the Google Pixel 10 series, which is happening on Wednesday, August 20. The latest leaks to reach us cover pricing and on-sale availability, and it's good news in both cases.\nFirst up, Android Headlines has apparently got hold of some inside information on pricing. From these figures, the starting prices will apparently be $799 (Pixel 10), $999 (Pixel 10 Pro), $1,199 (Pixel 10 Pro XL), and $1,799 (Pixel 10 Pro Fold).\nThose are the same as we saw for the Google Pixel 9 phones, except for the Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2013 but it seems that the cheapest version of that phone will have 256GB of storage this year, rather than 128GB, which means it does match the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nIn other regions, that would mean the Pixel 10 will likely cost \u00a3799 / AU$1,349, while the Pixel 10 Pro should set you back \u00a3999 / AU$1,699. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold, meanwhile, should again cost \u00a31,799 / AU $2,699.\nWe heard a couple of weeks ago that Pixel pricing would stay the same, but we only had prices in euros. An earlier leak from April suggested certain models might cost more or less, but this latest information points to price freezes across the board.\nWhen can you buy one?\nWith a Made by Google event in the calendar for August, Google itself has already given us a glimpse of one of the phones we can expect to see \u2013 but it hasn't revealed when these handsets are actually going to be available to buy.\nAccording to a source speaking to GSMArena, the Pixel 10 phones will be available to preorder the same day, August 20. There might be some variation between the different models though, which was the case last year.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOther recent rumors have suggested the Pixel 10 series is going to be the first set of Android phones to introduce MagSafe-style wireless charging, while we've also seen multiple unofficial renders hinting at the designs of these devices.\nIt's not just the Pixel 10 phones we're expecting to see at the August 20 event either. It looks very likely that we'll also be getting the Google Pixel Watch 4 and the Google Pixel Buds 2a \u2013 and we will of course be covering the event live.\nYou might also like\nDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

For starters, the camera rings on the back of the phone are much bolder than before \u2013 they\u2019re almost Galaxy Z Fold 6-like in appearance, and this design cue is shared across the entire Galaxy S25 range.\nThe Galaxy S25 is also 7% thinner and 5g lighter than its predecessor, measuring 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mm and weighing 162g. The Plus, meanwhile, measures 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3mm and weighs 190g, meaning it too is thinner and lighter than the Galaxy S24 Plus.\nColor options for both models include Navy, Icy Blue, Silver Shadow, and Mint, and both have an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance.\nAs for the Galaxy S25\u2019s display, it\u2019s the same 6.2-inch FHD+ AMOLED screen as before, which has a variable refresh rate of 1-120Hz and a peak brightness of 2,600 nits.\nSignificantly, the larger Plus model gets a 6.7-inch QHD+ AMOLED screen this year, and benefits from Samsung\u2019s new ProScaler display technology, which supposedly delivers a 40% improvement in image quality courtesy of some neat AI image processing. The 6.9-inch Ultra boasts this new display technology, too, bringing more parity between Samsung\u2019s largest Galaxy models.\nSamsung Galaxy S25: cameras\n- 50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP telephoto cameras\n- 12MP selfie camera\n- New Virtual Aperture feature and LOG recording\nThe Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus share the same three rear cameras: a 50MP main lens (f/1.8), a 12MP ultra-wide lens (f/2.2), and a 10MP telephoto camera (f/2.4) lens with 3x optical zoom. On the front, both phones get a 12MP camera (f/2.2).\nAll four cameras are unchanged versus the cameras on the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus, though both new phones are capable of shooting in LOG (where their predecessors weren\u2019t) and 10-bit HDR recording is now applied by default.\nFor a supposedly DSLR-like experience on mobile, the Galaxy S25 series also introduces depth-of-field control with Virtual Aperture, integrated into Expert RAW15. Professional photographers and video editors, then, have a lot to look forward to this year.\nSamsung Galaxy S25: performance and software\n- Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset\n- Larger vapor cooling chamber\n- 12GB of RAM\n- New Galaxy AI features including Audio Eraser\n- 4,000mAh battery for the base model\n- 4,900mAh battery for the Plus\nThe headline feature of the Galaxy 25 is its chipset: the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. As with last year\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset, this SoC is an overclocked version of the same Snapdragon 8 Elite you\u2019ll find powering other top-end Android phones like the OnePlus 13 and Honor Magic 7 Pro. Supposedly, then, the Galaxy S25 will be a slightly more powerful device than its similarly-specced rivals.\nFor the first time in a base-model Galaxy phone, this new chipset is joined by 12GB of RAM, meaning the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus are just as powerful on paper as the S25 Ultra (which also uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and has 12GB of RAM).\nThere\u2019s a larger vapor cooling chamber for both models, which should result in better heat efficiency while gaming, and the phones\u2019 minimum rated battery capacities are slightly higher, at 3,885mAh for the Galaxy S25 and 4,755mAh for Galaxy S25 Plus (Samsung is marketing the average capacities as 4,000mAh and 4,900mAh , respectively).\nOf course, with great(er) power comes great(er) Galaxy AI features. The Galaxy S25 series introduces several new software tricks, including Now Brief \u2013 a personalized daily briefing, delivered by Galaxy AI, that contains various handy stats like today\u2019s weather and your personal Energy score. You can receive your daily Now Brief at any time of day, and if you choose to go for a later notification, you\u2019ll get a recap of your \u201cmemorable moments\u201d and an overview of how you performed against your daily activity goal.\nThen there\u2019s Audio Eraser, which is an AI-based video editing tool that \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 lets you remove unwanted audio from video clips. Galaxy AI can suggest which audio to remove, or you can pick and choose certain snippets yourself.\nSamsung has also upgraded its Sketch to Image feature with text and voice input. You can now use real pictures as artistic inspiration, and even superimpose your real pictures onto artistic backgrounds. In addition, Sketch to Image will now simply function more quickly than before, which is something you can expect from all of Samsung\u2019s existing Galaxy AI features on the Galaxy S25 series.\nSome of these software features will remain exclusive to the Galaxy S25, while others will ship as part of One UI 7 (and therefore become available to other phones at a later date).\nSamsung Galaxy S25: my early verdict\nAs for whether the Galaxy S25 marks a monumental upgrade over the Galaxy S24, the answer is a resounding \u2018no\u2019. The phones\u2019 designs, cameras, and displays (the Plus notwithstanding) are almost identical, and I suspect that you\u2019re only going to notice the S25\u2019s significant on-paper jump in performance if you\u2019re an avid mobile gamer or photographer.\nThat said, the upgrades on offer here aren\u2019t inconsequential, especially in the software department. Working in tandem with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the S25\u2019s new 12GB RAM capacity should help all of Samsung\u2019s new and existing Galaxy AI features run super smoothly \u2013 perhaps more smoothly than any other AI features on the market \u2013 and the made improvements to the phone\u2019s size and weight (however small) are welcome.\nPersonally, I\u2019m a fan of the new camera ring design, and it\u2019s nice to see Samsung applying a consistent design philosophy across the Galaxy line. The new colors are nicer than last year\u2019s, too, which sounds silly, but it\u2019s important (just look at that Navy shade!).\nAlso consider\nAxel is TechRadar's UK-based Phones Editor, reporting on everything from the latest Apple developments to newest AI breakthroughs as part of the site's Mobile Computing vertical.

Samsung Galaxy S24 preorders for all three models kicked off on the same day, with the phones going on sale two weeks later on January 31, meaning they're out now.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIf you're interested, you can see our best Galaxy S24 deals page for a roundup of the top options.\nStorage | US price | UK price | AU price |\n128GB | $799 | \u00a3799 | N/A |\n256GB | $859 | \u00a3859 | AU$1,399 |\n512GB | N/A | N/A | AU$1,599 |\nThe Galaxy S24 comes in three storage variants, 128GB, 256GB and 512GB, with Australia skipping the 128GB model available in markets like the US and UK, and instead gaining a higher capacity 512GB model, priced at AU$1,599. The 128GB model sells for $799 / \u00a3799 and the 256GB build costs $859 / \u00a3859 / AU$1,399. This marks a notable reduction in price year-on-year for the base 128GB S24 in the UK, with its predecessor costing \u00a350 more at launch, at \u00a3849.\nSamsung Galaxy S24: design and display\n- New One-Mass Design language\n- Straighter sides\n- 10% stronger Armor Aluminum\n- Larger, brighter 6.2-inch display\nFrom a distance, the Galaxy S24 looks like its predecessor, but the newly-named One-Mass design language is most apparent in the new straighter sides this that S24 adopts, along with the fact that frame is no longer glossy, but lightly textured. For their latest phones, it would seem Apple and Samsung have met in the middle design-wise, meaning both phones look much more like one another this generation.\nThat new frame is also hewn from 'enhanced' Armor Aluminum, which Samsung says is 10% stronger than before. Both the front and back of the phone are clad in Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the phone retains its IP68 dust and water resistance too.\nAs for the Samsung Galaxy S24's colors, this year all three devices come in the same quartet of finishes, with the caveat that the names for the Galaxy S24 Ultra color's are preceded by the word 'Titanium', rather than the descriptors the other two phones use. In the case of both the S24 and S24 Plus you can pick the phone up in Onyx Black, Marble Gray, Cobalt Violet or Amber Yellow, while three additional Samsung.com-exclusive options manifest as Sandstone Orange, Sapphire Blue and Jade Green.\nAlthough a little taller, the size and weight of the S24 haven't changed much from that of its predecessor, which is particularly impressive when you consider that the screen has grown to 6.2-inches. Samsung has achieved this, not only by way of that flatter frame but thinner bezels than we've ever seen from the company, and they're now uniform too. Additionally, the punch hole front camera is smaller, making the viewing experience that little more immersive.\nSamsung finally figured out how to bring the full 1Hz to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate of the Ultra to the S24 and S24 Plus this generation, making for a more power efficient display (the S23's screen ranged from 48Hz to 120Hz), while peak brightness across the range now hits an impressive 2,600 nits (with a high brightness mode of 1,600 nits). Previously, the S23's screen topped out at 1,750 nits and 1,200 nits, respectively, so expect greater outdoor visibility and improved HDR visuals.\nSamsung Galaxy S24: software\n- Samsung One UI 6.1 atop Android 14 at launch\n- Promised seven generations of OS & security updates\n- New 'Galaxy AI' features throughout\nOne of the first phones to run Samsung's One UI 6.1 user experience, the S24 adopts the familiar software look and feel of its predecessors. However, now there are 'Galaxy AI' branded threads running throughout.\nNew features like Circle to Search show a tight collaboration with Google that grants users the ability to search anything on-screen after simply long-pressing the home button. Tone Tweak \u2013 now built into the Samsung Keyboard \u2013 can analyze typed sentences and suggest alternatives, depending on the tone you're trying to strike, while generative wallpapers ensure you can get something new a truly unique on a regular basis, just by relying on the new AI smarts of the S24.\nReal-time two-way translation across both written text and spoken word \u2013 even in calls \u2013 is now a native part of the Galaxy S experience too.\nSamsung previously led in the realm of Android updates, until Google crashed its party with the impressive offerings afforded to its latest Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. But with the S24 range, the scales have been balanced, with the company now committing to seven generations of both operating system and security updates; which would carry users up to Android 21 and, presumably, One UI 13.1.\nSince launch, Samsung has started updating the Galaxy S24, and as of April 2024 the One UI 7 / Android 15 update had started rolling out, but a bug has reportedly caused Samsung to halt the roll out. Still, Android 15 should be available soon.\nSamsung Galaxy S24: cameras\n- 50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide and 10MP 3x telephoto rear cameras\n- New 2x optical zoom option\n- ProVisual AI Engine\n- AI-based Edit Suggestions\nThe trio of rear cameras (and the front-facing punch hole camera) look, on paper, to comprise the same set of sensors at the same focal lengths as with the previous Galaxy S23. So what's new?\nThe main buzzword in the S24 photographic arsenal is its 'ProVisual AI Engine', which promises to more intelligently enhance shots by way of noise removal, more vivid and accurate colors and improved quality in low light shooting; all staple areas of improvement that Samsung and pretty much every other phone maker works on with each new generation of phone camera.\nPerhaps more impressive than improved gyro-based stabilization and more versatile 2x optical zoom focal length (using sensor cropping), is the suit of new AI editing that comes to the S24's photographic experience.\nAI editing suggestions now offer to dress appropriate shots with a portrait effect \u2013 even if they weren't taken in portrait mode, generally remaster the qualities of an image's color and contrast or, more practically, intelligently remove reflections in a scene.\nGenerative fill adds in pixels where there weren't originally any when, for example, straightening up a skewed shot, and the S24 even lets you move and resize subjects in a scene, promising to seamlessly paint in the space they were moved from; a feature that feels decidedly similar to the Pixel 8 series' Magic Editor.\nSmaller tweaks, like being able to view almost any video in your gallery in slow motion by long-pressing during playback (which relies of frame interpolation to offer up to 120fps slow-mo) and \u2013 through Samsung's well-established collaborations \u2013 allowing for HDR capture and review natively from third-party apps, like Instagram, all sweeten the capture experience on the S24.\nSamsung Galaxy S24: Performance & battery\n- Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy or Exynos 2400 for Galaxy chipset\n- 8GB RAM (LPDDR5X) on all models\n- All storage now UFS 4.0\n- 4,000mAh battery w/ 25W wired fast charging\nAfter a brief reprieve where Galaxy S phones came running the same silicon wherever you bought one in the world, the company is up to its old tricks again of splitting the heart of the Galaxy S24 series by region. Stateside, users get Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (but an enhanced 'for Galaxy' variant), while S24 and S24 Plus models in markets outside the US \u2013 including the UK and Europe \u2013 come with Samsung's own new Exynos 2400 'for Galaxy' (the S24 Ultra gets the 8 Gen 3 globally).\nWhile we can't say for sure how big a disparity there is between these two 3nm chipsets at this stage, previous splits have shown that Qualcomm's chipset usually reigns supreme, with weaker power efficiency and thermal performance holding previous Exynos chips back. That said, Samsung may have finally addressed previous shortcomings with the Exynos 2400 and there's even talk of better battery life from this new chip, by comparison to Snapdragon-toting S24s; something we're eager to test in review.\nOne range-wide upgrade is the move to faster and more efficient UFS 4.0 storage across all three storage builds of the S24. The Galaxy S23's dirty little secret was that the base 128GB build ran on older and less elegant UFS 3.1 storage; no longer. You also get 8GB of LPDDR5X RAM, whichever variant you opt for.\nWhile charging remains the same for the S24 (25W wired and 15W wireless), Samsung has increased battery capacity to 4,000mAh, narrowing the gap between the standard and Ultra Galaxy S phones to closer than it's ever been.\nSamsung Galaxy S24: Outlook\nOverall, the Galaxy S24 appears to be an iterative step over its predecessor, at least on paper. But a few design tweaks and more importantly a big dose of practical AI features could make for an impressive phone.\nIt may not have the glitz and glamour of the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the standard Galaxy S24 is keenly-priced and well equipped, meaning it may just be a viable contender for a spot on our best phones list.\nAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables.

      "text": "The Google Pixel 10 might let you edit photos with your voice (yes, really)\nAnd it could come in some colorful shades\n- The Google Pixel 10 series will reportedly let you talk to Gemini to edit your photos\n- You'll be able to do so via voice or text\n- We've also seen leaked images of the Pixel 10 in three shades\nGoogle might have some major software upgrades planned for the cameras on the Pixel 10 series, because along with a new Gemini-powered Camera Coach, these phones might also offer a 'Conversational Photo Editing' mode.\nThis is according to Android Headlines, which claims that the new software tool will also be powered by Gemini, and will allow you to use your voice (or typed text) to ask for changes to photos, such as adjusting the background, brightening the image, or erasing an object.\nSo, this would give you one more way to edit your photos, and might make the process easier for users who aren\u2019t confident in their hands-on editing skills.\nAndroid Headlines claims that Conversational Photo Editing will come to every Pixel 10 model \u2013 so (we think) the Pixel 10 itself, the Pixel 10 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The site speculates that it might also eventually roll out to older models as a Pixel Feature Drop, but initially, at least, it\u2019s thought to be exclusive to the upcoming phones.\nA trio of colors\nIn other Google Pixel 10 news, Roland Quandt (a leaker with a great track record) has shared some renders of the Pixel 10 with WinFuture, some of which you can see below.\nThese don\u2019t really show us any part of the phone that we haven\u2019t seen in earlier Pixel 10 design leaks, but they do give us a close look at the handset in blue, yellow, and black shades, which are rumored to be called Indigo, Limoncello, and Obsidian, respectively.\nThe blue and yellow in particular are quite striking, and are sure to stand out among most smartphones, so we hope this leak is accurate.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWe\u2019ll find out soon, as Google is expected to unveil the entire Pixel 10 line \u2013 with the possible exception of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold \u2013 on August 20.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "The Google Pixel 10 stars in the best leaked images so far \u2013 here are 5 upgrades to expect\nFrom new software to new cameras and beyond\n- Marketing material for the Pixel 10 series has seemingly leaked, including photos and videos\n- This material also includes a claim that Google AI Pro will be offered free for a year with select Pixel handsets\n- We've rounded up the five upgrades that could make these phones worth waiting for\nThe Google Pixel 10 series is now less than two weeks away, with August 20 being the big day, but ahead of that, various official marketing materials have seemingly leaked.\nShared by Evan Blass, these include videos of the Pixel 10 Pro and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and marketing photos of every model. These materials don\u2019t actually show us much that we haven\u2019t seen before, though, especially as Google itself has previously leaked the Pixel 10 line.\nHowever, there are two particularly notable things here. First, the presence of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in leaked marketing images suggests a recent rumor that this model might not land until October could be wrong.\n\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/muIX31bnnpAugust 7, 2025\nSecond, the leak also includes an image saying that you\u2019ll get one year of Google AI Pro with the purchase of select Pixel phones. So, some or all of the Pixel 10 series will probably come with this bundled subscription.\nEven without that freebie, though, these phones could be worth buying, and below we\u2019ve detailed five of the biggest upgrades to expect.\n1. An AI-powered Camera Coach\nGoogle has always been more of a software company than a hardware one, so it\u2019s no surprise that one of the most exciting rumored Pixel 10 upgrades relates to its software.\nAccording to a leak, the entire Pixel 10 series could launch with a \u2018Camera Coach\u2019, which is apparently a Gemini-powered tool that will use AI to help you take better photos.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIt\u2019s said to do this by analyzing the photos you take and then offering contextual suggestions, such as holding the camera at a different angle or looking for better lighting. So, this could be a great tool for anyone who still values real photos (rather than heavily AI-edited ones) but wants to use AI to improve them.\n2. An IP68 rating for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold\nOne exciting rumor about the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is that it could have an IP68 rating, which would mean it\u2019s not only got serious water resistance \u2013 like most foldable phones \u2013 but that it\u2019s also dust-tight, which is something no foldable phone has managed yet.\nIP68 ratings are common on non-foldable phones, but the hinge and other components required in a foldable make this harder to achieve on dual-screen handsets.\nSo, hopefully Google has cracked this, because it could make the Pixel 10 Pro Fold more durable than alternatives, and give it a significant selling point.\n3. A new Tensor G5 chipset\nOne expected but still appreciated upgrade is the move to a newer, more powerful chipset, likely to be dubbed the Tensor G5.\nOf all the upgrades we\u2019ve listed here, this is the one we\u2019re most sure of, as it would be surprising if a new model didn\u2019t have a new chipset.\nThis should help it perform better, whatever you\u2019re doing, but will likely prove particularly helpful for high-end games, AI, and other demanding tasks. That said, benchmarks suggest the Tensor G5 still isn\u2019t a match for the Snapdragon 8 Elite used by some rival phones.\n4. A telephoto camera for the base model\nThe Google Pixel 9 just has wide and ultra-wide cameras on the back, but for the Pixel 10, Google could equip the base model with a telephoto camera too according to multiple leaks.\nIt\u2019s not all good news \u2013 reports suggest the main and ultra-wide sensors could be downgraded, presumably to accommodate a new sensor without a price hike, but hopefully, the additional lens will be more of an upgrade than the changed sensors are a downgrade.\n5. Bigger batteries for the Pro models\nOne of the main upgrades for the Google Pixel 10 Pro and the Pixel 10 Pro XL could be a boosted battery capacity, with the Pixel 10 Pro reportedly having a 4,870mAh one (up from 4,700mAh in the Pixel 9 Pro), and the Pixel 10 Pro XL said to have a 5,200mAh one (up from 5,060mAh in the Pixel 9 Pro XL).\nA bigger battery will hopefully mean greater endurance, so you won\u2019t have to plug the phones in as often. So, while it\u2019s arguably not that exciting, this is always a desirable upgrade.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.
