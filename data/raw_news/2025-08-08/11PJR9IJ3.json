  "title": "Woman berates her boyfriend of five years over his reaction to her home-cooked meals",
  "description": "A woman\u2019s frustration over her boyfriend\u2019s lack of appreciation for her cooking sparks online debate.",
  "content": "A woman received an outpouring of support after revealing that her boyfriend of five years rarely compliments her home-cooked meals \u2013 yet gushes over takeout and leftovers from work.\n\nIt caused a huge blowout between them, she said on Reddit, and sparked a debate online, too.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I made a meal from scratch and, as usual, he ate it silently and only said it was good after I asked,\u201d the woman wrote on the platform recently. \u201cThen, today, we had a meal he brought from work and immediately reacted with an enthusiastic, \u2018Mmm.'\u201d\n\nIn the midst of the argument, the boyfriend claimed he tries to compliment her cooking but often forgets. That only made her more upset, the woman shared.\n\n\u201cWhy does he have to try so hard?\u201d she wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want forced compliments. I just want him to be honest.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old woman, who also shared that she is Slavic, described herself as an accomplished home cook.\n\n\u201cEverything you can name, I can cook,\u201d she said in the comments section, adding that she prepares dishes from their shared cultural background, as well as Chinese, Thai and more.\n\nHer boyfriend, she noted, grew up in a household in which home-cooked meals were the norm and takeout was a treat.\n\nMost users sided with her.\n\n\u201cCooking is a labor of love,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cYour guy doesn\u2019t understand that, but he needs to learn.\u201d\n\nSaid another person, \u201cMy [significant other] thanks me and compliments me even if it doesn\u2019t turn out that great. He\u2019s not just complimenting the food, he\u2019s grateful for my time and effort.\u201d\n\nMelanie Williams, a Baltimore-based psychotherapist, said it boils down to one of the most common relationship problems she sees.\n\n\u201cShe was right to speak up because if she didn\u2019t address it now, his entitlement would likely have continued and worsened.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone agreed.\n\nOne person said the girlfriend was being too \u201ctouchy.\u201d\n\nAnother said, \u201cCook for him either because you enjoy it or because you\u2019ve mutually determined it\u2019s your fair share of the household labor. Not something to start a fight over.\u201d\n\nOther people said compliments can\u2019t be forced.\n\n\u201cOtherwise it\u2019s performative and what\u2019s the point of that?\u201d one person wrote.\n\nBut certified life and parenting coach Randi Crawford of California said it\u2019s all about being seen.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s pouring energy into this relationship, and he\u2019s acting like dinner magically appears from the kitchen staff,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nThe woman should sit her boyfriend down and tell him she is hurt, Crawford said.\n\n\u201cSay, \u2018I don\u2019t need a production every night, but I do need you to notice me, not just the DoorDash guy,'\u201d she advised.\n\n\u201cAnd if he can\u2019t do that? Stop bending over backwards and let him know: \u2018Appreciation isn\u2019t optional in this relationship \u2013 it\u2019s the bare minimum,'\u201d Crawford added.\n\n\u201cAnd if he still doesn\u2019t get it? Let\u2019s see how quiet he gets when your kitchen is closed for business.\u201d",

      "text": "Ozzy Osbourne's official cause of death has been revealed.\nThe singer died from cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, according to the death certificate obtained by Fox News Digital.\nRepresentatives for Osbourne did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nThe lead singer of Black Sabbath died on July 22. He was 76.\n\"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,\" the family said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital at the time. \"He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\"\nOsbourne recently performed his final concert with the band in Birmingham, England. The 10-hour show on July 5 was hosted by Jason Momoa, and featured performances from Metallica, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Jack Black, Steven Tyler and more.\nOsbourne is survived by wife Sharon, daughters Kelly and Aimee, and son Jack, in addition to daughter Jessica, and sons Elliot and Louis from his first marriage to Thelma Riley.\nAccording to The Daily Mail, the Black Sabbath frontman desired to be buried near a lake on his 250-acre property.\nOZZY OSBOURNE FUNERAL: SHARON OSBOURNE BREAKS DOWN DURING EMOTIONAL PROCESSION\nDuring a private memorial, a huge floral tribute on the grounds of the mansion spelled out the words, 'OZZY F---ING OSBOURNE', on the banks of the Osbournes' lake. Kelly shared an image of the floral arrangement on her Instagram story Friday.\nOsbourne's long-time guitarist Zakk Wylde, along with Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson were among the guests who attended. Metallica frontman James Hetfield and Sir Elton John were also reportedly in attendance.\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

Or is it a thoughtful gift for your surviving relatives?\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\"I honestly don\u2019t care what they play at my funeral; they can put on a medley of Justin Bieber, Susan Boyle and We Are the Diddymen if it makes \u2019em happy,\" Osbourne wrote. \"But I do want to make sure it\u2019s a celebration, not a mope-fest.\"\n\"I\u2019d also like some pranks: maybe the sound of knocking inside the coffin; or a video of me asking my doctor for a second opinion on his diagnosis of \u2018death,\u2019\" he continued. \"There\u2019ll be no harping on the bad times.\"\n\"So to answer your question, yes, a bit of planning is the right thing to do for the family you leave behind,\" he said. \"It\u2019s worth remembering that a lot of people see nothing but misery their whole lives.

      "text": "If your relationship doesn\u2019t have this, it probably will fail, experts warn\nPucker up!\nIn today\u2019s busy world, couples often focus on big gestures \u2014 fancy date nights, vacations and therapy sessions \u2014 in hopes of keeping their relationship alive.\nBut leading relationship experts are sounding the alarm on something much simpler, yet frequently overlooked: a kiss.\nNot sex, not deep conversation \u2014 just a sweet smooch.\nIt may seem minor, but the consequences of skipping this small act could be more serious than many couples realize.\nMariah Freya, a sex education expert and co-founder of sex-ed platform Beducated, told the Daily Mail that kissing is the \u201cmost underrated relationship tool.\u201d\nWhile couples obsess over how often they\u2019re having sex or whether their communication is strong enough, Freya insists they\u2019re ignoring one of the most powerful indicators of long-term happiness: genuine, consistent kissing.\n\u201cSomething magical happens when we stop going about kissing in a mechanical way and really focus on it, even if it\u2019s for a few seconds more,\u201d Freya told the outlet.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when your brain shifts from \u2018greeting mode\u2019 to \u2018connection mode.\u2019 Your partner literally becomes more attractive to you.\u201d\nA 2020 study revealed that how often couples kiss is a strong predictor of both sexual and overall relationship satisfaction.\nBut despite its benefits, many couples aren\u2019t kissing nearly enough.\nA 2011 survey found that one in five married couples don\u2019t kiss for an entire week. Even more concerning, two in five married people say their kisses last only five seconds or less.\nInterestingly, age appears to play a role in kissing habits. Those aged 18 to 24 kiss an average of 11 times a week, while five percent of adults over 45 manage to squeeze in more than 31 kisses per week.\nStill, many adults blame their busy schedules for the decline in physical affection \u2014 but experts say that may be something more concerning.\n\u201cIf kissing fades, it\u2019s a subtle sign that something deeper is shifting. It\u2019s one of the first signs of emotional disconnection,\u201d Brie Temple, Chief Matchmaker at dating service Tawkify told the outlet.\n\u201cWithout those soft moments, partners may find themselves feeling like roommates rather than lovers. It\u2019s not just an absence of physical touch, but an absence of shared emotional language that keeps relationships close.\u201d\nIn addition to spending more time kissing, if a wedded couple wants their marriage to last, Arthur Brooks, a social science expert and professor who devoted his career to studying love said that every marriage should be built on friendship.\n\u201cThe goal of your marriage is not passion, it\u2019s friendship. This is the goal, you must be close friends, ideally best friends, with your spouse,\u201d Brooks said during his appearance on The Drive podcast."

For less cash than any fast food meal, the options are also healthier.\nTo fully taste the meal kit\u2019s offerings for my EveryPlate review, I wanted to try a sampling of some of the different categories of options on the site. I chose two meals for my weekly picks, with a customer favorite option of the \u201cChicken Sausage & Tomato Soup with Israeli Couscous & Parmesan,\u201d and then a more premium pick of the \u201cBrown Butter Scallops over Creamy Corn & Tomato Risotto\u201d as a treat for the weekend.\nTo note, each recipe, regardless of premium or not, came with easy-to-follow recipe cards, printed in full color with no more than six steps. This was super appreciated, especially when cooking something unfamiliar, as the photos guided my way almost as much as the text.\nSo how did it go once in the kitchen? According to plan!\nWhen timed out, each recipe took the estimated time listed on the card, and in my humble opinion, looked just like the pictures. The quality ingredients made it seem like I had slaved away for an Instagrammable food moment, and the quick cooking time made me know this would also work for family meals and those in a rush. Win-win.\nWe\u2019ve tested:\n- Chicken Sausage & Tomato Soup with Israeli Couscous & Parmesan\n- Brown Butter Scallops over Creamy Corn & Tomato Risotto\n- Creamy Potato and Bacon Soup\n- Smothered and Stuffed Meat Loaf\n- Cheesy Chicken, Broccoli and Rice Casserole\nHow does EveryPlate work?\nEach week, choose from 16 different meals ranging from chicken, pork, and beef to fish and veggie-based. The plans are customizable for your household\u2019s needs, allowing you to order for two, four or six people, at three, at four or five meals per week. The best part is that no matter the combination, each standard meal is $5.99 per serving and even less with a coupon. Plus, this is one of the only meal kits that allows for a six-person serving \u2014 perfect for larger families.\nEveryPlate does an amazing job of providing fresh produce and high-quality proteins without excess packaging to minimize waste. I appreciated that all the ingredients for all three meals came in one neatly packed box, with the chicken, scallops and dairy products packed below on ice to keep them fresh.\nTesting TL;DR:\n- Ease of ordering: When looking at the menu, EveryPlate was simple to set up and order for each week. It offers a marketplace and has add-on options in addition to traditional meals.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: EveryPlate takes between 15 and 45 minutes per meal, sticking very closely to what the recipe estimates.\n- Flavor and fullness: When testing EveryPlate, I did not have to add additional seasoning or spices, and almost always had leftovers. The meals were hearty and filling, making for a great breakfast, lunch or dinner.\n- Sustainability: EveryPlate does well with sustainability, as the packaging can be recycled. The company also limits plastic and individual wrapping whenever possible by sending all ingredients in a recyclable cardboard tray.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving, and so EveryPlate sits at the very affordable side of the spectrum at $2.99 \u2013 $5.99 per serving.\nBest Meal Kit for Beginners: HelloFresh\nEditor\u2019s Note: *This deal ends on September 30, 2025\nPros:\n- Easy to customize meals and skip weeks. Can order meals for two or four people, with two to six meals per week\n- Easy-to-follow and aesthetically pleasing recipe cards\n- Accurate estimates for prep and cook time\n- Produces 31% less carbon emissions than a traditional supermarket\n- One of the first meal kit brands to market and stays very consistent week over week; great quality control\n- Each meal comes wrapped up individually for ease of storage and cooking\nCons:\n- Make sure to have kitchen staples such as salt, pepper, butter and oil in the house, as they are not included in the box.\nWhen I think of \u201cmeal kit\u201d my brain goes right to HelloFresh, and I would argue that many Americans would agree. This meal kit has been on the market since 2012 and for good reason \u2014 over the four years I\u2019ve tested and re-tested HelloFresh, I have found the recipes to be fun and flavorful each time. The instructions are easy to follow, and the food arrives in good shape. Easy peasy, perfectly-ripe lemon squeezy.\nSince I\u2019ve tried almost everything I could think of from the brand, this time around I scoured the site for something new and found it! Not only did I discover a delish recipe for ramen from scratch, but I found out that HelloFresh offers seasonal boxes, and I timed this year\u2019s review just right for my annual Thanksgiving gathering.\nI host 10 in my apartment made for one, so having my turkey and fixings delivered to my door was an incredible time saver. I could add the items to my existing order, and they arrived in regular HelloFresh packaging. I will now make sure to keep an eye out for other seasonal offerings, like Buddy the Elf pasta and other fun festive bites.\nI would recommend HelloFresh to anyone, really; new to cooking or seasoned pros who want a meal kit to have (and to hold, for richer and for poorer\u2026) as they may just fall in love with how nice it is to be catered to and having fun recipes delivered weekly, exactly what a meal kit promises.\nWe\u2019ve tried\n- Apricot Ponzu Chicken\n- Creamy Dreamy Chicken Cavatappi\n- Steak with Mushroom and Cream Sauce\n- One-Pot Hoisin Pork Meatball Ramen\n- Chicken Shawarma Pita Bar\n- Roast Turkey Thanksgiving Feast\nHow does HelloFresh work?\nThis is why I love it: HelloFresh is the most traditional of all meal kits. You create an account, choose your cadence of meals, fill your box each week and it gets delivered. Then, unbox your pre-portioned, labeled brown bags and refrigerate until you want to cook. Boom. Done.\nThere is a Marketplace of add-ons and seasonal menu items to look out for, but those are also simple to navigate and add to your order.\nTesting TL;DR\n- Ease of ordering: HelloFresh has expanded to offer way more than just traditional meal kits, so keep an eye out for its pre-made meals, faster-timed meals, marketplace and other add-ons for your box, plus seasonal meals like Thanksgiving.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: HelloFresh takes between 15 and 60 minutes per meal, sticking very closely to what the recipe estimates.\n- Flavor and fullness: The meal kits are very easy to use and come with all the flavors you will need, except salt and pepper (which I added to most meals). They always yielded more than enough for leftovers and the meals themselves were hearty and filling.\n- Sustainability: HelloFresh does use packaging to separate meals and most ingredients, including plastic. You can recycle the box and the ice, but not everything.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving, and so HelloFresh sits in the middle, between $8.99 and $11.49 per serving.\nDon\u2019t forget to check out HelloFresh Ready Made Meals! Each is low-mess, heats in 3 minutes, and is delicious.\nBest Meal Delivery Service for Families: Home Chef\nPros:\n- A ton of options for different schedules, including 15-minute meals and oven-ready bakes\n- Easy-to-use zipper-bag packaging, and even easier-to-use recipe cards with cook time, expiration date, difficulty and spice levels\n- Great variety of meals for each week, and in many meals, the meat can be substituted for Impossible Foods\u2019 vegan options\n- Add-on options, including breakfast, snacks and baked goods\n- Meals are filling and feature classic, delicious recipes many know and love \u2014 perfect for families\nCons:\n- Does not come with salt, pepper or oil\nHome Chef brings the elements of comfort food and home cooking to your doorstep, with recipes tailored to fit your schedule.\nThe first note to make is on the notes themselves.\nThe recipe cards were super well-organized, making my type-A personality very happy. After unzipping the correct package for my meal, the cooking process was also very straightforward, following the instructions to the T.\nThe meals themselves were what I think of when I think \u201cfamily meals\u201d: hearty meatloaf and creamy mac and cheese, warm and comforting soup, easy-to-eat sandwiches, etc. I love how soothing many of the meals were, while also remaining fun and exciting to cook. For this reason, it is one of my favorites that I\u2019ve reviewed over the years.\nWe\u2019ve tested:\n- Acapulco Steak Quesadillas\n- Creamy Shrimp Diavolo Penne Bake\n- Pork Banh Mi Bowl\n- Sesame-Crusted Chicken Rice Bowl\n- Corn and Steak Strip Risotto\n- One-Pot Zesty Chicken Chowder\n- Peach BBQ Pork Meatloaf\n- Sunday Sauce Meatballs\nHow does Home Chef work?\nHome Chef is a traditional meal kit in that it operates on a weekly menu schedule, with the ability to add meals to your box and then choose a delivery date. The meals come in their own packaging, with ingredients separated out for ease (although this does mean more plastic waste for those trying to cut back) and proteins stored on ice packs.\nThey offer a specialty-priced and designed family-friendly meal plan for four, express meals ready in 15 minutes or less, oven-ready meals that even come with the tray in which to bake them in, ready-made microwave meals, and an assortment of add-ons for snacks, breakfast, and dessert.\nTesting TL;DR\n- Ease of ordering: When looking at the menu, Home Chef is simple to set up and order for each week, but do note the add-ons. I always take into consideration how to customize the order, make changes and pause a membership when testing.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: Home Chef takes between 15 and 50 minutes per meal, sticking very closely to what the recipe estimates. I still noted how long it took me to have a complete meal from unpacking to cooking, eating and recycling afterward.\n- Flavor and fullness: This meal delivery service was a thumbs-up when taking into account how satisfied I was after each meal and whether I needed to alter recipes in any way to make them taste better.\n- Sustainability: Not all meal kits are eco-friendly or use sustainable practices. To determine where Home Chef stood on the eco-conscious scale, I reviewed its production policy and looked into how it sourced its ingredients. Other things I took into account were its packaging and whether it could be recycled.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving, and so Home Chef sits in the middle at $9.99 per serving, with some priced a bit higher and some a bit lower.\nBest Meal Delivery Service for Singles: Factor\nPros:\n- Breakfast, lunch, dinner and desserts all come fresh, ready to heat and eat\n- Great option for those on the go and the health-conscious\n- Offers options for different diets, including keto, paleo, plant-based, low-carb, vegetarian, pescatarian and meat-eaters\n- They also offer snacks as well as smoothies and protein shakes for a grab-and-go meal or pre-workout\nCons:\n- Have plenty of fridge space to store meals or order a smaller plan (they range from four meals a week all the way up to 18 meals per week)\n- Not ideal for larger families\nFactor in all the time it takes to grocery shop, prep, eat and clean, and I\u2019m already overwhelmed. That\u2019s why Factor is a great meal kit option for those who want health-conscious, pre-portioned meals in a snap.\nThe meals arrive on ice and can be immediately eaten or refrigerated for later. They come pre-portioned and shrink-wrapped on top, which is also great for packing for work or school. These are especially great for singles or couples since they only yield one serving and aren\u2019t meant for sharing. I found the portions to be average, and some left me a little hungry but most were a very appropriate amount of food.\nI also loved that Factor made room for drinks and dessert, with delicious smoothies, shakes and desserts like cheesecake that keep things interesting \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t like a little sweet treat?\nThe sustainability is a bit better than some other kits, as the only plastic used is the seal on top of the meal box. The rest is made from recyclable cardboard and recycled materials, plus the ice packs and box can both be broken down.\nWe\u2019ve tested:\n- Truffle Butter Filet Mignon with Potato-Leek Mash & Roasted Carrots\n- Potato, Bacon & Egg Breakfast Skillet with Roasted Peppers & Onions\n- Grilled Chicken a la Vodka with Zucchini Noodles & Roasted Broccoli\n- Blackened Salmon with Smoked Gouda Cauliflower \u201cGrits\u201d & Broccoli\n- Jalape\u00f1o-Lime-Cheddar Chicken with Spicy Cilantro Cauliflower \u201cRice\u201d\n- Keto Cheesecake \u2013 Raspberry Vanilla topped with Freeze-Dried Raspberries\n- Protein Shake Variety Pack: Cold Brew Latte, Cinnamon Horchata & Chocolate Banana\n- Pineapple Turmeric Basil Cold Pressed Juice\n- Tropical Citrus & Mango Smoothie Variety Pack\n- Pumpkin Pancakes (seasonal)\nHow does Factor work?\nFactor is one of the most simple meal kits to use, as it\u2019s truly a premade meal delivery kit. The meals come ready to heat-and-eat or can be stored in the fridge. See? Easy.\nAll meals can be microwaved or removed from their packaging to be heated on the stove. For calories and other nutritional information, each meal kit sleeve has everything written out on the back, along with a QR code to learn more about the recipe.\nShipping costs a flat rate of $10.99, and gets sent out each week on the same day, depending on your location.\nTesting TL;DR:\n- Ease of ordering: Factor is one of the easiest kits to order, as they are all single size and you do not need to worry about meal prep or planning.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: There is zero prep and zero cleanup, so all you need is two minutes and a microwave to enjoy.\n- Flavor and fullness: Flavors are pretty good, especially for pre-cooked food. Some meals are more filling than others, like those with steak or pasta, while others are lighter and may require some snacks.\n- Sustainability: If done right, Factor can be very sustainable. The box and ice packs can be broken down and recycled and if you rinse out the tray of all food particles after eating, so can the package and cardboard sleeve, leaving only one piece of plastic to throw away.\n- Price: For a single serving, Factor is on the mid-to more expensive side, as they also have a flat rate for shipping. Eight meals per week average $13.99, but there are frequent promo codes. Similar to other meal delivery kits, the cost will be lower if you order more.\nBest Cheapest Meal Delivery Service: Dinnerly\nPros:\n- Dinnerly is one of the cheapest meal delivery services available, perfect for families and new chefs on a budget\n- Vegetarians will rejoice at their meat-free offerings\n- Portion sizes are generous, and most meals preserve well for leftovers or second helpings if eating for one.\n- Family-friendly and filling meal choices\n- Options for ready-made microwave meals in addition to traditional cooking.\n- Sustainable, with less packaging around the ingredients and recyclable boxes and ice packs.\nCons:\n- Make sure to check your zip code for delivery, as some areas in the Midwest and others are not eligible as of the time of publication\nDinnerly is exactly what I would have wanted on my dinner table as a kid, and frankly, I loved having it on my table as an adult at the end of 2024.\nThe meals are simple and delicious, with filling portions and fresh ingredients at an affordable price \u2014 what more could you ask for? Reviewing Dinnerly I came across many meals I would consider comfort foods, with pasta bakes, soups, burgers and more. There are over 100 choices on the menu each week, so there\u2019s always plenty to choose from.\nEach recipe has only six steps or less, making it easy to follow and a great option for families who want to cook together. They also offer options for ready-to-eat meals that only require a microwave to heat up. These are perfect for school or work lunches or just a quick dinner when you don\u2019t want to cook or clean up.\nWe\u2019ve tried:\n- Buffalo Fried Chicken Sandwich with Ranch & Green Beans\n- Two Cheese Pizza Gnocchi with Spinach\n- Turkey Ramen with Shredded Brussels Sprouts\n- Indian-Style Butter Chicken\n- Baked Pasta Primavera\nHow does Dinnerly work?\nDinnerly sends fresh ingredients and simple recipes to your door weekly. The menu rotates and offers an impressive 100 plus to choose from, with options for carnivores and vegetarians. A new offering since I last tried Dinnerly is their Marketplace, an added service that allows for a la carte grocery shopping, including household staples to supplement your weekly meals.\nTesting TL;DR:\n- Ease of ordering: When looking at the menu, Dinnerly is simple to set up and order for each week. I also made note of the Marketplace, which is a feature not offered by every meal kit service.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: Dinnerly takes between 15 and 45 minutes per meal, sticking closely to what the recipe estimates.\n- Flavor and fullness: When testing Dinnerly, I never needed extra seasonings, and only had to use my own ketchup or mustard once or twice. Everything was filling and I typically had leftovers.\n- Sustainability: Dinnerly was pretty sustainable. They now send paper recipes. In the past, they were solely online.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving, and so Dinnerly sits on the affordable end of the spectrum, starting at $4.99 to $8.49 per serving.\nBest Meal Delivery Service for Variety: Blue Apron\nPros:\n- Full-sized ingredients, super fresh produce and large portions\n- Teaches new culinary skills\n- Restaurant-quality tasting meals\n- Perfect for a hungry family or those who want to spend more quality time in the kitchen\n- Delivery service also offers pre-made meals, grocery items, and add-ons for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dessert\nCons:\n- Not the most sustainable, as each meal and many ingredients are individually wrapped in plastic\n- Some recipes are on the advanced side, so there may be a bit of a learning curve for cooking newbies\nOne of the best things about Blue Apron is the variety, as after four years, I\u2019m still not sick of any of the recipe offerings \u2014 they rotate the menu every week and have options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks \u2014 and even desserts. It\u2019s the quintessential meal kit for yummy meals and filling portions.\nI made sure to review options for beef, chicken, pork, fish, and vegetables. Each was perfect for a lunch or dinner portion, and there was enough for leftovers. This is not a kit for vegans or other diets, but for couples and families looking for delicious home-cooked meals, this fits the bill. These meals are also a bit more in-depth, so this may be the perfect way to sharpen your knife skills, so to speak.\nWe\u2019ve tested:\n- Crispy Steelhead Trout & Creamy Dijon Sauce\n- Seared Steaks & Caper Butter\n- Sambal Chicken & Quinoa \u201cFried Rice\u201d\n- Seared Scallops & Garlic-Herb Risotto\n- Spicy BBQ Pulled Chicken Bowls\nHow does Blue Apron work?\nThis can be as simple or as personalized as you\u2019d like to make it. All you have to do is sign up for your desired portions and meals per week, and then each week log on and choose your meals. Afterward, the box will be delivered to your door.\nFor a more personalized approach, you can choose to have chef-favorites, veggie-forward or even family-friendly meals served to you as options before diving into the full menu. Note: You can shop the full menu at any time, but this may make things simpler.\nYou can also shop from the Marketplace, where you can find meal kits with no subscription required, as well as ready-to-eat meals for a single-serve option. Deliveries can be paused or skipped whenever necessary.\nTesting TL;DR:\n- Ease of ordering: Blue Apron\u2019s intuitive website makes it very easy to order and customize your meal kits.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: I found that some meal recipes were more in-depth and required fine chopping or the use of more than one appliance at a time. However, I did find it helpful that all prep and cook times were on the menu, so I knew in advance what a meal required before choosing it.\n- Flavor and fullness: This is one of the most filling meal kits I\u2019ve tried. Ingredients were fresh and bountiful. The meals were flavorful and spiced perfectly.\n- Sustainability: This is on par with most other kits, and while boxes and ice packs can be recycled, there is a lot of single-use plastic that adds up.\n- Price: Blue Apron is comparable to most other kits, with meals averaging $12. Customers save more when choosing the most meals per week with four servings.\nBest Meal Delivery Service for Those Who Enjoy Cooking: Marley Spoon\nPros:\n- Delicious and high-quality meals \u2014 but what else would I expect from Martha?\n- Perfect for the home cook who likes a balance of easy meals and learning new skills\n- Great for home-cooked dinners with easy directions\n- Options for specific diets, including vegetarian and low-carb recipes, in addition to the classic comfort foods\n- Sustainable packaging and practices\nCons:\n- Make sure to check your zip code for delivery, as some areas in the Midwest and other locations are not eligible as of the time of publication.\n- You may need to add ingredients, especially for the baking recipes\nMartha, Martha, Martha!\nIt just makes sense that a cooking icon like Miss Martha Stewart would have her own meal kit, and I am so glad she does. This gourmet option is from the same manufacturer as Dinnerly, providing fresh and seasonal ingredients to your door with some of Martha\u2019s own recipes.\nFor all-out comfort food, the Pastrami Spice-Rubbed Steak and the Cheesy Sausage Brunch Bake were top-notch, and you can also now order for breakfast, lunch and even baked goods. Note: you will have to supply some of your own ingredients like butter, eggs and vanilla for both cooking and baking, which I learned when I tested Marley Spoon for myself \u2014 check out the clip of my baking skills below. Do you think Martha would be proud?\nBecause these recipes are from Martha Stewart, I wasn\u2019t surprised that my cooking time was slower on many recipes than the listed times on the cards \u2014 lots of extra chopping, prepping and using multiple pots and pans for some meals. Another note: Many of the recipes use the oven, so temperatures and cook times will vary based on your appliances.\nWe\u2019ve tried:\n- Pastrami Spice-Rubbed Steak\n- Cheesy Sausage Brunch Bake\n- Martha\u2019s Best Sausage & Broccoli Rabe Gemelli\n- Family Friendly! Classic Chicken Pho\n- Halloween Pumpkin & Chocolate Whoopie Pies\nHow does Marley Spoon work?\nThe kit is a traditional one, with more than 100 recipes loaded onto the site weekly to choose from and fresh ingredients shipped out according to your plan. You can opt for the two-person or the four-person plan and then select the number of meals you need per week, from two to six.\nThe ingredients come in a brown paper bag, and proteins come on ice packs to preserve freshness. Each box also includes all of the easy-to-follow recipe cards, which can either be recycled or kept for later use.\nTesting TL;DR:\n- Ease of ordering: When looking at the menu, Marley Spoon is simple to set up and order for each week. They also offer pre-made meals, add-ons and other fun items on the menu, so be sure to take a look whenever you visit the site.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: A major selling point of meal kits is that they save time. Note: Marley Spoon takes between 30 and 60 minutes per meal, sometimes longer than what the recipe estimates.\n- Flavor and fullness: Marley Spoon meals never needed to be additionally seasoned and always resulted in leftovers with large portions.\n- Sustainability: Marley Spoon meals are relatively sustainable, but they do use plastic wrappings and containers to separate ingredients.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving, and so Marley Spoon sits in the middle at $8.69 to $12.99 per serving.\nBest Organic Meal Delivery: Green Chef\nPros:\n- Great for those with allergies in the house, as the cards indicate allergens in each basket ingredient\n- Super fresh-tasting fish and proteins that comes on ice in the box\n- Each meal takes six steps to complete, usually under about 35 minutes, perfect for quick lunches and dinners\n- Options for all meals, plus snacks and add-ons\n- An abundance of seasonal recipes and ingredients\nCons:\n- Not as much variety as other brands\nThe green cousin of Hello Fresh, Green Chef stands out as a traditional meal kit with better-for-you options. When reviewing Green Chef, I noticed that it offered the first Keto options for those following the diet. Now, they offer an array of other options, too, including Mediterranean, plant-based, protein packed, gut & brain health, Keto, gluten-free, and calorie smart.\nAnother highlight of the organic meal delivery kit is the allergen-friendly notes on the cards, as there are indications on each ingredient that say if it could trigger an allergy. For example, an \u201cSH\u201d next to the shrimp and an \u201cS\u201d next to the sesame sauce for those with a soy allergy.\nThe kit came with everything I needed, sans salt, pepper and cooking oil, so make sure you have those on hand. The cooking itself stood up to the pretty picture on the recipe card, and so did the cooking time, a great sign for those who only have a half-hour lunch break or don\u2019t want to cook for hours only to eat in minutes.\nWe\u2019ve tried:\n- Sesame Shrimp Noodle Bowls\n- Ancho Chicken Soup\n- Greek Salad with Crunchy Pita Croutons\n- Italian Style Surf \u2018N\u2019 Turf\nHow does Green Chef work?\nThe organic meal delivery service sends fresh, pre-measured and prepped ingredients to your door, delivered on a weekly cadence depending on your subscription.\nChoose from a rotating weekly menu, with options to mix and match vegan, vegetarian, Keto, paleo, gluten-free and more.\nTesting TL;DR:\n- Ease of ordering: Green Chef is very simple to set up and order for each week, with a menu of rotating options to fill your box.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: Green Chef takes between 15 and 45 minutes per meal, sticking very closely to what the recipe estimates.\n- Flavor and fullness: When cooking Green Chef meals, I never had to add seasonings or additional spices, only using what was provided in the box. Each meal was filling and stuck to the servings stated on the cards.\n- Sustainability: Green Chef\u2019s packaging can all be recycled, including the ice packs and cardboard. They do have individually wrapped recipes and fall in the middle of the road when it comes to sustainability.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving, and so Green Chef sits in the middle at $11.99 per serving.\nBest Meal Kit for Kids: Little Spoon\nPros:\n- Offers meals for babies, toddlers, and children up to age 10\n- Uses USDA-certified organic, non-GMO ingredients free from artificial additives and preservatives\n- Meals are delivered directly to your doorstep every two weeks\n- Meals stay fresh for up to 14 days in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer\n- All meals are nut-free, with options for various dietary needs (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free)\nCons:\n- No option for one-time purchases or trial periods\n- Meals typically require refrigeration or freezing, which may be inconvenient for on-the-go feeding\nLittle Spoon is a revolutionary meal delivery service designed specifically for babies, toddlers, and young children up to age 10. The company offers a wide range of organic, freshly-made meals and snacks that are tailored to different stages of childhood development.

With its USDA-certified organic ingredients and innovative cold-pressure technology to preserve nutrients, Little Spoon aims to make feeding children healthy, delicious meals as easy as possible for busy parents. The current 50% discount for first-time orders provides an excellent opportunity for families to experience the benefits of Little Spoon\u2019s carefully crafted meals at a reduced cost. Commerce Writer, Miska Salemann tested this meal with her little one, who absolutely loved it.\nWe\u2019ve tried:\n- Turkey Kale Meatballs\n- Rosemary Chicken\n- Spinach and Cheese Ravioli\n- Pizzalicious Veggie Loops\n- Golden Apple Pie Smoothie\n- Sweet Potato Puree\n- Strawberry Smash Fruit Rippers\nHow does Little Spoon Work?\nLittle spoon has an easy-to-navigate site and plan. Meals start at $6.49 per plate. There are four different plans (or \u2018plates\u2019) to choose from. Once you sign up, select your meals, along with any allergens your little one needs to avoid. This is where you can also add extras to your cart.\nTesting TLDR\n- Ease of ordering: Little Spoon is super easy to order from. The site is simple to navigate with options and ingredients clearly labeled.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: A major selling point of meal kits is that they save time. Little Spoon is great for parents who don\u2019t have time to cook or who need a break a few nights of the week, as the meals are of the heat-and-eat variety.\n- Flavor and fullness: Based on Salemann\u2019s tester (her child!), the food from Little Spoon is kid-approved.\n- Sustainability: Each meal comes pre-packaged in a BPA-free and Phthalate-free container. packages can also be recycled, making this one of the most sustainably minded meal kits we reviewed.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving, and so Little Spoon is on the affordable end, with plates starting at $6.49.\nBest Vegan Meal Delivery: Purple Carrot\nPros:\n- Great variety of meal kits, heat-and-eat meals and snacks\n- Meal kits have easy instructions and packaged ingredients for easy sorting\n- Ready-made meals that are easy to re-heat and warm up well\n- Great flavors, textures, and meat and dairy replacements\n- Free shipping, easy customer service, and on-time delivery\nCons:\n- Individual packaging does mean less sustainability\nPurple Carrot is more than just veggies \u2014 way more.\nI\u2019ve tested the vegan meal delivery a few times over the past four years and each time two things have become clear: the meals are exceptionally tasty and they have more offerings than when I checked last. When I tested this time, I made it a point to order their traditional meal kits, some with easier prep, and others with more intensive cooking, plus some ready-to-eat meals and even some snacks and desserts.\nThe best thing about reviewing Purple Carrot was discovering how seamless it makes adding vegan cuisine into your daily life. I am a carnivore but loved having this healthy meal kit at the ready each week. The traditional kits came with very easy-to-read recipes and all ingredients were separated by meal, so there was no confusion as to which items went with what.\nThe meals only took between 15 and 30 minutes tops, which for me is a perfect amount of time for a weeknight dinner that is filling and nutritious. Since the kit is 100% plant-based, I was worried I would be left wanting more, but with the inclusion of the plant-based proteins I was full and satisfied after each meal.\nWe\u2019ve tested:\n- Green Shawarma Burgers with Lemon-Sesame Yogurt and Cucumber Salad\n- Pesto Portobello Tortellini with Tofu Ricotta and Broccoli\n- Thai Peanut Fried Rice\n- Vegan Chick\u2019n and Dumplings\n- Mafaldine with Red Pesto and Crispy Artichokes\nHow does Purple Carrot work?\nThe meal kit company offers a basic weekly menu with corresponding plans, but has also introduced ready-to-eat meals, and frozen meals sold in your local grocery store. There is even an online market with an array of other plant-based brands to shop.\nThe brand only offers vegan choices, so if this is your diet, you are in luck! However, even if you do choose to partake in meat and fish, Purple Carrot can serve as a great way to introduce a few plant-based options into your weekly rotation. It\u2019s also good for those searching vegetarian meal kits.\nThe traditional meal kits span breakfast, lunch and dinner and come in either two or four-person serving sizes. Simply choose a plan and then each week you can select which meals and add-ons you would like added to your delivery. You can pause or skip deliveries at any point.\nTesting TL;DR:\n- Ease of ordering: Purple Carrot was super easy to order and included options for pasta, salads, and burgers.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: Some recipes were more involved than others, so make note of what supplies and appliances you may need. They are listed on each recipe, but I was caught off guard when I saw I\u2019d need a food processor \u2014 I improvised with a blender, which worked out fine.\n- Flavor and fullness: I was shocked at how full I was after only eating vegan foods! The flavors were great, and many recipes included unique sauces and spice rubs.\n- Sustainability: While vegan, this isn\u2019t the most sustainable option due to individually wrapped ingredients and meals in plastic.\n- Price: This is on par with the majority of other meal kits, from $11 to $14 per serving.\nBest Gluten-Free Meal Delivery Service: Hungryroot\nPros:\n- A huge selection of options based on dietary needs, including gluten-free, dairy-free, and gut-friendly\n- Plans can include full meals, snacks and sweets \u2014 perfect for mindful eating all day\n- Offer a unique combination of a grocery delivery service and a meal delivery service\n- Great for those who like to cook on their own terms but also enjoy a pre-made meal\n- Very fun selection of new brands to choose from\n- Health-conscious brands and lighter recipes that are good for lunch and dinner\nCons:\n- The recipe card is on the back of your order receipt with no photos, and all recipes are grouped together\n- Not many hearty options\nHungryroot is my kind of meal kit since I am the type to leave grocery shopping until I have just one egg, a block of cheese and a singular tomato left in my fridge. My friends and I call it \u201cbachelor fridge\u201d and it\u2019s not a good look \u2014 and this is where Hungryroot saves the day.\nFor my review of Hungryroot, the service sent me full-sized grocery items, like a five-pack of flat breads, a full bag of pasta and a nice-sized package of smoked salmon \u2014 more than enough for the corresponding recipe and then some. On top of that, I also got standard grocery items for my fridge and pantry so I could say bye-bye to my \u201cbatchelor fridge\u201d for a week or two.\nThe meals themselves lean to the lighter side, with salads, sandwiches and bowls, but a few pasta dishes with cream and burgers on the menu may be more filling. I would sign up for the grocery delivery, but stay for the lunch, easy dinner materials, and recipe ideas.\nWe\u2019ve Tried:\n- Pasta Alfredo with Bacon + Snap Peas\n- Sweet Potato Bison Tikka Masala\n- Creamy Garlic Chicken + Crispy Brussels Bowl\n- Avocado Salmon Bagel\n- Shawarma Chicken Caesar Lavash Wrap\nHow does Hungryroot work?\nAs said above, this service has a unique structure of credits.\nYou can fill your box with a mix of recipes and groceries, or just one or the other \u2014 the choice is totally yours each week, as you \u201cpay\u201d for each item in the box with weekly credits. This system allows for customization, making it a great option when you need more meals over groceries one week.\nThe options for what to fill your box with do change, but not weekly like a traditional meal kit. You will have a variety of options from week to week, but I also found that most brands stay the same, like in a grocery store, so if you have favorite chips or candies, don\u2019t worry about them leaving the site too quickly.\nTesting TL;DR:\n- Ease of ordering: Hungryroot is a bit more complex, as you can add both grocery items and meal kits to your box via a points system. It feels more intuitive by the second order, but it may take a second to get used to the first time around.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: A major selling point of meal kits is that they save time. Hungryroot\u2019s meals take five to 30 minutes, sticking very closely to a recipe\u2019s estimate.\n- Flavor and fullness: Judging only the meal kits, each of the recipes was delicious, and many were on the lighter side with salads, bowls, and sandwiches. Many provided me with leftovers but stuck to the listed serving size.\n- Sustainability: Since Hungryroot ships groceries, there is very limited extra packaging, making Hungryroot very sustainable in comparison to other meal kits.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving, but Hungryroot has a unique pricing and credit system, with each item ranging from $1.99 and $8.99.\nBest Prepared Meal Delivery: Thistle\nPros:\n- Many options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner plus snacks, desserts and drinks\n- Meals come in plastic take-out-style containers for quick lunch-packing\n- Each item arrives fresh and has the eat-by date printed on the label for meal planning\n- Delivery is in-person and the folks are very nice \u2014 plus, the deliveries can be tracked by phone, alerting you to how many stops until your door\n- Very sustainable packaging, with a reusable cloth bag (give back to your delivery person) and recyclable jars and containers\nCons:\n- Some areas of the United States are not available for shipping as of Jan. 2025\n- Not a ton of weekly options to customize your box with\nForget heat-and-eat when you can just dive in!\nFor many of Thistle\u2019s meals, this is the case, which makes healthy eating all the easier. The ready-to-eat meals come in super easy-to-transport plastic containers, a la a work cafeteria, or a fast-casual restaurant. Better yet, many of the lunches, like salads and bowls, don\u2019t even need to be heated up, making for a perfect meal on the fly.\nWhen it comes to fresh veggies and vegan meals, I can be skeptical about the produce retaining its crunch upon delivery or that the meat (or meat alternatives) won\u2019t arrive a soggy mess. However, I was thrilled to experience excellent crunchy roughage, al dente pasta, and a chewy caramel brownie upon arrival.\nThistle takes care to label each breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack with the day you should eat it. I ordered for Sunday through Thursday, so it was easy to organize my fridge by day. I simply ate down the line, not allowing anything to go bad \u2014 a fear of mine with buying produce only to forget about it in the crisper drawer\u2026 anyone else?\nWhile reviewing Thistle I learned that it\u2019s one of the rare meal kits that does delivery multiple times per week, so should you want more than three days\u2019 worth of food at a time, you can schedule another delivery for mid-week. Amazing.\nThistle doesn\u2019t have too much variety when it comes to the meals themselves, as there is a relatively fixed weekly menu of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks, and desserts. However, you can choose how many meals per week are delivery, plus the delivery date and time \u2014 very rare among meal kits.\nPlans range in price depending on food type, shipping and local delivery. On the most recent FAQ page, I found the prices listed at the following, since the most accurate way to know the price is by entering your ZIP code.\n\u201cPrices per meal start at $16.32 (vegan lunch or dinner), $18.77 (meat lunch or dinner), and $14.14 (breakfast). Prices will go down as you increase the quantity of meals in your plan and custom orders, and the price per meal may also be less depending on your area, due to our sourcing from local farms and purveyors,\u201d reads the FAQ.\nWe\u2019ve Tried:\n- Pitaya Smoothie With Coconut Hemp Granola\n- Persephone\u2019s Salad\n- Peanut Butter Mousse Cup\n- Patatas Bravas Scramble\n- Golden Tahini Salad\n- Bibimbap\n- Chocolate Caramel Muesli Bar\n- Mocha Oats With Coconut Latte Cream\n- Curried Chickpea Salad\n- Jalape\u00f1o & Pinto \u201cBacon\u201d Bowl\n- Mango Coconut Oat Bar\n- Smashed Sonoma Chickpea Snack Plate\n- Crunchy Thai Peanut Salad\nHow does Thistle work?\nThistle is more like a daily food delivery regimen than a meal kit and honestly, I loved that. They provide a breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and dessert option for each day of the week and weekends, with the ability to swap out meals for allergy reasons or just personal preference. You can also add more snacks, juices and other items to fill your fridge, or just schedule another delivery in the same week \u2014 something that other services don\u2019t provide.\nThistle is not yet available in every U.S. state, so be sure to enter your ZIP code first. But, in states where you can participate, the customer service and ordering process is a breeze, with real-time delivery tracking, in-person handoffs, and sustainable, reusable packaging. Simply order for the week, receive your delivery, and then when your next order comes, return your old cloth bag to the delivery person.\nTesting TL;DR:\n- Ease of ordering: Thistle is very simple, as there are limited options for each day of the week if you are ordering for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: A major selling point of meal kits is that they save time. Thistle\u2019s meals come pre-made, taking no time to cook.\n- Flavor and fullness: I was very impressed that all the meals were both filling and flavorful. Many only contain veggies and a protein but with bold seasonings and sauces.\n- Sustainability: Thistle\u2019s meals come in plastic packaging, some of which can be recycled, like jars, but others may be more difficult to remove all food debris from.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving, and Thistle falls between $12 and $15, so it is on the high end of the spectrum.\nBest Chef-Approved Meal Delivery Service: What a Crock Meals\nPros:\n- No subscription required\n- No prep or mess is required\n- Wide variety of meal options\n- Flexible ordering with no subscription needed\n- Chef-crafted recipes\n- Preservative-free ingredients\nCons:\n- Some meals may require additional sides\n- Long cooking times for some dishes\nWhat a Crock Meals (currently offering 15% off to New York Post readers with the code NYPOST15!)is a unique meal delivery service specializing in pre-prepared ingredients for slow cooker and crockpot meals. Founded as a family-owned business, they offer various chef-crafted dishes designed to simplify dinnertime without sacrificing flavor or quality. Customers can choose from over 50 different meal options, including vegetarian, vegan, low-carb, and gluten-free selections, all made with fresh, preservative-free ingredients.\nThe concept is simple: open the meal bag, dump the contents into your slow cooker, and walk away. In a few hours, you\u2019ll have a delicious, home-cooked meal ready to serve. What a Crock Meals offers flexible ordering options, allowing customers to place one-time orders or schedule recurring deliveries without requiring a subscription. They also provide various portion sizes to accommodate different household needs and offer seasonal rotating menus to keep things interesting.\nBrand Spotlight: What A Crock \u2013 15% off your first order coupon with code: NYPOST15 + No subscription required\nWe\u2019ve tested:\n- Uptown Beef Stew\n- Chicken Parm Meatballs\n- Swedish Meatballs\n- Loaded Potato Soup\nHow does What a Crock work?\nWhat a Crock provides fully prepped, ready-to-cook meals designed for slow cookers, stovetops, and even Instant Pots. Customers can browse a rotating menu of over 50 meals and choose from single-serving, family-sized, or bulk portions. Unlike traditional meal kits, there\u2019s no chopping, slicing, or measuring involved; just dump the pre-portioned ingredients into your slow cooker and let it do the work.\nMeals are shipped frozen and arrive in vacuum-sealed bags to maintain freshness. There\u2019s no required subscription, allowing customers to order as needed, whether for a single meal or stocking up for the month. Also, What a Crock offers a variety of sides, dips, and desserts to complement the main dishes.\nTesting TLDR:\n- Ease of ordering: What a Crock makes it easy to order meals in bulk or individually, with no commitment. Their website allows customers to filter by dietary preferences, serving size, and cooking method, making selection simple.\n- Prep, cook, and cleanup time: With no prep required, meals go straight from the freezer to the slow cooker or stovetop. Cook times vary depending on the dish, typically ranging from 4 to 8 hours. Cleanup is minimal since everything cooks in one pot.\n- Flavor and fullness: The meals are well-seasoned and hearty, with generous portions. Some dishes, like stews and soups, are complete on their own, while others may benefit from additional sides like rice or bread.\n- Sustainability: Packaging is minimal, with vacuum-sealed bags reducing waste. Meals are shipped in insulated boxes with ice packs, which can be reused or recycled.\n- Price: While slightly more expensive than traditional meal kits, the convenience factor justifies the cost. Prices vary based on portion size, but they generally range from $8 to $15 per serving.\nOther top meal delivery kits we tested\nOver the last five years, I\u2019ve also tested other meal kits and delivery services. While they didn\u2019t make our list this time around, one could still be the perfect pick for you.\n- CookUnity is a premade meal delivery service crafted by local chefs and then delivered to your door. It is available in many of the 50 U.S. states.\n- Daily Harvest is great if you live by smoothies and shakes. They also have flatbreads and grain bowls now, but they are still best known for their blender favorites.\n- Splendid Spoon consists mostly of liquids, such as soups, smoothies, and daily wellness shots. They also have noodles and some other meals, but I found them to be the best for the former.\n- Mosaic Foods are meatless meals that made our list of the best vegan delivery services, so you should give them a look if you like protein-packed premade meals without meat or fish.\n- Veestro also made our vegan list, as another option for plant-based premade meals.\n- Sakara Life is more of a lifestyle or a nutrition program than a meal kit, offering supplements and other goodies in addition to salads and plant-based items.\n- Territory Foods is a great local option, as the prepared dishes were curated by local chefs and then delivered.\n- Sunbasket is a great meal kit for traditional meals but also more for snacks, drinks, and seasonal items.\n- Fresh Meal Plan is another locally sourced option that delivers a daily selection of premade meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n- We tested Freshly, Home Bistro, Model Meals and RealEats in the past, but they are no longer in business as of our latest update.\nHow We Tested\nFor those who typically order takeout, meal kits may add more nutritional value to your day. If you are a TV dinner family more nights out of the week than you would like, using a meal kit can provide priceless family time, with chopping, stirring, and hanging out in the kitchen while learning new culinary skills.\nMany choose meal kits for various reasons, and while they may not be for everyone, there certainly are a lot of options, making me a believer that maybe there is a meal kit or delivery service for everyone to try at least once! As a now-late-20-something who has graduated from heating food in the microwave to the culinary world of two or more pots on the stove at a time, I\u2019ve set out to try as many meal kits and delivery companies as possible.\nI tried to do the math, and being conservative, I\u2019ve spent over 84 hours just writing the 2025 re-boot alone \u2014 that\u2019s 10.5 full workdays, and this isn\u2019t my full-time job, folks!\nThat\u2019s not counting the actual cooking, filming, editing, eating, doing dishes, and breaking down boxes. I tried to cook a minimum of three meals per kit each year, so again, with some fast math, that is 42 meals minimum for 2024, from October to December. Multiply that by five years and we are at 210 minimum and that\u2019s not even counting the meal kits that didn\u2019t make this year\u2019s list, putting us at well over 250 meals and countless hours to find the 14 best meal delivery kits for 2025!\nMeal kits by the numbers:\n- 2024: creating new content = 14 new articles and 14 new reviews below\n- 2024: hours spent writing = 84, conservatively = 10.5 full workdays\n- 2024: hours spent filming videos = 14, minimum\n- 2024: minimum meals cooked = 42 meals between October and December\n- 2020 to 2024 minimum meals cooked = 250 roughly (but probably more!)\n- Boxes recycled = so many\nThe hardest part for you, dear reader, will be deciding which to try, or perhaps which to try first.\n- Ease of ordering: When looking at the menu, I reviewed how simple it was to set up and order for each week. I also noted any add-ons and Marketplace, as well as how easy it was to customize an order, make changes, and pause membership.\n- Prep, cook and cleanup time: A major selling point of meal kits is that they save time. I still noted how long it took me to have a complete meal from unpacking to cooking, eating, and recycling.\n- Flavor and fullness: Meal kits are meant to remove all the guesswork from cooking, including seasoning. When testing, I took into account if any of the dishes I ordered needed to be seasoned or altered to become more palpable. I also considered how satisfied they left me and for how long.\n- Sustainability: Not all meal kits are eco-friendly or use sustainable practices. To determine where each stood on the eco-conscious scale, I reviewed its production policy and looked into how it sourced its ingredients. Other things I took into account were its packaging and whether it could be recycled.\n- Price: Meal kits typically run between $7 and $15 per serving. I also took into account how many meals arrived per week and how many servings were included for the price.\nMeal delivery kits, compared\n| Name | Price | Shipping | Sample Plans |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| EveryPlate | $2.99+ | $9.99 | Most all diets, low calories, dairy-free, low-carb, vegan, vegetarian |\n| Purple Carrot | $13.25+ | $10 \u2013 $15 typically | Plant-based/vegan |\n| Blue Apron | $4.99+ | $10.99 | Most all diets, low calories, dairy-free, low-carb, vegan, vegetarian |\n| Factor | $7.99+ | $10.99 | Most all diets, Keto, low calorie, vegetarian, vegan |\n| Green Chef | $6.89+ | $9.99 | Most all diets, Keto, paleo, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian. |\n| Martha & Marley Spoon | $5.99+ | $11.99 | Most all diets, low calories, dairy-free, low carb, vegan, vegetarian |\nDinnerly | $4.99+ | $11.99 | Most all diets, low calorie, low carb, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free |\n| Home Chef | $9.99+ | $10.99 \u2013 $13.99 | Most all diets, vegetarian, carb-conscious, calorie-conscious |\n| HelloFresh | $8.99+ | $10.99 | Most all diets, vegetarian, vegan, carb-smart, calorie-smart |\n| Hungryroot | $65+ per delivery | Free on orders over $70, $6.99 otherwise | Groceries; most all diets |\n| Thistle | $12.00+ | Price varies | Plant-based, dairy-free, gluten-free |\nMeal Kit FAQ:\nWhat\u2019s the best meal delivery service?\nHands down, my favorite meal kit is EveryPlate. As I mentioned in a previous review, it works for almost every palate. Meals are typically $5.99, so it\u2019s extremely budget-friendly, and the ingredients are so fresh, I felt like I had picked the produce out at the grocery store myself!\nWhat is the difference between a meal kit and a meal delivery service?\nWell, this one is a bit tricky, as both are included in this roundup, and there is some overlap. A meal kit is usually a subscription-based program that sends ingredients and recipes to your home. A meal delivery service may be the above, or be pre-cooked meals or grocery items, in addition to or instead of ingredients for a specific meal.\nDo you need to subscribe to the meal kit?\nMost of the time, yes! Usually, a subscription is needed to try the meals, however, some companies also have a marketplace that sells items a la carte.\nHow often do offerings and menus change?\nTypically, sites will switch up their meal offerings on a weekly basis.\nDo I have to be a good cook to use a meal kit?\nNo! Meal kits come in many different skill levels, from simply microwaving to more intensive chopping and cooking. They can also be a great way to strengthen culinary skills or teach children how to cook.\nHow are meal kits sustainable?\nMeal kits are sustainable because they use more efficient supply chains, reduce food waste, and lower transportation emissions.\nFood Supply Chains: Many meal delivery services use a farm-to-table model, sourcing ingredients directly from farms. Opting for seasonal produce not only takes less energy to produce but also creates fewer greenhouse emissions because the food is never transported to a grocery store.\nReduced Food Waste: Meal kit delivery services use pre-portioned ingredients, so nothing is left over. This is not only great for those who can\u2019t be bothered figuring out serving sizes but also for those hoping to avoid throwing out unused food. According to the EPA, 40% of food is wasted in the United States, which costs an estimated $218 billion per year.\nLower Emissions: Because of packaging, many assume meal kit delivery services are not sustainable. However, they actually have a lower carbon footprint than most grocery stores. Part of this comes from sourcing their ingredients directly from local farms instead of commercial chains. By skipping this step in the retail phase, they produce lower emissions. Similarly, shoppers who use meal delivery services as a replacement for traditional grocery shopping reduce greenhouse gas emissions by not traveling to the store to buy food.\nWhat to look for when choosing a meal kit:\nDiet: Pay attention to the dietary options each service caters to, from vegetarian and vegan to Keto and paleo.\nHousehold Size: Count the number of people in your family and then account for how much they eat to best calculate how many servings you need to feed everyone. Some kits detailed above have larger portions, while others are single-serve only.\nBudget: Meal kits and services have a wide range of prices. Some offer free shipping, while others have a minimum spend. Specialty or health-related plans may cost more.\nTime: Think about how long you want to cook each night. Some meals require 30 or more, not including cleaning up. Others are microwavable and thus don\u2019t require any clean-up time.\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\nFor over 200 years, the New York Post has been America\u2019s go-to source for bold news, engaging stories, in-depth reporting, and now, insightful shopping guidance.

      "text": "Picky eater husband brutally roasted after wife forced to cook him separate dinner: \u2018You forgot his bottle\u2019\nA mom has a message for fellow parents: persevere in trying to get your kids to eat a variety of different foods.\nOtherwise, she says, you\u2019ll end up with a grown adult who is such a picky eater that their spouse will have to cook separate meals for them for the rest of their lives.\nThis is the reality of TikToker and mom Brianna Greenfield, who regularly documents life married to a picky eater.\nIn her latest clip, which has clocked over 2.5 million views, she shares herself preparing nachos for her husband after he refused to eat the salmon dinner she had cooked for the rest of the family.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t feed him, he doesn\u2019t eat\u201d\n\u201cMy husband didn\u2019t eat the dinner that I made,\u201d she says, \u201cso let\u2019s make him some nachos.\u201d\nAs Brianna grates a massive chunk of cheese, she continues, \u201cIf I don\u2019t feed him, he literally won\u2019t eat.\n\u201cThis used to irritate me.

      "text": "The key to solving your relationship problems might come down to your emojis, new study reveals\nEmojis can improve relationships, according to new research.\nUsing the digital representations of emotions and ideas in text and social media messages boosts closeness and relationship satisfaction by complementing face-to-face interactions, say American scientists.\nAlthough emojis are highly prevalent in texting and social media, no previous studies had looked at their potential as a tool for fostering interpersonal connection.\nResearchers from The University of Texas at Austin investigated how emojis influence relationship perceptions in an era dominated by online interactions.\nThe participants included 260 adults ranging in age from 23 to 67 who were randomly assigned to read 15 text message exchanges that varied only in the presence or absence of emojis in the text.\nThey were instructed to imagine themselves as the sender of each message and to focus on their partner\u2019s replies.\nParticipants rated partners who used emojis as more responsive than partners who communicated through text alone.\nStudy author Sally Huh said: \u201cThis perceived partner responsiveness through emoji use was positively associated with closeness and relationship satisfaction.\n\u201cSurprisingly, there were no significant differences between face and non-face emojis, suggesting that the type of emoji may be less critical than previously assumed.\n\u201cRather, it may be the presence of emojis that drives perceptions of greater partner responsiveness and better relationships.\u201d\nThe design of the study, published in the journal PLOS One, focused only on one partner in an inherently two-way relationship.\nThe researchers say the design helped to isolate the effects of emoji use on friendship dynamics, moving beyond the correlational approaches that dominate much of the existing literature.\nThey believe the findings show that emojis may serve not only as expressive devices but also as signals of attentiveness and emotional engagement.\nMs Huh added: \u201cThe study revealed that emojis can boost relationship satisfaction by signalling emotional attentiveness.\n\u201cInterestingly, it\u2019s not the type of emoji but simply their presence that makes people feel closer to their partner.\u201d"

On Wednesday, authorities said that the initial autopsy \"did not show evidence of violence.\"\nAccording to police, East Hampton Town officers responded to a 911 call just after midnight from a man who reported a woman unconscious on a vessel docked at the luxury marina, located on Star Island Road. Nearby good Samaritans attempted CPR before first responders arrived, but the woman was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.\nOn Wednesday, police identified the deceased as Nolan, an industrious entrepreneur.\nEXCLUSIVE WATERFRONT ENCLAVE ROCED AFTER BODY FOUND NEAR YACHT CLUB\nAuthorities said the preliminary investigation and medical exam were \"inconclusive\" as to the cause of death. An official ruling will be made following an autopsy by the Suffolk County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.\nFormer NYPD inspector and Fox News contributor Paul Mauro told Fox News Digital that police are likely beginning with the standard proceedings following a high-profile death investigation.\n\"The detectives will be doing the basics here \u2014 interview the boat owner, others potentially on the boat that night, other boat-owners nearby, members of the yacht club, etc. They\u2019ll also be doing the usual digital stuff we talk about, with phones and video,\" Mauro said. \"A key piece here will also be the determination made by the Suffolk Medical Examiner following the autopsy.\"\nDespite the upscale setting, Mauro said investigators won\u2019t be deterred: \"Just because this occurred in an exclusive area is no shield from police inquiries. I have no doubt there will be a full investigation.\"\nOne critical logistical challenge may be the scene of the incident: the boat.\n\"If it is indeed a crime scene, you have a crime scene that could go mobile. So the detectives have no doubt frozen the scene \u2014 by court order if necessary,\" Mauro explained. \"That boat cannot go sailing off into the sunset.\"\nOriginally from Carlow, Ireland, Nolan was the founder of East x East, a boutique resort wear label she frequently promoted on TikTok through stylish behind-the-scenes glimpses of her photo shoots and design process.\nIn one clip from a Mallorca campaign, she described the project as \"a beautiful love story,\" adding that \"witnessing my visions come to life fills me with so much happiness.\"\nHer most recent posts included a July video celebrating a pop-up appearance at Gurney\u2019s Resort in Montauk, captioned \"Goals Achieved,\" highlighting the culmination of her marketing efforts in the Hamptons.\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Nolan received her Bachelor of Commerce and Master's degree in Digital Marketing from University College Dublin before moving to the Big Apple at 26-years-old.\nFollowing her death, Nolan's business partner, Dylan Grace, wrote: \"We dreamed big together, laughed harder than anyone else could understand and built so much from nothing.\"\n\"I\u2019m truly blessed and grateful to have had you in my life,\" Grace wrote of Nolan. \"Love you so much Mar. Fly high girl.\"\nWATCH:\nThe Suffolk County Homicide Squad is leading the investigation. Anyone with information is urged to contact detectives at 631-852-6392.\nThe Montauk Yacht Club is a haven for summer tourism and upscale clientele. The Long Island hotel is oceanfront.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA spokesperson for the Montauk Yacht Club, where the boat was docked, confirmed the incident but declined to provide further details.\n\"We are saddened to learn of the incident that took place,\" the spokesperson said to Fox News Digital. \"Our team is cooperating with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation and remains committed to the safety and well-being of our guests and staff. We have no further comment at this time.\""

      "text": "His feelings are boiling over.\nOne woman\u2019s cooking is on the chopping block after his husband finally admitted that her meals have been nearly inedible eight years into their marriage.\nThe anonymous man took to Reddit to air out his frustrations saying his spouse has the confidence of a seasoned chef, but produces unappetizing \u2014 and potentially dangerous \u2014 dishes.\nIn fact, the situation is so dire that the husband, 29, is \u201cscared she\u2019s going to kill someone one day\u201d with undercooked meat and feels like he needs \u201cto watch her like a hawk.\u201d\n\u201cShe undercooks just about everything, especially meat, and no matter how many times I try to politely correct her, she claims I\u2019m being \u2018picky,'\u201d he explained, adding that they split household responsibilities 50/50, including kitchen time.\n\u201cFor example, every time she makes rice, I just can\u2019t convince her it\u2019s 1 part rice to 2 parts water. She always says \u2018are you sure? That seems like a lot of water.\u2019 Or \u2018Maybe that\u2019s how you like it, but I don\u2019t want it so mushy,'\u201d he continued. \u201cThe package and google won\u2019t convince her either, and I just swallow my pride and eat the crunchy rice every time. It\u2019s like that with everything.\u201d\nWhile he might be able to choke down ill-prepared meals, his wife, 28, constantly invites their friends over for dinner. They \u201cpolitely eat,\u201d but they have accepted \u201cfewer and fewer invitations for dinner\u201d as a result.\n\u201cShe really prides herself on her cooking and wants to make everything herself,\u201d the husband explained. \u201cI just trail behind her, trying to make sure it\u2019s all edible, but there\u2019s usually a few dishes that end up drastically over salted or undercooked.\u201d\nWhile he claims he\u2019s been protecting her feelings for their eight-year marriage, the situation has reached its boiling point.\nJust the other night, the husband explained, his wife cooked chicken in the oven while he showered \u2014 and was shocked when she claimed it was \u201cready\u201d just 10 minutes later. She argued that, because she pan-seared the meat before putting it in the oven, \u201cit was fine,\u201d but upon further inspection, the husband discovered \u201cthe sides were literally pink.\u201d\n\u201cI snapped a little and told her she\u2019s going to kill someone one day from serving them raw meat. Can\u2019t you see that it\u2019s pink? That\u2019s food safety number 1,\u201d he said.\n\u201cShe said she thought it was done, and it\u2019s not her fault, her mother never showed her how to cook chicken growing up. I then told her \u2018Well you\u2019re almost thirty, that\u2019s no excuse for not knowing how to cook at all.'\u201d\nWhile he admitted he could have been kinder, he asked Redditors how he should handle the situation.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been patient for eight years \u2014 that\u2019s a long time to be chewing on crunchy rice and dodging food poisoning,\u201d wrote one user who declared the man \u201cnot the a\u2013hole.\u201d\n\u201cYou said she won\u2019t listen to google or the instructions on the box- it\u2019s obvious she had NO INTENTION of learning. If my 9 yr old granddaughter can grasp how dangerous it is to eat raw meat, why can\u2019t your wife?\u201d questioned one person.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to cook. And I didn\u2019t have google. I had to teach myself (so many ppl do this everyday),\u201d they continued. \u201cI feel like your wife is playing stupid. But regardless, please stop having dinner parties (& don\u2019t let her near children).\u201d\nAnother reader called the woman\u2019s behavior \u201cconfusing,\u201d wondering \u201cwhere in the world is this undeserved confidence coming from?\u201d\n\u201cI just can\u2019t resolve \u2018never being taught how to cook\u2019 with \u2018assuming everyone else knows less than you about cooking,'\u201d they wrote.\n\u201cWhile intending to be kind, you\u2019ve allowed her to go several years thinking her food is edible when it\u2019s not,\u201d someone else chimed in. \u201cYou\u2019ve only put your foot down when not doing so might have put you in the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cYou may have been nice, but you haven\u2019t been kind. Hiding the truth is hurting you both, and \u2018nice\u2019 is just surface level,\u201d another person agreed, adding that it sounds like the couple need to \u201cwork on your communication.\u201d\n\u201cIf you CAN\u2019T talk to each other honestly about stuff like this, maybe eight is enough?\u201d"

Perechinsky was able to tourniquet both of Jenkins\u2019 arms.\nThe vehicles they arrived in sustained several gunshots. Paris would not say exactly how many rounds, but felt confident in saying \"dozens of rounds were fired.\" Two additional troopers arrived to evacuate the two injured troopers.\nAn EMT responding to the scene, Carl Lawson, also became a victim in the incident after his vehicle was fired at by the gunman. Lawson took evasive action and drove off the side of the road and crashed, sustaining injury. He is listed in stable condition.\nICE DETAINEE FOUND \u2018HANGING BY THE NECK\u2019 AT PENNSYLVANIA DETENTION CENTER\nSeveral law enforcement agencies helped to set up a perimeter around Faino. At one point, law enforcement launched a drone, but Faino allegedly shot it down with a firearm. Still, a perimeter was eventually setup up around Faino's location.\n\"We attempted, at length, to try and negotiate with Mr. Faino,\" Paris said. \"At one point\u2026he was sitting on a propane tank, which caused further concern that he had attempted to turn that into an improvised explosive device.\"\nParis said police were concerned Faino had other weapons, aside from a semiautomatic long gun he had fired several rounds from. But along with additional weapons, police were also concerned he had explosive devices.\nAfter a period of attempting to negotiate with Faino, Paris said, Faino continued to be a threat and was fatally shot.\nRep. Dan Meuser commented on the shooting.\n\"Latest update from Susquehanna County: I\u2019ve received word that, to the best of my knowledge, both troopers who were wounded are okay and are recovering,\" Meuser wrote.\nPerechinsky and Jenkins were airlifted to a medical facility for emergency treatment.\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said he would visit the area where the shooting happened.\nSUSPECT SHOOTS TROOPER, OPENS FIRE AT KENTUCKY CHURCH, LEAVING MULTIPLE PEOPLE INJURED\n\"Lori and I are praying for these brave Troopers, and our thoughts are with their families, friends, and every member of the State Police,\" Shapiro wrote in a post on X.\nSen.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.
