      "feedback": "Strong draft, but to reach world-class quality you should tighten the 0–3 week frame into a crisp, data-driven causal chain, quantify every claim with specific numbers from the sources, and provide a clear, testable set of catalysts and invalidation points. Actionable edits: reframe the piece as a tight 0–3 week narrative anchored to immediate data (unemployment claims 1.972m for the week of Aug 9; the 4-week average initial claims around 226k–235k; unemployment 4.2%; 20% of employers plan to hire fewer workers), and tariff-pass-through dynamics (average tariff rate ~18.3%; Goldman’s ~70% pass-through to prices) plus near-term inflation pressure (core PCE about 2.9%). Build a clean causal chain: tariff-driven input-cost pressures and immigration-driven labor-supply constraints constrain demand/supply balance; the Fed’s framework shift (higher neutral rate, flexible targeting) makes policy path data-dependent rather than preset; markets respond to data on claims, wages, and core inflation. Add explicit catalysts and triggers: next jobs/claims prints, wage growth momentum, tariff-policy changes or pass-through moves, and AI-capex announcements; specify thresholds for monitoring (claims crossing 2.0m, unemployment rising above 4.3%, core PCE sustaining 2.8–2.9% for two prints, tariff pass-through staying near 70% or higher). Outline a three-scenario framework (baseline, upside, downside) with clear invalidation rules: baseline persists if claims drift modestly higher but inflation stays near target; upside if inflation cools with a resilient labor market and steady growth; downside if sustained claims rise and inflation surprises to the upside, prompting earlier tightening. Include a near-term price-regulation impulse (air-conditioning costs +$1,500 per system; LLN6N4H3Z) as a one-off drag to CPI, not a core drift—but flag it as a pocket risk to consumer inflation. Map every assertion to IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL (GZ9VV1RV0 for labor/tariffs, 218AGGUXB for AI/tariff discourse, LLN6N4H3Z for cooling-costs, U6HXAJR4J for Lagarde/Jackson Hole stance, and Powell-framework notes in 4). If conflicts arise (e.g., Krugman’s stagflation warning vs AI-driven offset), state them succinctly and show how the Fed’s 2025 framework (flexible targeting, higher neutral rate) moderates policy risk in the near term. Finally, present this as a tight 0–3 week forecast with an explicit monitoring checklist (claims, wages, core PCE, tariff developments, AI investments) rather than a wide-ranging narrative, and prune non-core sources to retain focus and clarity.",
