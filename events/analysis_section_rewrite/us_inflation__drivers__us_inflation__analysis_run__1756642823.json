      "feedback": "The draft correctly identifies the Fed’s September 25‑bp cut as the pivot, but it needs tighter causal mapping, sharper numbers, and explicit catalyst windows to meet the “truth > verbosity” rule. Replace the vague “6‑9 % decline” with a range anchored to the current 10‑yr/2‑yr spread (≈30 bp) and the projected 35‑40 bp post‑cut; cite (LF0UUL917) for the spread change and (FAN5RYW6T) for the S&P impact. Explicitly map the asset to the canonical handle **spx** and the dollar to **dxy**; add inline citations (B1KYJ1GPU)(XTQIQRP5K) for the 0.5‑1 % DXY lift. Clarify the transmission: Fed cut → 2‑yr yield ↓ → term premium ↑ → discount rate on tech earnings ↑ → valuation compression → 6‑9 % spx decline; each step must carry a citation. Quantify risks: a Fed hike of +0.2‑0.4 % (LF0UUL917) could lift the 10‑yr/2‑yr spread back to 30 bp, flattening the DXY and supporting spx; a core PCE easing to 2.0 % (FAN5RYW6T) could lift risk appetite by 1‑4 %. Add a catalyst window: **September Fed meeting (Sep 25‑26)**, **August core PCE (Aug 15)**, **August NFP (Aug 31)**; cite (LF0UUL917)(XTQIQRP5K). Remove any sentence that drifts from spx (e.g., “the DXY rally” without linking back to equity risk‑premium). Finally, tighten the watch list: Fed meeting, core PCE, NFP, 10‑yr/2‑yr spread, dxy level; each with a 1‑2‑week horizon and a clear trigger (e.g., spread <30 bp → dxy falls → spx gains). This will satisfy the acceptance gate and elevate the analysis to elite, actionable insight.",
