So to help you decide which route is right for you, here are your main options after GCSEs.\n\nA-LEVELS: Most students take three or four to prepare them for work or Uni, with around 80 subjects on offer nationally. Check with your school or college as to what they offer.\n\nAPPRENTICESHIPS: The \u201cearn as you learn\u201d schemes offer real work experience alongside the chance to study for professional qualifications.\n\nAfter GCSEs you will start at Level 2/3 and you can continue up to Level 7, which is equivalent to a masters degree. See gov.uk/apply- apprenticeship.\n\nCassie Holloway left school at 16 and found an apprenticeship through Young Professionals.\n\nNow 19, she is a senior recruitment consultant at Office Angels.\n\nCassie, from Northampton, said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t the most well-behaved or engaged student at school, which meant I didn\u2019t achieve the grades I needed to get into sixth form.\n\n\u201cHowever, finding an apprenticeship changed everything. For the first time, I felt important, I had a real purpose. That gave me the motivation I needed to work hard.\n\n\u201cApprenticeships offer real-world experience that you simply can\u2019t get in a lecture hall.\n\n\u201cPlus, you\u2019re earning a proper wage instead of racking up debt \u2014 it\u2019s a win-win situation.\n\nFollow @youngprouk on Instagram for real-time advice, updates and job opportunities.\n\nT-LEVELS: A classroom-based alternative to apprenticeships for 16 to 18 year olds, with a 45-day industrial placement.\n\nCareers range from science to finance, to creative and design and students are awarded UCAS tariff points in line with 3 A-Levels.\n\nVocational qualifications: Qualifications such as BTECs give young people a broad overview of working in a specific sector, such as business, media, engineering, leisure or science and technology.\n\nAutumn resits: Want to improve your GCSE grades? Examination boards offer autumn resists in all subjects. Talk to your school or college.\n\nGet help: See tinyurl.com/helpwithexamresults or call 0800 100 900.\n\nThe helpline is free and is open weekdays 8am-8pm and Saturday from 10am-5pm.\n\nSMALL businesses and charities struggling to take on apprentices have been given a lifeline by Virgin Media O2, which a \u00a31million apprenticeship levy fund to train people for roles in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n\nOrganisations can access the fund to cover the cost of training for eligible roles.\n\nThe programme is designed to support women and people from global majority backgrounds looking to progress in a STEM-based jobs.\n\nThe fund concept is backed by three-star Michelin chef Clare Smyth, who began her career as an apprentice.\n\nShe said: \u201cBy tackling access and affordability constraints, and targeting underrepresented groups, this scheme can make a huge difference to communities across the country.\u201d\n\nCurrently, four in five employers say they would be more likely to hire apprentices if additional financial support was available, so the scheme could unlock hundreds of opportunities for young people and career-changers.\n\nYou can make the grade\n\nDIDN\u2019T get the grades you wanted? Don\u2019t worry, you can always retake to up your score.\n\nHere Jacqui Maher, deputy principal at Birmingham\u2019s South & City College, shares her GCSE resit guidance.\n\n1. Don\u2019t panic \u2013 it may feel like the end of the world right now, but it\u2019s not a disaster and you\u2019re not alone.\n\n2. Even celebrities such as Robbie Williams have spoken about their intention to resit exams.\n\n3. Don\u2019t let your results put you off enrolling for a course that will lead to the career of your choice. You can study a resit alongside your vocational programme \u2013 it might just take a little longer.\n\n4. Taking resits needn\u2019t be an isolating experience. Get in touch with your local further education college as it might offer supported tuition, so regardless of your background or financial position, high- quality tuition is available.\n\n5. Communicate with your teacher about your doubts, try to work on your weaknesses, and be prepared to try out different study techniques until you find what really works for you.\n\n6. Be prepared to put in the time. Resitting either English or maths GCSE without any commitment to studying won\u2019t lead to improved results.\n\n7. Seek reassurance in the fact that you\u2019re not the first to resit an exam and those who\u2019ve come before you have often found it a positive experience. On our Get Further programme, students have said: \u201cJust keep at it. Make sure you get a little bit done every day, attend as much as you can, and really understand it.\u201d",
