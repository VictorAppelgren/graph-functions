      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but still feels like a collection of disparate observations rather than a coherent, multi‑year structural thesis.  To reach world‑class quality, 1) break the analysis into four logical blocks (aviation safety, Japanese banks, U.S. CEO‑pay norms, Ford/auto sector) and explicitly map each to a first‑principles anchor (e.g., transponder reliability, demographic‑driven growth constraints, performance‑linked compensation, cyclical demand). 2) Add concrete numbers and source IDs for every claim (e.g., BS3876D03 for radar limits, PA57YBYVQ for Mizuho’s $489 B assets, MUFG’s 120.7 T yen, O4ZEED2EB for 7.7 % CEO‑pay rise and median $19 M, W2622L6WW and 22PL3Q360 for Ford’s 4.3 % operating margin, 10.1 % ROIC, $1.3 B EV loss, 5.18 % dividend yield, forward P/E 10.3). 3) Explicitly state regime transition conditions (e.g., a rebound in Japan’s GDP or a Fed rate cut would reduce overseas deal pressure; a tariff rollback would lift Ford’s margins). 4) Provide a concise causal chain for each regime (demographics → low domestic growth → banks → overseas deals; Fed tightening → higher auto financing costs → Ford demand erosion). 5) Conclude with a base‑case forecast, key risks, watch list (Fed policy, Japan GDP, Ford earnings, tariff policy), and a confidence rating (e.g., moderate‑high). 6) Ensure every critical source is cited; reconcile any conflicting figures (e.g., Ford’s 17 % 2025 gain vs. weak fundamentals). These edits will tighten the narrative, ground it in data, and satisfy the multi‑year, first‑principles focus.",
