  "title": "How to watch 2025 F1 Dutch Grand Prix: Schedule, streaming for Zandvoort after summer break",
  "description": "Coming straight off the summer break, the Dutch Grand Prix is the first objective measure of which teams spent August wisely.",
  "content": "Zandvoort cuts through the dunes beside the North Sea, a Formula One circuit as precarious as it is spectacular. Fans can still expect the Orange to sing, but Max Verstappen\u2019s homecoming has also become the season\u2019s reset point.\n\nComing straight off the summer break, the Dutch Grand Prix is the first objective measure of who spent August wisely: which teams arrive with meaningful upgrades, and which will be left exposed. McLaren\u2019s brewing civil war sets the stage, with Oscar Piastri clinging to a nine-point lead, and Lando Norris arriving with Budapest fresh in memory; last year\u2019s dominant win here in hand.\n\nHow to watch the 2025 F1 Dutch Grand Prix\n\nRace coverage can also be streamed on ESPN+.\n\nThe standings matter more with 10 races left. Every slip now tilts the championship math in more permanent ways than earlier events. For now, that flatters McLaren. But with Monza and Singapore looming, their margin looks thinner than the table suggests.\n\nPiastri leads, Norris stalks, Verstappen is third and George Russell anchors fourth. Ferrari, meanwhile, arrives in need of a reset. Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton have shown flashes but too often faded, and the car has been uneven on Sundays. Hamilton\u2019s early Ferrari season has been a grind, with no podiums and little luck. Brilliance has surfaced but never found daylight.\n\nCanada gave the season one of its rare jolts. Rookie Kimi Antonelli, who just turned 19, climbed the podium and looked unbothered by the spotlight. Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull won\u2019t have the next decade to themselves. The grid is changing faster than anyone expected. And just offstage, Cadillac waits with Andretti, preparing to enter in 2026.\n\nIt\u2019s another tremor in a sport that rarely stands still, proof that today\u2019s storylines will soon share space with new badges, new budgets and new rivals.\n\nStreaming links in this article are provided by partners of The Athletic.

      "text": "Mastercard will become the naming partner of McLaren\u2019s Formula One team from 2026, The Athletic can reveal.\nIn an announcement set to be made public imminently, McLaren has struck a deal to expand its existing sponsorship agreement with Mastercard, with the global payments giant becoming its named partner.\nAdvertisement\nThe team\u2019s official name will become \u2018McLaren Mastercard Formula 1 Team\u2019 from next season.\nThe Mastercard deal is estimated to be in the region of $100 million per season, sources with knowledge of the matter disclosed to The Athletic on condition of anonymity. It is a long-term agreement that is understood to run through to the mid-2030s.\nIt is also believed to stand as the biggest title sponsorship agreement on the F1 grid, and is the largest commercial deal in McLaren\u2019s history.\nIt will be the first time since the end of 2013 that McLaren has raced with a title sponsor. Back then, its high-profile agreement with Vodafone ended and was followed by a long period of decline for the team overall.\n\u201cWe wanted it to be the right partner, with the right long-term commitment, with the same values as McLaren, and a brand that we felt could add value off the track,\u201d Brown told reporters at an event in Amsterdam announcing the partnership. \u201cIf you look at Mastercard, what they\u2019ve historically done in other sports, the amount of reach they have, how global they are, it\u2019s a perfect fit for us.\n\u201cFor us, it was all about finding the right partner. We had plenty of opportunities, as you can imagine, over the past nine years, but this is one that was a no-brainer for us.\u201d\nBrown did suggest there would be no significant changes to McLaren\u2019s papaya livery despite the expanded agreement, with many teams often giving over large chunks of their paint scheme to their major partners.\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect radical change, as far as what our racecar looks like today,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re quite happy. We think (the design) is very distinctive, so of course, you\u2019ll see some enhancements and some modifications, especially as the car will look different in how it\u2019s developed (for 2026), as far as the race car itself. But it will be very recognizable next year from what you see this year.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMcLaren announced in July 2024 that Mastercard would be joining as a new primary partner, with the deal being fully launched at the Las Vegas Grand Prix last November.\nThe McLaren cars have raced with Mastercard branding since the Las Vegas race, while this season a large Mastercard logo has also been present on the side of McLaren\u2019s motorhome hospitality unit that houses the team at race weekends during European rounds.\nBut the expansion of the partnership into a title agreement is a big step for McLaren, which was previously the only team left on the F1 grid that did not race with a title sponsorship. This was even after it successfully ended its run of poor results with a resurgence in 2023 and then F1 constructors\u2019 championship in 2024.\nUnder the leadership of Zak Brown, McLaren Racing\u2019s CEO who took charge at the end of 2016, the team has overhauled its commercial portfolio.\nBesides Mastercard, it has significant partnerships with technology giant Google and crypto exchange OKX. A further 50 sponsors are listed on the team\u2019s website, including brands such as Dell, Android, Allwyn and Hilton.\nSpeaking in February, Brown estimated that McLaren had the greatest commercial revenue for any team in F1 history through 2024, when Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri helped secure its first constructors\u2019 championship in 26 years.\nBrown always claimed to be cautious about bringing a title sponsor back to McLaren, as he prioritized protecting the team name and brand from market fluctuations. But when the possibility of Mastercard eventually becoming a title sponsor was put to Brown in Las Vegas last year, he did acknowledge that a name combining the two brands had \u201ca nice ring to it.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a very long-term partnership,\u201d Brown added in November. \u201cWe\u2019re having all sorts of discussions as to what the partnership looks like today, and what it could potentially become.\u201d\nWhy now for McLaren?\nAs varied as McLaren\u2019s sponsorship portfolio may have been, the absence of a title sponsor made it stand out from the rest of the F1 grid. Other teams have moved to cash in on the sport\u2019s boom in popularity in recent years, bringing with it an array of new brands wanting to adorn cars with their logos.\nAdvertisement\nFerrari announced technology company HP as its new title sponsor in May 2024. Red Bull brought Oracle on board ahead of the 2022 season. Mercedes has a long-term partnership with Petronas, while Aston Martin has Aramco as its title partner. In the case of Racing Bulls, it has two title partners in Visa (a Mastercard rival) and Cash App, its official name being \u2018Visa Cash App Racing Bulls.\u2019\nMcLaren is now making the same choice at a time when its own on-track success and off-track popularity is reaching a new peak.\nThe team is poised to comfortably win its second straight constructors\u2019 title, likely with a handful of races to spare before F1 returns to North America in October. Piastri and Norris are also clear of the rest of the pack in the fight for the drivers\u2019 crown \u2014 Max Verstappen in third is 97 points behind Piastri \u2014 to set up an intra-team title fight through the remainder of the season.\nMcLaren therefore has the chance to clinch a first title double since 1998, when Mika H\u00e4kkinen won the drivers\u2019 championship. It has pulled clear of rivals including Ferrari and Red Bull going into the final season of the current F1 technical regulations.\nSpeaking in November, Brown was eager to emphasize the importance of the McLaren brand regardless of its on-track fortunes, and how that would continue to appeal to sponsors and partners.\n\u201cOne of the things when I got started at McLaren was being able to lean into the power of the McLaren brand coming back,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s very important. Given (Mastercard\u2019s) portfolio in sports (including sponsoring the UEFA Champions League), they will be well aware that you have good years, bad years. But you\u2019re always going to have the McLaren fans. And we\u2019re here to win.\u201d\nRegardless, the profile boost offered by a team at the very top of F1 would have made the prospect of a title partnership increasingly appealing to Mastercard, ensuring its name and logo would accompany much success for at least F1\u2019s short-term future. McLaren\u2019s rise would also have made any potential deal more lucrative for the team, making this an ideal time to strike an agreement.\nAdvertisement\nF1 team naming rights have proven increasingly attractive to companies involved in finance and banking. Revolut will also be a title sponsor in F1 next year with Audi, which is taking over the Sauber team.\nMastercard does have history in F1 prior to its latest foray in the sport with McLaren. The short-lived Mastercard Lola team planned to race in 1997, only to fail to qualify for the season-opening round in Australia. When it then collapsed financially, Mastercard spent four seasons sponsoring the Jordan team, which these days races as Aston.\n(Top image: Clive Rose/Getty Images)"
