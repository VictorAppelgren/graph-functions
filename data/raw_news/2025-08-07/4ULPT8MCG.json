  "title": "RFK Jr.'s vow to overhaul vaccine injury program echoes grievances of anti-vaccine movement",
  "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is vowing to \u201cfix\u201d the federal program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines, opening the door to \u2026",
  "content": "In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program \u201chas taken a hard line\u201d against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Approximately 70% of the Gardasil cases against Merck started as claims filed by Downing in the federal injury program, according to court records. A judge dismissed more than 120 of those cases, citing \u201ca paucity of evidence\u201d that Gardasil caused patients\u2019 problems. A spokesman for Kennedy declined to comment on Downing\u2019s hiring. Kennedy himself has been involved in the Gardasil litigation, as both an attorney and consultant. Before joining the government, Kennedy received payments for referring potential Gardasil clients to Wisner Baum, one of the law firms suing Merck. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to \u201ca nondependent, adult son,\u201d according to his financial disclosures. One of Kennedy\u2019s sons is an attorney at Wisner Baum. Experts see need for reform Experts who study vaccine compensation say real changes are needed to modernize the 40-year-old program. The cap on compensation remains $250,000 for injury or death, the same as in 1986. Similarly, the program still has eight adjudicators, known as special masters, to review all cases before the government. On average, the process takes two to three years. The fund has paid out $5.4 billion, compensating about 40% of all people who filed claims. The U.S. has an \u201cethical obligation\u201d to promptly pay those harmed by government-recommended vaccines, says Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. \u201cPlus, I think it increases trust in the vaccination program if you have quick, generous compensation,\u201d Reiss said. As health secretary, Kennedy has broad powers to reshape the program. One approach could be adding new diseases and illnesses to the government table of payable injuries. In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children\u2019s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link. Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm \u2014 perhaps from a large autism study he\u2019s commissioned \u2014 and add the condition to the program. In response, the federal government might have to increase taxes on vaccines to replenish the compensation fund, which would make the shots more expensive and less accessible. \u201cThen you will start to watch the vaccine program infrastructure in this country disintegrate until someone steps in,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who has clashed with Kennedy for years. A recent Senate hearing titled \u201cVoice of the Vaccine Injured\u201d appeared to make the case for expanding the program. Witnesses included two representatives from Children\u2019s Health Defense, the nonprofit group that Kennedy previously chaired and has repeatedly sued the government over vaccines. The group\u2019s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son\u2019s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.",

      "text": "Opinion: For a trade deal tomorrow, sacrifice these two dinosaurs\nWe won't get a deal until we bring something to the table. In our own interest we should axe supply management and auto sector subsidies\nIt\u2019s no surprise that five months after the Trump tariffs hit Canada, we still don\u2019t have a trade deal. With no cards to play, Canada sits impotent at the table. Having brought only a large bowl of sour grapes to the talks, we face the prospect of a bad situation only getting worse as Trump tightens the screws. Until Canada is ready to give something up in exchange for a tariff-free relationship, our position will continue to weaken, bringing irreparable, long-term commercial and political disadvantage.\nTo review: nothing happened at the much-anticipated Donald Trump-Mark Carney Oval Office meeting in early May. Nothing happened at the G7 in Kananaskis in June. And nothing happened before the Aug. 1 deadline. Now it\u2019s \u201c35 per cent, baby.\u201d\nInstead of stubbornly clinging to a lopsided wish list that would benefit only us, let\u2019s cut a deal built on a meaningful exchange of considerations. To get something from Trump we need to offer him something he wants. That\u2019s not the \u201cart of the deal.\u201d It\u2019s the definition of deal-making \u2014 a concept that so far has eluded Ottawa\u2019s brain trust. The art of the deal is balancing value, clout and leverage for good outcomes. We could try that, too.\nAt the moment, there\u2019s no evidence Ottawa has an end game in sight. To date, it\u2019s been either elbows up, a news cycle of aggression, a news cycle of patience, or jerry-rigging assorted clever counter-tariffs. Ontario\u2019s needless cancellation of Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink only adds more bitterness to an already nasty brew.\nSo far none of our maneuvers have worked, mainly because of our governments\u2019 myopic misunderstanding of who sits across the table. Everything else having failed, the pitiful mess that is Canada\u2019s tariff policy must now turn to an out-of-the-box solution.\nWe need to face facts about auto assembly and supply management. So far, we have sidelined these sacred dinosaurs for fear of backlash from their keepers. But nothing is strategically dumber than keeping them off the table. By now it should be obvious that until we bring them out of the shadows, no tariff deal is possible. In our own interest, it\u2019s time to sacrifice these two industries that are directly responsible for higher prices and taxes (to finance \u201cinvestments\u201d). Erasing them will clear the way for economic optimization on both sides of the border and stop our endless, economically draining fealty to powerfully entrenched but essentially fringe interests.\n- Terence Corcoran: Making a case for Donald Trump\u2019s import tax\n- Matthew Lau: Milton Friedman\u2019s birthday was a big deal for think-tanks\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe two have grazed long enough on our pocketbooks. Their sacrifice very likely will bring long-term tariff peace that will spawn a broad range of mutual advantages. There will be a political fuss \u2014 no doubt of that. But it will be up to our prime minister to manage a transition for Canada\u2019s greater good by eliminating economic models no longer viable in a global economy undergoing massive rationalization.\nIn an exercise Trump almost certainly will respect, our ex-central banker can sign a deal that serves all our industries, including the many that are not verging on extinction.\nMichael Nitefor is founder and president of Toronto-based Air Lab, Inc.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Trans Mountain pipeline delivers $12.6 billion in new revenue to oilpatch, windfall to governments: report\nBut any new export pipeline may not bring the same kinds of financial benefits\nThe Trans Mountain pipeline \u2014 finished years behind schedule and massively over-budget \u2014 has delivered an estimated $12.6 billion in new revenues to the Canadian oilpatch and padded government budgets, according to a new report.\nStill, the report by the financial group Alberta Central says any new export pipeline that might be built under Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2018s nation-building infrastructure agenda would not likely bring in a similar windfall.\nThe expanded Trans Mountain pipe that stretches from Alberta to the British Columbia coast, which came into service in May 2024, has significantly boosted market access for Canadian oil and raised prices for the country\u2019s producers, the report suggests.\n\u201cWhether these benefits justify the $34 billion in cost is likely to remain a source of debate for many years to come, (but) our analysis suggests that the benefits from TMX will outweigh the costs in the long run,\u201d Charles St-Arnaud, Alberta Central\u2019s chief economist, said in the report.\nThe federal government under Justin Trudeau bought the Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5 billion in 2018, but the price tag for the expansion later ballooned to $34 billion. And while it was the first new pipeline to the west coast in 70 years, it was finished six years behind schedule.\nStill, economists like St-Arnaud and the University of Calgary\u2019s Trevor Tombe have argued it was worth every penny.\nTrans Mountain has increased Canadian oil shipments to refineries in the United States and more than tripled the share of exports to countries abroad, including China. This expanded market access has allowed Canadian oil producers to fetch higher prices.\nThe country\u2019s heavy oil trades at a discount partly because the costs of refining it are higher. In recent years, the discount against North American prices expanded even more because there weren\u2019t enough pipelines, leading to an oversupply.\n- Ottawa may not want to get out of the pipeline business just yet: Trans Mountain CEO\n- 'Northern Leg' to Trans Mountain pipeline attracts interest amid brewing trade war\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe Trans Mountain expansion, which nearly tripled the pipeline\u2019s capacity, has helped to ease that pressure and shave the discount to levels that are well below historical norms. As a result, the Alberta Central report suggests the pipeline boosted overall oilpatch revenues by $12.6 billion, an estimate that does not account for increased production made possible by the expansion.\nThe lift in prices is also expected to boost tax and royalty windfalls for the federal and provincial governments. Alberta could bring in $5.4 billion in additional funds, which would account for almost seven per cent of the province\u2019s revenues for the 2024-25 fiscal year, according to the report.\nWhile the Trudeau government approved the pipeline project, the Liberals had also ushered in a spate of new policies that expanded environmental regulations and were widely seen in Alberta and Saskatchewan as hostile to the energy sector.\nThe Carney government is promising a change in tone with an agenda that favours oil and gas development. The prime minister has said a new oil export pipeline is \u201chighly likely\u201d to make a list of so-called nation-building projects that would receive much faster approvals from the federal government.\nStill, any new pipe may not bring the same kinds of financial benefits as Trans Mountain. A theoretical project \u2014 no private-sector proponent has come forward with a proposal \u2014 would not likely lead to even higher prices, according to the Alberta Central report. Instead, it would prevent Canadian prices from falling as companies produce more oil.\nAlready, there are signs that the country\u2019s pipeline capacity may not be keeping pace with a rise in crude production. The energy analytics firm RBN Energy said in a recent note that the oilpatch could face bottlenecks within the next three years.\n\u201cThings only get harder from here, because we don\u2019t have additional pipeline capacity coming on now, and the pipeline capacity that we do have, we\u2019re only going to keep filling it,\u201d said Rory Johnston, publisher of oil market research report Commodity Context.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to run into pricing pressure earlier than you\u2019d think.\u201d\n\u2022 Email: rsouthwick@postmedia.com\nWith files from Meghan Potkins\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "Air Canada offers 32.5% increase for flight attendants in contract talks\nSource says airline also agreed to pay workers for some of the time they spend on the ground\nAir Canada offered its flight attendants an overall increase of more than 30 per cent over four years ahead of a potential strike, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.\nThe union representing the airline\u2019s more than 10,000 flight attendants announced Tuesday that its members voted 99.7 per cent to strike, putting them in a legal position to walk off the job as soon as Aug. 16. Airlines usually begin winding down operations and canceling flights days before a potential labour disruption.\nAir Canada proposed to increase total compensation, including benefits and bonuses, by about 20 per cent in the first year of a contract and a total of 32.5 per cent over four years, said the person, speaking on condition they not be identified in order to speak about private talks.\nThe airline also agreed to pay workers for some of the time they spend on the ground \u2014 a request made by the union. Currently, Air Canada flight attendants are only paid when the aircraft is in motion, a common practice in the industry, but one which is increasingly being challenged.\n\u201cThe company has never presented this offer to the union,\u201d Nathalie Garceau, a spokesperson for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said by email. \u201cIf this indeed what the company plans to present when we resume negotiations on Friday, we look forward to discussing it then.\u201d\nLast month, United Airlines Holdings Inc.\u2019s flight attendants rejected a contract providing cumulative pay increases of as much as 45.6 per cent over five years \u2014 the agents would have been paid while passengers were boarding. Delta Air Lines Inc. became the first U.S. airline to pay them during this period.\nAir Canada and the union failed to reach an agreement during a two-month conciliation process that ended in July.

Workers at Air Canada Rouge, the company\u2019s budget brand, earn less.\nThe union\u2019s president, Wesley Lesosky, said in a statement Tuesday that Air Canada is \u201cexploiting their own employees by severely underpaying flight attendants or refusing to pay them at all for safety-critical aspects of our jobs.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the airline said: \u201cOut of respect for the negotiation process, we do not comment on what each party may or may not have offered at the negotiation table.\u201d\nLast year, Air Canada\u2019s pilots got a compensation increase of 42 per cent over four years in a last-minute deal, averting a strike that would have grounded more than 1,000 daily flights worldwide. That agreement was reached after a wave of substantial pay increases for pilots across North America.\nThe airline paid $4.9 billion in wages, salaries and benefits last year, representing about 23 per cent of operating costs. It posted an operating income of $1.26 billion, or about 5.7 per cent of revenue.\n\u2014 With assistance from Mary Schlangenstein.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

      "text": "IMF warns of rising risks in Canada's financial system despite bank resilience\nRising household debt, mortgage renewals and gaps in oversight could expose vulnerabilities in the years ahead, report says\nCanada\u2019s financial system remains broadly resilient despite mounting economic uncertainty, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its latest assessment \u2014 but warned that rising household debt, mortgage renewals and gaps in cyber and pension oversight could expose vulnerabilities in the years ahead.\nIn its 2025 Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA), the IMF said Canada\u2019s big banks, insurers and pension funds are well-capitalized and capable of withstanding major economic shocks.\nHowever, the report flagged growing risks tied to a wave of upcoming mortgage renewals, high household debt levels and a lack of coordination among financial regulators \u2014 including the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), the Bank of Canada and provincial authorities \u2014 in responding to systemic threats such as cyberattacks, housing market shocks and climate-related disruptions.\nFor the banking and financial sector, the report said \u201ctotal assets of financial institutions reached 756 per cent of GDP in 2024, increasing by 43.3 per cent since 2019.\u201d Non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) have become a dominant force in the sector, now accounting for 65 per cent of total assets.\nSince the last IMF review in 2019, the NBFI sector has expanded significantly, with investment fund assets growing from $2.6 trillion in 2020 to $3 trillion in 2023 \u2014 roughly 110 per cent of GDP. Canada\u2019s insurance market ranked ninth globally in terms of written premiums, according to the report.\nPension funds continue to play an outsized role, holding $2.2 trillion in assets in 2023, or about 75 per cent of GDP \u2014 one of the largest pension sectors in the G7.\nThe IMF notes that while NBFIs remained resilient, data gaps and inconsistent oversight remain concerns, particularly for large pension plans. The sector has grown in size and importance since the 2019 assessment but regulatory coordination has not kept pace.\n- Cuts to Canada's growth 'stand out' in latest IMF economic outlook\n- Canada set to be fastest growing economy in G7 in 2025, IMF forecasts\n- Advertisement embed-more-topicStory continues below\nThe report said the banking sector\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is 13 per cent. The CET1 ratio measures a bank\u2019s core capital relative to its risk-weighted assets, indicating its ability to absorb losses. A higher ratio signals strong financial health and compliance with global regulatory standards.\nA 13 per cent CET1 ratio indicates that Canadian banks are well-capitalized \u2014 significantly above the international regulatory minimum of 4.5 per cent, and even above the commonly recommended levels of around 10\u201311 per cent. This gives them a strong buffer to absorb losses in times of economic stress.\nThe report raised concerns about the real estate market in Canada. \u201cAs of December 2024, approximately 60 per cent of mortgages will renew by 2026 at likely higher rates, which could increase payment burdens and delinquencies if economic conditions deteriorate,\u201d it said.\nCanada has the highest household debt-to-GDP ratio among G7 countries, a key vulnerability flagged by the IMF. While it reflects strong credit access and homeownership, it also leaves households \u2014 and the broader economy \u2014 more exposed to rising interest rates, job losses or housing market downturns.\nOn the positive side, the report noted Canada\u2019s mortgage delinquency rate stood at just 0.2 per cent in December 2024 \u2014 well below historical norms \u2014 suggesting most homeowners still managed to keep up with their payments despite rising rates in the last cycle.\nUnder the IMF\u2019s 2025 adverse scenario, mortgage default rates are projected to rise to 0.9 per cent for uninsured loans and 1.4 per cent for insured loans, while corporate defaults could climb from 0.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent by 2027 \u2014 posing sharper risks than anticipated in 2019.\nThe report also warned that broader geoeconomic tensions \u2014 global conflict, shifting trade policies, reduced labour mobility and weak financial systems \u2014 posed a high risk to Canada\u2019s economic outlook.\nOther emerging threats include cyber-attacks, climate change and a potential housing market correction. The IMF flags cyber risks as high, noting they could disrupt payment systems and undermine financial institutions\u2019 ability to function.\nClimate-related disasters, such as wildfires and floods, carry medium-level risk, potentially triggering credit and liquidity stress. A sharp decline in home prices could drive up loan-to-value ratios, raise unemployment and curb household spending and investor confidence.\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the challenges faced by the U.S. vaccine injury compensation program, particularly in relation to Gardasil cases against Merck, highlighting the dismissal of many claims due to insufficient evidence. Experts advocate for reforms to modernize the program, which has not changed its compensation cap since 1986. The article also touches on the implications of potential changes under Health Secretary Kennedy, who has a controversial history with vaccine litigation, and the broader impact on public trust in vaccination programs.",
