  "content": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) \u2014 Broncos edge rusher Nik Bonitto missed a joint practice Thursday with Arizona as he recovers from a bone spur removed from the top of his foot.\n\nBonitto, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract, could return to the field next week. His recent procedure left him with three stitches in his foot, coach Sean Payton said after practice on a sweltering day at the Broncos\u2019 team facility.\n\n\u201cIt just made a lot of sense,\u201d Payton said of taking care of the bone spur now rather than trying to manage it through the regular season.\n\nBonitto appears to be next in line for a new contract after the Broncos finalized deals for receiver Courtland Sutton and defensive lineman Zach Allen. Asked if his star pass rusher\u2019s absence had anything to do with his contract, Payton opened up about Bonitto\u2019s bone-spur issue \u2014 and his own.\n\n\u201cI had two spurs removed on my big toe, and that hurt like you know what,\u201d Payton said. \u201cI\u2019m still recovering. It\u2019s better. His is something that we just had done, and we knew that he was going to miss this week.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be up and at it next week. He\u2019s been fantastic. The days he\u2019s missed has been this simple bone spur in a unique spot on the top of the foot. It\u2019s not weight bearing.\u201d\n\nBonitto is coming off a season in which he was named second-team All-Pro after leading the team with 13 1/2 sacks.\n\nThe Broncos practiced with the Cardinals on a day when temperatures soared into the high 90s. Left tackle Garett Bolles left practice due asthma and breathing issues.\n\n\u201cWe just pulled him out,\u201d Payton said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nPayton also said fullback Michael Burton was dealing with a hamstring ailment.\n\nIt\u2019s the second straight week the Broncos have taken part in a joint practice. That\u2019s why Payton said he\u2019s going to sit most of the starters in Saturday\u2019s preseason game against the Cardinals, including quarterback Bo Nix.\n\nHis plan is to play the starters for roughly 10 plays in the final preseason game on Aug. 23 at New Orleans.\n\nNotes: Payton said tight end Nate Adkins will miss some time in the regular season after undergoing a procedure on his ankle. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any other things that they noticed,\u201d Payton said. \u201cIt was a smart decision.\u201d",

      "text": "Brian Schottenheimer credits time with Pete Carroll in helping become a more well-rounded coach\nBrian Schottenheimer credits time with Pete Carroll in helping become a more well-rounded coach\nOXNARD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The tactical part of football came easy to Brian Schottenheimer, but the other aspects of what it takes to be a head coach had to be developed before finally getting the opportunity he always wanted with the Dallas Cowboys this season.\nThe philosophical, organizational and interpersonal pieces came to him during and after Schottenheimer\u2019s three-season stint as offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks under then-coach Pete Carroll, which in turn set the stage for the 51-year-old Schottenheimer to get his chance.\nThe foundation was set when Schottenheimer arrived in Seattle. Carroll recognized Schottenheimer, the son of longtime NFL head coach Marty Schottenheimer, knew how to draw up an offensive scheme.\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018But do you really know what you believe in?\u2019 Like, he challenged me, I think it was the first day he hired me,\u201d Brian Schottenheimer said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Do you really know what you believe in, and what a practice should look like, and what the identity of your defense should look like, and, you know, what\u2019s the practice going to look like?\u2019 And I just kind of paused, and I was like, \u2018Man.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018I can\u2019t answer that right now, I guess I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d\nSchottenheimer had long desired to become the youngest head coach in the league. After being named the offensive coordinator for the New York Jets in 2006, he admits to being overly focused on trying to build an offense so prolific that someone would have to hire him for a top job.\nThere had been some solid moments in his time with the Jets under Eric Mangini and Rex Ryan, less so with the Rams under Jeff Fisher in St. Louis. It took Carroll\u2019s approach to get Schottenheimer to realize the other components off the field are just as important to success as being a great play caller.\n\u201cI mean, Jeff was a fun-loving players\u2019 coach. Rex was a wild man, in a good way. Eric Mangini was very much like coach (Bill) Belichick. My dad was certainly, you know, a certain way. I chuckle on that one,\u201d Schottenheimer said.\n\u201cBut I just think, when I watched Pete, and I was sitting in the meetings, and whether was a staff meeting or a team meeting, there was just so many things that I was like, \u2018You know what, I do believe that.\u2019\u201d\nCarroll\u2019s relentless desire to create competition was an aspect that particularly captivated Schottenheimer. The phrase, \u201cCompete every day,\u201d was seen and heard throughout Cowboys training camp, and with no set depth chart, Schottenheimer looked to make sure players are rewarded in practice when they rise to that aim. There are also battles off the field, with basketball a particular favorite during the summer stint in Southern California.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a competitor, whether I\u2019m good at something or not, I\u2019m going to try to find a way to win. I don\u2019t always find a way to win, but I\u2019m going to try. And so I think he caught me at the right time,\u201d Schottenheimer said of Carroll.\nSchottenheimer also felt the consequences of Carroll\u2019s demanding pursuit of excellence. Despite overseeing three straight top-10 scoring offenses during his time in Seattle from 2018-20, Schottenheimer was fired in January 2021 over \u201cphilosophical differences.\u201d\nDuring an extensive self-debrief following his dismissal in an effort to determine his next step, Schottenheimer tried to figure out what mattered most to him. Schottenheimer found himself looking back on his time as a college quarterback when Florida won the national championship in 1996.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember the exact score of the (Sugar Bowl) game when we beat Florida State. I don\u2019t remember the score of the game, the first game of the year. But I remember times in the locker room, hanging out with my teammates, James Bates, Lawrence Wright, Sammy McCorkle, you know, Ike Hilliard. I remember that,\u201d Schottenheimer said.\nThat led Schottenheimer to work on building better relationships, including when he became Cowboys offensive coordinator in 2023 after spending a year as an analyst, and it has become an even greater emphasis after being named head coach on Jan. 24.\nBranching out\nAfter spending his career being locked in on one side of the ball, Schottenheimer has gone out of his way to get to know every player. He has extended that directive to the entire coaching staff, making it a point to have offensive coaches interact with defensive players during warmups and vice versa.\n\u201cSometimes, especially as an offensive line coach, it\u2019s very easy that you get very tribal, and tribal meaning just (be) with that group,\u201d first-year assistant Conor Riley said. \u201cHis encouragement in asking us to go build those relationships, and now when I\u2019m seeing guys in the hall, they\u2019re just not a face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s, you know, how much do we work with the defensive backs? I love going over there, tapping those guys up every day, saying a short message to them very briefly. And it really builds that connection within the football team.\u201d\nThose aren\u2019t the only steps Schottenheimer has taken in an effort to build a collective effort. He mostly bypasses 7-on-7 passing drills and other specialized work to instead highlight periods that require all 22 players, with his distaste for throwing without a pass rush coming from personal experience.\n\u201cReally, the biggest thing is the game is such a team game,\u201d Schottenheimer said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve always felt like \u2014 and maybe because I was actually pretty good in 7-on-7 back in college when I was a (expletive) quarterback \u2014 it\u2019s just such an easy drill. I mean, you\u2019re like, \u2018Ah, he\u2019s open. He\u2019s open. OK, nobody\u2019s open, but nobody\u2019s rushing me, so, like, OK, what do I do now?\u2019 It\u2019s just not realistic.\u201d\nAll those touches are why special teams coordinator Nick Sorensen, who is working with Schottenheimer for the third time, is confident he\u2019s ready for this moment.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt like that was his role, you know, in being around him,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cAnd you see certain guys and the way that they carry themselves, in the way that they coach. And you just, I saw it in him, whether I was in Seattle or whether I was in Jacksonville with him, I knew that this was the next step. And I felt like he\u2019s been ready for this for a long time, and he\u2019s gotten this opportunity, he\u2019s been outstanding.\u201d\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"

Stroud reunite at joint practice, reflect on NFL journeys\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Bryce Young and C.J. Stroud will be forever linked after the quarterbacks were taken first and second, respectively, in the 2023 NFL draft.\nBut long before they became NFL stars, the two California natives became friends when they competed in both football and basketball in middle school.\nOn Thursday, the two reunited when Stroud\u2019s Houston Texans hosted Young\u2019s Carolina Panthers for a joint practice ahead of Saturday\u2019s preseason game.\nThe quarterbacks were all business during drills, with both players making some nice throws during the two-hour workout. Afterward, they took some time to catch up and chat.\n\u201cTo see where he\u2019s at right now, I\u2019m super proud of him. It means a lot,\u201d Young said. \u201cI\u2019m always rooting for him. That\u2019s my guy. When practice is going, I\u2019m rooting for our defense. I\u2019m hoping we make every play. That\u2019s all that matters. But before and after I try not to take it for granted, us being able to live our dreams and be here. It\u2019s special.\u201d\nStroud said the two never specifically talked about their NFL dreams together as children but said competing against Young at such a young age made him a better player.\n\u201cWhen we focus on like the NFL or the NBA, it\u2019s hard to do because (at that age) there\u2019s so many people trying for that,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cBut like me and him, I feel like our process was just getting better, getting better, getting better, getting better. So, I think that was our mindset and it\u2019s cool to be in these moments.\u201d\nThe Panthers were criticized in 2023 for selecting Young, who struggled as a rookie as the team went 2-15. Meanwhile, Stroud led Houston to the postseason after a three-year absence and was named AP Offensive Rookie of the Year.\nNeither player likes talking about the what-ifs when it comes to that draft, and Young insisted Thursday that he\u2019s happy with how things turned out.\n\u201cI\u2019m exactly where I\u2019m supposed to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure C.J. would say the same thing. God doesn\u2019t make mistakes. Everything happens for a reason. So, I\u2019m super grateful to be a Panther.\u201d\nAs their NFL careers have blossomed, Stroud and Young have remained close. Young was asked to describe the best thing about Stroud as a friend.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him have ups and downs,\u201d Young said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him have so much success at this level (and) throughout all that he\u2019s been the exact same person ... and I know a lot of people on this team and everyone tells me how great of a leader he is, how much he means for this team, offense, the entire team, entire unit, the person he is. So, I think just his ability to be that same person, regardless of what his circumstances are is one of the things that I admire most.\u201d\nStroud also praised Young\u2019s consistency as a friend and lauded him for the improvement he showed last season.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a heck of a player, one of the best players I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cAnd I just think he needs some help around him too. But I\u2019m just really proud of that guy, just the same way he said about me, for every up and down, every valley and peak he\u2019s stayed the same guy, stayed loyal and stayed a friend and brother, so very appreciative.\u201d\nWhile Stroud has had much more success so far after taking Houston to the playoffs in each of his two seasons, he remains irked that one of Carolina\u2019s two wins in 2023 came against the Texans and hopes to have a rematch with Young one day.\n\u201cHe beat me my rookie year, still don\u2019t like that,\u201d Stroud said. \u201cWhen we cross those lines, we\u2019re competitive, we want to do well and see our teams win. So hopefully we get to match up next year or maybe in the Super Bowl or something. I don\u2019t know. But don\u2019t put that on ESPN, I know how y\u2019all do.\u201d\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"

(AP) \u2014 Like teammate Courtland Sutton, Denver Broncos All-Pro defensive lineman Zach Allen didn\u2019t skip any days of training camp while his agent argued for a new contract.\nUnlike Micah Parsons in Dallas, Trey Hendrickson in Cincinnati and Terry McLaurin in Washington, things never got contentious with the front office in Denver.\n\u201cThis is my happy place,\u201d Allen said Saturday after signing a four-year, $102 million extension with the Broncos that includes nearly $70 million in guarantees and makes him one of the NFL\u2019s highest-paid interior defensive linemen in average annual salary.\nAllen said the way both sides \u201chandled this was just awesome.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that we were able to go about this the way we have compared to probably some other things around the league is a testament to what we\u2019re building,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business but it never got contentious,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAnd I think that was a cool thing was just the way that everybody handled it.\u201d\nAllen said he told his agent, Tommy Condon, \u201cI want to obviously get the best deal possible ... but I care about these people, I care about this place, and I don\u2019t want it to get ugly. The way he went about it, the way the team went about it was awesome.\u201d\nAllen\u2019s extension came less than a week after Sutton signed a four-year, $92 million deal that features $41 million in guaranteed money. Sutton also thanked the Broncos\u2019 ownership group and general manager George Paton for the tenor of talks as he continued to take the field during training camp content in knowing a deal was at hand.\nIn many ways Allen has served as the fulcrum of Denver\u2019s dominant defense the last two seasons, applying pressure up the middle to augment the Broncos\u2019 premier pass rush and stellar secondary.\nA third-round pick by Arizona out of Boston College in 2019, Allen joined the Broncos two years ago, following defensive coordinator Vance Joseph to Denver. He had five sacks in his first season in Denver and a career-best 8 1/2 sacks last season when he earned second-team All-Pro honors and the Broncos set a franchise record with a league-best 63 sacks.\nAllen, who turns 28 this month, also set career bests last year with 15 tackles for loss and 40 quarterback hits while playing nearly 90% of Denver\u2019s defensive snaps and moving between end and tackle. He also led the league\u2019s defensive tackles with 67 pressures, according to Next Gen Stats.\nAllen is due $12.74 million this season, the final year of his three-year, $45.75 million deal he signed with Denver in 2023.\nWith deals in place now for Sutton and Allen, the Broncos\u2019 biggest contractual concern is rising star edge rusher Nik Bonitto, who is entering the final year of his rookie contrac. He also was named a second-team All-Pro last season when he led the team with 13 1/2 sacks.\nBefore camp began, Bonitto said he realized a deal might not get done until sometime during the season but knows he\u2019ll cash in eventually.\n\u201cYeah, I mean, the edge market is kind of crazy right now knowing that everybody\u2019s getting these big deals and it\u2019s only getting bigger and bigger,\u201d Bonitto said last month. \u201cLuckily for me, I\u2019m in a good position right now where the market\u2019s kind of in my favor.\u201d\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"
