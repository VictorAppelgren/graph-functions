  "title": "What Is The Apple Pencil's Hover Feature & How Does It Work?",
  "description": "The Apple Pencil is an extension of your iPad, and it has handy features such as hover. Here's what the feature is and how you can take advantage of it.",
  "content": "What Is The Apple Pencil's Hover Feature & How Does It Work?\n\nImagine bringing a stylus close to a tablet's screen, and before the tip even makes contact, you see which pen tool is selected, the width of the brush stroke, and the opacity level, as well. Or, when the Apple Pencil is hovering over the screen while a Keynote slide is open, you get a preview of the menu options before actually tapping on them. Well, that's essentially what the Apple Pencil hover feature is all about. In general, a stylus input is only recorded on a screen as it makes physical contact with the tip and slides across the X and Y axes. With hover, the display-stylus duo also responds along the Z axis without requiring physical contact. Apple won't be the first to implement this unique touch-less interaction system, as Wacom's drawing tablets have offered it for years. Aside from being integrated within Apple's in-house apps such as Pages and Keynote, the hover system is also available across third-party apps such as Procreate and AstroPad Studio. And if you own the Apple Pencil Pro, you can even check the angle of the brush stroke and adjust it in hover mode, thanks to support for the barrel roll system. Sounds appealing so far? Well, make sure you have a supported Apple tablet on your lap, or table, a list that includes the iPad Pro 11-inch (4th generation) and iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) with Apple Pencil (2nd generation). If you have an Apple Pencil Pro, the hover function will work with the iPad Air 11-inch and 13-inch (M2 and M3 processor), iPad Pro 11-inch and 13-inch (M4 processor), and the iPad Mini 2024 with the A17 Pro processor.\n\nWhy is it a godsend? The core idea behind the hover gesture is to give users a precise idea of exactly where the pen input will begin registering on the screen as they are about to start writing, sketching, or illustrating on a canvas. So, if you are working on a large multi-layer canvas, it becomes extremely important to know just where the free brush stroke will begin and how large or small it will be. This gives you a clear look at whether you will need to make any adjustments before the Apple Pencil touches the screen. At the moment, Apple Pencil Pro, second-gen Apple Pencil, and the Apple Pencil USB-C support the hover gesture. Now, as far as the implementation goes, it will vary depending on the app you are using. Moreover, it can be implemented in a variety of apps, though drawing and sketching apps have taken the lead in implementing it owing to the obvious benefits. For example, it can show the tool that is currently set for on-screen action with the stylus (with other details such as width, opacity, or stroke type), open menu items, show a preview of the action before it appears on the screen, and more. It's like a shortcut system that activates as soon as the Apple Pencil gets close to the iPad's screen. For artistic work, it's a godsend. \"The ability to not make a commitment or damage the artwork is transformative,\" Procreate chief, James Cuda, told Apple, adding that the new feature has left a profound impact.\n\n\"A hover gesture recognizer reacts when a pointer from a pointing device such as Apple Pencil moves over a user-interface element,\" explains Apple in a technical support document to help developers implement it in its app. On the technical side, enabling the hover gesture for the Apple Pencil requires adapting a gesture recognizer and a coalesced touch system for touch-based inputs to ensure a smoother drawing experience. The final step is creating a path point system for sending the stroke and rendering the stylus input accordingly on the touch canvas. The overarching idea is for the system to generate a visual preview of the stylus movement in a person's hand before the tip touches the touch-sensitive screen. Technically, the hover gesture can be enabled when the pencil tip is up to 12 millimeters away from the display, and goes as close as 1-millimeter before physical contact happens. Interestingly, the preview of the hover gesture that you see on the screen is sensitive to the distance between the stylus and the panel. The preview can be smaller if the Apple Pencil is further from the screen, and it increases in size as the tip comes closer to the display. Additionally, the hover preview doesn't simply appear and disappear. On the contrary, there's a fade offset technique involved that also adjusts the transparency of the hover preview on the screen, as it goes from partial to opaque. Depending on the on-screen UI element above which the pencil tip is currently hovering, the hover system can also be configured to activate animations or open menu items, as is the case with the Procreate app.",

      "text": "Apple iPad Pro 2022 Review: M2 Heart But Hover Steals The Show\nThe \"pro\" In Apple's iPad Pro has always been tricky to define, ever since the flagship tablet debuted all the way back in 2015. Whether designed for professionals or prosumers, the question of just what you can, cannot, and could reasonably expect to do from Apple's tablet has left users divided, either ready to give up their laptops and desktops in favor of a more flexible slate or still bemoaning shortcomings that typically hinge more on what the software allows you to do than anything else.\nAsk the cynic, meanwhile, and they might simply point to the fact that \u2014 like the MacBook Pro \u2014 these are the most expensive models in the line-up. With MacBook Pro-like pricing, iPad Pro ownership is no casual step. For 2022, then, Apple sweetens the deal with the same chipset as its most recent laptops, not to mention more involved and intuitive ways by which the tablet interacts with its key accessories.\nPlenty of iPad Pro overlap\nSome of the iPad Pro recipe has stayed the same, and I can't really fault Apple for that. The 12.9-inch Liquid Retina XDR display remains one of the best panels around: bright, color-rich, and generally enough to make you look at every other screen in your life with unbridled scorn. The 11-inch model sticks with the Liquid Retina display that doesn't get the mini-LED backlight magic.\nThe cameras, meanwhile, are also carried over. That means a 12-megapixel wide and 10-megapixel ultra-wide on the rear, along with the LiDAR Scanner. The front keeps the TrueDepth camera that powers Face ID, but where the 2022 iPad's selfie camera has been shifted to the landscape edge, the iPad Pro's remains at the top of the portrait edge.\nI suspect that's a packaging issue \u2014 TrueDepth does have a few more sensors than a regular camera \u2014 but it's a shame, as I typically find myself using the iPad Pro in landscape orientation. That's particularly the case with the MacBook Air-like Magic Keyboard \u2014 a still-expensive $299 option that frustratingly lacks the dedicated function key row Apple added to its new Magic Keyboard for the 2022 iPad \u2014 which more often than not I have attached. I really like Apple's Center Stage, which keeps you in the middle of the frame during video calls, but I wish the camera itself was positioned a little more centrally to make where I'm staring look entirely natural.\nBaked-in 5G is welcome\nPhysical connectivity remains the same as the last-gen iPad Pro, too, with a USB-C connector that supports Thunderbolt and USB 4. I can't fault Apple's audio, either, with the four speakers spread around the iPad Pro being more than capable when it comes to video \u2014 even if, for the most part, I used Bluetooth earbuds (sadly, no, there's still no 3.5mm headphones port).\nApple has added Wi-Fi 6E this year \u2014 something still missing from the MacBook range \u2014 and there's the option of integrated 5G. Like the iPhone 14, Apple is using eSIM alone for its cellular connectivity. Unlike the iPhone 14, however, it's much easier to access roaming data plans from the iPad Pro, since you can choose them directly from the tablet. I just wish stepping up to 5G wasn't so expensive.\nBattery life is the same 10-hour promise that Apple has been making for some generations now. In practice, with 5G active, I found that was a reasonable estimate.\niPadOS 16.1 brings iPad Pro even closer to Mac\nOut of the box, the iPad Pro runs iPadOS 16.1, and Apple is adding further distance between its iPhone and iPad versions of the software. Widgets and new versions of Mail, Safari, and other native apps are pretty familiar at this point. However, it's the updates to things like multitasking that stand out.\nIt's fair to say that multitasking has been a long-standing point of frustration for many iPad users, myself included. If you're used to how the process works on a Mac \u2014 or, for that matter, on any desktop computer \u2014 then iPadOS' combination of swipes, gestures, split-screen layouts, and the like may well have felt like a complex answer to the question of app windows. Now, we have Stage Manager to try to tame the process.\nI've ended up thinking about Stage Manager as a combination of macOS virtual desktops and app-switcher thumbnails. The idea is that you have your \u2014 automatically organized \u2014 recent apps and documents running along the left edge of the screen, and then tap between which gets maximized. There's (finally) support for having several windows visible at once, and for resizing them.\nStage Manager has promise, but still feels clunky in places\nHow well it works depends on, well, how you work. When I sat down to write a car review on the iPad Pro, being able to quickly jump between my copy in Pages, the photos I'd imported, a spec sheet, my notes, and the automaker's website was neat. It felt, in fact, pretty close to how I do the same thing on Mac, and the experience got even more impressive when I plugged in an external display (the iPad Pro can drive up to a 6K monitor).\nI'm not so convinced that users of some of the desktop-level (or near-desktop-level) apps for video editing, sound production, or graphic design will be so enamored. Those are apps that really make the most sense maximized in full-screen view. Anything that reduces the size of the interface feels like a non-starter. The problem here is that it's really those sorts of prosumers that the new iPad Pro is likely to be of greatest interest with.\niPad hardware, Mac performance\nIt was frankly astonishing when Apple added the M1 chipset to the iPad Pro in early 2021. For the first time, the Cupertino firm's tablets had the same processing potential as its laptops, a narrowing-of-the-field that, though predicted by many, still felt borderline magical in a device that was fanless and still capable of lengthy battery life. As we've seen from the Apple M2 in laptops like the 2022 MacBook Air refresh, the delta between the generations of Apple Silicon hasn't been quite as jaw-dropping as the leap from x86 to M1 was. Nonetheless, it's tough to understate just what the offer is here: desktop-level grunt.\nThe qualifier \u2014 which also lingers from previous, potent iPad Pros \u2014 is that how well you can take advantage of the power on offer depends on the whims of developers. DaVinci Resolve, Octane X, and Affinity Publisher users will all be getting updates later in the year that unlock features and processing speed that legitimately would've forced them to turn to the Mac version before now. That's huge.\nThere's a sense nonetheless that there's more here from the M2 than is really necessary for most iPadOS apps and iPad users. My typical workflow of email, messaging, browsing, writing, and watching the occasional video barely touches the sides, when you're talking about a CPU that's up to 15% faster than last year's, and a GPU that's up to 35% faster. Never has the fact that this is a pro machine, and not designed for everyone, been more stark.\nApple Pencil gets an intuitive upgrade\nThe other big change with the iPad Pro 11-inch (4th generation) and the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) is Apple Pencil hover. Until now, Apple's rechargeable second-generation stylus could track touch, pressure, and tilt when its nib was in contact with the display. With this update, the nib can be tracked up to 12 millimeters from the glass.\nHaving a tablet recognize a stylus before it actually comes in contact with the screen isn't new, of course. The trusty old HP tc1100 (running Windows XP Tablet Edition) I had in the mid-2000s could do that too, its Wacom digitizer allowing the pen to move the on-screen cursor from a short distance away. It always \u2014 as with most Windows-based tablets \u2014 felt like it was trying to emulate a mouse, though.\nThat's not how hover on the new iPad Pro feels. Instead, it's more akin to having a shadow cast by the nib of the Apple Pencil onto the screen, and in whatever form of tool that nib is currently set to represent, whether brush, eraser, or anything else. As a result, you have a better understanding of how the pen and app will interact before that actually happens.\nApp icons swell preemptively before you tap them; Scribble fields enlarge on the assumption you're about to use handwriting to text. It takes away a little of the guesstimate process as to what you're going to get, especially in apps that have explicit hover support. For casual \u2014 and not especially talented \u2014 artists like myself, seeing exactly where my digital ink or paint will land, and how thick and transparent it will be before I've actually applied it, makes for hitting the undo button far fewer times.\nHover is just getting started\nYou get the feeling, though, that hover is just getting started. As long as developers have already added support for Apple Pencil, they'll get all the new, standard hover features by default. However, the API opens the door to more tightly integrating the Apple Pencil as a UI tool.\nThe developers behind Pixelmator Photo, for example, are combining hover with the Apple Pencil's double-tap, essentially drawing out a new level of interface from the on-screen icons. Other apps will allow you to adjust brush size \u2014 complete with a hover preview of the result \u2014 by pinch-zooming with one hand while the nib is poised above the display. It should mean, generally, less tapping and more time to get on with creating.\nI'm curious to see how this pans out as more developers \u2014 beyond those Apple reached out to ahead of time \u2014 get to grips with the API. It's worth noting that hover only tracks Apple Pencil position, and the stylus only starts reporting tilt (and of course pressure) when it's in contact with the display. Nonetheless, it feels like it could potentially become a bigger deal than simply for artists.\niPad Pro M2 verdict\nIn fact, that sense pretty much describes how I feel about the iPad Pro in general. There is so much clear potential here, whether it's with the Pencil's new talents, the steps iPadOS is taking toward making the iPad a laptop replacement like Apple always claimed it was, or the raw performance of the M2 chip. It feels like we're scratching the surface, still.\nI also feel like I've been saying that about iPad \u2014 and iPad Pro specifically \u2014 for some generations now. What's changed is the alignment of iPadOS and macOS on Apple Silicon, an awakening of pro-level app makers to the experience parity across both platforms, and the fact that in some ways the iPad Pro now feels like the place Apple debuts some of its most compelling hardware.\nDoes that mean you should spend the $1,099 that the 2022 iPad Pro M2 will cost? That, mind, gets you the 128GB version \u2014 you're looking at $1,799 for 1TB or $2,199 for 2TB, plus a $200 premium for 5G. Then there's $129 for an Apple Pencil, and $349 for a Magic Keyboard. In short, MacBook Pro-level processing and MacBook Pro-level pricing too.\nIf the apps you use professionally are supported, though, I can't help but feel like it's probably worth it. The convenience of detaching the keyboard and kicking back with Apple Pencil makes a laptop feel staid. For the rest of us, just like with a MacBook Pro, the iPad Pro may well be overkill, and an iPad Air a far better \u2014 and more affordable \u2014 fit. I can't blame you if you still go for the Pro upgrade, though."

      "text": "iPad Mini Review (2024): Apple Intelligence Isn't What Makes This Tablet Shine\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nApple's smallest tablet has always found itself in a tough spot, but the new iPad mini is squeezed more than most. Flanked by bigger-than-ever iPhones on one side, and laptop-rivaling iPads on the other, 2024's update aims to hold its own with a faster chip delivering Apple Intelligence support. Question is, with the first wave of AI features finally here, is there enough to buoy the little slate into the mainstream?\nIt's one of those vaguely ineffable things, why the iPad mini feels so futuristic. Maybe I watched too much \"Star Trek: TNG\" over the years, and the appeal of something that resembles the PADD that Picard would get his sit-reps on tickles some deep, geeky chord in me. Regardless, it may not be the largest tablet that Apple offers, or as impressive an example of condensing cutting-edge technology into a tiny device as the iPhone 16 Pro, but something about the mini's form factor just seems endearing.\nThings haven't really changed from the design overhaul in 2021, which brought flat sides and crisp corners; Blue and Purple finishes join the Space Gray and Starlight gold options. There's still a bright, pixel-dense 8.3-inch display, with bezels just wide enough that you can hold the slate one-handed without inadvertently touching the edges of the screen. The Touch ID/power button is on the top edge, as are the volume buttons; still not my favorite spot for them, but at least the compact size makes reaching less of a chore.\nFaster, more storage, same price\nApple still quotes the vague \"all-day battery life\" that seems, from my testing so far, to be accurate. All 2024 iPad mini models get Wi-Fi 6E support, for faster connectivity assuming your router supports it, while the USB-C promises up to double the data speeds (10Gbps). Wi-Fi + Cellular versions of the tablet \u2014 for which you'll pay a whopping $150 premium \u2014 get 5G with eSIM support, though it's still only sub-6 GHz not the speedier (but rarer) mmWave flavor.\nIt's what's inside that's the big news, of course, with a version of the A17 Pro chip \u2014 launched with last year's iPhone 15 Pro, though here with five GPU cores, not six \u2014 replacing the A15 of before. Frankly, the old iPad mini never felt exactly slow, but this newer chipset is the minimum for supporting Apple Intelligence.\nIt's paired with a welcome doubling of the storage. The same $499 as before now gets you 128GB from the Apple Store, instead of a borderline-insulting 64GB, and there's up to a 512GB version from $799. Or you can get the iPad mini (2024) from Amazon for a starting price of $484.\nApple Intelligence is here... but should you care?\nHonestly, from Apple's perspective, I might not be the person they want passing judgment on Apple Intelligence. Like a lot of people, I'm skeptical of the value of most AI functionality, not least because of the resources it requires and the environmental impact that leads to. Then there's the well-reported tendency for AI products in general to \"hallucinate\" facts that turn out to be just plain incorrect, and how AI models are often trained on vast swathes of human-generated data with no respect to things like copyright.\nApple Intelligence tackles at least some of these concerns. The speedier chipset in the new iPad mini is required, because as much of the AI processing as possible is done locally. When the extra grunt of remote servers is required, Apple uses its new Private Cloud Compute; those servers are powered by renewable energy, permanently delete user data after it's processed, and support third-party privacy verification, the company promises.\nThere's no way, in real time, to see whether the iPad mini is handling Apple Intelligence processing locally, or if the tablet has tagged in the cloud. You can, retroactively, head into the iPadOS settings for a log of local/cloud requests. That can cover the past 15 minutes or seven days of use (or you can turn logging off completely), and is exported as a JSON file.\nSiri gets more conversational, but results still vary\niPadOS 18.1 delivered the first tranche of Apple Intelligence features to iPad \u2014 as well as to iPhone, with iOS 18.1, and Mac, with macOS Sequoia 15.1 \u2014 though the roadmap for all of the functionality Apple has been promising now stretches into 2025.\nOn the Siri side, as well as the new UI \u2014 a colorful band around the periphery of the display, rather than the animated bubble \u2014 Apple's assistant promises more realistic voices; you can also double-tap the bottom of the screen to bring up a text box, and type Siri requests instead. Handy, if you don't want, or don't like, to converse out loud.\nConversations can be a little more natural, too, with Siri promising to remember context across requests. So, I could ask \"When did the clocks go back in Europe?\" and then follow up with \"What about in America?\" and Siri knew the context of my second question without it explicitly being said.\nThat's great, but you're still at the mercy of Siri's actual results, and there things can be patchy. My clock-change question, for instance, brought up two lists of search results rather than just telling me \"October 17th\" and then \"November 10th;\" when I asked what time it was in the U.S., Siri gave me the current time in Washington, D.C. but, when I asked \"What about local to me?\" the assistant gave up after a few seconds, with no answer.\nDo you need Apple to ghostwrite for you?\nWriting tools and summaries are the other big, iPad-pervasive AI features now introduced. With the former, Apple's own apps \u2014 and many third-party ones \u2014 can now offer to proofread your text and then \"rewrite\" it for you, fixing any goofs or typos that regular autocorrect might not have caught. Or, you can have Apple Intelligence rewrite it in a Friendly, Professional, or Concise style.\nThe results are, well, bland. Apple's AI certainly delivers what's promised, but in the process strips out any germ of personality; it feels a bit like asking Hallmark to come up with a heartfelt message for your Mother's Day card. Perfectly serviceable in that it's grammatically correct, but I can't help but think a message with a tad more individuality would be acceptable in all but the most regimented of situations.\nSummaries \u2014 offered at the top of email chains, Messages chats, in notifications, and in transcribed audio within Notes and Phone \u2014 pulls out what Apple Intelligence thinks is most pertinent, saving you from diving into the full thread. It's arguably the most conspicuous demonstration of what we've been long promised AI will be ideal for: saving us the digital toil of actually reading what's clogging up our various inboxes.\nAI is a question of trust\nIt's simultaneously true to say that Apple Intelligence summaries work, and that I don't fully trust them yet. Summarizing an email conversation with a neighbor who just upgraded to a new iPhone 16, for example, the tl;dr correctly noted my confirmation that no, their old USB-A chargers wouldn't work. However, it ignored the part where I'd offered to check my tech closet for replacements; if I was relying on the summary as a reminder of that offer, or if my neighbor was looking at his \u2014 presumably similar \u2014 summary, that option would've gone unrecognized.\nYou face the same challenge using Apple Intelligence to summarize documents and webpages, which Apple pitches as a way to conjure a quick update without necessarily crafting a pr\u00e9cis of your own. Again, that's both true, but also something I have trouble trusting: when it was tasked with summarizing reviews I'd written myself, for instance, I couldn't fault the facts Apple Intelligence stated, but I also felt there was context absent that I would've included.\nIt's also worth noting that, for all the bump in onboard processing, Private Cloud Compute was required to figure out my thread summaries in Mail.\nLike with any AI product, Apple says Apple Intelligence will improve over time. The question I'm left with, however, is at what point I myself will figure I can trust those improvements. For now, though the iPad mini's summaries are neat, they don't really come close to what someone actually familiar with the text (even if just from a single read through) could whip up.\nGenuinely useful photo editing tools\nAs demonstrations of AI go, Apple's photo editing tools feel far more compelling. Clean Up offers the same sort of \"remove rogue people and objects from images\" magic as we've seen from Google and others, but while it may not be a new concept, the results are still worth noting. Although the 12-megapixel camera on the new iPad mini has been updated with Smart HDR 4 support, Clean Up works with any image in the Photos app, regardless of source or camera.\nAfter a moment's processing, likely candidates for removal are highlighted with a rainbow shimmer; you can tap them (with a finger, or with the newly-supported $129 Apple Pencil Pro that can do hover, squeeze-to-switch tools, and other improvements) or scribble around something else you'd like to oust from the image. For the most part, Clean Up does an impressively good job at extrapolating what's left behind to fill the gaps.\nI appreciate the improvements to photo search, too, which can not only spot more nuanced results from your pictures, but even take you straight to a certain matching frame in a video.\niPad mini 2024 Verdict\nThe things I enjoy about the iPad mini are all present and correct in this 2024 update. It's still an arguably perfect-sized companion device, neither too expensive nor too large to make you question why you're carrying both it, and your laptop, in your bag. The screen is great for video \u2014 markedly bigger than even that of an iPhone 16 Pro Max \u2014 but in a device still comfortable to hold one-handed. And, if your handwriting is more legible than mine, an iPad mini with Apple's stylus makes a fantastic note-taking device.\nAt the same time, having my finger summoned to the Touch ID button feels clunky compared to other Apple devices seamlessly using Face ID. The jelly scrolling of the iPad mini 6 hasn't been fixed, and the camera improvements are marginal. The A17 Pro leaves the new iPad mini faster than its predecessor, but I'm wary of it already being Apple's minimum for Apple Intelligence, especially when things like email summaries are relying on cloud processing rather than being cooked up locally.\nIf, like me, you're still unconvinced by Apple Intelligence anyway, the new iPad mini probably isn't going to warrant an upgrade from 2021's model. And there's no denying that bigger, more potent iPads are an easier, laptop-replacing sell. This 2024 update won't do anything to shift the iPad mini out of its niche: I'm still glad Apple makes it, I just wish some of the imagination applied to other recent products had made its way to this small but charming tablet."

      "text": "Spotlight on: Apple Pencil hover\nDecember 16, 2022\nWhen it comes to designing creative interactions, the Procreate team knows how to get the job done.\nThe illustration app kicked off in 2011 with touch-based controls \u2014 \"just five fingers of input,\" says CEO James Cuda \u2014 and won a rare pair of Apple Design Awards over the next decade for their innovative approaches to digital drawing, sketching, and painting.\nWhile finger painting remains a core part of the app, Apple Pencil has become a significant part of Procreate's story. Apple Pencil gives artists customization and control of their line width and opacity, stroke style, and quick-access controls. And with the introduction of Apple Pencil hover, the Procreate team is investing even more heavily in the stylus. \u201cIt\u2019s truly made a profound impact in our design phase,\u201d says Cuda.\nAs with pretty much any other digital or analog drawing tool, Apple Pencil operates on the X and Y axes of a canvas, requiring direct input from the stylus nib to draw a line or select a tool. The second-generation Apple Pencil also adds support for direct input along the side of the stylus \u2014 which gives developers an option to add shortcuts within their apps. Now, Apple Pencil hover is bringing tool and previewing shortcuts into an entirely new dimension. (The Z-axis, specifically.)\n\u201c[It's] a whole new layer of interaction,\" says Cuda. \u201cEverything springs to life as your Apple Pencil comes near.\u201d\nApple Pencil hover activates when the nib is up to 12 mm above the display on iPad Pro with the M2 chip. Developers can customize what the feature does within their app, including offering tool variations, menu selection, and even previewing lines themselves \u2014 so artists can draw, sketch, and color with even greater control. \"The ability to not make a commitment or damage the artwork is transformative,\" Cuda says.\nAnd the feature's functionality is only half the fun. \u201cIt makes everything feel so playful,\u201d says Claire d\u2019Este, Procreate\u2019s chief product officer. \u201cI find myself rolling up and down menus just to see it responding. There\u2019s something so nice about everything lighting up as I\u2019m thinking about what to do next.\u201d\nThe ability to not make a commitment or damage the artwork is transformative.\nJames Cuda, Procreate CEO\nThe Procreate team has hidden these sorts of playful moments throughout the entire app. In the gallery view, hovering over thumbnails expands the image or previews animations. Tools like the color picker or menu buttons react as you move across them. And then, of course, there's the canvas.\n\u2018Your mind starts racing\u2019\n\"There are two phases with something like this,\u201d says Procreate chief technology officer Lloyd Bottomley. \u201cThe first is the initial, \u2018Wow, this is cool.\u2019 But then your mind starts racing because you\u2019re trying to think of all the things you could do with it.\u201d\nWith so many possibilities open to them, the Procreate team had to approach each idea with care and scrutiny to ensure they were aiding and improving design and creation workflows rather than hindering them. \u201cWe\u2019re obsessed with keeping people focused on that point of interaction,\u201d Bottomley says.\nOne area that proved surprisingly challenging: the brush cursor. \u201cHonestly, we thought we'd have just one design through the entire brush library,\" says Cuda. \u201cThe problem was there's not one singular representation of that hover mark, because our brushes can do anything \u2014 you can have brushes inside brushes; you can have brushes that move across each other. To represent all that in a hover state was really challenging.\u201d\nWe're obsessed with keeping people focused on that point of interaction.\nLloyd Bottomley, Procreate chief technology officer\nAfter a few weeks of back and forth, the team landed on a solution: customizable cursors that change with different brushes. \u201cWe needed to move away from that idea of \u2018one thing to rule them all\u2019 to a series of settings that could get us there,\u201d says Cuda. \u201cNow, all the brush-makers out there can customize what their hover state will look like.\u201d\nA second target was the app's ColorDrop feature, which instantly fills a section of your artwork when you drag and drop a color on it, paint-by-numbers style. Using Apple Pencil hover, people can preview of what the artwork will look like before committing to a color, speeding up the process dramatically. \"If you\u2019re doing inking \u2014 comic book art, for instance \u2014 it\u2019s huge,\u201d says d\u2019Este.\nIf you\u2019re doing inking \u2014 comic book art, for instance \u2014 it\u2019s huge.\nClaire d\u2019Este, Procreate chief product officer\nIt\u2019s also a timely example of how a small change can make a massive improvement in an artistic workflow. \u201cThose kinds of interactions take a surprising amount of time,\u201d says Bottomley. \u201cEven moving your arm across the screen takes time. Now you barely have to move.\u201d\nThe saga of the sliders\nWhile the Procreate team delighted in improving interactions for brush cursors and ColorDrop, they had a much bigger problem they hoped Apple Pencil hover would solve: a little piece of UI that had been bothering the team since the app's very first days.\n\u201cOur goal is to put absolute focus on the artist\u2019s content,\u201d says Cuda. Procreate's interface has long championed minimalistic tool windows and intuitive gestures like tap-to-undo to keep the canvas clear for the work. But they hit a proverbial artistic wall when trying to build UI for repetitive interactions like adjusting brush size or opacity.\nIterations came and went; the pair tried variations on pinching and zooming and tapping and holding, but nothing felt properly connected to the rest of the Procreate experience. \u201cWe ditched it all,\u201d says Bottomley, \u201cand went with that very conventional set of sliders you see on the left hand side of the screen.\u201d\nThe sliders were functional. They were intuitive enough. But whenever the team thought about features they really liked about the app, the sliders were conspicuously absent \u2014 until Apple Pencil hover. \u201cOnce hover was announced, we realized we could work with Multi-Touch like we couldn\u2019t before,\u201d says Cuda.\nWith Apple Pencil hover, could they at last kill the sidebar? \u201cWe developed a gesture we thought would be just so ubiquitous and approachable,\u201d says Cuda. \u201cThe idea was you would use two fingers to pinch and zoom while you\u2019ve got hover up, so you could clearly see where your brush is and how it changes in size before you mark the screen. We were convinced it would be the way of the future.\u201d\nAnd then they began testing.\n\"We realized we were wrong as soon as we put it in practice,\" says Cuda. The gesture worked brilliantly when iPad was sitting on a table or against a stand \u2014 a common-enough use case \u2014 but anyone using the tablet on a couch had a different experience. \"You\u2019re clutching the device with two hands,\" he says. \"And as soon as you pinch and hover, the device is no longer, uh, in your clutches.\u201d\nWe had to put our egos aside and go, \u2018OK, maybe we were wrong.\u2019\nJames Cuda, Procreate CEO\nThe challenge was enough to send the team back to the drawing board. \u201cThe gesture is useful; it\u2019s just not the singular interface methodology were hoping to create,\u201d says Cuda. \u201cWe had to put our egos aside and go, \u2018OK, maybe we were wrong.\u2019 And we had to think about what was best for the customer.\u201d\nFor customers holding the device, it meant the return of the sliders. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping them for mobile drawing,\u201d Cuda says. \u201cOn a desk or stand, when you\u2019ve got both hands free, the sidebar goes away and we get exactly what we wanted. So it was a wild ride for a couple of weeks making those calls.\u201d\n\u2018It\u2019s hard to go back\u2019\nPeople using iPad Pro with the M2 chip and the second-generation Apple Pencil, can explore Procreate's Apple Pencil hover features now. But Cuda and the team are focused strongly on the future, regarding hover as an important new tool in the shed \u2014 enough so that Cuda says it already \u201csolves a bunch of things\u201d in regards to upcoming projects.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re tapping into a technology but creating a natural extension of what you could already do,\u201d d\u2019Este says. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve experienced this, it\u2019s hard to go back.\u201d"

      "text": "iPad Pro Gets New Apple Pencil Pro, Souped Up Magic Keyboard\nWith the new M4 iPad Pro and the M2 iPad Air, Apple also announced the long-awaited upgrade to the Apple Pencil, along with a new Magic Keyboard.\nLet's start with the new Apple Pencil Pro, which features the squeeze gesture. Thanks to a new sensor, the input device brings up a tool palette when you squeeze its barrel, helping to switch between line weights, colors, etc. Furthermore, Apple has equipped the device with a custom haptic engine to provide subtle vibrational feedback when using input features such as the squeeze gesture and double-tap.\nUnlike the Apple Pencil (2nd Generation), the new Pencil Pro allows changing the shape and orientation of the tool with a built-in gyroscope. For instance, someone using a paintbrush can simply rotate the stylus to change its orientation, therefore modifying the thickness of the strokes. To help visualize the adjustment, Apple Pencil hover will accompany the rotations with on-screen animations.\nAs rumors suggested, the Apple Pencil Pro supports Find My, making it easier to locate the device in case you misplace it. To pair and charge the device, you can attach the device to the side of the M4 iPad Pro. With all the intuitive features, the new input device costs $129. It is compatible with the new M4 iPad Pro and M2 iPad Air models. Apple also offers a $10 discount for students.\nThe new Magic Keyboard converts your iPad Pro into a MacBook, sort of\nThe new Magic Keyboard has a thinner and lighter body to complement the M4 iPad Pro's sleek design. Inspired by MacBooks, the Magic Keyboard features a function row that allows changing the screen's brightness or volume, along with an aluminum palm rest. Users also get a larger trackpad for more flexibility while using touch-based navigations. The device attaches to the back of the iPad Pro via magnets and synchronizes power and data without Bluetooth.\nAlong the aluminum hinge, there's a USB-C connector for charging. Matching the colors of the M4 iPad Pro, the new Magic Keyboard ships in black (with a space black aluminum palm rest) and white (with a silver aluminum palm rest). Moreover, the device makes your iPad Pro feel like a MacBook with the additional keyboard and trackpad functionality.\nThe 11-inch Magic Keyboard costs $299, while the 13-inch Magic Keyboard is available for $349. For education, the models are available at a discount of $20. You can pre-order the Apple Pencil Pro and the new Magic Keyboard today, and the devices will be available next week."
