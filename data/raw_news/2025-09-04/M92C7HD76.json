  "title": "Global markets are mixed after U.S. stocks surged following Nvidia\u2019s earnings report",
  "description": "Stocks around the world were mixed Thursday following gains on Wall Street from Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report.",
  "content": "World shares were mixed Thursday after modest gains on Wall Street lifted the S&P 500 to another all-time high ahead of computer chipmaker Nvidia\u2019s highly anticipated earnings report.\n\n\n\nThe future for S&P 500 rose 0.1% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3%. Meanwhile, oil prices declined.\n\n\n\nIn early European trading, Germany\u2019s DAX climbed 0.4% to 24,144.65 while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 slipped 0.2% to 9,240.75. In Paris, the CAC 40 jumped 1.1% to 7,825.28.\n\n\n\nIn China, shares in computer chipmaker Cambricon Technologies soared 15.7% to 1,587.91 yuan ($222), becoming the priciest stock on Shanghai\u2019s exchange as it surpassed Kweichou Moutai\u2019s stock, which slipped to 1,446 yuan ($202) a share. Cambricon\u2019s shares have jumped after it reported its revenue and profit expanded many fold in the first half of the year, helped by the Chinese government\u2019s support for domestic semiconductor makers.\n\n\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index surged 1.1% to 3,843.60. It has been trading near decade-high levels on heavy buying by institutional investors.\n\n\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 0.8% to 24,998.82, led by losses for technology companies like food delivery company Meituan. Its shares dropped 10.3% while e-commerce giant JD.com declined 5%. Such companies have seen demand sag as Chinese consumers cut back on spending.\n\n\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 added 0.7% to 42,828.79. It has been trading near record levels, despite friction with Washington over a preliminary trade agreement that has yet to be finalized. Top trade envoy Ryohei Akazawa abruptly postponed a trip to the U.S. capital planned for Thursday in the latest sign of trouble over the deal setting tariffs on Japanese exports at 15%, a policy that has yet to come into effect.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi climbed 0.3% to 3,196.32 after the Bank of Korea kept its policy rate unchanged at 2.5% for the second review in a row.\n\n\n\nAustralia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.2% higher to 8,980.00. India\u2019s BSE Sensex fell 0.9%, reopening following a public holiday after higher U.S. tariffs on the country\u2019s exports took effect on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nTaiwan\u2019s TAIEX shed 1.2%.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.2%, nudging past the record high it set two weeks ago to close at 6,481.40.\n\n\n\nThe Dow industrials rose 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite closed 0.2% higher at 21,590.14.\n\n\n\nTechnology companies led the way higher, outweighing declines in communication services and other sectors.\n\n\n\nAfter the market closed, Nvidia\u2019s quarterly report showed its earnings and revenue topped Wall Street analysts\u2019 forecasts, though the company noted that sales of its artificial intelligence chipsets rose at a slower pace than analysts anticipated. The stock fell 3.2% in after-hours trading after having slipped 0.1% during the regular session.\n\n\n\nInvestors consider Nvidia a barometer for the strength of the boom in artificial intelligence because the company makes most of the chips that power the technology. Its heavy weighting also gives Nvidia outsized influence as a bellwether for the broader market.\n\n\n\nIn other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude dropped 48 cents to $63.67 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 47 cents to $66.97 per barrel.\n\n\n\nThe dollar fell to 147.24 Japanese yen, down from 147.40 yen. The euro rose to $1.1639 from $1.1640.",
