  "description": "Since 1967, the Newport Bay Conservancy has worked to preserve the Upper Newport Bay. A fundraiser Saturday aims to support a massive, multi-million dollar restoration of the ecological jewel.",
  "content": "The Newport Bay Conservancy hosts an annual Gourmet by the Bay fundraiser in support of its efforts to preserve and restore the Upper Newport Bay, seen in 2024.\n\nFor more than half a century, the Newport Bay Conservancy has wrapped its collective arms around the 1,000-acre Upper Newport Bay to protect the ecologically important habitat from the encroachment of development, invasive species and other worldly harms.\n\nSince 1967, a stalwart team of biologists, philanthropists and legions of volunteers have worked to educate the public about the estuary that provides a home, refuge and crossing to hundreds of species of fish birds and other wildlife, many of which are endangered.\n\nFrom school visits and kayak tours to coastal cleanups and a volunteer-run native plant nursery, the conservancy\u2019s outreach touches more than 50,000 visitors annually. A broader, multiyear effort to reconstruct and restore the Bay and its watershed began in 2018 and is about to head into its largest and most transformative work to date.\n\nYet, on one evening each year, the conservancy\u2019s stakeholders join together, surrounded by the pristine natural beauty they\u2019ve vowed to preserve, to raise their glasses to the efforts of the past year and to look ahead to the future \u2014 and it\u2019s time once more for Gourmet by the Bay.\n\nThe seventh annual fundraising dinner takes place this Saturday, from 5 to 8 p.m. at the Peter and Mary Muth Interpretive Center in Newport Beach, with sunset views, live music, a silent and live auction as well as a farm-to-table dinner catered by Chef Nicoletta Grippo and drinks from Tap Truck Orange County, all served on a patio overlooking the scenic Back Bay.\n\nBilled as \u201can evening designed to delight your senses,\u201d Gourmet by the Bay is both a gathering of and a thank you to the many people who bring the organization\u2019s mission and vision to life through their volunteerism and philanthropy, according to Heather Cieslak, the conservancy\u2019s operations director.\n\n\u201cThis gives us an opportunity for our friends to come together and have a night at the Bay on the patio and get a chance to celebrate the accomplishments of the conservancy throughout the year,\u201d she said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural evening, a chance to see birds flying by, see the changing of the tides and watch the sun set \u2014 it\u2019s really stunning,\u201d Cieslak added. \u201cWe don\u2019t really decorate \u2014 one of our things is to let the resource speak for itself.\u201d\n\nProceeds from the event will support the work of the Newport Bay Conservancy as it embarks on a crucial third phase of a larger \u201crestoration era,\u201d during which it will lead a multi-million dollar restoration and adaptation of the , a natural canyon on the Bay\u2019s east side.\n\nThat work is set to begin this fall and includes restoring 14 acres of historical salt marsh and creating transitional wetland habitats that will help build the resilience of sensitive species as sea levels rise and salt water intrusion increases.\n\nA collaboration of partners, from the city of Newport Beach and California Coastal Conservancy to state and federal wildlife agencies, are helping to fund the project, through grants and reimbursements, and monitor the restored areas in the years after work has been completed.\n\nBut as the project lead, the Newport Bay Conservancy will be responsible for initiating the work and coming up with the funds to get the ball rolling, another reason why this year\u2019s Gourmet by the Bay\u2019s fundraising efforts are especially crucial, officials say.\n\nFor Cieslak, the important effort is worth undertaking if it means restoring and preserving the Bay\u2019s ecological presence in Orange County and California at large.\n\n\u201cThese natural estuaries are few and far between on our California coastline, because over 90% of coastal estuaries have been developed over,\u201d she said. \u201cThese areas, these buffer zones, are so important for wildlife, for migrating birds and for our own health and wellness.\u201d\n\nGourmet by the Bay takes place Saturday, at 5 p.m., at the Peter and Mary Muth Interpretive Center, 2301 University Drive, Newport Beach. General admission is $120 for members, $145 for non-members. For more details, visit .",

      "text": "Big Canyon restoration project in Newport Beach to begin third phase in fall 2024\n- Share via\nConstruction for the third and final phase of the Big Canyon restoration project is now scheduled for fall 2024, according to the Newport Bay Conservancy, having received final approvals for a coastal permit application from the state Coastal Commission on Thursday.\nThe final phase affects 29.5 acres of Big Canyon Nature Park, one of the biggest tributaries to upper Newport Bay. Roughly 45 acres of the park are designated as Big Canyon Nature Park and owned by the city of Newport Beach, while the lower 15 acres are owned by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. That section lies within the Upper Newport Bay State Ecological Reserve, where Phase III will take place.\nThe first phase included hydrology improvements in the northernmost 6 acres, while the second focused on restoration and drainage improvements in the 11.3 acres of the canyon immediately to the west of the Phase I site, according to Coastal Commission staff. Phase II was completed in 2021.\nThe final phase seeks to address restoration of the native salt marshes, realignment of existing freshwater flows to improve drainage and water quality, and final improvements to the existing public trails and signage throughout the park.\nAs part of the approval, the Coastal Commission required a habitat restoration plan, nesting bird protection measures, herbicide use protocols, other agency approvals, construction best-management practices, a construction staging plan, assumption of risk and protection of archaeological and tribal cultural resources.\nThe restoration project is organized through the efforts of the Newport Bay Conservancy, the city of Newport Beach and CDFW.\n\u201cOn behalf of the project partners, we thank the Coastal Commission for its ongoing support of this important project, which has already made significant progress in the first two phases,\u201d Newport Beach spokesman John Pope said following the approval Thursday. \u201cThe Big Canyon restoration removes a major mosquito breeding area, creates an open water area for marine birds and animals, eliminates invasive plants and restores native plants. We encourage the public to view the restoration efforts and educators to lead ecological tours of the area.\u201d\nNewport Bay Conservancy restoration manager Alys Arenas said the conservancy is waiting on other permits, but the delay in construction is because of the nesting and breeding seasons, which span from March to September.\n\u201cWe have a short window from Sept. 15 to March 15 to get any ground-moving work, basic removal, planting, and then it\u2019ll fall into monitoring and maintenance period. The short term will be 120 days, but after that, it\u2019s three to five years of monitoring and maintenance before it can be called complete,\u201d Arenas said.\n\u201cIt is a unique area. You can consider this area a transitional zone. It\u2019s a buffer between our wetland habitats and ... it\u2019s significantly important because of long-term sea level rise,\u201d Arenas continued. \u201cAs we get higher sea level rise, there\u2019s going to be a higher marsh for the water to recede and for the wildlife to rely on as we do expect some of our marsh to be underwater in 50 years. It\u2019s important that, as well as aside from recreational activities, we provide habitat for wildlife and educational benefits.\u201d\nPhase III is projected to cost about $6 million. The total cost for the permitting, planning, design and implementation of all three phases is estimated to be between $10 million and $11 million."

      "text": "Big Canyon is the largest remaining natural canyon on the east side of Newport Bay. The Conservancy is the final phase of the multi-phase water quality, restoration, and adaptation project in Big Canyon Nature Park. The 60-acre open space is located at the downstream end of the Big Canyon Watershed in the City of Newport Beach, within Orange County, California. Big Canyon Creek drains the 1,300-acre Big Canyon Watershed directly into the Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve (UNBER) and State Marine Conservation Area. The area it has been heavily influenced by the construction of a salt evaporation pond, historical placement of dredge and fill material, interim restoration efforts, and other human activities. Stockpiling of dredge fill during the 1950s and 1960s within Big Canyon Creek raised the elevations within the canyon and consequently channelized the creek to the north. The creek now winds through the Nature Park in a general southeast to northwest direction and then discharges into Upper Newport Bay.\nPHASE III Groundbreaking coming Fall 2025. Phase III consists of several components, including restoring 14 acres of historical salt marsh and establishment of transitional wetland habitats, providing long-term benefits to climate resiliency along the California coast. This Project provides a unique opportunity to establish transitional zones as sea level rise (SLR) alters habitats within the UNBER. Phase III proposes to extend the saltwater influence into the Project limits, allowing the tidal extent and inundation to increase with SLR. Transitional zones will allow migration of salt marsh vegetation with future SLR to improve the overall resiliency of salt marsh in UNB, supporting sensitive coastal habitats and several federally and state listed species.

Check out this plant palate featuring what was planted to start recognizing them as they grow or join us on Thursday mornings as we make sure we keep the site free of any non-native invasive plants. Phase 2A also included the HUGE task of removing a 6-acre infestation of Brazilian Pepper Trees.
