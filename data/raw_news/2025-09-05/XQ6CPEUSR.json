  "description": "Inmo's Air 3 glasses are unlike anything I've seen before.",
  "content": "Smart glasses are pretty exciting right now, not just because they\u2019re increasingly popular, but because they\u2019re not quite mainstream yet, which means companies are still allowed to get very weird with them. It\u2019s in that nascent zone of experimentation that you get some interesting stuff, and that definitely includes Inmo\u2019s Air 3 AR glasses.\n\nThere are lots of cool / quirky things about Inmo\u2019s Air 3\u2014which announced a Kickstarter as a part of IFA 2025\u2014but my favorite thing is that it tackles one of the most vexing issues with AR glasses as they stand: the UI. To control the Inmo Air 3, the smart glasses come with a smart ring that acts as a button, a touchpad, a mouse, and it also helps track the movement of virtual objects in the display. It reminds me of what Meta is likely cooking up with its pair of smart glasses (a wristband that reads your body\u2019s electrical signals), but with a lower footprint.\n\nThe other major highlight of these smart glasses is that, with the help of a micro OLED display from Sony, the Air 3 are not only full-color, but they\u2019re 1080p and have up to 600 nits of brightness. It\u2019s a relatively small field of view at 36 degrees, but it covers 100% sRGB, which is a far cry from competitors like Rokid Glasses that only show overlays in a Matrix-like green color. On paper, these smart glasses are equipped to do everything you wish you could do with Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, and with those extra capabilities, Inmo is planning a lot.\n\nOne thing Inmo envisions is lots of 2D apps that you can use in your smart glasses for things like doomscrolling X or Snapchat, if that\u2019s a thing that people still use. There\u2019s a built-in Google Play store, so pretty much anything you could download on there should be possible to use in the Air 3, which runs Android 14. One of the most compelling use cases is using the smart glasses as a virtual screen. Similar to competitors in the space like BigScreen, Inmo envisons its smart glasses as a way of gluing a big screen on your eyeballs\u2014the Air 3 translates to a 150-inch screen, according to the company.\n\nTo do all of those things, Inmo is loading the Air 3 up with a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, which it says should enable up to three \u201cindependent floating virtual screens.\u201d There\u2019s also a 16-megapixel ultrawide camera for pictures and computer vision, and an array of mics and speakers so you can use a voice assistant or listen to audio playback.\n\nMy biggest questions are the same as any pair of AR glasses that claim to do all this stuff. One is battery life; according to Inmo, the Air 3 has a 660mAh battery, though it doesn\u2019t give figures on how that translates to battery life. The other thing is weight, and Inmo hasn\u2019t shared figures in that department, so I\u2019m going to go ahead and assume these weigh a great deal more than less capable competitors from Rokid or Meta.\n\nEither way, the Air 3 is doing some interesting stuff, especially in terms of UI and display, and whether or not any of it pans out, it\u2019s hard not to appreciate the exercise in \u201chow the f**k are we going to make smart glasses work?\u201d Inmo\u2019s Kickstarter officially launches on Sept. 15, and its Air 3 glasses will cost $899.",

      "text": "Smart glasses are an exciting idea right now. In theory, they\u2019re a new gadget that does lots of the stuff that our phones do, but in an always-there form factor. They can take pictures, make calls, translate menus, and\u2014if the tech and the investment get there\u2014they might slap a screen right onto eyeballs for notifications, navigation, and maybe even augmented reality \u00e0 la Pok\u00e9mon Go.\nI say \u201cin theory\u201d because just because smart glasses can do all of those things on paper doesn\u2019t mean they can do them well, and if they can\u2019t do them well\u2026 they may as well not do them at all. We\u2019re still in the early stages of the grand ascension of smart glasses as a device category, but a brave few are venturing to do it all right now, and one of those few (at least in the U.S.) is a company based in China called Rokid (pronounced rock-id).\nI got a chance to try Rokid\u2019s plainly named Rokid Glasses, and while there was a lot that intrigued me, I can say for certain that the kinks are still being worked out. One thing that these smart glasses have that big-time entrants from the likes of Meta and its Ray-Bans don\u2019t have is a screen. That screen is a very simple dual-micro LED display that only shows things in a very Matrix-style green. I got to use the Rokid Glasses for 15 minutes and was surprised at how sharp the screen was, even if the display functions were fairly basic. And look, you can see the screen from outside the glasses. And that\u2019s good because sharpness is crucial for some of the things that make the Rokid Glasses unique.\nOne of those distinct capabilities is a teleprompter feature that displays a presentation in front of your eyes, so you can read along and not sound like a total moron during your big keynote. A thing that I found very cool is the fact that the Rokid Glasses actually use the onboard microphone to listen to your words and scroll the prompter in stride with the words. Even in a crowded room with lots of noise, the feature worked smoothly, which is no small feat.\nAnother screen-centric feature I got to try was translation, which\u2014though my conversation was fairly brief\u2014seemed to work better than you\u2019d expect. My demo companion spoke to me in Mandarin Chinese, and the Rokid Glasses were able to translate his speech in small snippets and slap them onto the screen. Again, the microphone did all of this in a noisy room, which was legitimately impressive. The microphones on Rokid\u2019s smart glasses work so well that I\u2019m pretty sure you could use them for spying\u2014it picked up bits of conversations across the room that I wasn\u2019t even able to make out with my own ears. Cool! Also scary!\nTo use all of this stuff, it\u2019s best to couple the Rokid Glasses with an app (Android-only right now) where everything you\u2019re doing is displayed. As sharp as the screen is, it\u2019s also quite small, and words are pushed off when new information arrives at a fairly quick pace. If you need to see something, it\u2019s best to have the app ready, lest you ask someone to repeat themselves multiple times. And in case you\u2019re wondering, you can control the display from the smart glasses by swiping the right arm and using a tap to select things like settings, translation, and other stuff, but it\u2019s not exactly the smoothest experience. That\u2019s why voice assistants\u2014for Rokid and any company making smart glasses right now\u2014are also critical. That brings me to a not-so-bright spot.\nThe Rokid Glasses voice assistant, which is supposed to activate with the wake phrase \u201cHi, Rokid,\u201d was basically broken. No matter how many times I screamed \u201cHi, Rokid\u201d into the smart glasses, it wouldn\u2019t answer my calls. Others around me were also having the same issue, which is not great from a UI perspective. The interesting thing is that when a native Mandarin-speaking represenative said the phrase, it seemed to work every time. American English-speaking people, not so much. I thought maybe it was the loud, crowded room at first, but after noticing that strange quirk, I think it may be a problem with how the voice assistant is trained. I can\u2019t say for sure without testing the Rokid Glasses more thoroughly, but it\u2019s definitely a concern for anyone buying a pair in the U.S.\nLike Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, the Rokid Glasses can also use AI for computer vision-based tasks like asking your glasses to read a menu in a different language using the built-in camera. I wasn\u2019t able to launch that task myself, given the aforementioned voice assistant issues, but when a Rokid representative asked the smart glasses to translate a menu in Finnish, it did so (at least I think) fairly well, displaying the translated Finnish words in the Rokid app. Again, I\u2019d need to test this feature out more thoroughly in a better environment to verify the translation separately and determine how well (or terribly) it actually works on a consistent basis.\nAs long as we\u2019re talking about computer vision, I was pleasantly surprised with the camera, which is a 12-megapixel sensor from Sony. Just one sensor, not two, though. I would say it\u2019s on par with Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, but I didn\u2019t get to test video recording out in my demo. I wouldn\u2019t try and use the Rokid Glasses to win any photo contests, but then again, I wouldn\u2019t do that with any pair of smart glasses.\nI won\u2019t know until I get to try Rokid Glasses for a longer period, but I get the sense that they\u2019re smart glasses with some peaks and valleys. Translation could be impressive, as could computer vision, and they\u2019re incredibly light (as light as Ray-Bans), but if there isn\u2019t a functional, English-ready voice assistant to tie it all together, that\u2019d be a big problem for anyone in the U.S. who wants to buy a pair. That\u2019s potentially not the best news for smart glasses enthusiasts in America, but I assume Mark Zuckerberg would welcome that quirk with open arms."

      "text": "If there\u2019s one thing that we\u2019ve learned in the world of mixed reality over the past year, it\u2019s that price is pretty much everything. Just ask Apple, which is still struggling to find an audience for its $3,500 Vision Pro headset. I mean, it\u2019s not that there\u2019s not a lot to love about the Vision Pro (the best UI in mixed reality and a premium display are particular highlights), but I bought my first used car for a price that wasn\u2019t too far off, and that at least got me to work semi-on time.\nIt\u2019s unclear what, if anything, Apple learned from its experiment in expensive AR hardware since there\u2019s no second-gen Vision Pro just yet, but Meta seems to have gotten the message, and not just with its newest headset, the Quest 3S, but apparently with an upcoming pair of smart glasses. According to a report from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Meta is planning to release its next pair of display-having smart glasses soon for $800, which is markedly less than the previous rumors that suggested a price of $1,000 or as much as $1,400. In other words, Meta seems to be taking a page from the Quest playbook, which is decidedly better for consumers.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, $800 is still a sizeable amount of money for most people, but it\u2019s not as bad when you consider new flagship phones. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25, Nothing\u2019s Phone 3, and Google\u2019s Pixel 9 all debuted at the same price, and as important as phones are, they don\u2019t often differ wildly between generations unless you wait three to five years. For someone who\u2019s interested in the smart glasses category and has some disposable income, $800 might just be enough to justify pulling the trigger. And sure, Meta\u2019s smart glasses (codenamed Hypernova, and not to be confused with its AR prototype Orion) won\u2019t have full phone-like ability, but according to Gurman, they will have one thing that people have been begging for in a pair of Meta-made specs: a screen.\nWith that screen (a single monocular display), Hypernova is said to have a much bigger bag of tricks compared to Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, the only pair of smart glasses it currently offers commercially. For one, Hypernova will reportedly have the ability to use \u201cmini-apps,\u201d as Gurman puts it, which could mean any number of things, including (I hope) navigation and messaging. To control those apps, Gurman says Meta plans to ship the glasses with a body-sensing wristband that takes inputs from hand movements and would be a novel move in the world of smart glasses. The Orion prototype used an electromyography (EMG) wristband controller; leaked images for Hypernova suggest the smart glasses will have its own wrist-worn device.\nMeta Hypernova and Ceres Wristband (low res) pic.twitter.com/N1QS28A5ef\n\u2014 Luna (@Lunayian) June 30, 2025\nOn top of that, a screen would also give Meta\u2019s Hypernova glasses the ability to display notifications, which is something that current-gen Ray-Bans are sorely lacking. And with the retention of a voice assistant, solid audio, and a camera for pictures and video, Hypernova could add up to something that comes damn-near close to being a phone replacement in some ways, or at least a capable fill-in. That brings me back to the price.\nAs important as phones are, I think most people would agree that skipping a generation (or two or three) isn\u2019t really going to be a big deal, and if people are presented with the opportunity to forego the next flagship phone in favor of a pair of smart glasses that actually expands their gadget wheelhouse and gives them lots of the same features in a different, useful, and maybe even exciting package, then I\u2019m willing to wager some will take it. Whether Hypernova will actually be any of those things remains to be seen, but at least Meta seems to be giving a decent number of people that chance to find out come September, when it\u2019s expected to unveil the glasses at its annual Connect conference."

      "text": "I\u2019ll admit it, I\u2019m a sucker for Atomic Purple. There\u2019s just something about the Game Boy nostalgia that gets me every time. Slap a translucent shell on just about anything and you\u2019ve got my attention. That goes for Nothing\u2019s products, these Beats earbuds, and the many, many retro Anbernic handhelds. Now, it goes for Bigscreen\u2019s Beyond 2e VR headset, too.\nWe're excited to partner with @VRChat to launch the Bigscreen Beyond 2e: VRChat Edition pic.twitter.com/iQy7CCEkYO\n\u2014 Bigscreen (@BigscreenVR) July 16, 2025\nThe recently released Beyond 2e isn\u2019t a huge departure from the Beyond 2, but it does sport an exclusive \u201cAtomic Purple\u201d shell that borrows style tips from Nintendo\u2019s iconic Atomic Purple colorway, which debuted on the 1998 Game Boy Color and later made its way to the N64. Not going to lie, I love it. Nostalgia, you dirty dog, you win again. While the Bigscreen Beyond 2e may look like a Game Boy, it\u2019s actually all about another thing\u2014VRChat.\nBigscreen made its new headset specifically for lovers of VRChat, a VR game-turned-social platform where you get to sport silly avatars and talk to other people. I could go down the rabbit hole talking about how strange VRChat can be, but for now, let\u2019s stick to hardware. From a technical perspective, there\u2019s not a huge difference between the Beyond 2 and 2e, but Bigscreen says that it did go all out to miniaturize its eye tracking. Believe it or not, according to them, the Beyond 2e has the world\u2019s smallest eye-tracking system and features a sensor the size of \u201ca grain of sand.\u201d To help that tiny sensor, Bigscreen says it also worked on the software side of things.\n\u201cUnlike prior approaches, Beyond 2e\u2019s eye-tracking algorithms utilize novel computer vision techniques. We trained AI models of the human pupil and run inference on GPUs in real-time on models fine-tuned to each unique individual,\u201d Bigscreen said in a statement.\nAs Bigscreen notes, eye tracking is a big part of delivering a solid VRChat experience since it helps players translate their expressions more and make avatars more lifelike. It\u2019s hard to say how all of that hard work paid off from an eye-tracking perspective, but the fact that it can shrink something like that down so much is a feat in and of itself. For hardcore VRChat fans, this may not be the most high-tech experience (tethered headsets are still best for that), but it is lightweight at 107 grams, which is hard to argue with.\nOutside of eye tracking, Bigscreen is also including some other perks for VRChat users, including a special VRChat-themed box and some exclusive items and stickers for in-game use. If you\u2019re as jazzed about this Atomic Purple headset as I am, you may want to place a preorder quickly. Bigscreen\u2019s Beyond 2e is limited edition and only available \u201cwhile supplies last.\u201d It starts at $1,269 but may be more expensive depending on what cushion you choose. It\u2019s set to ship in September."

      "text": "Meta might be the splashiest purveyor of smart glasses out there, but Zuck\u2019s house isn\u2019t alone in chasing AR eyewear. In fact, if you want a pair of smart glasses with a display in them\u2014frames that are technically more advanced than Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans\u2014you can buy one right now, and upstarts like Rokid are among the few offering that in the U.S.\nRokid just unveiled its new smart glasses, aptly dubbed Rokid Glasses, which pack a monochrome display in each eye with 1,500 nits of max brightness. Those displays (which are green-colored micro LED) can be used for simple app-like tools like navigation and even a \u201cteleprompter\u201d that can show scrolling text for presentations and keynotes. Game over, regular teleprompters; it\u2019s time for nerd glasses to shine.\nRokid is also claiming that its smart glasses are the lightest camera-equipped specs that combine audio, AI, and AR. That\u2019s a lofty claim, to be sure, but the Rokid Glasses are objectively light. According to the company, they weigh just 49 grams, thanks to a magnesium-aluminum alloy frame. That\u2019s around the same weight as Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, which weigh between 48 and 51 grams, though Meta\u2019s don\u2019t have a display of any kind. Arguably more so than the weight, I\u2019m curious about how slim Rokid Glasses look and whether they can match Meta\u2019s regular sunglasses-like form factor.\nLike any modern pair of smart glasses, Rokid Glasses will also come with a camera that has a serviceable 12-megapixel sensor and can record in up to 60 frames per second, though Rokid doesn\u2019t say for how long. One thing I love (at least on paper) about the camera functionality of Rokid Glasses is that Rokid allows you to take pictures and record videos in different aspect ratios (3:4, 9:16, 4:3), unlike Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans.\nThere are also speakers for open audio (great for listening to music) and a four-mic array for taking calls and using voice assistants like ChatGPT. Since we\u2019re already talking about AI; Rokid Glasses will come with a host of AI features similar to Meta\u2019s Ray-Bans, including object recognition, real-time translation, and AI transcription (asking your smart glasses to read text printed on a menu or sheet of paper). Those aren\u2019t novel, but they\u2019re increasingly standard when it comes to the new wave of AI-powered smart glasses.\nOne thing I\u2019m very curious about is the battery life. According to the company, the Rokid Glasses have a 210mAh battery, which sounds solid, though smart glasses with a display have a habit of eating up battery life very quickly, and if you\u2019re listening to music and using a voice assistant at the same time, demand on the battery piles up quickly. At least they support fast charging for when you need a quick top-up.\nRokid Glasses will be pricier than a pair of Meta Ray-Bans, but that\u2019s to be expected given the fact that they can do quite a bit more with two built-in displays. Rokid says a Kickstarter campaign will start pricing at $499, and the glasses will MSRP at $599, though there\u2019s no current launch date outside of the crowdfunded launch."

      "text": "Meta is back to teasing its futuristic body-reading wristband, and this time around, it\u2019s getting a little more specific with what the wearable can do. In short? It looks like all that high-level research is paying off. Meta published a new research paper in the journal Nature, showcasing progress on its sEMG-RD wearable, a device that was most recently shown at its Connect conference in 2024. That device, using sensors on a wristband, can read electrical signals in your muscles and translate them into inputs on a computer. With such a body-to-computer interface, users are able to control stuff on a screen, move a mouse cursor or windows, and open apps, all without ever physically touching a controller. Pretty neat.\nWhile all of that is fairly similar to what Meta has teased before\u2014it\u2019s been working on a similar device since 2021\u2014according to researchers, the latest prototype boasts some key improvements over predecessors. For one, previous versions of such a device needed to be trained on specific individuals to work, but this prototype uses a neural network to quickly assess the signals from whoever is wearing the wristband and can then tailor the device to that user. In short, Meta\u2019s new prototype and its corresponding software make the wristband feel a lot more feasible as a future wearable that\u2019s commercially available.\nImagine controlling your devices with a subtle hand or finger gesture. Our cutting-edge research turns intent and muscle signals into seamless computer control. This breakthrough wrist technology is redefining how we interact with computers\u2014intuitive, precise, and ready for the\u2026 pic.twitter.com/2dXERZYqkY\n\u2014 Meta (@Meta) July 23, 2025\nThat same advancement in understanding gestures also paves the way for more sophistication in the types of gestures that the wristband understands, too. Researchers say that with more complex software that can better understand your body, the wristband may also be able to interpret inputs like force (i.e., how tightly or softly you\u2019re gripping a virtual object). That would obviously have some interesting applications to games and experiences in both VR and AR, two areas that Meta is keenly attuned to.\nNo matter which way you spin it, Meta\u2019s wristband is gaining momentum since its debut several years ago, and the paper in Nature has the receipts to back that up. According to researchers, the current permutation of the device can do interesting stuff, like translate your handwriting at a rate of 20.9 words per minute. That\u2019s obviously not a real keyboard-level speed, but the fact that a wristband can interpret data like that at all is pretty wild.\nThere are lots of potential applications that extend beyond the consumer world, particularly for anyone who\u2019s disabled, since wristbands like this need only read the electrical signals you\u2019re sending through your body, as opposed to current camera-based inputs that need to track your hand. Both the Meta Quest 3 and Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headsets already offer that hand-tracking technology, by the way, and the results aren\u2019t exactly perfect. More than anything, its paper in Nature advances Meta\u2019s reputation as a leader in future AR and VR tech, whether experimental or not. Say what you will about Meta, but it\u2019s certainly spent a lot of time and money paving the way toward a more robust and interesting VR future, and for that, I use the electrical signals created by my brain to give it a big thumbs up."

      "text": "We\u2019re going back to IFA in Berlin! Well, some members of the Gizmodo crew, including our consumer tech reporter, Kyle Barr, will be roaming the labyrinthine halls of the Messe Berlin to find the smartest, coolest, and weirdest consumer electronics you\u2019ll have the luxury of spending your hard-earned paychecks on in the near-ish future. The rest of the gang will be hanging back and live blogging from afar.\nExpect the usual tech giants like Lenovo and Samsung to have a big presence. If you\u2019ve ever been to IFA (it\u2019s open to the public), you\u2019ll know there\u2019s a lot to take in. You\u2019ll definitely get your steps in, walking miles just to see a new laptop or the latest robot vacuum. IFA is not quite as expansive as CES, and even though there are attendees from all over the world, nothing compares to the sardine-packed hellscape that is Sin City every January.\nEurope\u2019s largest tech show officially runs from Sept. 5 through Sept. 9, but Gizmodo will be tackling the show in the few days right after Labor Day, when many announcements drop early. Bookmark this page and Ctrl/Cmd+R often, because we\u2019ll be updating this live blog often throughout the multi-day show.\nYou\u2019ve Heard of Convertibles, but How About Flippables?\nLenovo is known for going hard on concept devices (some even become real products, like the ThinkBook Rollable). Or, at least, it\u2019s one of the few major companies willing to show off what its engineers are cooking up behind the scenes. The laptop makers didn\u2019t disappoint at IFA 2025. First up is the ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept. It\u2019s a laptop with a screen built on a pivot point, meaning you can spin it from horizontal to vertical. I know you\u2019re already asking, why would I want that? Having a vertical display on demand may be convenient if you prefer to read an article without scrolling a paragraph at a time through ads. Coders also make good use of vertical displays. It\u2019s one of those designs I honestly think has a wider use case than even a foldable or rollable laptop.\nThen there\u2019s the Smart Motion Concept. It\u2019s a giant, heavy laptop stand that uses the laptop\u2019s camera to track your face. Imagine if you\u2019re in a Zoom call with your company, and you can\u2019t even duck out of frame to avoid its scrutiny. \u2014Kyle Barr\nLenovo\u2019s Yoga Tablet Can Do a Split\nFor all those folk still holding out hope for Android tablets to make a resurgence, Lenovo\u2019s Yoga Tab already sounds like an iPad Air alternative. The 11-inch tablet is built with the Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 3 mobile chip and has up to 12GB of RAM. The 3.2K OLED display supports Dolby Vision HDR (no, not Dolby Vision 2) with a rather high stated brightness. When hooked up with the keyboard and its built-in flat-panel kickstand, the Yoga Tab could make for a fair-looking pint-sized PC alternative, especially with the magnetic stylus attachment point. \u2014Kyle Barr\nHallo, Moto\nSometimes, I need Lenovo to remind me it owns Motorola. At IFA, Lenovo showed off the new Moto G06, the Moto G06 Power, and an Edge 60 Neo. Even though the specs seem solid for mid-range devices, you\u2019ll have a real hard time getting them in the U.S. Instead, I finally had the chance to check out the Brilliant Collection edition of the Motorola Razr (2025), but in a stark white color that seems designed to pick up a sheen of dirt the next time you drop it in the dirt. It\u2019s a faux leather back with a look made to resemble a \u201cquilted pattern,\u201d but all it reminds me of is my grandparents\u2019 old upholstered cushions. \u2014Kyle Barr\nYup, There\u2019s the Legion Go 2 With an OLED Screen\nLenovo\u2019s sequel to its odd and peculiar Legion Go handheld PC, the Legion Go 2 (or you can call it the Legion Go [Gen 2], I guess), is finally coming, and soon. Lenovo says it will include an OLED display with support for variable refresh rate (VRR). That\u2019s already more enticing if you\u2019re one of the Nintendo Switch OLED players miffed about the Switch 2\u2019s return to IPS LCD. It will still have the breakaway controllers with the built-in mouse sensor for players to wield like a flight stick in \u201cFPS mode.\u201d The Legion Go 2 uses an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, which promises better performance over the last-gen handhelds. The big questions about price, availability, and performance will need to come later.\nOh, if you still prefer laptops, Lenovo is dropping a new version of its Lenovo Legion Pro 7 with a high-end gaming CPU, the AMD Ryzen 9 9955X3D. With that processor, it promises to be a truly powerful gaming machine. \u2014Kyle Barr\nHow Would You Like a ThinkPad\u2026 in White?\nLenovo\u2019s press conference announcing its new products started off with a focus on its iconic business laptop brand. Along with a host of new ThinkPad devices, including the thick and heavy-duty ThinkPad P16 that can be configured with up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX Pro discrete mobile GPU, perhaps the most enticing is a \u201cglacial white\u201d ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition. It\u2019s exactly the same as the regular X9 in black, but it\u2019s the best way to look distinct among your ThinkPad-obsessed peers. It\u2019s only going to be available in limited quantities for people in the U.S. The only thing missing is the red TrackPoint \u201cnipple\u201d that\u2019s so iconic for ThinkPad devices. \u2014Kyle Barr\nThe Last AI Companion You\u2019ll Ever Need (Said Threateningly)\nCall me old-fashioned, but back in my day, stuffed animals just needed a cute face and some polyester. This is 2025, though, and now we\u2019re stuffing on-device LLMs into cute stuff because apparently your imagination just isn\u2019t enough.\nI\u2019m speaking, of course, about SwitchBot\u2019s new furry AI companion that apparently watches what you do all the time and gets \u201cjealous.\u201d Fun for the whole family if you ask me! Our staff writer, Kyle Barr, got to see this thing on the IFA show floor and said, \u201cAll it did was stare at me.\u201d Nothing weird to see here, folks! \u2014James Pero\nSure, Why Not Add AI Into Robot Vacuums\nOnly time will tell whether or not the robot vacuums\u2014they can slip on little mech suits and climb up stairs now\u2014will rise up and kill us all thanks to AI. But until that happens, we\u2019ll play along and believe that companies like Ecovacs adding AI into their wheeled floor cleaners is all in the name of better cleaning without us lazy humans having to constantly tell them where and how to clean. That\u2019s what the Deebot X11 OmniCyclone promises, at least. The $1,500 robot vacuum also has better motors that can climb over different floor materials (i.e. rug to wood and over the little dividers that separate them). \u2014Raymond Wong\nCheck out Wes\u2019s first impressions of the Deebot X11 OmniCyclone here:\nAerospace-Grade Shaving Power\nHave you ever looked at your electric shaver and thought: This is great, but what if it were made out of the same stuff that airplanes are made out of? Me neither, but that didn\u2019t stop Laifen from doing it anyway. Here is its electric shaver made from aerospace-grade aluminum alloy. I can\u2019t tell if its T1 Pro shaver is ready to make my head slick or detonate some C4. Either way, this is one shaver you don\u2019t have to worry about getting crushed in your overnight bag. \u2014James Pero\nUh-Oh, the Robot Vacuums Are Climbing Now\nAh, yes, stairs. The mortal enemy of robot vacuums everywhere. But maybe not for long. Eufy announced its next generation of robot vacuums and an accessory called the MarsWalker, which is a little mech suit for climbing up steps. The great part about this cool (if slightly bizarre) solution is that it means preexisting Eufy robot vacuums could also gain the ability to climb steps just by hopping in a mech and using its legs to start climbing.\nIn this case, we saw the MarsWalker coupled with Eufy\u2019s Omni S2, a new robo-vac, and a follow-up to its Omni S1 Pro self-cleaning robot vacuum. Outside of climbing stairs, the Omni S2 is also geared towards tackling pitfalls of other robot vacuums, like adapting to different floor surfaces, addressing bad carpet performance, and their bad habit of getting clogged. I\u2019m personally looking forward to seeing what happens when we inevitably get AI involved, too. A robot vacuum that can climb and tell me to put glue on my pizza? Sign me up. \u2014James Pero\nA Bright Idea for Security From Philips\nWhether or not you knew it, your Philips Hue bulbs (or most of them, at least) have been capable of motion detection this whole time. Thanks to an update from Philips and its new Hue Bridge Pro, most generations of Philips Hue bulbs can now use a feature called MotionAware that activates bulbs when movement is detected in the room.\nMotionAware, which is enabled by new algorithms in the Hue Bridge Pro, uses radio frequencies already present in every generation of Hue smart bulb since 2014 and can also double as a security tool for detecting burglars. It\u2019s creepy but also cool, and according to Philips, all of the motion activity is stored locally on its Bridge Pro hub, which is ideal since I don\u2019t fancy Philips knowing where I am in my own apartment. \u2014James Pero\nGovee\u2019s Christmas Lights All Year Round\nSanta is gonna be confused\u2014or impressed\u2014when he lands on people\u2019s roofs and sees their houses decked out in Govee\u2019s Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism, er, lights. The lighting system supports up to 16 million colors and can create a tricolor lighting effect from each LED. Basically, these are permanent Christmas lights that you can leave up all year round and program to output different colors and lighting patterns throughout the year. Halloween is coming up, so maybe an orange theme? Kyle Barr\u2019s got the lowdown on the Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism below.\nGovee also has a new Backlight 3 Pro lighting system for TVs that uses \u201ccinema-quality\u201d lenses to match the lighting to the content you\u2019re watching. \u2014Raymond Wong\nMaingear\u2019s Super 16 Gaming Laptop Jumps to 300Hz\nMaingear\u2019s new Super 16 gaming laptop is a beast by every spec. The 16-incher has an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti mobile GPU. But the marquee spec is its 300Hz IPS LCD display. Yes, it\u2019s not OLED, but the stupidly high refresh rate means you have no excuse when you lose a match of Fortnite or Valorant or whatever game you think you don\u2019t suck at. \u2014Raymond Wong\nA TCL TV So Bright, You May Need to Put on Sunglasses\nThe NXTPaper 60 Ultra phone has a cool screen, but TCL\u2019s bread and butter is TVs. So, of course, it\u2019s got a new TV at IFA. The honor goes to the QM9K, a mini LED 4K TV with 6,500 nits of peak brightness and up to 144Hz refresh rates. Long story short, TCL\u2019s TV will blind you with so much brightness you won\u2019t know whether you\u2019re in heaven or hell. Oh, it also has built-in Gemini because AI, AI, AI. Shoving Gemini into TVs is the new shoving Google Assistant/Alexa into TVs. \u2014Raymond Wong\niPhone 17 Won\u2019t Have This Screen Technology\nLook, we know that Apple is announcing the iPhone 17 family next week, but if you want something different, perhaps TCL\u2019s NXTPaper 60 Ultra will fancy you. The standout feature on the Android phone is its second-gen NXTPpaper 4 screen technology. The matte screen is supposed to be more paper-like, offer zero flicker, and have more natural backlighting than the blue light emitting from regular phones. According to TCL, all of these features make the phone a lot easier on your eyes. There is one catch: it\u2019s not available in North America. Europeans can get it for 449 euros or about $524. Check out Kyle Barr\u2019s write-up below. \u2014Raymond Wong\nAnother One for the Fans\nAlongside the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra tablets, Samsung also announced the Galaxy S25 FE at IFA 2025. And as you\u2019d expect, the \u201d $650 \u201cFan Edition\u201d smartphone is made up of parts mostly from the $1,000 S25+. There\u2019s a 6.7-inch display and a 4,900mAh battery. The telephoto camera got a resolution downgrade, and there\u2019s less base storage (128GB vs. 256GB), but otherwise, it seems to be a solid value if you\u2019ve got exactly $650 to spend on a new phone and don\u2019t want to splurge any more. Read all about the S25 FE and what it has and doesn\u2019t have below. \u2014Raymond Wong\nSamsung\u2019s Big and Absolutely Huge Galaxy Tab S11 Tablets\nTeased last week, Samsung announced its new Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra Android tablets today. You can read my write-up about all the differences between the two slates, but if you\u2019re short on time, just know that the Tab S11 has an 11-inch screen and the Tab S11 Ultra has a 14.6-inch display. The bigger model also has an anti-reflective coating on the screen, which should reduce glare by quite a bit, especially if you\u2019re gonna be using it outdoors. \u2014Raymond Wong\nDreame\u2019s Stair-Climbing Robovac Has Chainsaw Arms\nDid you watch the Chainsaw Man anime and wonder to yourself what a robovac version of the chainsaw-headed Pochita would look like? Behold: Dreame\u2019s Cyber X, a dock for the robovac with four separate arms and tank-like treads made to haul itself up stairs. When up on all fours, the device looks like a killer robot spider and is much more severe than Anker\u2019s similar MarsWalker that also made its debut at IFA 2025. The CyberX\u2019s rubberized tracks are supposed to help it stick to both rug and hardwood surfaces. The device also uses a laser and camera system to navigate horizontally or up flights of stairs. \u2014Kyle Barr\nThat Company You Know for Robovacs Now Makes Robo Lawnmowers\nRoborock sounds like the kind of company that already makes automatic construction vehicles, not mainly robovacs. The company is branching out now into lawn care with a slate of three mowers headlined by the Roborock RockMow Z1. The big feature of this mower compared to competing products from companies like Yarbo is how it handles slopes. The RockMow Z1 has an all-wheel drive system, and independent hub motors on the two front wheels help the mower tackle 80 percent, or around 38-degree, surfaces. Otherwise, it\u2019s using both visual sensors and satellite-based, real-time kinematics for hitting all corners of your lawn. \u2014Kyle Barr\nRoborock\u2019s New Washer/Dryer Has a Robovac Doggy Door\nIf we\u2019re keen to save space for all our extraneous gadgets, why should our robovacs\u2019 charging unit take up so much room? Roborock\u2019s 4-in-1 Homewide Cleaning Combo includes a secret door tall enough for a robot vacuum to fit inside. The whole unit is a clothes washer and dryer combo, but the vacuum itself includes a mop function\u2014hence the 4-in-1 in the name. While the robovac doggy door is kind of neat, it will be interesting to learn how well it handles the dirty water from the mop.\nYou can check out Wes Davis\u2019s first impressions of the washer/dryer/ and robot vac dock combo here:\n\u2014Kyle Barr\nDamn, I Just Realized I Need a Dock With a Screen\nAnker\u2019s used to sticking screens on its big external chargers, but seeing its Prime Docking Station, I now realize just how useful it would be to have another screen where I plug in all my displays. It supports 140W fast charging through a single USB-C, and with the AnkerSense panel you can see how fast each of your connected devices is charging. Otherwise, the Prime Docking Station has enough ports for three displays (one DisplayPort and two HDMI) while promising support for 8K resolution at 60Hz through DisplayPort. If you\u2019re looking for something to supply the most juice possible to your devices, you should look at the 300W Anker Prime Power Bank. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWhy Not Just Buy a Movie Theater?\nAnker\u2019s Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro is an entire cinema in one massive, rollable package. While the original Nebula X1\u2019s big claim to fame was its internal liquid cooling and extra-large projection lens, the new version contains an entire speaker setup for spatial surround sound, either in your home or outdoors. The projector can hit 4K at 3,500 lumens, which is pretty damn bright, but it will also cost you $4,000. \u2014Kyle Barr\nAnker\u2019s AI Voice Transcriber Is So Damn Small\nAnker\u2019s Soundcore AI Voice Recorder will remind you of the Plaud NotePin AI voice transcription device for more than one reason. It\u2019s a coin-sized clip-on wearable that will listen to everything you say, or anything anybody says to you, and then transcribe and summarize it in an app. The AI Voice Recorder is smaller than Plaud\u2019s NotePin, though that may just make it easier to misplace when it\u2019s not kept on the charging unit. \u2014Kyle Barr\nCue the Rocky Theme Music\nFinally, our robovacs are finding ways to tackle the most daunting impediments to full-house cleaning: dreaded stairs. Anker\u2019s Eufy MarsWalker is essentially a robot suit for another Eufy cleaning robot built with four fold-out paddles on the exterior of each of its wheels. After achieving the right angle, the robot-robot exoskeleton can then ascend relatively steep stairs.\nThe MarsWalker currently supports Eufy\u2019s new Robot Vacuum Omni S2. It promises to give you a deep clean of your rugs to remove all the excess dirt and pet hair. It lifts up to 5 centimeters to attack thick carpets. The roving vacuum also includes a mop function using Anker\u2019s new HydroJet technology to scrub away stains on hard floors. The Omni S2 should be available sometime in January in the U.S. MarsWalker is a real product, which should arrive sometime in the first half of 2026. \u2014Kyle Barr\nPrint That Artwork on Anything\nAnker\u2019s eufyMake E1 UV Printer has been one of my most-anticipated gadgets since I saw it last year. It uses UV-activated ink to print on practically any surface, not just paper or canvas. What\u2019s even neater is how it can print in \u201c3D\u201d by applying multiple layers of ink to create a kind of effect akin to an oil painting. Now, finally, regular consumers should be able to get one if they missed the Kickstarter. The printer should be available starting in December at a starting price of $2,500. \u2014Kyle Barr\nAmazon\u2019s New Dongle\nAmazon-owned Eero has a dongle to sell you if you\u2019re an Eero customer. Called the Eero Signal, the dongle is a USB-C splitter that connects to an Eero router and lets you back up your Eero network over cellular data. In other words, it\u2019s handy for when you have an internet outage. Our freelancer and smart home expert, Wes Davis, has the details on the Eero Signal below. \u2014Raymond Wong\nWired Earbuds Are Back, Baby\nWired earbuds are back big-time, and Sony knows it. Introducing: the IER-EX15C, a pair of \u201cin-ear headphones,\u201d which come equipped with a wired USB-C connection. These wired earbuds are only $29.99 and give me flashbacks to the days of Apple\u2019s wired EarPods with a Lightning port.\nAll I can remember about the days of wired audio is having to constantly untangle my headphones before I listened to them, but Sony says its latest entry have a \u201cserrated design\u201d that\u2019s meant to prevent that. One great thing about wired earbuds like this is that they at least usually have a great mic and solid sound. I\u2019m still not ready to go back to 2012, but if that\u2019s your thing, you clearly have some new options. \u2014James Pero\nParty On, Samsung\nParty speakers seem to be a big thing this year at IFA, with entrants from JBL, Marshall, and now, Samsung. Samsung\u2019s new Sound Tower speaker has a revamped acoustic design over the last generation and comes in two variants. The top-of-the-line version has 18 hours of battery life and the biggest tweeters and woofers for a robust karaoke sound that will make your neighbors wish they\u2019d never been born. \u2014James Pero\nNo AirPods Left Behind\nNotable among the sea of accessories announcing at IFA 2025 this week is this Mophie Headphones Charging Stand. It\u2019s $150, which is kinda pricey, but it does have silicone cups and a magnetic USB-C dongle for quickly dropping AirPods Max into them for a charge. The aluminum base also has a Qi wireless charger for juicing up any AirPods or AirPods Pro, or non-Apple wireless earbuds that support wireless charging.\nMophie created the ultimate AirPods charging stand that Apple should have. \u2014Raymond Wong\nThe Polar Opposite Approach to Subcriptions\nPeople love Whoop\u2019s screenless fitness bands, but one thing they don\u2019t love is paying subscriptions forever and ever. Luckily, Polar and its new Polar Loop is here for anyone who isn\u2019t okay with adding another subscription to their life. The Polar Loop does all the same stuff as Whoop\u2019s band, too, including heart rate tracking, sleep monitoring, and step counting. Sorry, Whoop, maybe it\u2019s time to soften your stance on recurring fees. \u2014James Pero\nKickin\u2019 It With Acer\u2019s Kickstand-Equipped Tablets\nAcer announced a truckload of tablets at IFA 2025. There\u2019s the $320 Iconia X12 and $350 X14, and the $300 Iconia A14 and $340 A16. I haven\u2019t any clue whether these are good tablets or not. I do know that all of them except for the Iconia X12 have kickstands. I like kickstands on my gadgets. The 12-inch Surface Pro and the Nintendo Switch 2 have very nice kickstands. But the ones on these new Acer Iconia tablets? They look more like the gumstick one on the original Nintendo Switch, though they\u2019re longer and hopefully made of more durable material. \u2014Raymond Wong\nThe Iconia A16 (left) and Iconia X14 (right) also have kickstands!\nNo kickstand on the below Iconia X12:\nUgh, Now I Need a Tape-Playing Boombox\nI love ogling gadgets, but I hate when they actually make me want to spend money. The latest source of that frustration comes courtesy of We Are Rewind, which just announced its GB-001, a next-gen boombox that plays cassettes, looks cool, and still has all the modern trappings of wireless audio devices like Bluetooth and hi-fi sound. It even has analog needles for volume and recording levels. Check out my post for the full details. I don\u2019t need this boombox, but damn do I want it. \u2014James Pero\nFor People on the Move\nreMarkable\u2019s smaller e-paper device is official, and it\u2019s called the Paper Pro Move. Get it? For people on the move who need to jot stuff down but won\u2019t do that if they need to pull out a big iPad or Paper Pro from their backpack.\nThe Paper Pro Move starts at $449 with an included Marker stylus and features a 7.3-inch color E Ink display and 64GB of internal storage. Battery life is up to two weeks, according to reMarkable.\nI\u2019ll have a full review in the coming days, but for now, here\u2019s my first impressions (including thoughts on the handwriting-to-text recognition) of the device after using it for a few days:\n\u2014Raymond Wong\nNvidia\u2019s New AI Magic Trick\nNvidia has a whole new pipeline it claims will allow anybody to create 3D objects using AI. The company\u2019s 3D object generator blueprint can generate up to 20 objects based on a single prompt. Nvidia claims the tool takes into account the theme of the project you\u2019re working on and then creates 2D images that act as previews for the potential generated 3D model. You can then export those models to most 3D applications, such as Blender.\nNvidia suggested these tools aren\u2019t built to replace 3D modelers but allow them to more easily prototype a scene or rendering with \u201clow-fidelity assets.\u201d I\u2019ve seen Adobe\u2019s AI 3D modeling suite in action going back to 2024. Those objects were not what anybody would consider high-quality. Still, if you\u2019re growing tired of the number of AI-generated 2D images flooding online art repositories, which formerly featured human-created work, we may soon find 3D model sites filling up with even more prompt-created slop.\nYou could consider Nvidia\u2019s big contribution to this year\u2019s IFA its GB10 Blackwell Superchip\u2014an AI-centric version of its latest GPU microarchitecture fueling new devices like Acer\u2019s Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation. It may look like a mini PC, but it\u2019s a computer specifically built to test large language models or other generative AI locally, rather than relying on cloud-based processing. Nvidia has its own similar device, the DGX Sparx, that the company teased back at CES and is currently up for reservation. Acer said its Veriton will be available to North American customers for $4,000 a pop. \u2014Kyle Barr\nHow Big Do You Like Your Screens?\nAcer\u2019s Nitro XZ403CKR is one of those monitors that makes you wonder if 5K will become more mainstream outside of creator circles. It\u2019s a 39.7-inch curved ultrawide IPS LCD display with the notorious 5K2K spec, or 5,120 x 2,160 resolution. The best part is the monitor can still hit 180Hz refresh rates at 5K. At the wide FHD resolution\u2014equivalent to 1080p\u2014you could expect 288Hz. The refresh rate may not be blisteringly fast compared to some gaming displays, but it\u2019s more than enough for most players looking to play their games at 4K at high frame rates. Acer says the XZ403CKR will be available sometime early next year with a starting price of $1,000. \u2014Kyle Barr\nThe \u2018Predator Notebook\u2019 Wants to Be the Working Nerd\u2019s Favorite Laptop\nAcer\u2019s Predator Helios 18P AI looks like many of the company\u2019s previous big and thick gaming laptops. Let me halt your yawn, because there\u2019s a twist. The device has the kind of specs and security software you expect from a big workstation laptop, but it will still bloom with heavy RGB lights under the keyboard. It\u2019s the real mullet of gaming laptops, a \u201cbusiness in the front, party in the back\u201d situation. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWell, Now There\u2019s at Least One Intel Panther Lake Device Confirmed\nIntel hasn\u2019t exactly been quiet talking about its next generation of mobile chips, dubbed Panther Lake. While we\u2019re waiting for more official specs to tell us if this is the start to the beleaguered chipmaker\u2019s redemption arc, Acer mentioned it\u2019s working on an upcoming Swift 16 AI laptop that should have the chip inside. This CPU should provide better gaming performance\u2014something that leaks suggest will be a major selling point for both small and thin laptops and maybe even handhelds. Otherwise, everything is centered on AI, AI, and AI. If you could not begin to care about on-device AI processing, the Swift 16 has an extra-large trackpad with stylus support, kind of like the company\u2019s Triton 14 AI. \u2014Kyle Barr\nAcer CEO Jason Chen Rides the 15 Feet to the Stage on a Scooter\nI\u2019m not sure why tech companies have to show they\u2019re always using tech, even if it\u2019s to move the 15 feet to start presenting its refreshed laptops. Acer CEO Jason Chen took one of the company\u2019s Predator e-scooters to the center of the stage to talk about its sustainability goals. I\u2019m not here to dive into the company\u2019s stated green goals and how the impact of global supply chains on climate change may conflict with that. At least the scooter wasn\u2019t running, because that would have been a waste of electricity.\nIf you\u2019re awake right now, you can watch along with me here. The actual hardware is still incoming. First up are Chromebooks. \u201cThe most advanced Chromebook\u201d from Acer, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514, features the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip last seen in the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14. That processor is noticeably extra for ChromeOS, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s a convertible too, so it\u2019ll act as a tablet with an optional 2.8K OLED display. \u2014Kyle Barr\nEdit: For those of you who want a closer look at Acer\u2019s new $699 Chromebook, here it is. Here\u2019s a reminder: you don\u2019t need to stick with ChromeOS. If you\u2019re considering the open-source operating system Linux, the Chromebook Plus Spin could offer solid bang for your buck.\nAcer\u2019s Doing Acer Things\nI\u2019m here at Acer\u2019s press conference, and the PC maker is playing the music way too loud at the City Cube Innovation Stage in the Messe Berlin convention center. I have an idea of what to expect, though it may be hard to top last year\u2019s conference. In 2024, the company debuted several cool concept devices, like its deranged Dual Play gaming laptop with a controller built into the trackpad. There were other small-form gaming laptops and interesting devices like hot-swappable desktop PC SSDs. I\u2019d love more crazy gadgets, but I have a feeling this year\u2019s devices will be more humdrum. Just give me a surprise, please. Or better yet, tell me when you\u2019re finally going to launch your Acer Nitro Blaze and Blaze 11 handhelds. \u2014Kyle Barr\nIf Don Draper Went Dolby Atmos\nMarshall is back with another soundbar, and, as usual, it\u2019s leaning on some appealing mid-century design. The Heston 60 is more compact than its predecessor and maybe not as powerful, but who really cares when you\u2019ve got this smooth \u201970s cream color? Read my post below for the full details. \u2014James Pero\nGet Your Ice-Cold JBL Speaker Here\nSummer might be coming to a close, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have time to double-fist a beer and JBL\u2019s new Bluetooth speaker. According to JBL, its new Grip speaker is inspired by a can of seltzer. I personally think of an ice-cold beer (tallboy) when I see it, but that\u2019s just me.\nIn keeping with the seltzer inspiration, this speaker is IP68 rated, so it won\u2019t get damaged by water easily. They also come in quite a few fun colors (purple is my favorite) and have a programmable light on the back panel. The main thing with the Grip is that it\u2019s portable, so it has a loop attached that you can hook a rope through to carry on your bike or backpack, but I request that you please bike responsibly. For all the details, you can read my post below. \u2014James Pero\nEven HDR Can\u2019t Escape AI\nSome 10 years after Dolby Vision first came out to bring HDR to the masses, the audio and visual technology company is advancing things forward with *drum roll* Vision 2. And the crowd goes wild!\nHard to tell (no pun intended) whether or not Dolby Vision 2 actually brings anything noticeable to the naked eye. I mean, how many colors can you actually discern? I dunno about you, but my sight is only getting worse with age, and so too is their ability to see more shades. Who has the \u201cgolden eyes\u201d (coining this term as the visual version of \u201cgolden ears\u201d for audio) to appreciate Vision 2 to its fullest?\nOur Senior Reporter James Pero has the breakdown on what\u2019s new in Vision 2 here:\nIt mostly boils down to \u201cContent Intelligence\u201d which is jargon for using AI to adjust picture quality based on what you\u2019re watching and where you\u2019re watching. Yes, really! Then, there\u2019s also Vision 2 Max. Again, yes, really! Go read about\u2026 if you\u2019re an HDR enthusiast looking for a reason to buy a new TV with Dolby Vision 2. Or just wait for Vision 2 to come to inevitably come to an iPhone or something. \u2014Raymond Wong\nBegun, the Thin Phone War Has\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a super skinny phone that doesn\u2019t have battery compromises, you probably shouldn\u2019t get Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Edge or Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 Air, which will be announced at Apple\u2019s \u201cAwe dropping\u201d event next week on Sept. 9. You might want to look into the Tecno POVA Slim, which is reportedly 5.95mm thin and has a 5,160mAh battery, according to tech reviewer Ben Sin.\nThe Tecno POVA Slim, launching at IFA, measures only 5.95mm but with a 5160 mAh battery. That's crucial because I don't see what's so impressive about a \"thin phone\" if the battery shrunk down. And yes I will keep this energy in September 9 pic.twitter.com/pOBsYdnX6o\n\u2014 ben sin (@bencsin) August 28, 2025\nSin shared a few images of the thin phone on X, and as you can see, it appears to have two cameras (one more than the iPhone 17 Air), but also a signature feature that Samsung ditched years ago: curved glass edges. Anything to make the phone look and feel even thinner in the hand, amirite? \u2014Raymond Wong\nA Little Light on Philips Hue at IFA\nSmart light brands Philips Hue has a few announcements planned for the next few days. Last month, the lighting fanatics over at HueBlog were keeping track of several upcoming products the company self-leaked on its own website. These include several more products for the Hue Secure line, including a long-rumored smart doorbell. Philips Hue is also reportedly planning all-new Festavia lights that look like a more permanent garland feature with a few spotlights. There are several more smart bulbs coming down the pike as well.\nThe big news may be a Hue Bridge Pro. This is a device that allows Hue devices to connect with the Matter smart home standard, which allows interoperability between several different brands. Philips Hue does not support Matter natively, as it normally only works over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Thread. The latter is a low-power Wi-Fi-like connection between devices that lets them communicate. According to HueBlog, Philips Hue isn\u2019t abandoning its love affair with Wi-Fi and Zigbee\u2014a separate communication protocol. However, it may be introducing some kind of radio chip that could support Thread into its latest products without having to rely on the Hue Bridge Pro. We\u2019ll know more in the coming days. Philips Hue is holding a large announcement soiree on Sept. 3. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWhat\u2019s in My Pack: IFA 2025 Edition\nI\u2019ll be in Berlin in just a few days. Already, my thoughts are burned with the memory of the Messe Berlin convention center and its utterly nonsensical layout. If you\u2019ve never had to meander those labyrinthine halls, where one can lose their sanity as fast as they lose their way, then my advice is to travel light. I\u2019m stuffing my Patagonia 55L Black Hole duffel with my usual essentials plus everything I\u2019ll need for quick capture and content creation. I\u2019m still testing the Insta360 Go Ultra, which will be especially useful for POV shots as I eat my hundredth bratwurst (and possibly shoot some wacky gadgets). Alongside a DJI Osmo Mobile 6 and a simple USB-C lavalier mic, I\u2019m packing my ancient Nikon D3400 DSLR. It\u2019s light, foolproof, and does the job. I don\u2019t have to worry much if I damage or lose it.\nFor moving between nations with different outlet dimensions, I rely on my Anker Nano Travel Adapter. My 14-inch MacBook Pro 14 with M4 will keep me company as I write these blogs, but of course you probably spotted my Nintendo Switch 2. It\u2019s sporting vinyl stickers from Dbrand as well as the company\u2019s KillSwitch case grips. I\u2019m still making use of Dbrand\u2019s travel cover, but I\u2019ve since replaced the main case with Genki\u2019s Attack Vector. That shell includes a MagSafe attachment point that lets me hook up an external battery for when the handheld inevitably dies on the plane. We\u2019ll find out if I\u2019ll have any time to relax to play it or read more of Micaiah Johnson\u2019s Those Beyond the Wall. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWhat\u2019s DJI Bringing to IFA?\nDJI, the company you likely most associate with drones, has a few new products on its plate that have little to do with UAVs. We expect the China-based company to offer us a look at its new $220 Mic 3. This is a compact wireless microphone setup that\u2019s best described as a cross between the company\u2019s Mic mini and Mic 2. Each of the pack\u2019s two mics weighs in at just 16 grams\u2014half that of the DJI Mic 2\u2014though you can still adjust the transmitter\u2019s orientation. It can now support up to four transmitters and eight receivers at once, in case you want to capture an entire podcast debate that hopefully won\u2019t go viral for all the wrong reasons. In addition, new leaks suggest DJI is planning on producing a new action camera with a magnetic lens pod \u00e0 la the Insta360 Go 3S.\n\ud83d\udc49Here is our little Osmo Nano, which is set to compete with Go Ultra.\n\u2705Built-in memory 64 GB / 128 GB\n\u2705OLED touchscreen for one-handed control.\n\u2705Charges from the module to 80% in just 20 minutes.\n\u2705SD card slot\n\u2705Magnetic body for mounting anywhere#osmonano pic.twitter.com/12tvl5ZMDf\u2014 Igor Bogdanov (@Quadro_News) August 28, 2025\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see what actually shows up at the DJI IFA booth come Sept. 5. \u2014Kyle Barr\nreMarkably Mini?\nreMarkable\u2019s e-paper tablets have gained something of a cult following. People who use them love them to death. It\u2019s not hard to see why\u2014writing on the slim displays is closer to pen and paper than an iPad and Apple Pencil.\nThe company has started teasing \u201csomething\u201d that\u2019s \u201con the move.\u201d Speculation is that it\u2019ll be a mini version of the Paper Pro. It better have a color e-paper display or else. \u2014Raymond Wong\nSamsung Teases New Galaxy Tab\nSamsung is doing its own virtual Unpacked event on Sept. 4 to announce a new Galaxy Tab. Most likely refreshed versions of the Galaxy Tab S10+ and Tab S10 Ultra. Anybody wanna take bets on the name? I\u2019m going with Galaxy Tab S11+ and Tab S11 Ultra.\nAs for what to expect from the tablets. Well, they\u2019ll run Android and likely with Samsung\u2019s own One UI 8 interface. More Galaxy AI features are a safe bet. Ditto for Google Gemini integration. AI, AI, AI\u2014you know?\nThe Tab S10 Ultra had a gargantuan 14.6-inch display. I say go bigger or go home. Give us a 16- or 18-inch tablet that dwarfs even the biggest 12.9-inch M4 iPad Pro. Why the hell not? \u2014Raymond Wong"

      "text": "Two years ago, at CES 2023, I looked into my augmented reality crystal ball and predicted that it wouldn\u2019t be long before we were talking about \u201cglassholes\u201d all over again. CES 2025 was inundated with AR glasses, and you couldn\u2019t walk five feet without finding another booth begging you to slip a pair over your eyes. The glasses\u2019 displays are looking better than ever. The controls are feeling tighter. And yet, they\u2019re not there yet, not by miles. The best glasses we used were merely screen replacements.\nCompanies like Chamelo trotted out smart glasses with color-changing lenses. Beyond those, there were hordes of of glasses that function as wearable cameras, essentially equivalent to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses that have become increasingly popular these last two years. These weren\u2019t all small companies, either. Alongside new handhelds, Lenovo debuted a revised pair of glasses, the $400 Legion Glasses 2. They are an update to the company\u2019s similar, tethered glasses from 2023 with far better screen clarity and brightness. You have to position them on your face just right, but they offer great-looking micro-OLED displays and loud, clear audio.\nThose glasses were made for handhelds, though they\u2019re still ancillary to the mobile gaming experience. Similarly, AR glasses maker XReal trotted out its $500 XReal One and $600 XReal One Pro. These glasses tether to your phone or computer to create a secondary screen. They include a switch to cement the image in place or have it follow your head where you look. Even better, they offer ultrawide screen view when tethered to a PC, so you can get that Apple Vision Pro ultrawide Mac mirroring experience at a fraction of the price. They were our favorite glasses of the convention, and they earned a spot on our best of show list.\nThe Functional AR Glasses of CES 2025 Were Full of Blazing Green Text\nAs our readers were keen to point out, XReal\u2019s latest doesn\u2019t fit the mold of \u201caugmented reality\u201d or even \u201cextended reality.\u201d It\u2019s a hard thing to hear, but all those glasses with any true XR bent were merely prototypes. In the two years since I wrote my original AR CES article, these glasses are still trying to fix the same issues.\nTake TCL\u2019s RayNeo brand. The company slipped its RayNeo X3 Pro around my eyes and tried to get them to translate text from Mandarin to English. It worked, at least most of the time. With too much clamor around us, the glasses struggled to interpret language accurately or hear our commands. Even then, the translation was slow and cumbersome, and it certainly didn\u2019t look or feel like a fully finished product. The glasses have touch controls on the right-side arm that worked\u2014mostly. As with other glasses, they require you to position them on your nose precisely to see the wall of green, beta text spelling out its AI-connected software. These were all similar issues I experienced with the company\u2019s prototype glasses from two years ago.\nAt least the RayNeo glasses were using Waveguide displays instead of projection, like on the XReal glasses. The company also mentioned its glasses include two sensors for image recognition and hand tracking, but I didn\u2019t get to demo any of those capabilities. Fellow glasses brand Rokid also had a pair of glasses that showed off app lists you could view on the glasses with some hand controls, but you still only see green text displayed on your AR environment.\nThat was a routine issue I experienced with other brands\u2019 products. I slapped the LAWK One glasses with their wraparound shades around my noggin, and I immediately felt like the kind of asshole who owns multiple jet skis and wants everyone to know they do. The glasses are made for the sporting users who want to start race timers in AR. Could it start a timer? Yes, but then you have ugly green text clogging up your field of view. LAWK also claims its new View glasses could stream live on TikTok, but I didn\u2019t get to try any of that functionality. Those are more of a Meta Ray-Ban-style glasses without a screen.\nSo Far, Nobody Has Cracked the All the Issues With AR Glasses\nBased on what I experienced, any real \u201caugmented reality\u201d glasses didn\u2019t feel like a full product, even though I wore similar designs at CES two years ago. Just like the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, I have a hard time trusting AI models with all but the simplest queries, and without on-device processing, they will still rely on external devices for anything you would actually want to use them for.\nMeta is one of the few companies to show us the possibilities of true AR glasses, though we still don\u2019t know when or if they\u2019ll become a product you can buy. The company\u2019s Orion project uses a pair of AR glasses, a wristband for motion controls, and a processing puck that sits in your pocket. Rumors hint Samsung may release its own pair of smart glasses this year with some more AI vision functionality, though based on those hints it certainly can\u2019t be a phone replacement, at least not yet.\nI\u2019m bullish on AR glasses. They have an appeal far beyond bulky and heavy VR headsets. XReal\u2019s landmark AR glasses from last year were the $700 Air 2 Ultra, which also featured some hand tracking and AR capabilities. They were limited when I tried them last year with a prototype UI. Developing an untethered UI is hard. The Spacetop G1 laptop from 2024 uses those same XReal glasses instead of a traditional screen, but it runs on an OS based on Android without the full functionality of a Windows PC or Mac. They\u2019re a developer haven, but not exactly the kind of device any Joe Schmo would reach for first.\nWe\u2019re still in the prototype phase for AR, but companies think there is a market for these devices now. Nobody but developers and self-proclaimed futurists will find most of these AR glasses useful in day-to-day life. But if you\u2019re on a cheap red-eye flight without a TV built into the backrest, these light, tethered, secondary screen glasses might prove a good way to watch a movie without the bulk of a laptop or\u2014worse\u2014a massive Apple Vision Pro headset."

      "text": "When Google Glass came stumbling onto the scene in 2013, people were taken aback. Not only did Google\u2019s smart glasses, with their bordering-on-novel camera, present new and somewhat icky questions about personal privacy, but they also crossed an even more controversial line: they looked really, really dorky. Fast forward more than 10 years into the future, and all of those hangups (at least on the surface) seem to be in the rearview. Take Meta, for example.\nSales of Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses have been surprisingly high, keeping even its waning Quest mixed reality headset afloat. Meta is rumored to be on the precipice of launching its first-ever pair of \u201creal\u201d smart glasses, which is to say glasses with an actual display in them. And naturally, more than a decade removed from Google Glass, the rhetoric around Meta\u2019s glasses (codenamed Hypernova) couldn\u2019t be more disparate from smart glasses of yore. People are excited; they\u2019re watching; even Apple is rumored to be looking at the field as a potential new frontier. So, this is all money in the bank for Meta, right? Maybe, but I wouldn\u2019t count those shiny new metaverse dollars just yet.\nSee Meta Oakley Glasses at Best Buy\nAs promising as Meta\u2019s push into smart glasses might be, there\u2019s one quirk with Hypernova that I can\u2019t seem to get off my mind. It\u2019s not the glasses themselves, necessarily, but the rumored \u201cneural wristband\u201d that reportedly comes with them. Let me backtrack for a moment for those that haven\u2019t been keeping up; as I mentioned previously, Meta\u2019s next smart glasses will most likely have a display. If they have a screen, then they\u2019re going to need a way for people to control things on said display, including \u201cmini apps,\u201d which are stripped-down versions of apps that can run on glasses and are a capability rumored by Bloomberg. There are a few ways you could go about controlling a pair of smart glasses with apps, but Meta\u2019s approach is allegedly a \u201cneural wristband,\u201d which is a wearable that reads the electrical signals in your arm for finger- and hand-based inputs. This is where the weirdness comes in.\nOn one hand (or wrist, I guess), a wristband that reads the signals sent through your brain and into your hand is objectively kind of awesome. Like, damn, that\u2019s some future shit if I\u2019ve ever seen it. On the other, it\u2019s a big liability at best. As useful as a wristband like that may be, asking people to strap on a wearable to use their smart glasses properly is a tall order. My guess is most people paying $800 (the rumored price of Hypernova) for a futuristic pair of smart glasses will want an all-in-one package. It\u2019s not a big deal on paper to remember to strap your wristband on, but what if it needs a charge? What if you don\u2019t like wearing stuff on your wrist or arm? Or\u2014and this is what I think is arguably the biggest problem\u2014what if you don\u2019t like how it looks?\nOne of the biggest problems with Google Glass, as I mentioned before, is that you looked like you were wearing a gadget when you had it on. So much so that anyone who dared slide them onto their face was dubbed a \u201cglasshole.\u201d It was Google Glass\u2019s noticeable camera module and display prism that turned it into a pariah and prevented what could have been a fruitful category of device from growing past an infancy stage. It\u2019s not all about looks, obviously\u20142013 was also a very different time when it came to personal privacy, a concept that has been severely eroded as the years have gone on. But I think there\u2019s a reason Meta\u2019s very much glasses-presenting Ray-Bans, which do almost everything Google Glass did and more, have caught on, and presentation is a major part of that.\nBut hey, things are definitely different now, and maybe the same can be said for what people are willing to wear on their bodies or not. All I know is that it seems like a lot of what could make Hypernova useful or special comes down to a wearable, and while smart glasses might be a semi-proven category, wristbands are not. Google Glass might be long dead, but just because those mistakes are in the rearview doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be made again."
