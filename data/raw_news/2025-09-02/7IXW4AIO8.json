  "description": "Aryna Sabalenka, the world's No. 1 women's tennis player, says tequila is \"better on the body,\" though doctors emphasize all alcohol carries health risks.",
  "content": "A top tennis star said she \"feels great\" after drinking tequila, but health experts say to take that not with a squeeze of lime, but a grain of salt.\n\nAryna Sabalenka, the world's No. 1-ranked women's tennis player and reigning U.S. Open champion, recently told Air Mail magazine that tequila is \"much better on the body.\"\n\nSabalenka, a brand ambassador for Maestro Dobel, the official tequila sponsor of the U.S. Open, said she prefers reposado tequila, which is barrel-aged and known for its smooth, mellow flavor.\n\n\"You just sip it as a whiskey or Cognac, but it has a better taste, and the next day you feel great,\" the Belarusian player told the outlet.\n\nSabalenka has joined a growing list of athletes and celebrities \u2013 including Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, LeBron James and Michael Jordan \u2013 who have endorsed or launched tequila brands, helping reposition the spirit as a \"cleaner,\" wellness-friendly drink.\n\nThere might be something to the buzz, industry insiders say.\n\n\"We hear it constantly: Tequila makes people feel lighter, less weighed-down and more energized compared to other liquors,\" Jon-Paul Fortunati, the Los Angeles-based CEO of Cazcanes Tequila, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Additive-free, carefully distilled tequila will almost always deliver a cleaner experience than spirits that rely on sweeteners or shortcuts.\"\n\nYounger drinkers are driving this shift, Fortunati said, choosing tequila because it feels \"both celebratory and mindful.\"\n\nBrent Hocking, founder of Tequila Purisima, said tequila also stands out for the transparency of its ingredients.\n\n\"Among spirits, tequila \u2014 especially additive-free tequila made from 100% Blue Weber agave \u2014 offers a level of clarity that's increasingly rare,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\nBut not all bottles qualify. Many mass-market tequilas contain sweeteners, coloring agents or glycerin to mask shortcuts in production, Hocking warned.\n\n7 BEST LOW-CARB BEERS THAT ARE ALSO BIG ON FLAVOR, ACCORDING TO NEW RANKING\n\n\"There's something to be said for ritual and moderation,\" he said. \"In traditional settings, tequila is sipped, not shot. It's often shared slowly, with food and conversation. That pacing matters.\"\n\nPure tequila made from 100% pure agave, sipped as Sabalenka does, may be better tolerated by the body, some experts say.\n\n\"It's naturally lower in sugar and doesn't contain additives, which might make it easier on your body compared to sugary cocktails or heavily processed liquors,\" Lauren Manaker, a registered dietitian based in South Carolina, previously told Fox News Digital.\n\nGEN Z DRINKING MORE ALCOHOL THAN BEFORE, CHALLENGING LONG-HELD INDUSTRY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT YOUTH HABITS\n\nBut Manaker stressed that no booze is truly \"hangover-proof\" and all alcohol, regardless of type, is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer.\n\nThe WHO and other global health bodies have said that no amount of alcohol is beneficial for health \u2013 and even light drinking carries risks.\n\nPart of tequila's reputation comes from its chemistry. Like vodka and rum, it's a clear spirit with relatively fewer congeners \u2013 the chemical byproducts of fermentation and aging that can intensify hangovers \u2013 than darker liquors such as bourbon or brandy.\n\n\"Ethanol is ethanol,\" Dr. Michael Genovese, chief medical advisor at Ascendant New York in New York City, told Fox News Digital. \"Drink enough and a hangover will come no matter the purity.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nGenetics, biology, hydration levels and muscle mass all affect how a person reacts to alcohol, Genovese added.\n\n\"This can explain why one person swears tequila gives them the cleanest buzz while another insists it wrecks them.\"\n\nNot everyone can expect to feel the same way Sabalenka does after a night out, he added.\n\n\"Her muscle mass dilutes alcohol's effects, her hydration and recovery habits blunt hangover severity, and tequila itself \u2013 when it's high quality \u2013 has fewer congeners, adding to the effect,\" he said.\n\nEven high-quality alcohol still interferes with sleep, performance, muscle repair and hydration, Genovese said. It may also increase inflammation and stress hormones, which for athletes can mean slower recovery, reduced performance and a higher risk of injury.\n\nRecent studies underscore that. A randomized trial published in the journal PLOS ONE found that drinking alcohol after strenuous exercise significantly reduced muscle protein synthesis \u2014 even when paired with protein intake \u2014 blunting the body's ability to repair and build muscle.\n\nOther research has linked post-exercise drinking to impaired recovery and, over time, greater risk of muscle loss.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The bottom line is, tequila is not a health drink. It's just a relatively cleaner alcohol option compared to some others,\" Genovese said.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Sabalenka's team for additional comment.",

Low-carb beer is making a comeback.\nBrewers are tapping into a renewed thirst for light beers, which were once marketed mostly toward women and lacking the complex flavors that connoisseurs crave.\nA rise in health-conscious behavior, especially among millennials and Gen Z, is driving the shift, said Michael Vollmer, assistant director of food and beverage at Chicago's Kimpton Gray Hotel.\nAMERICAN BREWS CRUSH THE COMPETITION AT 'OLYMPICS OF BEER' WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP\n\"People want to enjoy social moments without compromising on health goals,\" he told Fox News Digital.\nMichelob Ultra, a pioneer in the space, saw sales grow over 3% in June compared to the same period last year, even as broader beer sales declined, The Wall Street Journal reported in July.\nProducing full-bodied, low-carb beers can be difficult, but the challenge has inspired innovation, Katherine Benecke, a cicerone at Treadwell Park in New York City, told Fox News Digital.\n\"Brewers are moving beyond the old 'light' stereotype to craft bold, flavorful brews that keep carbs and glycemic impact low,\" she said.\n\"They help reduce blood sugar spikes so you can maintain more sustainable energy levels.\"\nWhen made well, low-carb beers can be good for anyone, Benecke added, regardless of health needs.\n\"They help reduce blood sugar spikes so you can maintain more sustainable energy levels, can aid in digestion and are just generally easier on the gut and on the palate.\"\nIS TEQUILA GOOD FOR YOU?

Dogfish Head 30 Minute Light IPA\nWith 95 calories, 3.6 grams of carbohydrates and 4% alcohol by volume (ABV), the hoppy Dogfish Head's 30 Minute Light IPA combines classic notes of citrus peel with juicy mango and pineapple, the judges said.\n2.

      "text": "Despite taking blame for the alcohol industry's global slump, new data reveals that Gen Z adults are actually drinking more \u2013 not less \u2013 than before.\nAccording to drinks data and analytics provider IWSR, zoomers ranging from legal drinking age to age 27 (LDA+) increased their alcohol consumption from 66% in April 2023 to 73% in March 2025, indicating they haven't changed their habits as a result of healthy lifestyles or cultural trends as initially suspected.\n\"Alcohol usage among LDA+ Gen Z adults has increased significantly from April 2023 lows, and there is evidence that the propensity to go out and spend more is recovering among this group \u2013 challenging the received wisdom that this generation is \u2018abandoning\u2019 alcohol,\" Richard Halstead, Consumer Insights COO, said per a press release on the findings.\nNEW STUDY REVEALS THREATS TO THE CLASS OF 2025. FIXING THEM SHOULD BE JOB NO. 1 FOR AMERICA\nThe findings suggest that lower alcohol consumption seen in recent years may have been less about cultural shifts and more about financial constraints. In fact, the members of the generation were most likely to agree with the statement, \"I am actively choosing to drink more.\"\nZoomers in the U.S. aren't alone either. In addition to participation rates among American Gen-Zers rising from 46% to 70% between April 2023 and March 2025, respectively, IWSR reports drinking rates are rising in other countries.\nIn the United Kingdom, Gen Z alcohol participation rose from 66% to 76%. In India, the number climbed from 60% to 70% and, in Australia, the percentage went from 61% to 83%.\nMORE SENIORS ARE USING CANNABIS THAN EVER BEFORE DESPITE HEALTH RISKS, RESEARCH SHOWS\nHalstead said Gen Z's behavior has large economic implications. Meaning, as more young adults become established in the workplace and mitigate their cost-of-living concerns, their alcohol consumption tends to respond accordingly.\n\"We know that beverage alcohol consumption correlates with disposable income, and Gen Z came of age during a cost-of-living crisis. Rising prices have been especially acute in bars and restaurants \u2013 places that appeal most to Gen Z drinkers,\" he said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"With every year that passes, more Gen Z drinkers are entering the workforce, and those already in the workforce are typically earning more. I think we should expect that, as their incomes rise, they will drink more often \u2013 just as Millennials did before them.\"\nHe added that the findings suggest the industry's decline is more \"cyclical\" than longstanding."

      "text": "Long before bourbon dominated the liquor market, rye whiskey reigned supreme.\nNow, a Midwestern distiller is teaming up with scientists to bring back a long-gone type of grain and turn it into spicy, bold whiskey.\nThe source is a wooden schooner named the James R. Bentley that's been sitting in Lake Huron for nearly 150 years. The ship sank in Nov. 1878 after striking a shoal.\nANCIENT ROMANS' FAVORITE SAUCE REVEALS FISHY SECRETS AFTER 1,800 YEARS\nRemarkably, all the crew members on the ship were rescued \u2013 and even more remarkably, the ship still contains the remnants of the rye it was shipping.\nChad Munger, founder and CEO of Mammoth Distilling, talked to Fox News Digital about his efforts to revive the grain, which he calls \"Bentley rye.\"\n\"The shipwreck itself is a rarity in the Great Lakes,\" Munger said. \"It's privately owned by a gentleman [who] lives in Illinois who won a lawsuit ... which resulted in some new laws in the state of Michigan that preclude individuals from owning shipwrecks.\"\nThat legal quirk made the recovery possible.\nORDINARY ANCIENT ROMANS ATE 'LUXURY' MEAT AT FAST-FOOD SHOPS, NEW RESEARCH REVEALS\nAfter Munger contacted the owner and obtained permission for a dive, his team retrieved samples of the 140-year-old rye from the ship's hold.\n\"It was a really rare set of circumstances that brought that all together in this particular case,\" Munger said.\nMammoth Distilling is no stranger to this type of effort. It has helped revive another old type of grain, called Rosen rye.\nThanks to a U.S. Department of Agriculture seed bank in Idaho, the company obtained the seeds and germinated them back into existence.\nBentley rye, however, has been trickier to germinate. Eric Olson, a wheat breeding and genetics professor at Michigan State University, has been working to sequence the genome of the DNA.\nSTUDENTS COOK ANCIENT RICE DISH BASED ON 2,000-YEAR-OLD MANUSCRIPT WITH SURPRISINGLY HEALTHY RESULTS\nSpeaking to Fox News Digital on July 30, Olson called the Bentley rye variety a \"historical treasure.\"\n\"It gives us a snapshot of the exact variety of rye being grown in the Great Lakes region in the late 1800s,\" he said.\n\"It's a tip of the spear in terms of a very, very large project to make rye better in the world.\"\nOlson reported that the project has made some \"foundational progress\" over the past several months, including growing 269 varieties of rye.\n\"In the coming weeks, we will be extracting DNA and sequencing pieces of the chromosomes of the 269 rye varieties and then [comparing] them with the chromosomes of the Bentley rye variety,\" Olson detailed.\n\"Once we find the existing varieties with chromosomes matching those from the Bentley rye, we start the process of hybridizing these existing varieties (using classical plant-breeding methods) to bring all of the Bentley rye chromosomes back together.\"\nOlson said the process will take between four and five years.\nOf the effort, Munger said, \"They're essentially Frankenstein-ing the thing back into existence.\"\n\"It\u2019s a tip of the spear in terms of a very, very large project to make rye better in the world.\"\nRARE AND MYSTERIOUS WHISKEY BOTTLES FOUND WASHED UP ON BEACH\nMunger explained that the majority of whiskey made before Prohibition was rye whiskey, which must contain at least 51% rye grain.\n\"That's what everybody in the United States used to make whiskey,\" Munger said. \"It was not bourbon.\"\nHe added, \"Bourbon took over because it's cheaper to make.\"\n\"It's a much bigger story than just a cool shipwreck.\"\nBut, Munger said, good grain is like good wine grapes \u2013 and it makes a huge difference in the final product.\n\"The varieties of grain you use make a big difference in terms of the flavor character,\" he said.\n\"You can get a lot of grassy notes and clove spice notes and base spice notes, depending on what variety of grain you're using.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nThe project may also help the Great Lakes State become the top producer of rye again.\n\"One hundred and fifty years ago, Michigan was the rye-growing capital of North America,\" Munger said.\n\"The state of Michigan is where you came to buy rye for whatever reason you were buying rye. As soon as Prohibition happened, it wiped out the whole industry.\"\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\nHe hopes that his project has the potential to help \"reinvigorate a segment of the Michigan agricultural economy that's gone dormant and that really needs to be revived.\"\n\"It's a much bigger story than just a cool shipwreck,\" Munger emphasized.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"It's really the first step in what we hope is a reinvigoration of a whole segment of the Michigan economy.\""

      "text": "As the summer heat drives many Americans to reach for a cold drink after a hard day's work, some may wonder: What's the healthiest alcohol to sip if you're not cutting it out entirely?\nSome health-conscious Americans opt for liquors instead of beer and cider to avoid excess calories. Others avoid red wines to steer clear of hangover-inducing tannins.\nAmong the rising favorites is tequila, especially as it's celebrated Thursday on National Tequila Day.\nEXPERTS COMPARE NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS OF TACOS AND SLIDERS AND OFFER HEALTHY PREP TIPS\nThe distilled Mexican spirit, known for its starring role in margaritas and tequila sunrises, is often seen as a cleaner, potentially healthier choice. But is it really?\nLauren Manaker, a registered dietitian based in South Carolina, shared with Fox News Digital some of the myths and facts surrounding tequila.\nManaker said that pure tequila, made from 100% agave, can be a \"reasonable choice\" for health-minded imbibers.\n\"Hangovers depend on how much you drink, how hydrated you are, and what you pair it with, not just the type of alcohol.\"\n\"It's naturally lower in sugar and doesn't contain additives, which might make it easier on your body compared to sugary cocktails or heavily processed liquors,\" the health expert said.\nStill, Manaker noted that tequila is not hangover-proof, despite popular belief.\n\"No alcohol is truly 'hangover-proof,'\" the dietitian said. \"Hangovers depend on how much you drink, how hydrated you are and what you pair it with \u2013 not just the type of alcohol.\"\nEven so, tequila isn't necessarily healthy either.\n'FRIDGE CIGARETTE' IS GEN Z'S NEW DIET COKE OBSESSION THAT CONCERNS HEALTH EXPERTS\nManaker said that all alcohol is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\"This means it's in the same category as tobacco and asbestos \u2013 not because it's equally risky, but because there's enough evidence suggesting it's link to increased cancer risk, especially with heavy or regular consumption,\" she said.\n\"So, while a drink here and there is fine for most people, it's worth keeping the big picture in mind.\"\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle\nBelow are Manaker's top tips for enjoying National Tequila Day without wrecking your health.\nTips for health-conscious sipping\nQuantity matters: Moderation is key. Stick to one drink for women or two for men per day max, as recommended by health guidelines. Overindulging is where the trouble starts.\nMind your mixers: Skip sugary mixers (like margarita mix) and opt for soda water, fresh lime or a splash of grapefruit juice for a lighter option.\nEat before you drink: Drinking on an empty stomach is a recipe for disaster. A balanced meal with protein, healthy fats and carbs can help slow alcohol absorption.\nHydrate: Alcohol dehydrates you, so drink water before, during and after. A good rule of thumb is one glass of water for every alcoholic drink.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"And remember, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink less or not at all,\" Manaker said."
