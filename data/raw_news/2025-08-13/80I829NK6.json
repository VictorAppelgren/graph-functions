  "content": "Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - August 13, 2025) - Lipari Mining Ltd. (Cboe CA: LML) (FSE: 0Y90) (\"Lipari\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce it has engaged ArcStone Canada Inc. (\"ArcStone\"), a subsidiary of ArcStone Securities and Investments Corp., to provide capital markets advisory and investment banking services as Lipari advances its next phase of growth. ArcStone is a cross-border financial services firm with a dynamic equity desk with global institutions and family offices. Lipari is focused on expanding its flagship Tchitengo Diamond Project in Angola, leveraging nearly two decades of successful diamond mining and processing experience in Brazil. Work is underway to update the 2013 feasibility study and to evaluate phased development options designed to optimize capital efficiency, schedule, and scale. The engagement follows a share consolidation and name change completed earlier this year, marking the launch of Lipari as a renewed public markets story. The Company is now actively positioning itself to attract a global investor base and strategic partners, with the goal of competing at an international scale in the diamond sector. \"We're pleased to partner with ArcStone as we broaden our connectivity with institutional investors, family offices, and U.S. market participants,\" said Ken Johnson, President and CEO of Lipari. \"Their cross-border platform, distribution reach, and sector experience will help us expand awareness of Lipari's story and attract strategic partners aligned with our long-term vision. This engagement supports our strategy to build on our success in Brazil and to accelerate our expansion into one of the world's most prospective diamond regions, establishing Lipari as an international diamond producer with operations in both South America and Africa.\" \"Lipari is executing a disciplined growth plan in a Tier-1 diamond district with meaningful exploration upside,\" said Michael Astone, CPA, CA, CEO of ArcStone. \"Our mandate is to support the Company with institutional coverage, U.S. market access, and strategic capital solutions as it advances Tchitengo.\" The diamond market is experiencing renewed momentum, supported by tightening global supply, robust luxury demand, and the growing importance of ethically sourced production. Angola remains one of the most prolific and prospective diamond jurisdictions in the world, with large-scale projects attracting capital from global mining houses and investors seeking exposure to premium-grade stones. Lipari's operational history, combined with its environmental stewardship, positions it to compete effectively for market share in this evolving landscape.\n\nAs part of this engagement, Lipari will participate in the ArcStone-Kingswood Growth Summit 2025 on September 18 at The St. Regis Toronto, a high-profile investor forum connecting growth-stage issuers with institutional investors, family offices, and retail wealth advisors. Last year's inaugural summit hosted 430 delegates, featured 30 presenting companies, and facilitated 140 one-on-one meetings. ArcStone Securities & Investments Corp. is an independent, cross-border financial services firm with operations in New York, Toronto, and Florida. The firm provides full-service capital markets and advisory solutions investment banking, equity research and targeting, non-deal roadshows, growth conferences, and aftermarket support. Through a strategic relationship with Kingswood, ArcStone's equity desk extends distribution to 400+ RIAs with $15B+ in client assets, complementing institutional and family office coverage with one of North America's largest retail advisory networks. Lipari Mining is South America's leading diamond producer, with a proven operating track record at the Bra\u00fana diamond mine in Brazil, which has produced over 1.24 million carats to date. Lipari is now advancing the Tchitengo Diamond Project in Angola's Lunda Sul province, a premier diamond district with significant exploration potential and infrastructure advantages. The Company is committed to environmentally responsible mining; Bra\u00fana recycles nearly 100% of process water and produces a dry tailings product with potential agricultural applications.
