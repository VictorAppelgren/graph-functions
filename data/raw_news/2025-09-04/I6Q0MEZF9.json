  "content": "The painting, Portrait of a Lady by Giuseppe Ghislandi, had disappeared from the collection of a Jewish art dealer during World War II.\n\nAuthorities in Argentina have opened a criminal investigation into the daughter of a former Nazi official and her spouse after an 18th-century painting stolen from a late Jewish art dealer was recovered from one of their properties.\n\nProsecutors announced the probe on Thursday, which will focus on Juan Carlos Cortegoso and his wife Patricia Kadgien, whose father was the fugitive Nazi officer Friedrich Kadgien.\n\nThe elder Kadgien died in the late 1970s. He spent the final decades of his life in Argentina, having fled Germany at the end of World War II.\n\nHe is believed to have brought with him priceless artworks looted from the collections of Jewish families and businesses, including that of the Dutch art dealer Jacques Goudstikker.\n\nGoudstikker had amassed a collection of nearly 1,400 pieces, according to the meticulous records he kept.\n\nBut that made his collection a target for Nazi officials like Hermann Goring, who sought to seize the artwork for himself. The elder Kadgien was Goring\u2019s financial adviser.\n\nIt is unclear how Kadgien came to own Portrait of a Lady by Giuseppe Ghislandi, an Italian portraitist prolific during the Baroque and Rococo periods.\n\nThe painting, a large portrait of the Contessa Colleoni holding gloves and a book, had not been seen in decades. As far as researchers knew, only black-and-white photographs of the artwork survived.\n\nGoudstikker had been forced to sell many of his artworks to Nazi officials as the Holocaust unfolded in Europe.\n\nIn May 1940, the art dealer would ultimately die from a fall on board the SS Bodegraven, as he fled a genocide that would claim at least six million Jewish lives, as well as millions of prisoners-of-war, dissidents, LGBTQ people and those with disabilities.\n\nGoudstikker\u2019s heirs have been seeking to recover his collection ever since.\n\nThought lost, Portrait of a Lady reappeared suddenly last month, as the result of internet sleuthing.\n\nDutch journalists with the publication Algemeen Dagblad had been investigating the late Kadgien\u2019s dealings with the Nazis, and they stumbled across a real estate listing from February for a house belonging to his daughter, Patricia Kadgien.\n\nA picture in the listing showed Portrait of a Lady hanging above a green velvet couch.\n\nThe journalists published their findings on August 25, and soon after, police in Argentina raided the residence, which was located in the coastal city of Mar del Plata.\n\nBut the painting was nowhere to be found. Instead, authorities reported they had recovered other paintings, this time from the 19th century, that they suspected may also be Nazi-looted artwork.\n\nA tapestry was found hanging where Portrait of a Lady was once photographed. The real estate listing, meanwhile, appeared to have been removed.\n\nPolice have since raided several properties belonging to Patricia Kadgien and her sister. On Wednesday, it was announced that the painting had finally been recovered.\n\nBut in Thursday\u2019s hearing, federal authorities revealed they were charging Kadgien, 59, and her husband, Cortegoso, 62, with attempting a cover-up.\n\nProsecutor Carlos Martinez accused the couple of hiding the painting, despite being \u201caware that the artwork was being sought by the criminal justice system and international authorities\u201d. That, he said, amounted to obstruction of justice and concealment.\n\n\u201cIt was only after several police raids that they turned it in,\u201d Martinez explained.\n\nPatricia Kadgien and Cortegoso were briefly put under house arrest on Monday, though that was lifted in favour of a 180-day travel ban and a requirement that they seek court approval before leaving the house.\n\nA lawyer for the couple reportedly asked a civil court this week to allow them to sell the painting, but that request was denied.\n\nMartinez, meanwhile, told journalists on Thursday that Marei von Saher, one of Goudstikker\u2019s heirs, had already reached out to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States to ensure the painting\u2019s restitution.\n\nHe explained that prosecutors had requested Portrait of a Lady be held at the Buenos Aires Holocaust Museum for now.",

The combined sentence for the two offences could reach up to 12 years in prison.\nBrazilian news outlet O Dia said on Wednesday that recordings were also found on a device seized during the police investigation of Bolsonaro, which indicated \u201cattempts to intimidate authorities and impede the progress of the investigations related to the inquiry into the attack on democracy, including attempts to use external influence\u201d.\nBolsonaro \u2013 who has been under house arrest since early August \u2013 has maintained his innocence in the coup trial, which US President Donald Trump, an ally, has called a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d.\nBolsonaro\u2019s son, Eduardo, stepped down from his position as a Brazilian congressman in March and moved to the US, where he is campaigning for the Trump administration to intercede on his father\u2019s behalf.\nThose lobbying efforts have been successful, with the Trump administration taking punitive action against Brazil over the case, including sanctions against court officials.\nTrump has also imposed a massive 50 percent tariff on many Brazilian exports to the US, citing Bolsonaro\u2019s trial."

      "text": "Argentinian President Javier Milei leaves rally after protesters throw rocks\nThe Milei government is weathering a bribery scandal as a pair of important elections approach in September and October.\nArgentina\u2019s President Javier Milei has been forced to leave a campaign rally in Lomas de Zamora, a suburb of Buenos Aires, after protesters pelted his vehicle with small rocks, bottles and other objects.\nOn Wednesday, Milei and members of his libertarian party, La Libertad Avanza, held a rally for voters ahead of two key upcoming elections.\nRecommended Stories\nlist of 3 items- list 1 of 3Milei vetoes pension, disability spending increases as Argentina feels cuts\n- list 2 of 3Chainsaw economics, organ sales and governing by dog: Argentina under Milei\n- list 3 of 3Argentina\u2019s Javier Milei launches group to boost Israel-Latin America ties\nOn September 7, the province of Buenos Aires is expected to hold local races. And on October 26, the country faces midterm elections, which will see half of the 257-seat Chamber of Deputies up for grabs, as well as a third of the Senate.\nThe elections are seen as major tests for Milei as he reaches the midpoint of his four-year term as president.\nBut Milei, whose dark-horse election victory in 2023 upset Argentina\u2019s political establishment, has faced backlash for the dramatic \u201cshock treatment\u201d he has attempted to undertake with the country\u2019s economy.\nHis administration has also been rocked by a bribery scandal involving his sister, Karina Milei.\nAs Milei and Karina stood on the bed of an open pick-up truck on Wednesday, waving to supporters and signing autographs, witnesses reported seeing objects flying in their direction as protesters attempted to approach the vehicle.\nPresidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni shared a picture on the social media platform X, with a circle highlighting what appeared to be a rock thrown in the president\u2019s direction.\n\u201cThey could have killed anyone,\u201d Adorni said of the protesters. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about human life, and they\u2019ll care even less about the country. The end.\u201d\nVideo captured the pick-up truck accelerating to escape the crowd. One protester held aloft a mock suitcase with Karina Milei\u2019s face on it and dollar bills sticking out in odd places. Others chanted, \u201cOut with Milei!\u201d\nThe news agency AFP reported that one Milei supporter had to be transported by ambulance for medical care after clashes with protesters resulted in rib injuries. But no officials in the Milei pick-up truck were injured.\nMilei himself used the incident to campaign on social media against \u201cKirchnerism\u201d, a left-wing political movement.\n\u201cThe empty-headed nutters throwing rocks resorted to violence again,\u201d he wrote in one post. \u201cOn September 7 and October 26, let\u2019s say at the polls: KIRCHNERISM NEVER AGAIN.\u201d\nIn another, Milei put the choice more starkly: \u201cCivilisation or barbarity.\u201d\nMilei has taken dramatic action to regulate Argentina\u2019s spiralling inflation, but his austerity campaign has included cuts to social safety-net services, widespread government layoffs and sweeping deregulation.\nHe famously campaigned with a chainsaw to symbolise his approach to government bureaucracy. But critics warn that his efforts have left Argentina\u2019s poorest citizens more vulnerable. While official statistics indicate inflation has dropped, unemployment and poverty have risen.\nThe bribery allegations have heightened the backlash against his administration.\nKarina Milei occupies a high-level position in Milei\u2019s government, as a general secretary to the president.\nBut audio recordings have captured Diego Spagnuolo, the head of the National Disability Agency and a close ally of Milei, claiming that Karina took a cut from government contracts intended to help those with disabilities.\nMilei has since fired Spagnuolo, and in his public appearances on Wednesday, he repudiated the recordings.\n\u201cEverything he says is a lie,\u201d Milei told reporters in Lomas de Zamora. \u201cWe are going to bring him to justice and prove he lied.\u201d\nMilei put on a united front with his sister at Wednesday\u2019s rally, appearing side by side with her in the pick-up truck."
