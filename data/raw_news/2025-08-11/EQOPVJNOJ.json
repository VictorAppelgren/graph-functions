  "content": "Olivia Rodrigo and actor Louis Partridge may have reached a major new milestone in their romance after two years of dating.\n\nStrolling hand-in-hand down an Los Angeles sidewalk on Sunday, all eyes were on the massive diamond ring on Rodrigo's engagement finger.\n\nWhile the singer and her British boyfriend, both only 22, have remained tight-lipped about whether he's popped the question, her dazzling new accessory is said to be the talk of Tinseltown.\n\nSunday's outing follows the couple's very loved-up display at Wimbledon, where they were seen passionately kissing in the stands just last month.\n\nIt also adds to recent fan speculation that Rodrigo subtly mentions Partridge in her hit 2023 track, 'So American'.\n\nShe sings: 'Oh God, I'm gonna marry him / If he keeps this s**t up.'\n\nWhile performing the song at Glastonbury music festival in June, Rodrigo teased at the fan theory, saying: 'One thing you should know about me is f***ing love England, I love England so much. As luck would have it, I also really love English boys, I wrote this next song about getting to know a boy from England who loves beans on a jacket potato, I took all our little jokes and made a song called, \"So American\".'\n\nJewelry expert, Anya Walsh, estimates Rodrigo's new stone is 'approximately 3.5 to 4 carats.'\n\n'While the photograph is indistinct, the diamond is clearly square-shaped, suggesting it is either an elongated emerald cut or a radiant cut,' Walsh, who works for Europe's largest online diamond jeweler 77 Diamonds, told the Daily Mail.\n\nShe continued: 'For those seeking a similar ring, prices vary considerably depending on whether the diamond is natural or lab-grown. An excellent cut would typically command a price in the range of $55,000 to $70,000.'\n\nRodrigo and Partridge first made headlines as a couple when they were spotted together in his hometown, London, in October 2023.\n\nIn a October 2024 interview with Elle magazine, Partridge playfully dodged questions about whether Rodrigo's song \"So American\" was about him.\n\nAt the time, he laughed and said, 'Not my song, not my place. So I wouldn't know.'\n\nHe did, however, share that Rodrigo has influenced his music taste, saying, 'My girlfriend has been trying to get me into more pop recently. Chappell Roan has been on repeat.'\n\nDescribing his own approach to relationships, Partridge said he sees himself as a 'golden retriever' boyfriend type \u2014 easygoing and loyal.\n\n'I think in past relationships my mind worked at a different speed to the women I've known,' he explained. 'A bit slower. The way I would characterize it is like a Golden Retriever and a black cat. I can imagine being happy sitting and catching a Frisbee.'\n\nIn April 2024, Partridge spoke again on the relationship, this time to British Vogue.\n\n'I think she\u2019s got it a lot worse than I have,' he said. 'I can be a bit of a normal person. She's got tons and tons of eyes on her case.\n\n'Dating probably shouldn\u2019t be done in the public eye. There's enough going on between two people. You don\u2019t need the voices of thousands of others in your head.'\n\nHe was previously romantically linked to actress Sydney Chandler, who he met on the set of the FX series Pistol.\n\nRodrigo has previously dated record producer, Zack Bia, and actors Ethan Wacker and Ethan Wacker.\n\nRepresentatives for the singer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
