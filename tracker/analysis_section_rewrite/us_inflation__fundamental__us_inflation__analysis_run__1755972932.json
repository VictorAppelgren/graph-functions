      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first pass but still feels like a collection of facts rather than a coherent, first‑principles narrative. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking the four structural anchors (real‑rate differentials, terms‑of‑trade, productivity, BoP) to the two regime shifts you identify (AI‑driven TFP gains and EV‑driven scale). Use the IBM pause (≈7,800 jobs, 30 % of 26,000 roles) and the JUST index outperformance (17.3 % vs Russell 1000) as concrete evidence that workforce strategy feeds into TFP and earnings. Quantify the EV regime: Rivian’s R2 is projected to lift gross margin from 20 % to 30 % at 200,000 units, while Tesla’s Q2 EBITDA margin fell from 17 % to 12 % if robotaxi volumes lag. Cite the Fed’s policy reaction function by noting the expected real‑rate path (e.g., 2.5 %–3.0 % nominal, 1.5 % real) and its impact on borrowing costs for AI and EV firms. Add a risk matrix: (1) Fed rate hike → tighter terms‑of‑trade, (2) AI regulatory clamp‑down → slower TFP, (3) EV tax‑credit loss + battery tariffs → margin compression. Watch signals: Fed minutes, AI‑policy announcements, Q4 2025 EV sales data. Finally, embed citations directly after each key figure (e.g., “IBM pause ≈7,800 jobs [4LQD15CFU]”). This will give the piece the depth, specificity, and source coverage required for a world‑class analysis.",
