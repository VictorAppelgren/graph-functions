  "description": "Results exceed prespecified primary endpoint of 95% posterior probability of benefit for PMX on 28-day mortality Pooled absolute risk reduction of 8.3%; Relative risk reduction of 18% Key secondary endpoint: 90-day Mortality 17.4% lower with PMX and >99% posterior probability of benefit 38.7% Mortality at 28 days with PMX confirms results of prior trial subset TORONTO, Ontario and DEERFIELD, Ill., Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spectral Medical Inc. (\u201cSpectral\u201d) (TSX: EDT), a late-stage thera",
  "content": "The primary endpoint\u201428-day all-cause mortality\u2014was evaluated using a prespecified Bayesian statistical model, which evaluates results in the context of prior probability. The model incorporated data from 179 patients in the previously conducted EUPHRATES trial alongside the data from the Tigris trial. The EUPHRATES trial was conducted in North America and examined the impact of PMX on mortality in patients with septic shock and endotoxemia. The goal of the Tigris trial was to confirm the benefit of PMX hemoadsorption in patients with endotoxic septic shock, defined by EAA 0.60 but < 0.90. The Tigris trial\u2019s design and analysis plan were aligned with published FDA\u2019s Guidance for the Use of Bayesian Statistics in Medical Device Clinical Trials. 2\n\nEach year, approximately 5-7 million cases of endotoxic septic shock, a particularly deadly form of sepsis, occur worldwide. 1 Today, there is no specific therapy targeting this patient population currently available in the United States. The Tigris trial was a U.S.-based, multicenter, randomized, controlled Phase 3 study evaluating PMX in adults with endotoxic septic shock, defined by an Endotoxin Activity Assay (\u201cEAA\u201d) level between 0.60 and 0.90. EAA is an FDA approved, semiquantitative test for measurement of endotoxin activity, allowing for rapid measurements to obtain results in approximately 30 minutes. The treating physician can use these results to help inform timely therapeutic decisions. Eligible patients also had to meet criteria for multiple organ dysfunction, including a Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (\u201cMODS\u201d) >9 or a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (\u201cSOFA\u201d) score of >11. A total of 157 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either PMX plus standard care (n=106) or standard care alone (n=51).\n\nTORONTO, Ontario and DEERFIELD, Ill., Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spectral Medical Inc. (\u201cSpectral\u201d) (TSX: EDT), a late-stage theranostic company advancing therapeutic options for sepsis and septic shock, and Vantive, a vital organ therapy company committed to pursuing novel diagnostic and therapeutic options for organ failure, today announced topline results from the Tigris trial. This Phase 3 follow-on study sponsored by Spectral evaluated the use of Polymyxin B Hemoadsorption (\u201cPMX\u201d) in a randomized clinical trial of adults treated for endotoxic septic shock.\n\nThe purpose of Bayesian analysis is to update prior evidence with new trial data, producing a \u2018posterior probability\u2019 that reflects the most current and complete picture of the treatment effect. Results are presented for adjusted and unadjusted analyses. Consistent with expert recommendations and the FDA\u2019s guidance on clinical trials, the adjusted analysis is used to account for baseline prognostic covariates such as severity of illness and comorbidities \u2013 which provides a more precise estimate of the true treatment effect. Unadjusted analyses do not account for these important differences.\n\u2022 Intention to treat cohort showed a posterior probability of benefit of 95.3% at 28 days\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Adjusted posterior probability of benefit from PMX at 28 days exceeds the prespecified 95% target and thus meets the prespecified primary endpoint.\n\u2022 Observed 28-day mortality for Tigris was 38.7% with PMX vs 45.1% with standard of care \u2013 6.4% absolute difference.\n\u2022 Unadjusted absolute risk reduction from the posterior distribution was 8.3% [-2.1%, 19.7%] representing a 18% relative risk reduction, posterior probability 92.3%.\n\u2022 Observed 28-day mortality from the modified intention to treat population (includes 100 PMX and 51 control patients receiving any assigned treatment) was 37.0% with PMX vs 45.1% with standard of care \u2013 8.1% absolute difference.\n\u2022 The key secondary endpoint, mortality at 90 days, showed a >99% posterior probability of benefit for PMX.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Adjusted posterior probability of benefit from PMX at 90 days was 99.4%.\n\u2022 Observed mortality at 90 days (Tigris alone): 43.4% with PMX vs. 60.8% with standard of care \u2013 17.4% absolute difference.\n\u2022 Unadjusted absolute risk reduction from the posterior distribution was 12.3% [0.76%, 23.7%] representing a 20.2% relative risk reduction, posterior probability 98.3%.\n\u2022 Resultant number needed to treat (\u201cNNT\u201d) to save 1 life at 90 days is 8.1.\n\nDr. John Kellum, Chief Medical Officer of Spectral Medical, commented, \u201cWe are pleased to announce that the fully adjusted Bayesian analysis met our prespecified goal of >95% posterior probability of benefit for 28-day mortality. As we explained in our November 14, 2023 press release, our published simulations involving over 2,000 potential trial results found an observed absolute risk reduction for mortality in the range of 6 - 7% in Tigris would meet this bar. Final results from Tigris indicate that our observed 6.4% difference yields a 95.3% posterior probability and thus exceeds this threshold. Furthermore our 90 days results provide important confirmation that benefits with PMX are persistent.\u201d\n\nProfessor Claudio Ronco, Director of the International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza IRRIV and world-renowned expert in blood purification for sepsis, commented, \u201cThe results that we see today are a clear confirmation of what we observed more than 16 years ago with the EUPHAS trial. Tigris, together with a subset of patients from EUPHRATES indicate that hemoadsorption therapy with PMX can be effective if we select the correct population. Like in EUPHAS, patients in the Tigris trial have a 28-day mortality of approximately 50% unless treated with PMX. The benefit for survival from PMX becomes even more dramatic at 90 days where it exceeds 17%. This is not unexpected as today many patients can be maintained on life support for more than 28 days \u2013 as such, longer term survival is a more accurate reflection of benefit.\u201d\n\nDr. Danielle Davison, Professor of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and Director of the Intensive Care Unit, George Washington University, Washington, DC, commented, \u201cHaving participated in both EUPHRATES and Tigris, it is particularly satisfying to see these final results. We look forward to having this therapy available for our patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cVantive is committed to supporting clinical research to advance therapy innovation and expand access to care for critically ill patients,\u201d said Professor Peter Rutherford, Head of Worldwide Medical at Vantive. \u201cWe are encouraged by these results, and look forward to continuing to work toward addressing unmet clinical needs and improving outcomes for patients affected by endotoxic septic shock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results from Tigris represent a significant milestone for Spectral as we continue advancing toward our goal of improving outcomes in endotoxic septic shock,\u201d said Chris Seto, Chief Executive Officer of Spectral Medical. \u201cWhen considered alongside prior evidence from the EUPHRATES trial and real-world global experience, the totality of data supporting PMX continues to strengthen. Importantly, the safety profile observed in Tigris was consistent with PMX\u2019s historical use with over 360,000 units sold worldwide. These findings further support our planned FDA PMA submission and our efforts to make this therapy available to the patients who need it most.\u201d\n\nVantive is Spectral's exclusive distributor of PMX in the U.S. and Canada and has non-exclusive rights to distribute EAA globally. Spectral Medical intends to submit the final Premarket Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) module (Module 3) for PMX to the FDA by end of October 2025. If approved by the FDA, Vantive plans to commercialize both EAA and PMX, beginning in the United States, to support Targeted Rapid Endotoxin Adsorption (TREA) Therapy. TREA therapy brings precision medicine to sepsis, delivering rapid, decisive treatment for patients with endotoxic septic shock.\n\nFull results from the Tigris trial will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming major medical conference and for publication in a peer-reviewed journal later this year.\n\nChris Seto, Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. John Kellum, Chief Medical Officer, will host the call followed by a question-and-answer session. All interested parties are invited to participate.\n\nParticipants can use Guest dial-in #s above and be answered by an operator OR click the Call me link for instant telephone access to the event. *Available 15 minutes prior to scheduled start time.\n\nAvailable 1:00 p.m. ET, Wednesday, August 13, 2025, until 11:59 p.m. ET, Wednesday, August 27, 2025\n\nPMX is not approved for use in the United States.\n\nEAA Rx Only: For safe and proper use of devices mentioned herein, please refer to User Manual.\n\nVantive is a trademark of Vantive Health LLC or its affiliates.\n\nAbout Spectral \n\n \n\nSpectral is a Phase 3 company seeking U.S. FDA approval for its unique product for the treatment of patients with septic shock, Toraymyxin\u2122 (\u201cPMX\u201d). PMX is a single-use therapeutic hemoperfusion device that removes endotoxin, which can cause sepsis, from the bloodstream and is guided by the Company\u2019s FDA cleared Endotoxin Activity Assay (EAA\u2122), the clinically available test for endotoxin in blood. EAA\u2122 is also CE marked and licensed by Health Canada. \n\n \n\nPMX is approved for therapeutic use in Japan and Europe, licensed by Health Canada, and has been used safely and effectively with over 360,000 units sold worldwide to date. In March 2009, Spectral obtained the exclusive development and commercial rights in the U.S. for PMX, and in November 2010, signed an exclusive distribution agreement for this product in Canada. In July 2022, the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Device Designation for PMX for the treatment of endotoxic septic shock. Approximately 330,000 patients are diagnosed with septic shock in North America each year. \n\n \n\nThe Tigris Trial is a confirmatory study of PMX in addition to standard care vs standard care alone and is designed as a 2:1 randomized trial of 150 patients using Bayesian statistics. Endotoxic septic shock is a malignant form of sepsis . \n\n \n\nThe trial methods are detailed in \u201c \u201d. \n\n \n\nSpectral is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol EDT.

Implicit in this information, particularly in respect of the future outlook of Spectral and anticipated events or results, are assumptions based on beliefs of Spectral's senior management as well as information currently available to it. While these assumptions were considered reasonable by Spectral at the time of preparation, they may prove to be incorrect. Readers are cautioned that actual results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the availability of funds and resources to pursue R&D projects, the successful and timely completion of clinical studies, the ability of Spectral to take advantage of business opportunities in the biomedical industry, the granting of necessary approvals by regulatory authorities as well as general economic, market and business conditions, and could differ materially from what is currently expected.\n\nSpectral has not yet received FDA clearance for the PMX device. While Spectral believes that a potential PMA from the FDA following the completion of Tigris could be granted in the second half of 2026, the regulatory approval process of the FDA is lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If Spectral is unable to obtain FDA clearance for PMX, it will be unable to commercialize the PMX device and generate revenue in the United States which would have material adverse consequences on its business.\n\nThe TSX has not reviewed and does not accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this statement.\n\u2022 Kellum J, Ronco C.

This opening highlights our ongoing commitment to investing in manufacturing and fulfillment infrastructure, enabling us to better serve our customers and patients. It also builds on our recent announcement of more than $1 billion in planned investments over the next five years to support kidney care and vital organ solutions globally. This 140,000-square-foot facility strengthens our U.S. distribution network. It reinforces our commitment to delivering trusted renal care solutions efficiently and reliably to all our U.S. patients and customers. A big thank you to our cross-functional teams, local partners, and community leaders who helped bring this milestone to life. We\u2019re proud to be part of the Olive Branch community and excited about what\u2019s ahead!\n-\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like the energy in the room when our passionate colleagues unite! Recently, our Asia Pacific, China, and Americas teams gathered in their regions to forge new connections, strengthen collaboration, and hear directly from our leaders about the strategic vision for the future of Vantive. These are the moments that inspire us to stay focused on our mission \u2013 to extend lives and #ExpandPossibilities \u2013 for patients and their care teams around the world. #WeAreVantive\n-\n+1\n-\nFor over 15 years, we\u2019ve proudly partnered with Camp Dorset, a unique place where patients on dialysis can experience an outdoor getaway with their families complete with fishing, kayaking, and cabins, all while receiving their dialysis treatments on-site. This year, our Vantive Canada employees from teams spanning manufacturing and quality control, operations, and nursing came together to prepare the campgrounds for guests and their families. From raking leaves to scrubbing windows, the work is physical, but the impact is emotional \u2014 a reminder of why we do what we do for patients and their care teams. #WeAreVantive #PurposeDrivenWork #VantiveVolunteers #DialysisCare\n-\nWe\u2019re proud to announce a new long-term agreement with Innovative Renal Care (IRC) focused on expanding access to home dialysis, enhancing the therapy experience, and empowering patients and care teams through home dialysis care. Learn more about our collaboration and shared commitment to #ExpandPossibilities for patients and care teams: https://bit.ly/3IvBPIE\n-\nThe Vantive Asia Pacific team recently hosted the 2nd Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) Champion Program, a year-long initiative to increase home therapy awareness and education in the nephrology community. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) from 10 countries were engaged in two days of workshops featuring distinguished speakers, including our own Dr. Peter Rutherford, M.B. BS, Ph.D., FRCP, head of worldwide medical. Sessions focused on reviewing evidence for the use of PD, discussing ways to improve access to home dialysis, understanding patient benefits that drive adoption, and learning how to optimize treatment. With overwhelmingly positive feedback from both HCPs and our Vantive teams, we\u2019re excited to build on this momentum to #ExpandPossibilities for dialysis patients and their care teams in Asia Pacific and across the globe.\n-\nKnowledge is power \u2013 so, we are focused on sharing it! Recently, our Vantive team in Greece hosted their 2nd annual scientific event on peritoneal dialysis (PD), a home-based therapy option. This event brought together healthcare professionals and scientists to learn from one another and discuss the latest clinical practices, research data and therapeutic approaches for PD. The patient experience was front and center throughout these discussions, with a clear focus on quality of life. We look forward to continuing our work to #ExpandPossibilities through education. With more information, patients and their care teams can make more informed decisions when managing chronic kidney disease.\n-\nThis week, our teams gathered at our US HQ for treats, trivia, and prizes to celebrate our 30-year history of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) innovation and ICU partnership. Over the last three decades, we\u2019ve worked to address the most pressing challenges of ICU healthcare practitioners in treating critically ill patients, and we continue to explore new opportunities to help clinicians deliver the best care possible to their patients in the most critical moments. As we look to the next 30+ years, we are excited to build on this legacy as we work to extend lives and #ExpandPossibilities for patients around the world!\n-\nFor the first time as Vantive, we\u2019re at the European Renal Association (ERA) Congress in Vienna, Austria. We are energized by this opportunity to connect with clinicians and partners, and learn how we can better support patients. Yesterday, EMEA President Magnus Lindholm shared additional insight into our plan to invest in digitally-enabled therapy innovation, with a clear focus on expanding access and improving the user experience. If you\u2019re here at #ERA25, visit booth #365 and follow our social channels to see for yourself how we are bringing our mission to extend lives and #ExpandPossibilities to life!"

      "text": "WINNING THE BATTLE AGAINST ENDOTOXIC SEPTIC SHOCK\nThe first theranostic: EAA\u2122 & Toraymyxin\u2122\nMedia\nSpectral combining diagnostics with targeted therapy in novel approach to septic shock.\nBioTuesdays, November 12, 2024\nREAD MORE...\nSepsis Awareness\nSepsis is a life-threatening condition triggered by the body\u2019s overwhelming response to bacterial components such as endotoxin and it continues to be a major global health issue, impacting millions. If not recognized and treated promptly, sepsis can result in multiple organ failure, shock, and even death.\nSeptember marked Sepsis Awareness Month, with numerous events held globally to raise awareness and support this important cause.\nAt Spectral Medical Inc, we remain dedicated to fighting endotoxic septic shock with our unique theranostic approach.

      "text": "- Research\n- Open access\n- Published:\nBayesian methods: a potential path forward for sepsis trials\nCritical Care volume 27, Article number: 432 (2023)\nAbstract\nBackground\nGiven the success of recent platform trials for COVID-19, Bayesian statistical methods have become an option for complex, heterogenous syndromes like sepsis. However, study design will require careful consideration of how statistical power varies using Bayesian methods across different choices for how historical data are incorporated through a prior distribution and how the analysis is ultimately conducted. Our objective with the current analysis is to assess how different uses of historical data through a prior distribution, and type of analysis influence results of a proposed trial that will be analyzed using Bayesian statistical methods.\nMethods\nWe conducted a simulation study incorporating historical data from a published multicenter, randomized clinical trial in the US and Canada of polymyxin B hemadsorption for treatment of endotoxemic septic shock. Historical data come from a 179-patient subgroup of the previous trial of adult critically ill patients with septic shock, multiple organ failure and an endotoxin activity of 0.60\u20130.89. The trial intervention consisted of two polymyxin B hemoadsorption treatments (2 h each) completed within 24 h of enrollment.\nResults\nIn our simulations for a new trial of 150 patients, a range of hypothetical results were observed. Across a range of baseline risks and treatment effects and four ways of including historical data, we demonstrate an increase in power with the use of clinically defensible incorporation of historical data. In one possible trial result, for example, with an observed reduction in risk of mortality from 44 to 37%, the probability of benefit is 96% with a fixed weight of 75% on prior data and 90% with a commensurate (adaptive-weighting) prior; the same data give an 80% probability of benefit if historical data are ignored.\nConclusions\nUsing Bayesian methods and a biologically justifiable use of historical data in a prior distribution yields a study design with higher power than a conventional design that ignores relevant historical data. Bayesian methods may be a viable option for trials in critical care medicine where beneficial treatments have been elusive.\nGraphical abstract\nBackground\nSepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection [1]. While effective interventions for infection are available, treatments for sepsis have been elusive perhaps because no single underlying biologic process can account for the range of severity and distribution of organ failures encountered in sepsis. This variation is directly associated with hospital mortality which ranges from 2 to 32% [2].\nHeterogeneity of the phenotype that defines sepsis is a significant problem for clinical trials and the problem cannot be solved by increasing the total sample size\u2014the highest mortality in sepsis occurs in a subgroup of patients with more than three organ failures and this subgroup is less common than the subgroup with fewer organs failing. Increasing the sample size by enrolling readily available but less severe cases will only increase the proportion of patients with lower mortality. Large \u201cpragmatic\u201d trials are rarely suitable for complex heterogenous conditions like sepsis. Sepsis is not alone in these problems. Other forms of critical illness such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI) are similar in terms of clinical and mechanistic heterogeneity and in terms of scarcity of treatment.\nThe classical approach to interventional clinical trials applied to sepsis and other critical care syndromes has moved confidently from one failure to another. Despite several examples where robust pre-clinical foundations existed and early-stage clinical trials showed promise, phase 3 clinical trials have come up short [3]. Failure at phase 2 or 3 usually spells \u201ccertain death\u201d for an investigational agent and yet, given the heterogeneity described above, benefit might still be obtainable for subgroups of patients (for example, those with a specific mechanism of disease) [4]. One potential way forward is to use Bayesian methods in order to incorporate prior experience with an intervention into later-phase clinical trials. Here we explore the advantages of the use of Bayesian statistical methods for clinical trials in the critically ill and we present an example using an intervention for sepsis.\nMany authors have advocated for use of Bayesian methods [5,6,7,8,9,10] citing (a) the flexibility that they can bring to the analyses of complex trials; (b) their ability to incorporate information from outside the current trial; and (c) their ability to better quantify the evidence as to whether a treatment is beneficial. It is beyond the scope of this paper to fully cover the Bayesian approach and we refer the interested reader to the many published articles and key textbooks that present this material to a non-statistical audience [6, 8, 11, 12]. Here, we take the example of a randomized trial of an intervention for sepsis and explain the steps in designing and analyzing the trial based on Bayesian methods. Importantly, while many papers using Bayesian methods in analyses of clinical trials have examined what potential priors do to the interpretation of completed trials [13], our goal here is to design a new trial. As such we have selected a single, empirical source of prior information and examined differences in trial performance according to the method for incorporating this prior information and the choice of analytic method and then present a range of hypothetical results for the new trial analyzed with the proposed methods.\nMethods\nThe EUPHRATES trial [14] compared 28-day mortality between 223 patients randomized to polymyxin B hemadsorption (PMX) and 226 to sham hemadsorption (control). The trial was performed in accordance with the responsible committee on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrollment. IRB approval Cooper University Hospital (05/18/2010; #09-144). Clinicaltrials.gov [NCT01046669].\nMortality was not significantly different between groups in the intention-to-treat analyses. In a subsequent post hoc analysis [15], where comparisons were restricted to patients completing two treatments and with a Multi-Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) [16] of 9 or more and endotoxin activity assay (EAA) results between 0.60 and 0.89, and adjusting for baseline APACHE II and mean arterial pressure found an odds ratio (OR) for 28-day mortality of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.27\u20130.99) in favor of PMX. PMX treatment compared with control also showed greater improvement in MAP (median (IQR) 8 mmHg (\u2212 0.5, 19.5) versus 4 mmHg (\u2212 4.0, 11) P = 0.04) and ventilator-free days (median (IQR) 20 days (0.5, 23.5) versus 6 days (0, 20), P = 0.004). This subgroup effect is credible since observational studies have found reduced benefit for PMX for patients with lower organ failure scores [17]. Endotoxin activity < 0.6 equates to a burden of endotoxin below the threshold for benefit from PMX in most patients while \u2265 0.9 may identify a population too sick to benefit [15]. These thresholds are not arbitrary because of the mechanism of action of PMX. First, like other forms of blood purification, hemoadsorption relies on concentration-dependent binding; when the solute concentration is lower, removal will be reduced. Second, when solute concentration exceeds an upper limit, the device will no longer be able to achieve an effect and evidence suggests that EAA \u2265 0.9 equates to an endotoxin load beyond the capacity of PMX to impact [18]. Third, using the full EUPHRATES dataset, there was a greater than 97% probability (> 99% in US sites) that the effect of PMX was more beneficial in patients with MODS > 9 and 0.6 \u2264 EAA \u2264 0.89 than in the remaining patients. Full details of this subgroup analysis are provided in the supplement. See also Instrument for assessing the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) in randomized controlled trials checklist (ICEMAN [19] is provided in the supplement). However, there is interest in confirming the benefit of PMX in this subgroup in a new clinical trial.\nA new trial could be performed as a standalone study. However, if analyzed with a chi-squared test of proportions, and assuming the exact 28-day mortality seen in the subgroup (36.7% in PMX and 47.2% in control), it would require 542 patients (271 per arm) to achieve 80% power at a one-side significance level of 0.05. While possible, such a trial would be impractical given that we are selecting a narrow subgroup of the overall septic shock population. Furthermore, the data from EUPHRATES would be put aside when the new data were analyzed. By contrast, an alternative design would be to use Bayesian methods and run the new trial in such a way that the new results could be combined with the prior results from those patients in EUPHRATES with both high MODS and a treatable range of EAA between 0.6 and 0.89 (from now, referred to as the \u201ctreatable cohort\u201d) to more efficiently confirm or refute the benefit in such patients. The new trial is called Tigris (NCT03901807)\u2014see supplement. Since the new trial will be performed exclusively in the US, the treatable cohort was further limited to patients from US sites and to achieve greater face validity, the full ITT cohort was used. The final treatable cohort from EUPHRATES was thus 179 patients, 90 PMX/89 control, and unadjusted 28-day mortality was 36.7% versus 47.2%.\nThe design of Tigris requires that we address two questions. 1. How will the results from the treatable cohort from EUPHRATES [15] be integrated with the results from Tigris? 2. How will the integrated results from these trials be analyzed?\nData integration across trials\nA Bayesian analysis can summarize historical evidence on the size of a treatment effect through what is called the \u2018prior distribution\u2019. Although many previous studies provide support for the notion that PMX can reduce mortality [20,21,22,23], there are numerous differences between the patient groups in these other studies and the proposed Tigris study, most notably the absence of the EAA biomarker to identify a group most likely to benefit from PMX treatment. The treatment effects from these other studies are not a summary of the evidence for a benefit of PMX in this subgroup, so they cannot be used directly to construct a prior for the treatment effect in Tigris. Furthermore, there are many other differences (e.g., study protocol, patient inclusion criteria, study location, timing of outcomes) that also introduce uncertainty about the applicability of those earlier findings to a new trial. By contrast, when we consider Pocock\u2019s criteria [24] for inclusion of data from historical patients in analysis of a new trial, we find that the treatable cohort [15] from the EUPHRATES study is an ideal source of prior information for the treatment effect in Tigris; standard of care, treatment, patient eligibility, evaluation of outcomes, investigators and ICU locations are largely the same in the two studies. We will demonstrate a range of uses of the EUPHRATES treatable cohort: (a) viewing Tigris as a simple continuation of that cohort, (b) down-weighting the prior evidence it provides or (c) ignoring the results entirely.\nThe extent to which Tigris can be seen as a continuation of enrollment into the treatable cohort from EUPHRATES determines how we use those historical data to create a prior for Tigris. To illustrate this idea, Fig. 1 shows a range of prior distributions formed from the historical APACHE-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) from the treatable cohort. Figure 1a treats Tigris as a straight continuation, and simply takes the posterior distribution of the aOR from the treatable cohort as the prior for Tigris. The priors in Figs. 1b and 1c acknowledge that the previous results may not be entirely transportable to this new trial and are down-weighted to be equivalent to data with the same observed aOR, but in a sample only 75% or 50% of the actual size; these down-weighted priors express more uncertainty than the prior in 1a about the potential values of the aOR. Figure 1d takes an extreme view\u2014the one taken by a classical analysis that uses no prior- ignoring the results in the previous study entirely and allowing a priori that all values of the OR are equally likely, no matter how biologically implausible. The prior appears almost as a horizontal line. Each figure also shows the prior 95% credible interval (CrI), prior probability that the OR for treatment is less than 1 and, because small differences in tail probabilities appear to understate the different levels of certainty in these priors, the corresponding odds that the OR is less than 1.\nThere are two broad approaches to specifying how much weight should be placed on the historical evidence. One approach uses clinical judgment to fix the weights as shown in Fig. 1 [25] and investigates the results of analyzing new data for each of a small set of fixed weights (e.g., 75%, 100%). The other approach is statistical and uses the similarity between the new data in the trial and the historical data to infer the weight that should be given to the historical evidence; the more similar the new data and the historical data, the higher the weight, and vice versa. We assessed two statistical approaches. The first uses a normalized power prior [26] and the second uses what is called a commensurate prior [27]. Notably, even when the new data are in perfect agreement with the historical data, each of these statistical approaches still places less than full weight on the historical evidence.\nA brief summary of the simulations and statistical analyses of the simulations are provided here; full details can be found in the in the supplement. For each of 25 combinations of control group risk (40% to 60% by 5%) and absolute risk reductions (ARR) (0% to 20% by 5%), 2000 trials of 150 patients (100 PMX and 50 control) were simulated. Each trial was analyzed with 5 different uses of the historical data (100% weighting, 75% weighting, weighting through commensurate and normalized power priors, and 0% weighting) with and without adjustment for baseline APACHE score, for a total of 10 analyses per trial. These Bayesian analyses estimated the odds ratio (OR) for mortality comparing the PMX and control groups and in each simulated trial, checked whether the trial demonstrated benefit for PMX, defined in each trial as a posterior probability greater than 95% that the OR was less than 1. The percentage of the 2000 trials demonstrating benefit was used to estimate the power (or type I error when ARR = 0) of the corresponding analytic method for that control group risk and ARR. As a sensitivity analysis, benefit was defined as a posterior probability greater than 97.5% that the OR was less than 1.\nWhen TIGRIS is complete, the trial report will present a plot of the odds ratio and its 95% credible interval against weights ranging from 0 to 100% to allow the reader to assess the dependence of the results on the amount of historical information that is borrowed. We will also present the posterior probability of benefit as a function of these prior weights and will not dichotomize this probability at a sharp threshold of 95%, for example, as being \u201csignificant\u201d or not. However, for the purposes of trial planning and investigating the role of the prior, we use these thresholds, an approach that is in keeping with previous literature [28].\nResults\nEffects of baseline risk and prior weighting on power\nEach plot in Fig. 2 shows power (the probability that we will conclude that PMX is superior to control at the 95% probability threshold) versus the marginal ARR for treatment. Each plot is for a scenario with the baseline risk shown in the row heading analyzed with either an APACHE-adjusted model (left column) or unadjusted model (right column). Each plot shows power curves versus for fixed 75% and 100% prior weighting, for prior weighting based on similarity of new and historical data using the commensurate prior and for a Bayesian analysis including minimal prior information (uninformative prior). The results shown in Fig. 2 help us make some decisions about the choice of a prior and the analysis, no matter what the true treatment effect and prevalence. There are a few clear patterns. First, an analysis that adjusts for the baseline APACHE II score (left column) is always more powerful than the analysis that does not (right column). Secondly, use of a prior putting 75% weight on the results from the treatable cohort in EUPHRATES (gold lines in each panel in Fig. 2) leads to a greater chance of detecting a true benefit for PMX than a prior that bases the weighting on the similarity of new and historical data (red lines) or an analysis that disregards the historical data (black lines). Thirdly, the increase in power with use of historical data comes with this cost: if there is no true benefit of PMX in Tigris (ARR = 0, far left side of each plot), any analysis that combines a positive signal (from the treatable cohort) with what will be on average a null signal (from Tigris), is more likely to produce a more favorable result than an analysis of Tigris alone [29]. The prior that adjusts the weighting based on the similarity of new and historical data is less likely to produce a favorable result in this null scenario than the fixed 75% weight prior. As the normalized power prior and commensurate prior approaches produced results that were practically identical, only results for the commensurate prior are shown. Additional file 1: Figure S1 presents power when benefit is defined as a posterior probability greater than 97.5% that the OR was less than 1.\nThe analysis using only Tigris data, as expected, has a 5% chance of meeting the 95% probability threshold for benefit (the black lines in Fig. 2 have \u201cpower\u201d of 5% when ARR = 0). When the true ARR in Tigris is 0, some Tigris trial results will vary randomly below an ARR of 0 and, when combined with any use of the historical data, may meet the 95% probability threshold for benefit. Our planned analyses therefore have a small chance of determining that PMX is effective when it is not effective in Tigris. Conversely when the ARR in Tigris is in the neighborhood of 15%, there is still a small chance that we will conclude that PMX is ineffective even though it is highly effective. Still, an analysis combining the historical data with data from the new trial will provide a better representation of the true effect than either the historical data or the new trial data taken separately.\nPotential outcomes for various scenarios\nFigure 3 provides distributions of observed APACHE-adjusted ORs from the 2000 simulated trials with a baseline risk of 50%, coded according to whether they meet the 95% probability threshold for benefit; a similar plot showing unadjusted ARRs can be found in Additional file 1: Figure S2 and a plot with Bayesian posterior estimated of unadjusted ORs can be found in Additional file 1: Figure S3.\nFigures 2 and 3 summarize results over thousands of simulated trials. Table 1 provides a more concrete demonstration of how the different analytic approaches may lead to different conclusions in a single trial. This table shows results of analyses of eight potential trial results, all having an observed control group mortality of 44% (22/50), but with observed mortality in the 100 patients treated with PMX ranging from 24% up to 44%. For observed absolute risk reductions (ARR) from 20% (the first block of rows) and 15% (the second block of rows), Tigris alone would satisfy the criterion of > 95% probability of benefit in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses (cells a and b). The commensurate prior and 75% weighted prior produce still higher probabilities of benefit. In the case of an 11% ARR (33% vs 44%), the adjusted analysis for Tigris alone (cell d in the table), produces only a 92.3% probability of the OR being less than one, a value that rises to 96.1% with the commensurate prior and 98.4% with 75% weight on the prior (cell c). Here, even though the ARR of 11% is almost identical to the 10.5% absolute risk reduction in the treatable cohort, the commensurate prior gives as much credence to the historical data as a 50% weighted prior (result not shown) and returns a probability of benefit of 96.1%, i.e., less than the 97% probability found in the prior. Using the planned 75% weight on the prior, an observed ARR of 7% (37% vs 44%) is approximately the boundary in these eight datasets for reaching the 95% probability threshold for declaring PMX effective. This result gives only a 79.9% probability of benefit in Tigris alone in the adjusted analysis (cell f), but a 95.7% probability when combined with the prior (cell e). In the four potential Tigris trial results that are less favorable (observed ARRs of 5% or less), the posterior probability of benefit in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses fall below the 95% threshold when the prior data are down-weighted to 75%, included through the commensurate prior, or ignored. It may be surprising that a finding of a 1% ARR or even no effect in Tigris (cells g and h) can translate into a posterior probability of benefit of 87%-89% (odds of ~ 7:1 to 8:1) but note that this is lower than the 97% prior probability of benefit (odds 32:1) that we began with; a negative result in Tigris will reduce our belief that PMX is effective. Notably, as an absolute 0% ARR is quite dissimilar to the result in the treatable cohort (10.5% ARR), the commensurate prior gives less credence to the prior data and returns a posterior probability of benefit of 68.3% (cell i).\nDiscussion\nThe synthesis of results from a prior trial into the analysis of a new trial expresses the view that science is engaged in knowledge-building. For example, the totality of what we know about PMX in the target population will be best represented by the synthesized results once Tigris is completed. The use of Bayesian analyses forces an explicit expression of how previous findings will be used in the analysis of new data. Interpretation of results from a standalone trial often involves qualitative comparisons to other trials or observational data, but with no clear message about what the totality of evidence means.\nOn the weight of existing evidence, there is a weak recommendation against PMX hemadsorption in 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guideline [30]. Two systematic reviews [22, 23] concluded that hemadsorption in general and hemadsorption with PMX specifically, reduced mortality in patients with sepsis. A third meta-analysis found no benefit from trials with low risk of bias [31]. A propensity score-matched comparison of PMX to non-PMX hemadsorption in 4141 matched pairs found a reduction in all-cause in-hospital mortality with PMX treatment [20]. However, when PMX is used for all patients with sepsis or even septic shock, the overall treatment effect will be attenuated because not all patients will be able to benefit because most do not have endotoxin activity in the target range. Furthermore, not all patients with high endotoxin activity have sufficient organ dysfunction to warrant therapy. Fujimori et al. reported that PMX is not effective when the patients Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores are < 7 [17]. Thus, using both an organ failure threshold and an EAA range to enrich the patient population ensures that a larger effect size will be achieved. By contrast, most trials in critical illnesses such as sepsis, have used more pragmatic approaches that maximize sample size, on the premise that a larger sample size always increases power of the test of an intervention. The problem is that adding patients who cannot benefit actually reduces power because it lowers the average effect size\u2014it simply isn\u2019t possible to improve trial efficiency by enrolling the wrong patients.\nImportantly, the Bayesian analysis we have illustrated is entirely consistent with trials recently conducted to evaluate therapies of COVID-19. In fact, if EUPHRATES had not stopped entirely, but stopped enrollment only of those with EAA \u2265 0.90 and continued to enroll patients with EAA in the 0.60 to 0.89 range with MODS > 9 (an enrichment phase), it would resemble many of the large platform trials that have had so much success recently [32, 33]. If that had been the case, the treatment effect in the EAA-defined subgroup could have been estimated from all the patients who were in the EAA-defined subgroup in both the pre- and post-enrichment phases of the trial. When all the patients are pooled in this way, this is equivalent to forming a prior from the data in the first part of the trial, putting 100% weight on that prior, and updating it the with data from the second part of the trial. Finally, the selection of the treatable cohort from EUPHRATES (i.e., the group used to generate the prior used for Tigris) was not based on statistical \u201cfishing\u201d but rather, is supported by the literature. Observational studies have found reduced benefit for PMX for patients with lower organ failure scores [17], and endotoxin activity 0.9 or higher equates to a burden of endotoxin often beyond the capacity of the device to clear [18]. The ICEMAN instrument [19] provided in the supplement provides a detailed assessment of credibility for effect modification analyses such as this one.\nWe acknowledge that there will be criticism of our planned analysis because it uses an informative prior to increase the power of the Tigris trial at the expense of an increased frequentist type I error rate. The criticism is that if the true effect of PMX in TIGRIS is exactly zero, our analysis has a greater than 5% chance of concluding benefit for PMX when we use a 95% threshold for concluding benefit. Along with this criticism might come a suggestion that we use a more stringent threshold (e.g., Probability (benefit) > 99%), in order to attain 5% type I error rate. However, it has been shown [29, 34] that use of a more stringent threshold negates any power gains that come from using an informative prior. If data from EUPHRATES are used to create an informative prior favoring treatment, the type I error rate will be greater than (100-P)%, when we set the threshold for declaring benefit at P%. As it is not possible both to have power gains and strict control of type I error with our informative prior, there is no advantage to our use of such a prior if type I error control is of paramount concern. A criticism of power gains made at the expense of an increased type I error rate is a criticism of the use of an informative prior favoring treatment. The trade-offs inherent in the use of prior information are implicit in FDA guidance for the use of Bayesian statistics in medical device trials, [35] which sanctions loosened type I error control with the use of credible prior information: \u201cWhen using prior information, it may be appropriate to control type I error at a less stringent level than when no prior information is used. For example, if the prior information is favorable, the current trial may not need to provide as much information regarding safety and effectiveness. The degree to which we might relax the type I error control is a case-by-case decision that depends on many factors, primarily the confidence we have in the prior information.\u201d We believe this same logic extends beyond device trials. The question of the importance of type I error (or p-values) in study design cannot be resolved here. However, we have presented a study design that transparently adheres to Bayesian principles of data synthesis, along with its frequentist operating characteristics and anticipate healthy debate about our approach when Tigris is complete and analyzed.\nConclusion\nUsing Bayesian methods and a biologically credible prior distribution yields a study design with a much smaller sample size than a standalone trial. In our example, when the prior distribution places 75% weight on the historical data, the power for demonstrating benefit at the 95% probability threshold is greater than 80% for ARR of at least 14% in a sample of 150 patients randomized 2:1 in favor of the intervention. Bayesian methods may be a viable option for trials in critical care medicine where treatments have been elusive.\nAvailability of data and materials\nSimulation algorithms and Stan code are available in the supplement.

  "argos_summary": "The Tigris trial, a Phase 3 study sponsored by Spectral Medical, evaluated the efficacy of Polymyxin B Hemoadsorption (PMX) in adults with endotoxic septic shock. The trial demonstrated a 95.3% posterior probability of benefit for PMX on 28-day mortality, with a 6.4% absolute risk reduction compared to standard care. Additionally, the 90-day mortality results showed a significant benefit, with a 17.4% absolute difference favoring PMX. These findings support the potential of PMX as a treatment for this severe condition, and Spectral plans to submit for FDA approval.",
