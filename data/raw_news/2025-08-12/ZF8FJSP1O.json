  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Palantir's valuation multiples are at levels far beyond any of its peers in the software arena.\n\u2022 None At the same time, the company's revenue growth and profit margins exceed comparable businesses -- potentially suggesting the stock deserves to trade at a premium.\n\u2022 None While Palantir's growth is impressive, institutional investors may not rely as heavily on software industry metrics as much as Cramer implies.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies \u203a\n\nShares of data analytics powerhouse Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) soared by 141% this year. For two years running, Palantir is the top-performing stock in the S&P 500, and its momentum doesn't appear to be diminishing in the slightest.\n\nFollowing the company's blowout second quarter earnings report, CNBC investment personality Jim Cramer shared his thoughts on Palantir -- even going so far as to call the stock \"ridiculously cheap\".\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nThat's a bold statement, and one I'm not totally sold on myself. Let's explore some different valuation methodologies for Palantir and assess why Cramer still sees Palantir as a compelling buy.\n\nIs now a good time to buy Palantir stock? Read on to find out.\n\nMany years ago, I worked as an investment banking analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- which is now part of Truist Financial following its merger with BB&T Capital Markets. My focus was on mergers and acquisitions, and a key part of my role involved prepping comparable company valuation analyses.\n\nBroadly speaking, companies trade at a multiple of some profitability metric -- be it earnings, EBITDA, or free cash flow. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses are a slight exception to these traditional valuation norms, however. While SaaS businesses often have healthy gross margins, they tend to reinvest excess profits to bolster sales, marketing, and product development efforts rather than capture near-term profitability.\n\nThese dynamics make valuing Palantir a little tricky. For example, Palantir currently trades for a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 621 and a forward P/E of 287 -- levels so stretched that they offer little insight as very few (if any) other SaaS businesses trade at comparable multiples.\n\nI've benchmarked Palantir against a sizable cohort of SaaS companies specializing in data analytics, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, customer relationship management, and enterprise productivity.\n\nNot only does Palantir boast a meaningfully higher price-to-sales (P/S) multiple than any of its peers, but the ratio is expanding. By this very nature, Palantir stock is becoming more expensive relative to other SaaS stocks -- suggesting the stock is well past the point of being considered overvalued.\n\nGiven these dynamics, how can Cramer justify saying Palantir stock is cheap?\n\nWell, in order to understand his logic, investors are going to have to close the lid on traditional valuation protocols and look at some industry-specific metrics; in particular, the Rule of 40.\n\nIs Palantir's Rule of 40 score any good?\n\nThe Rule of 40 is a SaaS metric that is calculated by taking a company's revenue growth and adding it to some sort of profit margin (i.e. free cash flow margin, operating income margin, or EBITDA margin).\n\nThe chart above was included in Palantir's second quarter earnings report presentation. As investors can see, Palantir's Rule of 40 score of 94% is higher than any enterprise software company that generates at least $1 billion in revenue.\n\nPalantir's combination of accelerating revenue and improving profitability is unmatched in the software sector. When viewed through the lens of the Rule of 40, it's easy to see why some investors think the company's valuation is justified.\n\nMy issue with the Rule of 40\n\nRelying purely on the Rule of 40 to value Palantir is a controversial -- and potentially flawed -- approach.\n\nThe metric can be misleading for many reasons: short-term revenue spikes can create the illusion of sustained high growth, while profitability can appear more durable than it really is if a company chooses to use adjusted non-GAAP figures that remove certain expenses. As seen in the footnote in the slide above, Palantir uses adjusted operating margin in its Rule of 40 score. This is calculated by adding back non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation.\n\nMoreover, the Rule of 40 does not directly account for competitive dynamics in the broader market or the sustainability of growth -- meaning a high score does not necessarily imply that a stock is undervalued.\n\nWhile I applaud Palantir's growth throughout the AI revolution, I do think the stock is overbought and view Cramer's declaration that the stock is cheap as an outlier perspective.\n\nIn practice, institutional investors at hedge funds and wealth management firms generally place greater weight on traditional valuation methodologies such as P/S, P/E, or cash flow yields over industry-specific metrics such as the Rule of 40.\n\nIf these measures suggest that a stock is overvalued -- as they do with Palantir -- institutions will likely face pressure from their limited partners to trim exposure and lock in profits rather than add to their position at a premium valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

      "text": "What is it?\nWhat is the price-to-sales ratio?\nThe price-to-sales ratio, also known as \"price/sales,\" \"P/S ratio,\" or \"list-price-to-sale-price ratio,\" is one of many valuation metrics for stocks. The ratio describes how much someone must pay to buy one share of a company relative to how much that share generates in revenue for the company. Generally speaking, the lower the P/S ratio, the better.\nFormula\nPrice-to-sales ratio formula\nYou determine the P/S ratio by dividing the company's total market capitalization by its trailing 12-month revenue:\nThat means the P/S ratio is based solely on revenue, not on profits or cash flow. As a result, it's especially useful for comparing the valuations of companies with little or no profit or negative cash flow.\nCash Flow\nAmazon (AMZN -0.7%), for example, is notorious for having been unprofitable until 2003, seven years after it went public. On Jan. 1, 2003, Amazon's market capitalization (the sum of the price of all its outstanding shares) was $7.3 billion. Its trailing 12-month revenue was $3.9 billion. Divide $7.3 billion by $3.9 billion and you get about 1.8, which was Amazon's P/S ratio at the time.\nExample\nAn example of price-to-sales ratio analysis\nBy using the P/S ratio, we can compare Amazon's valuation on Jan. 1, 2003, with its performance leading up to that point:\nDue largely to how quickly Amazon was increasing its revenue, its price-to-sales ratio fell from a high of about 40 to 1.8. As a result, Amazon looks like a comparative bargain in 2003. (And it was: The stock has appreciated more than 22,000% since then.)\nComparing companies\nThe price-to-sales ratio can also be used for comparing companies -- including unprofitable companies -- against one another. Here, for example, is a comparison of two cloud-computing solution stocks, Snowflake (SNOW -0.22%) and Datadog (DDOG -1.7%).\nSnowflake's price-to-sales ratio is significantly higher than Datadog's. From a P/S ratio point of view, that makes Snowflake a more expensive stock. But that doesn't mean it's a worse investment. Snowflake could be worth the premium price because it's accruing revenue faster than Datadog. Remember, Amazon made a great investment in the early 2000s despite its sky-high P/S ratio because it was adding revenue at such a rapid clip.\nThe P/S ratio is a good starting point to compare two companies' stock, but investors should dive deeper to understand whether one stock is a better buy than the other.\nAdditional information\nWhat is a good price-to-sales ratio?\nIt depends on the company and the industry.\nGrocery stores, for example, have massive amounts of sales but relatively low profit margins, so it's not unusual for grocery store stocks to see P/S ratios of 0.2 or even 0.1. A higher-margin company could have a much higher P/S ratio and still be considered a bargain. Amazon's P/S ratio, for example, has ranged between 2 and 6 for the past five years.\nBecause P/S ratio is a rear-facing metric that looks only at past performance, fast-growing companies such as Snowflake or Datadog can easily see massive P/S ratios as investors bid up the price in expectation of future sales growth.\nYour best bet when looking at a company's P/S ratio is to compare it with the P/S ratios of similar companies in the same industry.\nOne piece of the puzzle\nThe price-to-sales ratio is a useful tool for evaluating companies, especially those with negative earnings or cash flow that can't be measured through the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or price-to-free-cash-flow ratio. But the P/S ratio isn't very useful on its own.\nFor example, if one company has a low P/S ratio but an unreasonably high debt load, it isn't necessarily a good value. A company's growth rate, profit margins, and competitive advantages should also be considered. Snowflake's P/S ratio might be much higher than Datadog's, but Snowflake also has no debt, is growing faster, and has a higher gross profit margin.\nInvesting decisions should never be made on the basis of a single metric, and the P/S ratio is no exception.\nRelated investing topics\nGoing beyond the P/S ratio\nCalculating the price-to-sales ratio for any given stock is very easy. Just divide the market cap by the company's total revenue. One of the best ways to use the P/S ratio is by comparing it to a stock's historical average. Alternatively, you can use it to compare the valuations of two companies' stocks to help determine which is a better fit for your portfolio. Ultimately, however, you should dig deeper for context around why the market may be trading a stock at a certain P/S ratio to make the best investment decisions possible."

      "text": "The price-to-earnings ratio, also known as the P/E ratio, is one of the most commonly used stock valuation metrics, and it is important for any investor to understand. In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at what the P/E ratio is, how to calculate it, and how to use it as part of your investment analysis.\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nThe P/E ratio, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a metric that compares a company\u2019s net income to its stock price. It can be an excellent tool when analyzing stocks and can help investors get a sense of whether a stock is a good value or expensive.\nAs the name implies, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the current share price of a stock and dividing by its earnings per share over a one-year period. For example, if a stock trades for $40 per share and earned $2 per share in the past year, its P/E ratio would be 20.\nYou may hear the P/E ratio also referred to as the P/E multiple or earnings multiple, and it\u2019s important to realize that these terms are often used interchangeably and mean the same thing.\nThere are several different ways to calculate the P/E ratio, with the two most common being the trailing P/E and the forward P/E. A stock\u2019s trailing P/E is calculated by using its past four quarters\u2019 earnings, while the forward P/E is calculated by using the consensus projections, or the company\u2019s own guidance, for the next 12 months of earnings.\nWhy is P/E ratio important?\nWhy is the P/E ratio important?\nThe P/E ratio is important because it is a valuation metric that is useful for comparing different investment opportunities to one another. It can be a useful tool when trying to identify undervalued stocks, and it can help you avoid overpaying for stocks as well.\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nThe most effective way to use the P/E ratio is to compare the valuations of businesses in the same industry at similar stages of maturity. For example, you might use the P/E ratio as part of an analysis comparing Target (TGT -1.36%), Costco (COST 0.79%), and Walmart (WMT 0.18%).\nIt is also worth pointing out that the P/E ratio doesn\u2019t work on companies that aren\u2019t profitable. There are other valuation metrics that can be applied to early-stage growth companies, but the P/E ratio isn\u2019t one of them.\nNo valuation metric can tell you if a stock is an attractive investment opportunity all by itself, and the P/E ratio is no exception. For example, the stock of a faster-growing business should have a higher P/E ratio than a slower-growing one, all other factors being equal. So the P/E ratio is best used as one piece of the puzzle, in combination with earnings growth, cash and debt levels, gross and net profit margins, and other figures.\nFinally, if a stock has a P/E ratio that is much lower than its peers, it can be a red flag that is worthy of further investigation. Companies with P/E ratios that seem too good to be true often have declining sales, poor balance sheet quality, or another underlying reason for the seemingly cheap valuation.\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nLet\u2019s take a look at a real-world example of calculating the P/E ratio. As of Feb. 6, 2023, Apple (AAPL -0.92%) traded for $154.50. Over the past four quarters, Apple earned $5.90 per share. So we can calculate its trailing P/E ratio as follows:\nSo Apple trades for 26.2 times its trailing-12-month earnings. If we wanted a more forward-looking metric, we can use Apple\u2019s projected earnings over the next 12 months, which are $6.23 per share. If we use this, our forward earnings calculation looks like:\nNow let\u2019s say that you\u2019re trying to decide between Apple and Microsoft (MSFT -0.16%). On the same date, Microsoft traded for $255.12. Its trailing-12-month earnings were $8.99 per share, so its trailing P/E ratio could be calculated as:\nApple\u2019s trailing P/E is 26.2, while Microsoft\u2019s is 28.4. Based on the P/E ratio alone, Apple appears to be the cheaper stock. However, as mentioned above, it\u2019s important to understand the P/E ratio is just one metric that should be used in stock analysis and doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nSo when conducting an analysis of two companies like this, the best practice is to use the P/E ratio along with other metrics for both companies to develop a thorough comparison of the two investment opportunities."

Let's go over GAAP vs. non-GAAP and what you should do if a company reports both.\nWhat is GAAP?\nWhat is GAAP?\nGAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, accounting standards are created and administered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The purpose of GAAP standards is to create a uniform way of measuring a company's financial health. GAAP principles dictate:\n- How a company can recognize revenue and expenses.\n- What types of expenses actually have to be capitalized as assets.\n- How information is presented to shareholders in an audited report.\n- What things need to be disclosed in the notes for financial statements.\nAlthough we'll focus on public companies in this article, private companies that have audited financials also use GAAP.\nGAAP is very useful for investors and auditors. These standards make it so you don't need to learn a totally new system of accounting and presentation for each individual company. While there will certainly be differences from industry to industry, you can expect the financial statements of similar companies to look and feel similar.\nThere are limitations, though. In some instances, GAAP reporting doesn't give investors a true picture of the current standing or long-term prospects of a company. When that happens, the company can also choose to report non-GAAP results.\nSEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)\nWhat is non-GAAP?\nWhat is non-GAAP?\nWhile GAAP accounting covers the entirety of the accounting process from paying an invoice to creating financial statements, non-GAAP accounting is an adjustment to already existing numbers. You probably don't have to worry that a company using non-GAAP accounting has a totally different set of books to produce its non-GAAP net income. You should be able to reconcile the company's GAAP and non-GAAP figures pretty easily.\nWhile the FASB created and makes changes to GAAP, there's no direct creator of non-GAAP standards. However, non-GAAP financials are still governed by the SEC. In fact, the SEC has taken action in the past against companies that it believes are being too aggressive with non-GAAP numbers.\nThat said, don't rely on the SEC to do due diligence on non-GAAP for you. Be vigilant in your analysis and move on if a company is being too aggressive -- even if the SEC hasn't done anything about it.\nOne of the most common forms of non-GAAP measurements in accounting is EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBIDTA is reported by most companies in press releases and financial statements. This isn't a true GAAP number for income, but it makes it a little easier to compare income from year to year and company to company.\nEBITDA\nWhen you use EBITDA, you don't have to worry about whether a company took on more debt that's reducing income with interest expense. You don't have to adjust depreciation because capital expenditures are materially higher. It's an easy back-of-the-envelope calculation.\nOf course, many non-GAAP (also called pro forma) reports of income aren't this easy. Companies will make all sorts of changes to net income to look better.\nThey'll add back depreciation because it is non-cash. They'll add back restructuring charges and say they're a one-time thing. Insurance companies will add back catastrophic losses if they think the losses aren't likely to recur. Some companies will even adjust the reported numbers of a recently acquired business to subtract out expenses it believes will be reduced with \"synergy.\"\nAs an investor, all of this makes it hard to trust non-GAAP numbers, and there's a long history of companies using non-GAAP to mislead investors. As long as the company reports GAAP financials as well, it can say anything it wants (as long as it isn't untrue, of course) with non-GAAP numbers.\nFor example, one-time costs suddenly become recurring costs. Synergies that were expected don't happen. And non-cash expenses exist in GAAP for a reason.\nWhy do companies use non-GAAP?\nWhy do companies use non-GAAP?\nThere are companies that use non-GAAP legitimately. They really do have one-time expenses or they have a business model that doesn't lend itself to GAAP reporting. Let's use an example to talk about why a company would stray from GAAP.\nIn its Q4 2020 earnings report, United Parcel Service (UPS -0.4%) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.66 per share. That is a non-GAAP number; the actual EPS was ($3.75) per share. Take a look at the chart in the company's earnings report showing the difference:\nThat's quite a difference (more than $6 billion), and you can see that UPS isn't a stranger to adjustments since it also reported much higher non-GAAP EPS in 2019.\nWhat's the story here? For UPS, the main addback in both years is charges GAAP required it to take to net income for shortages in its pension plan. The charges are so high that the company did a separate presentation on them after reporting its earnings.\nThe gist of the charge is that UPS did not estimate the demographics of its employees well and used too high of a discount rate when it calculated how much it needed in its pension plan to meet its obligations. It missed the mark by quite a bit and had to take a total of $7.72 billion in charges in 2019 and 2020.\nThe good news for investors is that the company has stopped doing new pensions for non-union employees and will no longer do pensions for any employees after Jan. 1, 2023. Like most businesses did decades ago, it will switch to a defined contribution plan.\nIt's obvious why UPS chooses to report non-GAAP (remember the company just calls it adjusted) EPS. Pension charges are part of doing business, but with the changes UPS has made to the program, management doesn't think these charges will recur. This is where you come in as an investor.\nRelated investing topics\nHow should investors handle non-GAAP?\nHow should investors handle non-GAAP?\nNo one ever said learning how to invest was easy. It seems perfectly reasonable as an investor to believe management's claim that these pension charges are a one-time deal and don't reflect the reality of UPS's business.\nBut what happens if the stock market crashes? Or what if ex-UPS employees live even longer and UPS has to do even more charges? Remember, even if it is a one-time expense, it is a legitimate expense.\nThe first thing you need to do is reconcile the numbers. Make sure you understand exactly how the company is adjusting its GAAP net income and why. If you don't understand how the numbers are calculated or can't get it to add up, you may want to pass.\nOnce you understand the numbers and management's case for using them, decide whether you agree with the case. And, even if you do, consider what the future holds if it turns out management is being overly optimistic."

      "text": "Jim Cramer is the face of CNBC's Mad Money television show. In that role, he educates and entertains his audience by exuberantly explaining the latest trends in the financial markets. He also shares his views on which stocks and sectors are poised to outperform and which are about to flop.\nRead on to learn how Cramer rose from journalist to hedge fund manager to TV personality, how he invests, and what's in the portfolio he manages today.\nWho is he?\nWho is Jim Cramer?\nJim Cramer is a television personality and former hedge fund manager who makes investing recommendations for viewers. He grew up in Pennsylvania and developed an early interest in investing, even tracking a portfolio of stocks he picked but didn't own. Reportedly, his fictitious portfolio would have profited by seven figures before he finished elementary school.\nIn his 20s, Cramer had moved on to investing real money, refining his approach to focus on lesser-known stocks. He made enough in profits to pay for a year of his post-graduate studies at Harvard Law School. By the time Cramer completed his law degree, he was managing money for a Harvard Law faculty member and was ready to start a career in finance.\nCramer worked at Goldman Sachs (GS -0.31%) for three years before he launched the hedge fund Cramer Levy Partners. In 1996, he cofounded financial news website TheStreet. He left the hedge fund a few years later to host syndicated radio show Jim Cramer's Real Money. In 2005, he began his lengthy tenure as host of Mad Money.\nCramer has also written several books, including Get Rich Carefully and Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World. He sold his interest in TheStreet in 2019.\nPersonal stats\nJim Cramer's personal stats\n- Age: Born on Feb. 10, 1955\n- Source of wealth: Former hedge fund founder and manager, author, and television personality\n- Marital status: Married\n- Residence: Summit, NJ\n- Children: Two daughters, one stepdaughter, and one stepson\n- Education: Bachelor's degree in government from Harvard University and a Juris Doctor (law) degree from Harvard Law School\nInvestment approach\nJim Cramer's investment approach\nCramer's investment approach follows opportunity. Whether the market's up or down, he believes there's opportunity somewhere and it's the investor's responsibility to find it. In a bear market, that opportunity could be hiding in a less prominent industry or in a different asset class, such as bonds or cryptocurrency.\nAdmittedly, being opportunistic is an open-ended strategy that is not easy to teach or implement. Fortunately, Cramer also promotes some specific investing rules to guide his followers and fans.\n1. Do your homework\nCramer recommends investors devote sufficient time to researching stocks, both before and after buying them. For pre-buying research, he stresses the importance of learning the business model, understanding the financial statements, appreciating the product value, and researching the leadership team.\nAfter buying a stock, Cramer recommends shareholders spend an hour researching for each stock they own. Instead of \"buy and hold,\" he recommends \"buy and homework.\" Those who can't or won't put in the time may be better suited for lower maintenance index funds.\n2. Diversify across sectors\nTo Cramer, diversification is easy and obvious protection against sector weakness. After all, the investment community is fickle -- one bad news event can bring down an entire industry. When that happens, being diversified protects you from feeling the full force of the downturn.\nI can't say a diversified portfolio is bulletproof. But I can say that it makes it easier to stay in the game when one particularly popular group gets put through the meat grinder.Jim Cramer\n3. Invest in the best in class\nCramer recommends investing in any industry's strongest player. That way, even if the industry falls out of favor temporarily, you know you own the company that will recover first. He compares this strategy to buying quality merchandise over cheaper goods. The quality stuff will last longer and won't need to be replaced as quickly.\n4. Know when to buy and when to sell\nCramer is not a buy-and-hold-forever investor. He believes in strategically selling winners and taking profits when the opportunity arises, even if you plan to reinvest in that stock later.\nOf course, recognizing those peaks and valleys in the moment is easier said than done. Cramer believes you should know the value of what you own and be ready to trade when the stock price drifts too far from that value.\n5. Keep emotions out of it\nCramer says panic leads to poor decision-making. He advises investors to stay grounded and focus on the value of their positions -- rather than the price the market is currently applying. With a clear head, you are more likely to see and act on opportunities in volatile markets.\nInvestments\nJim Cramer's investments\nSince Cramer is a stock-picking television personality, he invests his personal wealth in index funds to sidestep any conflicts of interest. He shared his personal allocations in a 2021 interview with AARP. Prior to his 65th birthday, he was invested in 80% U.S. stocks, 10% international stocks, and 10% gold and cryptocurrency.\nAfter turning 65, he shifted to the more conservative composition of 50% cash, 40% U.S. stocks, 5% international stocks, and 5% gold and cryptocurrency.\nRecommendations\nCramer's stock recommendations\nCramer makes frequent stock recommendations -- often more than 100 per month. Here are some of the stocks he has been bullish on or has recommended buying.\n| Name and ticker | Market cap | Industry |\n|---|---|---|\n| Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) | $2.4 trillion | Interactive Media and Services |\n| Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) | $2.4 trillion | Multiline Retail |\n| Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) | $3.4 trillion | Technology Hardware, Storage and Peripherals |\n| Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) | $1.9 trillion | Interactive Media and Services |\n| Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) | $4.4 trillion | Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment |\n| Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) | $1.1 trillion | Automobiles |\n| Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) | $189 billion | Road and Rail |\nAdditional information\nMore from Jim Cramer\nRelated investing topics\nInvest like Jim Cramer\nLove him or hate him, Cramer is influential in the investment community. He promotes in-depth research, diversification, and adjusting your approach to market trends as primary investing strategies. His on-air stock picks can be a mixed bag, but he has provided some useful advice, and there aren't many analysts who cover as many companies as Cramer.\nFAQs\nJim Cramer FAQs\nHow did Jim Cramer get rich?\nCramer started his wealth journey in his 20s by investing as a hobby. He would subsequently sell securities for Goldman Sachs, launch his own hedge fund, co-found TheStreet.com, and become the face of CNBC's Mad Money television show. Cramer reportedly generated double-digit, market-beating returns in his hedge fund over a 14-year period.\nWhat is Jim Cramer famous for?\nCramer is best known for hosting CNBC's Mad Money television show. He's also a co-anchor on Squawk on the Street, filmed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the start of each trading day.\nHow does Jim Cramer invest?\nAccording to his stock picks in his investment club and on Mad Money, Cramer is an opportunistic investor. He views volatility as the opportunity to buy or sell. He likes growth stocks but will also take advantage of a good value.\nNote that Cramer doesn't buy individual stocks with his own money anymore to avoid conflicts of interest. In 2021, he said his personal wealth was invested in 50% cash, 40% U.S. stock index funds, 5% international, and 5% in gold and cryptocurrency."

      "text": "A job well done may be its own reward, but a salary and equity in a company are often better. Companies -- especially start-ups -- will frequently offer stock to employees as an incentive to stay with them. Here, we'll discuss stock-based compensation and how it's used and provide an example of a corporate officer who's been rewarded with an ownership share.\nWhat is stock-based compensation?\nWhat is stock-based compensation?\nCompensation for an employee can come in many forms: Paychecks, benefits, bonuses, and, of course, stock in the company that gives employees a stake in the company's ownership. Although stock-based compensation is no guarantee of wealth, providing valuable employees with an ownership stake in the company can be a means of both rewarding and retaining workers.\nAs a general rule, stock-based compensation is a bit more involved than simply handing shares to employees. Usually, companies offer employees an ownership stake with strings that require them to work for a certain period before they take full ownership of the shares.\nTypes\nTypes of stock-based compensation\nThere are five basic types of stock-based compensation:\n- Shares. This is a common type of compensation. Again, employees who are given shares typically have to wait a certain amount of time before they're able to sell their shares. Although shares are frequently given to top employees in a corporation, such as chief executive officers, board members, and other senior executives, workers are often rewarded for loyalty and hard work with shares as part of their compensation.\n- Restricted stock units (RSUs). Commonly given to corporate officers, RSUs are usually based on specific company performance goals, such as reaching annual revenue or income targets. As with any other type of stock-based compensation, a vesting period is generally required.\n- Stock options. These are not usually direct stock awards but give employees the opportunity to buy a certain amount of stock at a pre-determined price. If the stock price rises to a certain level and the vesting period is met, an employee can borrow money to buy shares at the option price and then sell them for a profit. If the stock falls below the strike price for the option, the shares are essentially worthless to the employee (at least, for the time being).\n- Phantom shares. When is stock-based compensation not actually stock-based compensation? When it involves phantom shares, which are essentially cash distributions to employees that are based on a company's share price. Although it's less common in the U.S., the practice of handing out phantom shares is common in Germany, with more than three-quarters of German companies using it to reward and retain employees.\n- Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). In an ESOP, employees are given stock generally based on their tenure and other compensation. ESOPs usually hold the shares in a trust, and employees can cash out their shares when they leave the company. ESOPs are also useful in keeping businesses afloat when a founder or primary shareholder dies or leaves the business without a succession plan since ownership passes to the actual employees.\nRelated investing topics\nAccounting implications\nAccounting implications\nStock-based compensation can affect the company's income statement, statement of cash flows, and balance sheet.\nOn the income statement, the awarding of shares or options is an operating expense usually recorded when the shares or options vest. The employee's role in the company typically determines the exact line item for the expense. It could be cost of goods sold, research and development (R&D), sales, or something else.\nThe cash flow statement should show the non-cash equity compensation expense in the reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities. The cash flow statement would also show any cash collected from exercised stock options.\nOn the balance sheet, vested shares and exercised options increase the company's equity value and share count. This dilutes ownership and the company's earnings per share. Some companies will use share buybacks to offset these dilutive effects.\nExample\nExample of stock-based compensation\nChief executives are the most high-profile and frequent recipients of stock-based compensation, which has made them incredibly wealthy. Consider Apple's (AAPL -0.92%) Tim Cook, who was appointed CEO of the tech giant in 2011.\nCook hasn't been shy about turning shares into cash, selling 511,000 shares worth $87.8 million (before taxes) in October 2023. Cook had also sold $355 million in Apple shares in August 2021. Even with the sales, Cook still owns an estimated 3.3 million shares worth about $565 million.\nAlthough Cook's day job involves running one of the world's largest companies -- Apple has a market capitalization of roughly $3 trillion as of December -- he also serves on the board of Nike (NKE -0.25%), the Oregon-based athletic shoe and clothing titan. His reward for serving on the board includes more than 31,000 shares of Nike stock worth more than $3 million."

      "text": "Stanley Druckenmiller is a billionaire investor who manages capital at his fund, the Duquesne Family Office. Over the past few years, he has made some eyebrow-raising moves related to investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Perhaps the biggest head-scratcher was his selling Nvidia stock when everyone else seemed to be buying. In fairness, though, Druckenmiller has since expressed some regret about exiting his Nvidia position.\nWhile Nvidia has been one of the largest beneficiaries of a bullish AI narrative, it's far from the only growth stock out there. Ironically, however, Druckenmiller just dumped his fund's entire stake in yet another scorching hot AI stock.\nWill Druckenmiller come to regret this decision, too? I don't think so. Read on to find out which AI darling the Duquesne Family Office just exited, and learn why I think this was a savvy decision.\nWhich AI darling did Druckenmiller dump now?\nAccording to its most recent 13F filing, the Duquesne Family Office has completely exited its position in Palantir Technologies (PLTR -2.27%). In the table below, I've summarized Druckenmiller's exposure to Palantir stock over the last year.\n| Category | Q1 2024 | Q2 2024 | Q3 2024 | Q4 2024 | Q1 2025 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Shares | 769,965 | 769,965 | 41,710 | 41,710 | 0 |\nPer the data above, it appears that the majority of Duquesne's exposure to Palantir was trimmed in the middle of last year. Over the last six months, Druckenmiller's fund held a small position in Palantir stock -- enjoying record gains as the company remained one of the best-performing stocks across the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indices. It begs the question: Why sell now?\nWhy might Druckenmiller have dumped Palantir stock?\nSince going public in 2020, Palantir stock has gained well over 1,000%. That's an unusually high return in this short a time duration. However, looking at Palantir's parabolic rise through this lens is a bit misleading. The reason I say that is because the majority of gains in the stock have actually occurred over the last 18 months. When you look at it that way, it becomes even more questionable just how much further the stock can run right now.\nIn the graph above, I've benchmarked Palantir's valuation against a peer set of high-growth software stocks on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. Not only is Palantir the obvious outlier here, but just look at how much expansion its valuation multiples have experienced over the last year relative to its peers.\nAs of the closing bell on May 23, Palantir boasted a market capitalization of $291 billion -- considerably more than Salesforce (which I predicted would happen), despite being a much smaller, less diversified, and less profitable business.\nIn my eyes, Druckenmiller isn't going to roll the dice on any more momentum fueling Palantir. I think he decided to take his gains and redeploy capital into more appropriately valued businesses.\nShould you sell Palantir stock right now?\nOne of the secrets to investing is that there is never really a perfect time to sell a stock. What I would point out about Palantir's valuation right now is that its P/S multiple is more than double the levels that Amazon and Cisco peaked at during the dot-com bubble, and considerably higher than where Nvidia reached throughout the AI revolution.\nI bring this up because as sobering as it may be to realize, even the hottest growth stocks experience pullbacks from time to time. As Palantir stock continues to rocket higher, I suspect expectations will rise around its quarterly earnings results. This presents a risk in that Palantir could deliver a monster earnings report, but ultimately fail to live up to unjustifiably lofty expectations -- hence, the stock could drop off a cliff instantly.\nWhile I remain a long-term bull, I wouldn't blame investors who trim their Palantir positions right now. One prudent approach could be to sell enough to at least recoup your initial investment. Another strategy could be to collect some gains if you're up by 15% or more on your position (essentially double the long-run average annual return of the S&P 500)."

      "text": "Mergers and acquisitions are more than just a payday for investment bankers. They're a key tactic for growth and capital allocation, especially among big businesses.\nSometimes known as M&A, mergers and acquisitions have been valued at $100 billion or more. They can be transformative or disastrous for businesses, depending on the deal.\nWhat are mergers and acquisitions?\nWhat are mergers and acquisitions?\nMergers and acquisitions are the umbrella term given to business combinations. When two businesses combine and form a new entity, that's the result of an M&A deal.\nMergers generally reference the combination of two businesses that are roughly the same size, while an acquisition implies a larger business taking over a smaller business and absorbing it within its operations.\nMergers often come with name and leadership changes, while the acquiring company's organization tends to remain stable in an acquisition.\nWhy are they done?\nWhy do businesses do M&A deals?\nThere are a lot of different arguments and justifications for M&A deals.\nGenerally, they take place because the acquirer sees a strategic opportunity in the acquisition or both companies believe the company will be stronger as a single unit, in the case of a merger.\nSometimes, there's a trend in an industry toward consolidation. In the media industry, for example, there have been a number of mergers and acquisitions in the streaming sector as legacy media companies and others are aiming to build content libraries and scale to compete successfully in streaming.\nIn other instances, a company may acquire another business to diversify into a new market or geography or to vertically integrate either downstream or upstream, moving closer to the customer or to the raw materials required to make the product.\nA company may make an acquisition to take control of a particular product or intellectual property like a patent. Sometimes, a business might acquire a smaller company for its talent or leadership, which is derisively known as an acqui-hire.\nRisks of mergers and acquisitions\nWhat are the risks of mergers and acquisitions?\nAlthough M&A deals are a popular tactic for growing a business and adding value, the strategy doesn't always pan out, and mergers aren't as easy as they seem in the boardroom.\nThere are a number of risks and pitfalls involved in the process. Among the biggest is the cultural fit. If the two companies have much different cultures, the absorbed employees are unlikely to feel at home.\nAT&T's acquisition of Time Warner was plagued by a culture clash since AT&T was much more conservative and formal than the more freewheeling Time Warner. Similarly, Walmart's takeover of Jet.com led to Walmart banning alcohol and profanity from Jet's offices before reversing that decision after a protest.\nSimilarly, deciding on new leadership can also be a pitfall since the absorbed employees may prefer to work for their former executive team, and making a new leadership team for a new company is not easy.\nAnother common risk is that a company overpays in an acquisition. To buy out a company, the acquiring business often has to pay a premium, buying the company for significantly more than the existing stock price. To justify that, the target business has to deliver extra value to the acquirer. If the deal goes bust, as it did with Time Warner and AT&T, that can make it especially costly.\nFinally, there's the risk that the strategic rationale behind the deal is poorly thought out. AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015, for example, buying a declining satellite TV business that would soon be worth much less than the $67 billion it paid for it.\nRelated investing topics\nExample of an M&A\nAn example of a merger or acquisition\nOne recent high-profile merger was the creation of Warner Bros. Discovery, which was formed by the combination of Discovery Communications with Warner Media, the renamed Time Warner that was spun off by AT&T.\nDiscovery was searching for a partner to beef up its content library for the streaming era, and AT&T was anxious to get Warner Media off of its books after its acquisition of Time Warner went sour.\nSince combining, the new company has launched a new streaming service, Max, which includes content from both Discovery and Warner Media properties like HBO.\nHowever, the stock has struggled since the merger amid broader challenges in the streaming industry.\nLooking ahead, we could see mergers and acquisitions pick up in the next bull market as businesses could get more aggressive with spending and growth opportunities, but investors should be careful to scrutinize each M&A deal before deciding if it's a winner."

      "text": "If you follow the software industry, you've probably heard talk of the Rule of 40. This is a shorthand rule of thumb for assessing whether a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business is investable.\nWhat it is\nWhat does the Rule of 40 mean in SaaS?\nThe Rule of 40 refers to the sum of a company's revenue growth and its free-cash-flow margin, or a similar profitability metric, such as its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin.\nIf the number is above 40%, the company is considered healthy and worth investing in. For example, if a company has 20% revenue growth and a 20% free-cash-flow margin, someone using this metric would consider investing in the business.\nNotably, a software company can reach the Rule of 40 by having strong revenue growth and a negative free-cash-flow margin, or it can be a slower-growing company with a strong free-cash-flow margin.\nMany software companies rely on stock-based compensation to boost free-cash-flow margin or adjusted EBITDA. This makes the Rule of 40 target easier to achieve than it would be if generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) numbers were used.\nWhere it started\nWhere does the Rule of 40 come from?\nThe Rule of 40 was popularized by venture capitalists Brad Feld and Fred Wilson, who described the concept in blog posts in 2015. The pair learned about it in a board meeting from another investor, who used it to gauge software start-ups.\nAt the time, the Rule of 40 was understood to apply to start-up firms rather than publicly traded companies, which could be more easily valued by the market. But publicly traded software stocks have also adopted the Rule of 40 as shorthand for success. Achieving the Rule of 40 means that a business is delivering strong growth, strong profitability, or a good balance of both.\nThe rule caught on because it neatly sums up the balance between growth and profitability that start-ups and software stocks must navigate to be successful. Some companies with rates higher than 40 will use phrases like the Rule of 50, 60, and so forth to demonstrate the strength of their businesses.\nIts usefulness\nIs the Rule of 40 useful?\nThe Rule of 40 is a good rule of thumb for determining whether a software business is delivering a good mix of growth and profitability. However, it shouldn't be the only criterion you use to decide whether to invest in a stock.\nThe rule can be dangerous if a business focuses too much on hitting one number. For instance, free-cash-flow margins can be boosted by using excessive share-based compensation or by delaying capital expenditures so they can hit a certain number for investors. Capital expenditures tend to be minimal for software businesses, but there are other tricks they can use to inflate free cash flow in a given quarter.\nOverall, the metric is useful, but investors should consider other financial metrics, such as GAAP profitability, which can differ substantially from free cash flow.\nRelated investing topics\nAn example\nWhat's an example of the Rule of 40?\nOne company that offers a good example of the Rule of 40 is Palantir (PLTR -2.27%). Palantir is a highly valued software company focused on data fusion and analytics for government agencies and commercial businesses. It often touts the Rule of 40 in earnings reports and calls.\nAs the business has performed well with both margins and revenue growth increasing, its Rule of 40 score has climbed higher. In the first quarter of 2025, Palantir reported revenue growth of 39%, and its free-cash-flow margin improved to 42%. Management opted to use an adjusted operating margin of 44% to give it a Rule of 40 score of 83%, as CEO Alex Karp had touted in the earnings release.\nThat offers one explanation for why Palantir stock has done so well. Consider the Rule of 40 the next time you look at a software stock. While it's not the only factor that should determine whether you buy a stock, it's a good starting point for analyzing SaaS stocks."

      "text": "The acronym EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA is a useful metric for understanding a business's ability to generate cash flow for its owners and for judging a company's operating performance.\nWhy it matters\nWhy EBITDA matters\nEBITDA is an earnings metric that is capital-structure neutral, meaning it doesn't account for the different ways a company may use debt, equity, cash, or other capital sources to finance its operations. It also excludes non-cash expenses like depreciation, which may or may not reflect a company's ability to generate cash that it can pay back as dividends.\nAdditionally, it excludes taxes, which can vary from one period to the next and are affected by numerous conditions that may not be directly related to a company's operating results.\nAmortization\nOverall, EBITDA is a handy tool for normalizing a company's results so you can more easily evaluate the business. To be clear, EBITDA is not a substitute for other metrics such as net income. After all, the items excluded from EBITDA -- interest, taxes, and non-cash expenses -- are still real items with financial implications that should not be dismissed or ignored.\nEBITDA is often most useful for comparing two similar businesses or trying to determine a company's cash flow potential.\nHow to calculate\nHow to calculate EBITDA\nEBITDA is very simple to calculate. Start with a company's annual SEC Form 10-K or quarterly 10-Q report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Go to the operating statement, and you will find line items for all of the items in EBITDA:\n- Earnings (net income or net loss)\n- Interest expense (sometimes also interest income)\n- Income tax expense (sometimes also tax credit)\n- Depreciation and amortization (typically combined but sometimes as separate line items)\nNext, add up all the line items that are expenses, subtract any line items that are income (such as interest income), then add the total to the net income (or net loss) figure. The result is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. In other words, you're adding any expenses from these categories to (and subtracting any gains from) the company's net income.\nNote: Many companies also report adjusted EBITDA. This is not the same thing as EBITDA since it includes additional expenses such as stock issuance, nonrecurring expenses, and other material items that affect the results. While adjusted EBITDA can be useful, it can also be used by company management to support a narrative that frames the company in the best light while disregarding items investors should factor into their analysis and not ignore.\nLimitations of EBITDA\nThe limitations of EBITDA\nEBITDA can be a useful tool for better understanding a company's underlying operating results, comparing it to similar businesses, and understanding the impact of the company's capital structure on its bottom line and cash flows.\nHowever, using EBITDA incorrectly can have a negative impact on your returns. EBITDA should not be used exclusively as a measure of a company's financial performance, nor should it be a reason to disregard the impact of a company's capital structure on its financial performance.\nEBITDA should be considered one tool among many in your financial analysis tool belt. The example below helps explain why relying solely on EBITDA can be a mistake.\nWhy EBITDA: An example\nWhy EBITDA: An example\nSuppose you wanted to evaluate two businesses. To keep this example easy to follow, we will compare two lemonade stands with similar revenues, equipment and property investments, taxes, and costs of production. But they'll have big differences in how much net income they generate due to differences in their capital structures.\nLemonade Stand A was funded entirely by equity. Lemonade Stand B primarily uses debt to fund its operations. The only difference between them is how they choose to finance these assets -- one with debt, one with equity.\nIncome statements for these two lemonade stands appear below.\n| Lemonade Stand A | |\n|---|---|\n| Revenue | $1,000 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | $200 |\n| Interest Expense | $0 |\n| Depreciation of Lemonade Stand | $50 |\n| Income Before Taxes | $750 |\n| Net Income (35% tax rate) | $487.50 |\n| EBITDA | $800 |\nNote that Lemonade Stand A earned $487.50 in net income, while EBITDA was $800 in the example year.\n| Lemonade Stand B | |\n|---|---|\n| Revenue | $1,000 |\n| Cost of Goods Sold | $200 |\n| Interest Expense ($1,500 at 10% interest) | $150 |\n| Depreciation of Lemonade Stand | $50 |\n| Income Before Taxes | $600 |\n| Net Income (35% tax rate) | $390 |\n| EBITDA | $800 |\nBecause Lemonade Stand B uses substantially more debt ($1,500 at 10% interest) to finance its operations, it is less profitable in terms of net income ($390 in profits versus $487.50). However, when compared on the basis of EBITDA, the lemonade stands are equal, each producing $800 in EBITDA from $1,000 in sales last year.\nWhat's the lesson here? By looking at EBITDA, we can determine the underlying profitability of a company's operations, allowing for easier comparison to another business. Then we can take those results and gain a deeper understanding of the impact of a company's capital structure, e.g., debt and capital expenditures, as well as differences in taxes (particularly if the companies operate in different places) on the company's actual profits and cash flows.\nRelated investing topics\nDoing all that can go a long way toward helping you decide if a company is worth investing in and what price it's worth. In the example above, Lemonade Stand A would be worth more to investors since it is able to turn more of its EBITDA into net income. Lemonade Stand B isn't as profitable because of its debt expense, so investors should be compensated by paying a lower stock price."

      "text": "One industry that is transforming in real time thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is enterprise software.\nWhile cloud computing hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have benefited handsomely from new AI-powered services, two other software companies have emerged as fan favorites in the stock market -- largely thanks to their diversified exposure to various applications, offering investors a deeper playbook compared to more specialized businesses offered through big tech.\nAs of the closing bell on July 17, shares of Palantir Technologies (PLTR -2.27%) and BigBear.ai (BBAI -0.49%) have risen by 104% and 85%, respectively, so far this year. Despite such monster gains, I'd caution investors from following this momentum blindly.\nTo get a better sense of the investment case between Palantir and BigBear.ai, I'll compare the two businesses across a number of financial and operating metrics -- particularly the Rule of 40. Let's dig in!\nWhat is the rule of 40 in SaaS?\nOutside of traditional financial figures such as revenue, gross profit, and net income, companies will often rely on industry-specific metrics to help investors better understand the health of the business. For software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses, non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) metrics, such as annual recurring revenue (ARR), or the Rule of 40 are often used to complement traditionally reported financials on the income or cash-flow statements.\nThe Rule of 40 is derived by taking a company's revenue growth rate and adding it to free-cash-flow margin. Generally speaking, SaaS companies strive to achieve combined scores above 40%.\nWhile the Rule of 40 can be a useful tool in benchmarking SaaS companies, it does have some nuances.\nFirst, some companies will choose other profit-adjacent metrics such as operating income margin or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin instead of free cash flow. In addition, companies can also inflate non-GAAP figures such as EBITDA and free cash flow by using adjustments such as stock-based compensation in their calculations.\nAlthough the Rule of 40 is not necessarily as bulletproof as traditional valuation benchmarks such as price-to-sales (P/S) or price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF), it can still be a useful tool when screening SaaS businesses against one another more broadly.\nComparing Palantir and BigBear.ai across the Rule of 40\nOne thing that is nice about Palantir's reporting is that it provides investors with a view into non-GAAP measures, such as the Rule of 40. At the end of the first quarter, Palantir achieved a Rule of 40 score of 83%. This figure was calculated by taking the company's revenue growth rate of 39% and adding it to adjusted operating income margin of 44%.\nIn the table below, I've outlined the necessary financials from the first quarter to calculate BigBear.ai's Rule of 40 score.\n| Financial Figure | $Amount |\n|---|---|\n| Revenue ($) | $34.8 million |\n| Revenue growth rate (%) | 5% |\n| Free cash flow ($) | ($8.3 million) |\n| Free cash flow margin (%) | (24%) |\n| Adjusted EBITDA ($) | ($7 million) |\n| Adjusted EBITDA (%) | (20%) |\n| Rule of 40 (free cash flow margin) | (19%) |\n| Rule of 40 (adjusted EBITDA margin) | (15%) |\nWhat's the verdict?\nAs the analysis above illustrates, even with adjusted (inflated) EBITDA figures, BigBear.ai's Rule of 40 score remains well below 0%. Meanwhile, Palantir's Rule of 40 score has increased by more than twofold over the last two years.\nTo me, these trends highlight something deeper. I see Palantir's improving Rule of 40 score as a direct translation of the company's enormous success with its AI platforms, Foundry and Gotham. By contrast, BigBear.ai's foray into the AI realm has not been anywhere near as lucrative -- underscored by rather muted revenue growth and an unproven path to profitability, making its long-run worthiness as an investment questionable.\nIn my eyes, BigBear.ai's rising stock price can be attributed to more of a bullish macro narrative surrounding some of its end markets -- particularly in defense tech, which is just one area that Palantir is currently dominating. In other words, it's likely that some investors are hoping that Palantir's success means that BigBear.ai is destined to follow the same trajectory. Smart investors know that isn't always how things turn out in reality, though. Moreover, hope is not a prudent investment strategy.\nPalantir is a faster-growing, more profitable enterprise than BigBear.ai by a longshot. In my eyes, Palantir is the superior choice between the two budding AI software businesses."

  "argos_summary": "Palantir Technologies has seen a significant rise in its stock value, outperforming its peers in the software sector with a 141% increase this year. Despite its high valuation multiples, which are among the highest in the industry, the company's strong revenue growth and profit margins suggest it may deserve a premium. However, reliance on the Rule of 40 for valuation, which combines revenue growth and profit margins, can be misleading, as it may not fully account for competitive dynamics and sustainability of growth. Institutional investors typically favor traditional valuation metrics, which indicate that Palantir may be overvalued.",
