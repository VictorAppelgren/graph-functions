During that stretch, the Fever lost guards Sydney Colson (left ACL tear) and Aari McDonald (broken right foot) to season-ending injuries, creating a glaring need for as Caitlin Clark remains sidelined because of a right groin injury.\n\nThe Fever are coming off a 81-80 loss to the Dallas Wings on Tuesday, Aug 12. Indiana trailed 17-points with 6:38 remaining in the game, but the Fever went on a 19-3 run and cut the deficit to one. Indiana had a chance to win it, but the Wings' defense shut down the Fever's final possession.\n\nFollowing the loss, Fever coach Stephanie White criticized officiating this season, calling Aliyah Boston \"the worst officiated post player in the league.\" White added, \"She never gets a call. There's a double standard there certainly, but if it's going to be physical... allow both teams to be physical.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Mystics are coming off a 88-83 loss to the Golden State Valkyries, marking the team's fifth loss in six games. Rookies Kiki Iriafen and Sonia Citron have been sensational this year \u2014 Iriafen leads all rookies in rebounds (8.3 per game), while Sonia Citron ranks second among rookies in points (14.8) \u2014 but the Mystics find themselves outside the playoff picture in 10th place in the standings.\n\nHere's what you need to know for Friday's game between the Fever and Mystics:\n\nWhat time is Indiana Fever vs. Washington Mystics?\n\nThe Indiana Fever will host the Washington Mystics at 7:30 p.m. ET (4:30 p.m. PT) on Tuesday, Aug. 12 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.

      "text": "Caitlin Clark injury update: Is Fever guard playing today against Mystics?\nIndiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark has been out with a right groin injury for nearly a month, leaving many fans wondering when the All-Star guard will make her return to the court.\nClark will miss the Fever's matchup against the Washington Mystics on Friday, her 12th consecutive absence since suffering the groin injury July 15. Clark, who previously missed time with a left quad and a left groin injury, has been sidelined 20 of the Fever's 33 games this season. Indiana is 8-5 with Clark in the lineup and 10-10 without her on the floor.\nClark's lengthy absence marks uncharted territory for the 2024 Rookie of the Year, who never missed a game during her four years at Iowa or during her rookie campaign with the Fever.\n\"I've never been through anything like this, which is probably why it's been so hard,\" Clark said during a Aug. 8 episode of Sue Bird's podcast, \"Bird's Eye View.\" \"I've never really dealt with injury. It's probably been a challenge in itself because when I was first feeling pain, I didn't understand it.\"\nClark isn't the only injury Indiana is navigating. The Fever lost guards Sydney Colson (left ACL tear) and Aari McDonald (broken right foot) to season-ending injuries, further depleting the team's depth at point guard. The Fever signed guard Odyssey Sims to a hardship contract on Sunday and guard Kyra Lambert to a seven-day contract on Thursday.\nHere's what we know about Clark's injury status, including a full injury timeline:\nIs Caitlin Clark playing Friday? Injury status for Fever-Mystics\nClark (right groin injury) will likely be ruled out of the Fever's matchup against the Washington Mystics on Friday in Indianapolis, which is set to tip off at 7:30 p.m. ET (4:30 p.m. PT) on ESPN. Indiana hasn't announced a timetable for Clark's return. Earlier this week, Fever coach Stephanie White said Clark has resumed running, but hasn't returned to practice just yet, meaning her return won't be anytime soon.\nIf Clark is ruled out, Friday's game against the Mystics would mark her 21st total absence of the year.\nHow was Caitlin Clark injured?\nClark suffered a right groin injury in the final minute of the Fever's 85-77 victory over the Sun at TD Garden in Boston on July 15. With 39.1 seconds remaining in the contest, Clark completed a bounce pass to Kelsey Mitchell to put the Fever up 84-75. After the pass, Clark immediately grabbed for her right groin and grimaced as she gingerly walked over and headbutted the stanchion. She did not return to the game.\nCaitlin Clark injury timeline\n- May 24: Clark suffered a left quad injury during the Fever's 90-88 loss to the New York Liberty, where she recorded a double-double with 18 points and 10 assists. Clark couldn't pinpoint the specific play that caused her injury, but noted that it happened early in the contest. Clark said, \"Adrenaline covers up a lot of stuff when you're in the heat of battle. After the game, I had some pain, and then we got an MRI, and that kind of gave me the result that I didn't want to see.\" She missed the Fever's next five games.\n- June 14: Clark returned to Indiana's lineup in the Fever's 102-88 win over the Liberty and dropped 32 points, nine assists and eight rebounds in her first game back.\n- June 24: Clark suffered a left groin injury in the Fever's 94-86 win over the Seattle Storm, which resulted in Clark missing the team's next four games. Fever coach Stephanie White said she learned of Clark's groin injury the following night after Clark alerted team trainers of discomfort.\n- July 1: Clark was ruled out of the Fever's 2025 Commissioner's Cup win over the Minnesota Lynx in Minneapolis. That didn't stop Clark from rightfully celebrating the team's hardware.\n- July 9: Clark returned to the Fever's lineup in the Fever's 80-61 loss to the Golden State Valkyries. Clark was limited to 10 points, shooting 4 of 12 from the field and 2 of 5 from the 3-point line, in addition to six assists, five rebounds and four turnovers. Following the blowout loss, Clark said it was \"going to take me a second to get my wind back. ... Just trying to get my legs under me.\"\n- July 15: Clark suffered a right groin injury in the final minute of the Fever's 85-77 victory over the Sun at TD Garden in Boston. White later confirmed Clark \"felt a little something in her groin.\" This marked the last game for which Clark suited up.\n- July 18: Clark announced that she would sit out the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game in Indianapolis, where she was named a team captain. Clark was also set to participate in the 3-point contest. She said, \"I am incredibly sad and disappointed to say I can't participate ... I have to rest my body.\"\n- July 24: The Fever said Clark's medical evaluations confirmed there's \"no additional injuries or damage,\" but the team said it will be cautious with Clark's rehab and recovery.\n- August 8: During an appearance on Sue Bird's podcast, \"Bird's Eye View,\" Clark spoke about the frustrations of her injury-filled season: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a training camp to build up to play in my first game again. It\u2019s like no, you\u2019re tossed into Game 30 \u2014 like, \u2018Go try to play well.\u2019 It\u2019s hard, it really is.\u201d\n- August 10: Fever coach Stephanie White said Clark has progressed in her recovery and has started running full court again, but Clark hasn't returned to practice just yet: an important step in her ramp-up. \"She's been able to get a little bit more in her full-court running with all of her body weight... She's been able to do a little more on the court in terms of how she moves, but not into practice yet,\" White said.\nCaitlin Clark stats\nClark is averaging 16.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and a career-high 8.8 assists in 13 games this season. Her assists average is the second-highest in the league, behind Phoenix's Alyssa Thomas (9.0).\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news \u2014 fast.
