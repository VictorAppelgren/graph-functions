  "description": "Pixel 10 phones can now dish out weather advice tailored just for you, if you happen to live in the right place.",
  "content": "The Pixel 10 series features Magic Cue, a type of personal assistant that pulls information from other apps. Thanks to Magic Cue, the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL now have a new weather-related feature that makes weather reports even more personal, but sadly, not for everyone.\n\nThe three new Pixel flagships now support personal weather insights in the Pixel Weather app. These insights deliver tailored weather details and preparation tips based on events and plans saved in your Google account. For example, if you have a trip scheduled, the Pixel Weather app can show you forecasts and advice for the place you\u2019re visiting.\n\nTo get personal weather insights, you\u2019ll have to enable Magic Cue from your Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and or 10 Pro XL\u2019s settings. Once Magic Cue is enabled, you\u2019ll need to follow the steps below to receive personal weather insights:\n\u2022 On the current location page, tap back to view all saved locations.\n\u2022 Tap Save to add it to your saved locations.\n\u2022 Under \u201cAI Weather Report,\u201d you may now see new personal weather insights. Google notes that personal weather insights only appear for events happening within the next 10 days. Travel plans or events more than 10 days in the future will not show in the suggested locations yet.\n\nAnother limitation of the feature is that personal weather insights are currently only available to users in the US and Japan, and only in English. Google doesn\u2019t even mention the feature\u2019s availability for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, even though it technically supports Magic Cue.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold is here: Is this the Galaxy Z Fold 7 rival you've been waiting for?\nAugust 20, 2025\n- Google has launched the Pixel 10 Pro Fold starting at $1,799.\n- The phone is now available for pre-order, but will begin shipping in October.\n- It\u2019s the first foldable phone to feature an IP68 rating and Qi2 wireless charging. It also brings a stronger hinge, upgraded displays, a bigger battery, the new Tensor G5 chip, and a host of other upgrades.\n2025 is shaping up to be a big year for foldable phones. With the new Galaxy Z Fold, Samsung has managed to breathe fresh life into a category long held back by sky-high prices, bulkier designs, and limited mainstream appeal. For once, consumer interest in foldables is peaking. Now, it\u2019s Google\u2019s turn to make its mark. Enter the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, a strong contender primed to take on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 as a compelling alternative, and a powerful foldable phone in its own right.\nThis year, Google may not have the thinnest foldable phone in the world, but we all know that Pixels are some of the best Android phones you can buy, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a host of promising upgrades over the Pixel 9 Pro Fold that make it an exciting new entry into the foldable segment. Let\u2019s break down what we\u2019ve got.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: Pricing and availability\n- Pixel 10 Pro Fold (256GB): $1,799 / \u00a31,749 / \u20ac1,899/ Rs 1,72,999\n- Pixel 10 Pro Fold (512GB): $1,919 / \u00a31,869 / \u20ac2,029\n- Pixel 10 Pro Fold (1TB): $2,149 / \u00a32,099 / \u20ac2,289\nWhile the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has been officially announced and is now available for pre-order, it won\u2019t ship until much later \u2014 on October 9, to be specific. According to Google, the delayed release is intended to ensure that all promised hardware and software features are fully ready at launch.\nPricing of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 for the base model, which includes 256GB storage and 16GB RAM, matching the cost of last year\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Google is also offering 512GB and 1TB storage configurations if you can shell out more cash.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold will come in two new colorways: the sleek new Moonstone and a fresh Jade option, departing from the more conventional Porcelain and Obsidian shades of its predecessor. While the new hues bring a welcome refresh to the new foldable, some users may miss the traditional tones.\nWhat\u2019s great is that if you buy a Pixel 10 Pro Fold, like any other Pro Pixel 10, you get a one-year Google AI Pro subscription for free. This gives you access to some of Google\u2019s most advanced AI tools, such as Gemini, Imagen 4, Veo 3, Flow, Whisk, and more. You also get 2TB of total storage for Photos, Drive, and Gmail. Google will charge $19.99/month for the service after the free subscription ends.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold specs\nWe\u2019ll dive deeper into the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a bit, but for those of you who want a quick glance at all the key hardware and software details, here\u2019s the phone\u2019s full spec sheet.\n| Pixel 10 Pro Fold | Specs |\n|---|---|\nDisplay | Inner: 8-inch OLED Super Actua Flex display (LTPO) 2,076 x 2,152 Up to 1800 nits (HDR) and up to 3000 nits (peak brightness) Outer: 6.4-inch OLED Actua display 1,080 x 2,364 Up to 2,000 nits (HDR) and up to 3000 nits (peak brightness) |\nProcessor | Google Tensor G5 Titan M2 security coprocessor |\nRAM | 16GB |\nStorage | 256GB 512GB 1TB UFS 4.0 |\nBattery & Charging | -5015mAh -Fast charging: up to 50% in about 30 minutes using 30W USB-C PPS charger (sold separately) -Qi2 built-in for wireless charging up to 15W |\nCameras (Rear) | -48MP Wide (Quad PD, \u0192/1.70 aperture, 82\u00b0 field of view, 1/2\" image sensor size) -10.5 MP ultrawide (Dual PD, Autofocus, \u0192/2.2 aperture, 127\u00b0 field of view, 1/3.4\" image sensor size) -10.8 MP telephoto lens (Dual PD, \u0192/3.1 aperture, 23\u00b0 field of view, 1/3.2\" image sensor size, 5x optical zoom, Super Res Zoom up to 20x) |\nCameras (Front/Inner) | -Front Camera: 10 MP Dual PD, \u0192/2.2 aperture, 87\u00b0 field of view -Inner Camera: 10 MP Dual PD, \u0192/2.2 aperture, 87\u00b0 field of view |\nDimensions | Folded: 155.2mm tall, 76.3mm wide, and 10.8mm thick Unfolded:155.2mm height x 150.4mm width x 5.2mm depth |\nWeight | 258 g (9.1 oz) |\nDurability | -IP68 dust and water resistance -Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 |\nOS | Android 16 7 years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates |\nAuthentication | Fingerprint Unlock (side-mounted), Face Unlock, Pattern, PIN, password |\nConnectivity | -Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) with 2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz, 2x2 MIMO -Bluetooth v6 -UWB -NFC -Google Cast -US: Dual Band GNSS GPS, GLONASS, Galileo -ROW: Dual Band GNSS GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, BeiDou, NavIC |\nSIMs | Single Nano SIM and eSIM |\nSafety | -Satellite SOS -Emergency SOS -Crisis Alerts -Car Crash Detection -Safety Check -Emergency Location Service -Emergency Contacts & Medical Info -Android Earthquake -Alerts System -Theft Protection |\nColors | Moonstone, Jade |\nWarranty | 1 year (US, CA, TW, IN, JP, SG) 2 years (GB, IE, DE, FR, IT, ES, NO, DK, SE, NL, BE, AT, CH, PT, PL, CZ, RO, HU, SI, LT, LV, EE, SK, FI, AU) |\nDesign and durability\nA big highlight of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is its IP68 rating, a feat that no foldable phone has achieved so far. This means that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold\u2019s water and dust resistance is at the highest level, comparable to most flagship phones on the market, including the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. It also means that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is completely dust-protected out of the box and can withstand immersion in water for up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. For a phone that has a hinge and a folding display, this surely sets a new durability benchmark.\nGoogle says the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is its most advanced foldable phone yet.\nIts industry-leading water and dust protection aside, Google says the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is its most advanced foldable phone yet. It features an all-new gearless hinge crafted from aerospace-grade aluminum, which allows for a larger outer display with slimmer bezels.\nAccording to the company, the hinge is twice as durable as the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The inner display of the phone has also been re-engineered with Ultra-Thin Glass and a dual-layer anti-impact film to better protect it against drops. Google says that together, the improvements to the display and the redesigned hinge ensure that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold can survive over 10 years of folding, taking into account 50 folds a day.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold can survive over 10 years of folding.\nThe phone\u2019s front screen and back cover are covered in Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for added durability.\nUnlike many other foldables launching in 2025, Google clearly wasn\u2019t chasing a super-thin design with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The phone measures 155.2mm tall, 76.3mm wide, and 10.8mm thick when folded, making it just slightly narrower than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and almost as thick. However, it weighs 258g, up from 257g on its predecessor and noticeably more than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 at 215g. So while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold\u2019s dimensions are nearly identical to last year\u2019s model, it\u2019s now slightly heavier. That might sound like a drawback, but there\u2019s a good reason for the added weight, which we\u2019ll get to in just a bit.\nDisplays\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold features an 8-inch LTPO Super Actua Flex inner display with a resolution of 2,076 x 2,152. Google claims it can now reach a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, which makes it more vibrant than the inner screen on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, at least on paper. The company has also made several usability improvements to enhance the inner display experience.\nFor example, you can now resize apps beyond screen boundaries in Split Screen mode, giving you more control over how multiple apps are arranged. You can also easily drag and drop files between apps, making the multitasking experience more intuitive. A new feature called Instant View allows you to see recently captured photos right next to the viewfinder when using the inner display, a useful tool for quickly reviewing previous shots before you take new ones.\nGoogle has made several usability improvements to enhance the inner display experience.\nWe\u2019ve already covered the durability upgrades to this inner screen, so let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s on the outside: a 6.4-inch OLED panel with a 20:9 aspect ratio and the same impressive 3,000 nits peak brightness. That\u2019s an upgrade in both size and brightness compared to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Plus, the more traditional smartphone form factor when folded makes using the Pixel 10 Pro a familiar and comfortable experience for those who don\u2019t like to unfold their device constantly.\nCameras\nPhotography is the mainstay of all Pixel phones, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold gets its digs from a triple camera setup consisting of a new 48MP wide-angle lens, a 10.8MP telephoto shooter capable of 5x optical and up to 20x Super Res Zoom, and a 10.5MP ultrawide lens with macro focus. It\u2019s essentially the same primary camera setup as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but since the device is powered by the Tensor G5 processor (more on that later), it gets an upgraded Image Signal Processor (ISP) for improved image and video quality.\nThe new ISP better understands details like skin tones and eye colors, runs machine learning in real time to reduce blur in low-light videos, and even records 10-bit HDR by default for 1080p and 4K 30fps clips, all of which should contribute to noticeably improved photos and videos.\nThere are two selfie cameras at play here, including a 10MP shooter on the outer display and another 10MP sensor on the inner screen. Users can also take advantage of the better rear camera setup for selfies using the Rear Camera Selfie feature, which essentially kicks up when you\u2019re using the outer display as a viewfinder while the phone is in table-top mode.\nOf course, you get loads of AI photography features because it\u2019s a Pixel. Google is introducing a new Camera Coach this year, which uses Gemini to help guide you about things like framing and composition. It can also suggest different scenes and provide step-by-step directions for taking the best pictures.\nThen there\u2019s the new Auto Best Take feature, which activates when the AI detects you\u2019re clicking a group photo. It then analyzes up to 150 photos to find and blend images, giving you that perfect picture where everyone is looking their best.\nLastly, you\u2019re getting a cool new AI editing tool called Ask Photos, which essentially lets you ask Gemini to make the edits you want to see. You can even ask for multiple edits, like fixing the lighting and removing an object, in a single prompt written in natural language.\nThe Pixel 10 phones are the first to support C2PA Content Credentials, a system that adds cryptographically signed metadata to images. This metadata includes details about the image\u2019s origin and any edits made to it. This information will be visible in Google Photos for all images, whether untouched or edited with AI, helping users easily verify their authenticity.\nPerformance and battery life\nWith the camera features covered, let\u2019s move on to the real heart of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold \u2014 the Tensor G5 and the batteries that power all these upgrades.\nWe won\u2019t go into extreme detail here. We have a separate Tensor G5 deep dive for that purpose. However, we\u2019ll tell you what Google is promising on paper.\nGoogle says the Tensor G5 represents the most significant leap for its in-house chip in 5 years.\nAccording to the company, the Tensor G5 represents the most significant leap for its in-house chip in five years. Built on TSMC\u2019s 3nm process, it boasts a 60% more powerful Tensor Processing Unit for advanced AI capabilities, along with a 34% boost in CPU performance. As mentioned earlier, the image sensor has also been upgraded, which should translate to noticeably better photos and videos.\nOf course, these are just claims for now, and we\u2019ll be putting them to the test when we review the Pixel 10 lineup. Historically, Tensor chips haven\u2019t been strong on raw benchmark performance, but have excelled at enabling software-driven experiences. Still, we\u2019re eager to see how the G5 stacks up against flagship processors from Qualcomm and Apple.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold: Hot or Not?\nOne burning question remains, though. Has thermal performance improved over the Tensor G4? Google says it has, but given how last year\u2019s chip ran a bit warm for our liking, the Tensor G5\u2019s performance in that area will be right at the top of our checklist during testing.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first foldable phone in the world to feature Qi2 wireless charging.\nMeanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is getting a big battery boost with a 5,015mAh cell. That\u2019s one of the main reasons why the phone isn\u2019t as thin and light as its competitors, and honestly, we\u2019re okay with that. Google says the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should deliver over 30 hours of battery life in typical usage, which can be extended to 84 hours in Extreme Battery Saver mode.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more. Find out more here.\nThe device supports fast wired charging, reaching 50% capacity in around 30 minutes when paired with a 30W or higher USB-C PPS charger (sold separately). It\u2019s also the first foldable phone in the world to feature Qi2 wireless charging, delivering speeds of up to 15W. Additionally, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is compatible with all of Google\u2019s new Pixel Snap accessories.\nSoftware and updates\nAs for software updates, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is promised to receive seven years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates, the same as the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup and last year\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Since the phone is launching with Android 16 out of the box, you can expect to receive updates right up to Android 23!\nGoogle is also introducing a few cool AI tricks in the new Pixels, including the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. You get access to Magic Cue, which is essentially a proactive assistant that surfaces contextual suggestions when you need them, like pulling up an address mentioned in a chat, suggesting a quick reply from Gmail, or settling a dinner tab. It highlights its tips with a rainbow marker so you know it\u2019s Magic Cue, and Google says it\u2019ll get even smarter in the future.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold will get seven years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates.\nThe new Pixel also brings the Pixel Journal, a private on-device app for recording your thoughts securely. It uses Gemini Nano to generate helpful prompts that can guide reflection, track personal progress, or spark new ideas, all without your data ever leaving your phone. Everything is stored locally, with PIN protection available for extra security.\nThere\u2019s also Take a Message, a handy feature for times when you miss or decline a call. Instead of lumping everything into one section, it separates your missed and declined calls from spam calls and provides real-time transcripts of incoming messages. It also uses AI to suggest logical next steps once a message is recorded, making call management more intuitive on Google\u2019s new flagships.\nAnd finally, we have Voice Translate \u2014 one of the most impressive features that can not only translate what a speaker is saying during a phone call in real time, but it can do it in their own voice!\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nMagic Cue on Pixel 10: What is it and how will it make your life simpler?\nAugust 20, 2025\n- With the Pixel 10 series, Google has revealed a new AI feature called \u201cMagic Cue.\u201d\n- Magic Cue watches your screen and offers suggestions by pulling relevant information from multiple apps.\n- It currently supports a host of Google apps, with support for third-party apps promised to arrive soon.\nDespite nearly a decade of selling its Pixel phones (and several years with the Nexus devices before that), Google still strongly relies on unique software experiences to make its phones more compelling. Although all supported Pixel devices have received the Android 16 update, Google is launching special features that give Pixel 10 phones an edge over the rest. One of them is the new Magic Cue functionality, which can be Google\u2019s first step towards agentic usage on a phone \u2014 something that Apple also appears to be attempting with an upcoming version of Siri.\nWhile Magic Cue does not, at the moment, control your phone entirely, it is aimed at offering highly personalized suggestions for actions by \u201cconnecting the dots of your digital life.\u201d These suggestions are powered by Google\u2019s Gemini models, and likely process all information on-device to keep your personal data safe. While we\u2019re still missing some details from Google, here is what we know about Magic Cue and how it aims to make your life easier.\nWhat is Magic Cue?\nMagic Cue is like a supercharged version of Android\u2019s app actions, except these suggestions are much more refined and take cues from other apps to reduce the manual labor. In essence, the feature analyzes the contents on your screen and pulls up information from other apps to offer predictive suggestions.\nGoogle illustrates a few scenarios where Magic Cue could prove to be useful. For instance, when you\u2019re calling a particular business, it would scour through your messages, emails, or calendar appointments and pull up details such as the address, order ID, time of appointment, etc., and display this information right within the dialer using a floating overlay window.\nAnother example Google shares is when you\u2019re chatting with a friend on Google Messages, and they enquire about a restaurant recommendation, Magic Cue could pull up suggestions from other apps like your Google Search or Maps search history, and show them as a suggested reply. All you would have to do is tap the floating suggestion to share it with the other person.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nGoogle has previously demonstrated similar functionality with the Pixel Screenshots app on the Pixel 9. That app uses AI to analyze the contents of your screenshots, and allows you not just to search them with vague terms, but also lets you create collections, add events to calendars, or even summarize the contents from those screenshots.\nWith Magic Cue, Google is expanding the ambit beyond just images and limiting manual actions. Magic Cue will access information from multiple sources to render useful information.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what sources Magic Cue will seek information from, let\u2019s take a look below.\nWhich apps are supported in Magic Cue?\nFrom its current set of demos \u2014 and based on previous Magic Cue leaks, we understand that Magic Cue will work with a host of Google apps. From the launch of the Pixel 10 series, you can expect the feature to work with apps such as Calendar, Chrome, Docs, Files, Gmail, Messages, Photos, and YouTube.\nAt the same time, Google also promises that select third-party apps will be supported by the feature. Google told us that select regional apps like Line will work with Magic Cue. We\u2019re unsure of the full roster, but we will be sure to bring you an updated list once we have the details.\nGoogle paints a lucid picture of the different ways Magic Cue can help Pixel 10 users, but we hope it doesn\u2019t turn out to be as disappointing as Samsung\u2019s Now Brief, which is also marketed to source information from multiple sources and display them in a single dashboard.\nMagic Cue is expected to offer better, i.e., more frequent and more accurate, results as you continue using your phone. However, Google warns that some of the information produced by Magic Cue may be inaccurate, so we will wait to see the feature in action before commenting on its efficacy. At the same time, if you\u2019re not pleased with the results, Google will give you the option to opt out.\nDo you think Magic Cue will live up to the expectations set by Google? Let us know in the comments below!\n6.3-inch display\nLoaded with Google AI features\nSatellite SOS\nPowerful AI tools\nBright display\nIP68 rating\n6.4-inch outer and 8-inch inner displays\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nPixel Weather is my favorite weather app; there's just one problem with it\nApril 10, 2025\nI have a confession to make: I\u2019m a sucker for weather apps. I like major apps like AccuWeather and The Weather Channel, as well as smaller third-party ones like Hello Weather and Today Weather. Part of it\u2019s due to living in Michigan and having so many different conditions to deal with throughout the year, and another part is because I\u2019m just a nerd for trying new Android apps.\nGiven all this, you can imagine my excitement when Google launched its new Pixel Weather app alongside the Pixel 9 series last year. We\u2019ve seen phone brands like Samsung, OnePlus, and others create weather apps specific to their devices, but they\u2019re often never very good \u2014 and usually less of a full \u201capp\u201d and more just a basic weather UI that sends you to The Weather Channel\u2019s website if you want to see any real data.\nPixel Weather, meanwhile, isn\u2019t that at all. It\u2019s a feature-rich, highly customizable, and incredibly well-designed weather app that\u2019s quickly become one of my all-time favorites. There\u2019s just one problem with it. I can only use Pixel Weather on Pixel phones, and it\u2019s time that changes.\nDo you think Pixel Weather should be available for all Android phones?\nPixel Weather is everything a weather app should be\nWhat is it about Pixel Weather that makes it so good? For me, it\u2019s a combination of a few things, starting with the sheer amount of available data. Basic information, such as an hourly forecast, a 10-day forecast, and upcoming precipitation, are here. But, like any good weather app, there\u2019s a boatload of other info, too \u2014 including the sunrise/sunset times, humidity, visibility, air quality, UV index, and more.\nI especially like how in-depth Pixel Weather lets you dig into these things. The sunrise/sunset menu, for example, breaks down specific times for dawn, sunrise, sunset, and dusk \u2014 paired with a live illustration of the sun\u2019s current position. Dig into the wind page, and there\u2019s a helpful graph showing how fast wind speeds are for the coming hours, plus which direction they\u2019re blowing in. As someone who likes looking at the nitty gritty data like this \u2014 particularly during spring storm season right now \u2014 it\u2019s a treasure trove of info.\nComparatively, for those times when I don\u2019t want to parse through mountains of data, I quite like the AI Weather Report and Weather Insight features, both of which summarize key weather details at a glance. I think the AI branding is silly, but having a brief, written summary of the weather ahead is a nice, helpful touch.\nBeyond the data, Google just nailed the overall UI and design for Pixel Weather. Between the big and bold temperature at the top of the app, the whimsical shapes/colors for the various weather info, and the themed weather animations in the background, all of it gives the app a fun, lighthearted feel. Pixel Weather is also the only weather app I\u2019ve used that vibrates my phone to mimic rain, snow, and thunderstorms, and it feels like magic whenever it happens. The included home screen widgets are excellent, too.\nFinally, just as you\u2019d expect from an app designed with Android users in mind, Pixel Weather has fantastic customization. You can customize and reorder the position of almost all the tiles/widgets in the app. If the 10-day forecast is important to you, you can put that near the very top of the app. If you don\u2019t particularly care about the weather map, you can move it to the bottom. This lets you arrange Pixel Weather to look and feel exactly how you want it, and as a customization nut, I love it.\nOf all the weather apps I've tried over the years, Pixel Weather stands out as one of my favorites.\nOf all the weather apps I\u2019ve tried over the years, Pixel Weather stands out as one of my favorites. It\u2019s loaded with data, pleasing to look at, fully customizable, and isn\u2019t hampered by ads or extra fluff like news articles or videos. It checks all the boxes for what I want in a weather app.\nThe only problem, as mentioned above, is that it\u2019s currently exclusive to the last few generations of Pixel phones. Unique software features are what make Pixel phones so compelling in the first place, but in the case of Pixel Weather, Google can (and should) turn it into the face of weather for all Android phones.\nThe default weather app Android deserves\nAs it currently stands, Android doesn\u2019t have a de facto weather app for all devices. Samsung phones have Samsung Weather, while OnePlus phones have OnePlus Weather, but neither is particularly good. The closest thing we have is the weather UI that\u2019s part of the Google app, and while it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s just a parred-down version of Pixel Weather \u2014 featuring similar design elements but less granular data and missing customization options.\nSimilar to how Google has its Phone, Messages, and Clock apps available on the Play Store for everyone, Google should really do the same with Pixel Weather. It doesn\u2019t need to be installed on every Android phone by default, but it should be available in the Play Store as an option to download for anyone who wants it. Just like your texting or alarm app, checking the weather is one of the most basic functions of your phone. All Android users \u2014 not just Pixel owners \u2014 deserve a high-quality, go-to weather app.\nIf/when this happens, I\u2019m all for Google keeping some features exclusive to Pixel phones. AI Summaries can stay limited to modern Pixels (and likely need to for technical reasons), plus more advanced features like the pollen count card and weather vibrations could remain only on Pixels, too. Google designed Pixel Weather with Pixel phones in mind, so it only makes sense that some of its more advanced features should stay with its own phones.\nBut beyond that, there\u2019s no reason the core Pixel Weather app shouldn\u2019t be available to all other Android phones. If you\u2019re OK fiddling with APKs and sideloading, you can easily get Pixel Weather on non-Pixels already; Google just hasn\u2019t taken that extra step of putting it on the Play Store for the masses.\nA proper, Google-made weather app is something Android\u2019s been missing for ages, and now that Google has a good solution (and one that\u2019s getting some much-needed missing features), it\u2019s the perfect time to open up Pixel Weather to more people. With a slight name change to Google Weather \u2014 and adding the weather frog to it \u2014 everything is there for the default Android weather app we need.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nPixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL debut as Google's most ambitious lineup yet\nAugust 20, 2025\nYear after year, Google has given us good reason to consider its latest Pixel lineup among the best Android phones you can buy. And while the company pushes both its hardware and software to new limits with each subsequent generation, this year, the Pixel 10 series has got to represent one of the biggest, boldest steps forward for the phones yet.\nOnce again, we\u2019ve got four new additions to the Pixel family to check out, with the launch of the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. We\u2019re giving the new foldable some special attention of its own, but right now, let\u2019s break down exactly what you can expect from the three new traditional models forming this year\u2019s Pixel lineup.\n6.3-inch display\nLoaded with Google AI features\nSatellite SOS\nPowerful AI tools\nBright display\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL: Release date, price, and availability\n- Google Pixel 10 (128GB): $799 / \u00a3799\n- Google Pixel 10 (256GB): $899 / \u00a3899\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (128GB): $999 / \u00a3999\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (256GB): $1,099 / \u00a3,1,099\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (512GB): $1,219 / \u00a31,219\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (1TB): $1,449 / \u00a31,449\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (256GB): $1,199 / \u00a31,199\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (512GB): $1,319 / \u00a31,319\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (1TB): $1,549 / \u00a31,549\nWe\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting the Pixel 10 series for ages now, and back in July, Google finally set the date for this season\u2019s Made By Google event. Today, with August 20 finally rolling around, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s chance to officially check out the new family, with Google showing them all off at its Brooklyn launch extravaganza.\nWhile this year introduces some important changes for the hardware that make up Google\u2019s Pixel phones, pricing is blessedly remaining consistent with last year\u2019s Pixel 9 devices, starting at just under $800 for the 128GB base model \u2014 and moving up from there.\nPre-orders for the new handsets open up today, so if you like what you see here, you don\u2019t have to waste any time getting the ball rolling on making a Pixel 10 model your next daily driver. For all three of these non-folding Pixels, regular retail availability kicks off next week, on August 28.\nGoogle is once again making its latest Pixel phones available to global audiences, kicking sales of the Pixel 10 series off in all the usual markets, with the addition of Mexico this time around.

But even with that approach to design remaining consistent, the manufacturer hasn\u2019t been afraid to deliver some impactful changes to the hardware you\u2019ll find within.\nWe\u2019ll be covering some of those more important differences in a little more depth, but here\u2019s your bird\u2019s-eye view at how all this hardware compares across the lineup:\n| Pixel 10 | Pixel 10 Pro | Pixel 10

new phone is imaging performance, raw speed, or excellent power management, you should be able to find something about these Pixel 10 phones to make them worthy of consideration. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the highlights.\nCamera\nSome phones really go all-in on camera hardware, and it\u2019s no surprise to see these models with beefy sensors and crazy periscopic zoom options on our list of best camera phones. But even without really jaw-dropping hardware, we also see Google\u2019s Pixel phones join those right up at the top, year after year, thanks in no small part to Google\u2019s exceptional image-processing prowess.\nMaybe the biggest news this year is the arrival of a telephoto option for the base Pixel 10, getting a 10.8MP camera with a 5x optical zoom. Google tries to sell that for a little more than it is, highlighting \u201cup to 10x optical quality\u201d and capable of even tighter zooms with Super Res processing, but we\u2019d be happy either way.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more. Find out more here.\nWith the Pro models, Google doubles down on that sentiment. Here it pairs a 48MP sensor with that 5x optical zoom, and the company claims this offers the highest-quality zoom you\u2019ll get of any smartphone being sold to US shoppers. Similarly, it\u2019s pushing processing to new heights, with these two boasting Pro Res Zoom up to 100x. That\u2019s optimized for the new Tensor G5 processor, and operates using an advanced diffusion model.\nIn addition to the fancy new zoom capabilities, you can expect some solid improvements to optical stabilization quality and auto-focus speed.\nPerformance\nOK, now we\u2019re getting into it. When your smartphone-obsessed friend advised you to hold off buying that Pixel 9 and wait for the Pixel 10 series, this is likely what they looking forward to: the Tensor G5 chip.\nGoogle\u2019s been building Pixel phones around its custom-designed Tensor processors for years now, but with this generation the company moves from Samsung to TSMC as its manufacturing partner \u2014 and as a consequence, jumps from the 4nm process it employed across the past two chips down to 3nm for the G5.\nGoogle's got more to prove than ever this year, with all eyes on the Tensor G5 and its performance.\nUnsurprisingly, this chip is heavily focused on AI capabilities. It can run on-device models with the help of an upgraded TPU, which Google says is 60% more powerful than before. That new production node doesn\u2019t just help the Tensor G5 run on average 34% faster but also aids in keeping power consumption down. And in case you haven\u2019t picked up on it from those incredible camera tricks we were just touching on, this chip\u2019s got an upgraded image processor on board.\nUnlike last year, we\u2019re not getting any big shake-ups when it comes to memory configuration. Google is sticking with the same 12GB for the base Pixel 10 and 16GB on the Pro and Pro XL. We\u2019d love seeing 16GB across the board, but the lack of motion here isn\u2019t exactly surprising.\nYour storage choices also remain largely consistent with the new Pixel 10 generation, still starting down at 128GB, but this time Google drops the 128GB option for the Pixel 10 Pro XL, starting at 256GB, instead \u2014 honestly, a trend we wouldn\u2019t hate to see trickle down to the rest of the phones.\nScreen quality and size\nGoogle\u2019s also sticking with what works when it comes to screen size and resolution, returning with the same 6.3-inch sizes on the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, and a 6.8-inch panel on the Pro XL. On the smallest Pixel 10, that spells a pixel density of around 420ppi, while you\u2019ll enjoy a slightly sharper image closer to 490ppi on the Pro models. All three support Smooth Display output at up to 120Hz, but only the Pro models can also dial that down as low as 1Hz for power saving.\nPeak brightness should be about 10% higher this time around, from what Google calls \u201cbest in class\u201d Actua displays \u2014 and better yet, the company claims we\u2019ll get those brighter screens without feeling the impact on battery life. Just like we had with the Pixel 9 series, Google is tapping Corning for some Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection.\nDesign, colors, and build quality\nWhile last year brought us a major new look, with that new pill-shaped camera island on the back, the Pixel 10 is very much a smartphone cast in the physical mold of its predecessor. And comparing the sizes of these three phones against their Pixel 9 equivalents, the differences are absolutely minuscule: Really, the only distinction you\u2019ll measure is the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro each coming in a tenth of a millimeter thicker than last year.\nThere is, admittedly, a little heft being added this time around, but it\u2019s on a scale that might be too minor to notice outside of holding one phone in each hand \u2014 maxing out at an 11g difference with the Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nJust like on the front, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protects the hardware around back, with a sturdy aluminum frame making up the middle of our smartphone sandwich. And as we\u2019d only expect, all three carry an IP68 ingress rating, so they\u2019ll have no trouble surviving a brief dunk.\nWhat's your favorite Pixel 10 series color?\nThe question of best Pixel colors is a contentious one, granted, and this year you\u2019ve got your choice of four no matter which Pixel you go with. In addition to the expected assortment of neutral tones, we get a few fun options, like Indigo and Lemongrass on the smallest Pixel 10 and Jade available for the Pro and Pro XL.\nDepending on where you get your Pixel 10, you may notice a low-key omission from the phone\u2019s expected design. For Pixel 10 series phones sold in the US, this year, Google is taking the unprecedented step of going eSIM-only: The phones will lack a traditional tray for a physical SIM card. While some users might not blink twice at that, those who rely upon the flexibility of physical SIMs (especially when traveling) could run into trouble \u2014 so be advised.\nBattery life and charging speed\nHere\u2019s one area in particular where we\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic this year \u2014 even if that\u2019s one word that\u2019s just positively fraught to throw around when we\u2019re talking all things battery. Instead of making one big change, Google has implemented several, and with any luck, they\u2019ll all add up to make the Pixel 10 series some real endurance champions.\nGoogle started by lowering power demands from phone components, with parts like the 3nm Tensor G5 chip and the updated Actua displays promising to merely sip away at battery capacity. On its own, that might not deliver in the way users hope, but Google pairs that with higher-capacity batteries across the board.\nNow, those gains themselves are a little minor: 270mAh higher on the Pixel 10, 170mAh higher with the 10 Pro, and up 140mAh on the Pro XL. But they are absolutely progressing in the right direction, and we will take all the extra juice phone manufacturers are willing to offer. Maybe most interesting, though, is that this year the little Pixel 10 actually manages to push past the Pro in terms of raw capacity \u2014 even though the phones are the same size, we guess not having a few of those Pro upgrades left room within for some extra battery.\nThat\u2019s consumption and capacity for you, but maybe Google\u2019s biggest win with power on the Pixel 10 series will come from how you recharge them.\nWith this generation, Google is finally giving users a full-featured wireless charging experience, and that means Qi2 support, complete with built-in magnets for secure attachment \u2014 no case required. The company is taking full advantage of this by introducing new Pixelsnap branding for accessories designed to tap into it \u2014 including a long-overdue successor to the Pixel Stand. You\u2019ll enjoy 15W wireless speeds on the Pixel 10 and Pro, while the Pro XL supports even speedier Qi2.2 25W charging.\nWired charging also gets a boost across the lineup, going from 27W to 30W for the Pixel 10 and Pro, while climbing from 37W to 45W on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Google says that users should expect over 30 hours of battery life, and between all these upgrades, that sounds like it just might be within the realm of possibility.\nSoftware and updates\nUnlike last year, when the Pixel 9 phones arrived still running Android 14, Google has sorted out its development cycle, and Android 16 has arrived well in time to show up at home on the Pixel 10 phones. And with seven years of updates in the pipeline, you\u2019ll be running new Android releases well into the next decade.\nJust like everything Google touches these days, the Pixel 10 series is chock full of Gemini AI-powered features \u2014 including a full year of free access to Google AI Pro with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL. Gemini Live is picking up some cool-sounding new tricks, like highlighting stuff in your camera to show you, and the Phone app is adding an impressive real-time translation tool.\nWe finally get to meet what would have been Pixel Sense with the introduction of Magic Cue, an AI-powered assistant with awareness of what you\u2019re working on with your phone, and the ability to offer suggested actions you may want to take next. In case that sounds like a step too far, Google\u2019s privacy controls will let you decide just how much of your data you want AI having access to.\nYou\u2019d have to be living in a cave not to understand how popular journaling is these days. Rather than forcing you to jot your thoughts down in something like Keep, Google\u2019s now offering a dedicated solution in the form of the new Pixel Journal app \u2014 complete with PIN protection to keep your private thoughts private.\nThere\u2019s tons more, too, from Call Message offering a hand dealing with your missed calls to Pixel Studio upgrades, new NotebookLM integration with Pixel Recorder and Screenshots, and Camera Coach helping you get your best shots yet. It\u2019s the new Pixel, after all! This is Google\u2019s biggest chance to show off all year! If you don\u2019t want to miss out on that experience, make sure to get your pre-order in now.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
