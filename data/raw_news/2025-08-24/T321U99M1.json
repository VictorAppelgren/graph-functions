  "description": "No promotional obstacle courses to run, just pure, unadulterated deal.",
  "content": "A couple of months after launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 hasn't proven an elusive buy like the PS5 and Xbox Series X did at launch. You can walk into pretty much any electronics retailer and buy one. It even fairly regularly receives discounts, especially on Amazon and eBay. It's the latter who's come through with the goods this week, with The Gamesmen's eBay shop doling out Nintendo Switch 2 consoles for AU$629.95\u2014AU$70 cheaper than RRP.\n\nOh sure, I can hear you say, I bet I'll have to sign up for a subscription trial, and also stack some other cash back deal with a subs discount, and then possibly perform some kind of blood ritual, to get that price. But actually, no: there's no trick to this one. Use the coupon code RISE10 at checkout and it'll just work. Shipping is free, too.\n\nThis coupon code offers 10% off the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle too, bringing it down from AU$769.95 to AU$692.95 for a AU$77 discount. I'd honestly go for that bundle if I was in the market for a Nintendo Switch 2, unless you really don't like Mario Kart. It's marginally cheaper than the standalone console, and you get the game effectively free.\n\nIs the Nintendo Switch 2 worth it as of August 2025? If you've never owned a Switch, absolutely: you can access all (or the vast majority) of Nintendo Switch games via backwards compatibility, plus rest assured that any forthcoming games will be accessible to you.\n\nBut if you already own a vanilla Switch, the question is a little more complex. You really have to want to play Mario Kart World or Donkey Kong Bananza at this point, or else you want to enjoy the performance improvements in older games like Breath of the Wild. I've made a list of all the Nintendo Switch 2 games that aren't on the original Switch here, if you want to check it out.\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza is a pretty damn good reason to get a Switch 2, though: Dustin Bailey scored it highly last month, writing that it \"shows Nintendo at its absolute best\".",

      "text": "Nintendo Switch 2 games in Australia - the best prices on all the biggest games\nDon't pay more than you have to for Switch games.\nTake a deep breath and enjoy the hype: Nintendo Switch 2 is finally out, and the excitement of a new console generation is a rarity worth savouring. The new console launched on June 5, with an unusually large selection of first and third-party launch games available in physical format.\nWhich is great. What is less great, is that the RRP on these is a big jump from what we saw with the original Nintendo Switch. First-party games like Mario Kart World can cost as much as AU$119.95, which is much higher than the usual AU$89.95 we've come to expect from Nintendo.\nNot all retailers are asking that much: the likes of Amazon and JB Hi-Fi are carving small chunks off that astronomical RRP. Likewise with games like Donkey Kong Bonanza, which wears an RRP of AU$109.95, but which Amazon, for example, is offering for AU$99 at the moment. Launch week saw some first-party games, like Mario Kart World, sell for as little as AU$94, but a week later, and now that the storm has settled, most retailers are charging between the RRP and AU$105.\nBelow is a list of the biggest Nintendo Switch 2 launch games in Australia, and the best price on each at the time of writing. I'll keep this updated over the coming days and weeks.\nCheapest Nintendo Switch 2 games in Australia\nTarget offered the best launch discount for this brilliant 3D platformer with an early AU$89 offering, but now that the dust has cleared Amazon's price is trending better, albeit by a single dollar.\nStill, if you've a Big W or JB Hi-Fi nearby and you want to pick it up today, that extra buck isn't going to make up for the convenience.\nA range of retailers, including Amazon and Target, were offering first-party Nintendo Switch 2 games for AU$94 (down from AU$119.95) during launch week, but prices have gone back up now. Still, Amazon's AU$104 is pretty good, with free shipping.\nOf course, buying the Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for AU$766 is the most economical approach: the standalone console is AU$699, so you're getting the game for only AU$67. If you don't already have the console pre-ordered, definitely do that.\nA little over AU$10 off this modern classic (which, I feel inclined to add, has now released across three Nintendo generations). Amazon and Target are the best place to buy this online due to the free shipping element, but bricks 'n' mortar stores like Big W are also offering this for a discount so if you prefer, go grab it there on launch day.\nYes, Tears of the Kingdom is getting the \"Nintendo Switch 2 Edition\" treatment too. At the moment, Amazon is offering the best price on this new edition, and thankfully, online orders are eligible for free shipping.\nWhile billed as a remaster, this reissue of a deep cut PS2 Atlus JRPG is actually more of a remake: its combat system has been entirely rehauled, all dialogue has been voiced, and pesky random encounters are gone. If you loved Shin Megami Tensei V, or the Persona games, this is well worth investigation.\nAmazon is currently offering the best price on this sprawling RPG, when you take free shipping into account. The big question is: is the Nintendo Switch 2 the only console you own? If you happen to have a decent PC or a PS5 at home, you're probably better off playing Cyberpunk on those; you'll get it much cheaper than this on those platforms too.\nHazelight's two-player odyssey skipped the original Nintendo Switch, but it's arriving on launch day for the newer console. Note that Big W is offering this for AU$59 in-store, but Amazon is the cheapest way to get it with shipping online. Note that this game has no cart: it's a download code only.\nStreet Fighter 6 was already brilliant when it released for other platforms a couple of years ago, but it's even better in 2025, making this a must-have launch title. It's also a bit of a steal at AU$69, when compared to other Nintendo Switch 2 games. If you're after a fighter on your new console, it's the best you'll find.\nWidely considered the best Yakuza game to start with (and by some, the best overall), this is among the neatest surprises among the Switch 2's launch day catalogue.\nAmazon was flogging this for AU$49 last week, but since they've sold out, JB is the next best option. This sprawling tactical RPG originally released for the Nintendo 3DS, but this Switch 2 version adds hi-def graphics, a reworked UI (the original relied heavily on the 3DS's dual-screen) and a bunch of other QOL improvements. The RRP on this is great value considering how big it is, so the meagre discount doesn't hurt that much.\nThe Hitman series is brilliant, and this Nintendo Switch 2 offering is very generous: it contains campaigns from the modern Hitman trilogy, as well as a suite of bonuses including Contracts mode, Escalation, and more. Easily the best immersive sim / stealth game on Nintendo Switch 2 at launch (also, the only one).\nIt wouldn't be a Nintendo launch without a new Sonic ga... uh, this will never stop feeling weird. Anyway, if you're keen on this new take on a classic modern Sonic game, complete with a Shadow campaign, then Amazon is offering a touch over AU$10 off the RRP.\nThose are the big physical releases for Nintendo Switch 2 at launch. I'll be updating this page as more games join the roster post-launch.\nLooking for Nintendo Switch 2 console pre-orders and accessories? We're rounding those up here.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nShaun is the Australian editor and news writer for our sister site, PC Gamer, but he occasionally dabbles on GamesRadar too. He mostly plays platformers and RPGs, and keeps a close eye on anything of particular interest to antipodean audiences. He (rather obsessively) tracks the movements of the Doom modding community, too.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Nintendo fans rejoice - even during price hikes, these Switch 2 games have never been cheaper\nBuild up your new Switch 2 game library for less\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 hasn't even been around for longer than three months, yet already some Switch 2 games are seeing price cuts. At a time when Nintendo hardware price hikes are rife, that's exactly what I want to see, but there are some things you need to know first.\nFor one, it's not first-party Nintendo games that are seeing discounts. Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza remain firmly at full price, which makes sense given how new they are. Additionally, it's mainly Game-Key Card titles and digital codes in a box type releases that have some crash shaved off them right now, which not everyone is a huge fan of, understandably.\nIf you don't care about not having the full game on a physical cart and just want to save some cash, then stick with me as I lay out all the discounts I can currently find below.\nRaidou: Remastered \u2013 The Mystery of the Soulless Army Launch Edition (Game-Key Card) | $49.99 $39.99 at Amazon\nSave $10 - This is the first discount of its kind for the action RPG, taking its $49.99 MSRP down to $39.99 and saving you $10 in the process. Sure, a saving of $10 isn't a lot, but the remaster has only been out two months, so any price drop at all is worth making a fuss about.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You have a soft spot for ATLUS RPGs\n\u2705 You never played the original\n\u2705 You have space for the full 17GB game download\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You aren't a fan of Game-Key Cards\n\u274c You prefer turn-based RPGs\nYakuza 0: Director\u2019s Cut (Game-Key Card) | $49.99 $39.99 at Amazon\nSave $10 - The director's cut of Yakuza 0, the definitive prequel of the iconic Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, saw some discounts shortly after launch, but it shot back up to its full $49.99 MSRP in no time. Now its' returned to just $39.99, saving you $10 off one of my favorite games of all time. Just in time for both Yakuza Kiwami games releasing on the new handheld later this year.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You want to start the Yakuza game series\n\u2705 You agree that Majima is the best boy\n\u2705 You love games set in the 80s\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You prefer the turn-based RPG gameplay of Yakuza Like a Dragon\n\u274c You'd rather just get the game from the eShop\n\u274c You can't free up 47GB for the full game download\nUK: \u00a340.96 at Amazon\nPuyo Puyo Tetris 2S (Game-Key Card) | $39.99 $29.99 at Amazon\nSave $10 - Just like Yakuza 0, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S has seen a discount in the past, although only up to $2 was dropped from its $39.99 MSRP. Now, the Switch 2 version is down to its lowest ever price so far at just $29.99, saving you $10 in the process.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You're a nerd for puzzle games\n\u2705 You want to try out the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls\n\u2705 You enjoy competitive and casual play\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You aren't a fan of Game-Key Cards\n\u274c You don't want to free up 4GB\n\u274c You don't like puzzle games\nSid Meier's Civilization VII \u2013 Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Code In Box) | $69.99 $64.99 at Amazon\nSave $5 - There's no Game-Key Card to be found here, and instead this version of Civ 7 is a download code in a box. If you're happy with that fact, then you might be happier to know the game is down to $64.99 right now, saving you $5 off its $69.99 MSRP. This marks the lowest ever price for the Switch 2 version of the game so far.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You want to put the mouse controls to work\n\u2705 You want to play a Civ game on the go\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You'd prefer the physical Switch version\n\u274c You only buy physical games\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 (Code in Box) Standard Edition | $49.99 $39.99 at Best Buy\nSave $10 - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 has barely been out for over a month, but already the Switch 2 version is seeing a discount of $10 off right now. This current sale price takes the $49.99 game down to $39.99, its lowest ever price on the new Ninty handheld so far. It is a download code in a box, which is a bit of a bummer for you, physical game fans, but you're still saving cash on two games in one.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You want to relive a ton of nostalgia\n\u2705 You want two games-in-one\n\u2705 You want skating games to play on the go\n\u2705 You want the HDR support of the Switch 2 port\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You want the full original game soundtrack\n\u274c You only play physical Switch 2 games\n\u274c You prefer the Skate series\nUK: \u00a324.99 at Argos\nSonic X Shadow Generations (Game-Key Card) | $39.99 $49.99 at Amazon\nSave $10 - In case you missed it on the original Switch, Sonic X Shadow Generations has returned on the Switch 2 and is down to just $49.99 right now. The OG Switch version has been cheaper, but if you're keen for those crisper visuals, you can grab this version for the new handheld and save $10 in the process.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You never played the OG Sonic Generations\n\u2705 You love classic and modern Sonic gameplay\n\u2705 You're a big Shadow the Hedgehog fan\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You already own the game on the OG Switch\n\u274c You aren't into Game-Key Cards\nUK: \u00a342.99 at Argos\nShould you buy Switch 2 Game-Key Cards?\nGame-Key Cards are new to the Switch 2 Nintendo generation, and not everyone is a fan. These cards are physical game carts, and are exactly the same dimensions as any other physical game on the new handheld, but they don't contain the full data of a game. Instead, Game-Key Cards act as a 'key' to grant you access to a digital game download of whatever title you own.\nEssentially, it's like having a digital code in a box on a physical game cart. You still need to have space for the full game to download on your handheld, so you're losing some of the benefits of owning a typical physical game.\nWith that in mind, they're not for everyone. I'm a physical game girlie, and I feel uneasy knowing I own No Sleep for Kaname Date as a Game-Key Card and not the full physical version that's available on the original Switch. Yes, there's still a physical game involved, which I could re-sell if I needed to, or let a friend borrow, but I much prefer knowing the entire game data is all on one cart.\nIf you're in the same boat, a lot of the discounts above won't be for you, and that's okay. In some spots, you can grab the original Switch versions of games like Civilization 7 for $77.79 at Amazon, and grab the Switch 2 upgrade pack on the eShop to get the best of both worlds. However, these discounts on Switch 2 games, even if they are game-key cards, are a sight for sore eyes when Nintendo tech is getting pricier every day.\n- View all Switch 2 game deals at Amazon\n- Nintendo Switch 2 + Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A Bundle: $499 at Walmart\n- Donkey Kong Bananza: $69 at Amazon\n- Mario Kart World: $79 at Amazon\nOur ultimate Switch 2 starter pack is full of the best accessories, from the best Nintendo Switch 2 microSD Express Cards, to the best Nintendo Switch 2 cameras, that can help unlock the full potential of your new Ninty handheld.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nEver since I first held a NES controller in my hand I've been obsessed with gaming, and the hardware it runs on. I could hook up a NES and SNES to a telly, without instructions, before I could walk. Even now, nothing is more exciting then taking a console, or handheld, out the box for the first time and setting it up. This obsession transformed into a love of games and game music, which lead to my music degree and dream of becoming the Scottish Nobuo Uematsu. After sharing my love of games through music, I began to share my love through words on sites like TechRadar and iMore. This lead to becoming a Hardware staff writer for PCGamesN, and later the Senior Tech Writer for Dexerto, covering all things Steam Deck, PlayStation and Nintendo. With that experience, I was able to level up as Hardware Editor for GamesRadar+, where I'm still just as Nintendo, PlayStation and gaming tech obsessed as ever.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Nintendo Switch 2 stock live - US and UK restocks for Ninty's latest handheld\nWhere to buy the Switch 2 right now and restock updates.\n1. Quick stock check\n2. US stock\n3. UK stock\n4. Live updates\nCongratulations, gamers. You've sucessfully waited out the shortages and Nintendo Switch 2 stock is now holding. You can buy one of Nintendo's new consoles pretty easily now, whether you're in the US or UK, and regardless of whether you're looking for bundles or just the console at MSRP, we've found the best places to shop.\nOne thing I'm noticing with Switch 2 restocks as we approach the end of July is lower bundle pricing. Yes, the base console comes in at $449 / \u00a3395, but the likes of the Mario Kart World and Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A editions will set you back $499 / \u00a3429. That's all fine and well since you're getting a game, but some stores like to list stock with extra accessories for way above MSRP.\nThankfully, most Switch 2 prices out there aren't inflated using extra accessories, and you'll find the handheld at all my go-to retailers for a reasonable price. I've been keeping an eye on the handheld throughout 2025, and I'll be continuing to bring you the latest restocks and drops live this week and beyond.\nCheck Nintendo Switch 2 stock\n- \u2705 Best Buy: In stock\n- \u2705 Amazon: Request invite\n- \u2705 Antonline: In stock\n- \u2705Walmart: In stock\n- \u2705 Target: In stock\n- \u2705 GameStop: In-store and pre-owned available\n- Nintendo: Check stock\n- Newegg: Inflated price\nUK\n- \u2705 Amazon: In stock\n- \u2705 Argos: In stock\n- \u2705 Currys: In stock\n- \u2705 Very: In stock\n- \u2705 EE: In stock\n- \u2705 Nintendo: In stock\n- \u2705 Ebuyer: In stock\n- \u2705 ShopTo: In stock\n- The GameCollection: Check stock\nI've been getting the latest consoles into the hands of players for almost two decades, so it's safe to say I have a knack for sniffing out Switch 2 stock. Ninty's latest handheld might be the most in-demand console since the mighty PS2, but having previously served on the frontlines during the launch of the Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3, it's safe to say I have some solid leads when it comes to Switch 2 restocks.\nWhere to buy Nintendo Switch 2 in the US\n\u2705 Amazon | Request invite\nTechnically speaking, you have to be invited in like some sort of Switch 2 seeking vampire to buy the handheld at Amazon. But you'll actually get approval fairly quickly, and the measure is simply a way to curb resellers.\n\u2705 Walmart | In stock\nAfter a stint of resellers at the retailer offering up inflated prices, Walmart finally has its own Switch 2 stock at MSRP. Just make sure you check you're either getting it from the big box store when buying or ensure you aren't paying over the odds at one of its listed merchants.\nGameStop | Check stock\nGameStop doesn't actually have any Switch 2 stock available online, but it is a solid option for in-store console purchases. If you'd like to keep things traditional and grab the handheld at a physical games retailer, pop down to your local store.\nNintendo Store | Check stock\nYou can pick up the Switch 2 direct from Nintendo, but it's still using an invite system for now. That makes picking up the portable slightly more awkward, so I'd be inclined to check other retailers before falling back to Ninty's store.\nWhere to buy Nintendo Switch 2 in the UK\n\u2705 Very | In stock\nVery was out to impress with its Switch 2 stock over the launch, but it's now down to just a Donkey Kong Bananza bundle and the upcoming Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A version. I've no doubts that it'll get other options in soon, but you don't have to go here first if you want to keep costs lower.\n\u2705 EE | In stock for mobile customers\nAs a phone contract retailer, EE is handling the Switch 2 stock situation slightly differently. You'll have to be a customer to pick up the handheld at the store, which makes sense since it'll be built into your monthly bill.\n\u2705 The Game Collection | In stock\nIf, for whatever reason, you'd rather spend more on a Switch 2 that's bundled with Hogwarts Legacy and a Camera, then The Game Collection is an option. It feels like the retailer should simply have the console available since it's sitting pretty everywhere else, but it'd rather you pick up extras.\nShopTo | Check stock\nShopTo likes to beat rival retailers by mere pennies, and that might be why is has no stock available right now. It does have pre-orders for the Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A bundle, though, so if you're happy to wait until October, check them out.\nEbuyer | Check stock\nEbuyer's Switch 2 stock is technically on backorder, so if the handheld dries up everywhere else, you could reserve in time for a restock on July 30.\nLive updates\nAnother week of Switch 2 hunting begins\nHello Ninty fans and handheld lovers alike!\nI'm back on the ground searching for more Switch 2 stock drops, and things are looking pretty great. Recent restocks mean most retailers in the US and UK are carrying the handheld, and I suspect things will remain healthy for a while. That said, things could change at any second thanks to turbulent global economics, so I'd urge you not to take the current situation for granted.\nPsst, Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A Switch 2 bundle pre-orders are also live!\nYou'll have to wait until October to actually get your hands on one, but there's now a Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A Switch 2 bundle available for pre-order. Sadly, it's not a special edition handheld, as the package merely contains the vanilla console and a download code the the latest entry to the RPG. However, if you're only interested in catching adorable monsters and having them battle it out, reserving this version will save you spending money right this second.\nUS: Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A Switch 2 bundle | $499.99 at Best Buy\nUK: Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A Switch 2 bundle | \u00a3429.99 at Smyths\nArgos has Switch 2 stock again in the UK\nI'm pretty hyped to see Argos get in on the Switch 2 restocks, as it's one of the most reliable retailers in the UK for picking up the handheld. I personally grabbed my pre-order at the longstanding catalogue-based store, and it's pretty versatile since it offers home delivery and click and collect.\nNintendo Switch 2 | \u00a3395.99 at Argos\nIs now the right time to buy a Nintendo Switch 2?\nI feel like I've had this conversation on repeat with friends since June, but many of you will no doubt be wondering if you should buy a Switch 2 right now. Ultimately, I'd say the decision comes down to whether you want to play Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza or the new version of Super Mario Party Jamboree, as those are two exclusives that will only run on the handheld. Everything else will either work on your OG console or other platforms, and while some older releases benefit from a performance bump, that might not be worth investing in right this second.\nA quick Switch 2 stock update\nHey all!\nThought I'd give you the skinny on Switch 2 stock right now. First off, my three got-to retailers, Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart all have a nice supply of the handheld right now. I'm not seeing any inventory dips *yet*, but it could happen if restocks aren't happening behind the scenes. In the UK, Argos re-joined the fold alongside Amazon and Currys, and Smyths also has the Pok\u00e9mon Legends X-A version.\nSimply put, you've not missed the Switch 2 restocks train, but if you've decided you need the handheld in your life, I'd grab one sooner rather than later.\nNintendo Switch 2 | $449.99 at Best Buy\nNintendo Switch 2 Pokemon Legends Z-A bundle | $499.99 at Best Buy\nUh-oh, Walmart is fresh out of its own stock!\nWe kicked off the week with the Switch 2 in stock at most major retailers, but Walmart's supply has finally run dry. You'll still find the handheld at the big box store, but prices are higher thanks to marketplace listings. Simply put, you'll be paying more for the luxury of grabbing one from a reseller at the site, so I'd stick with Best Buy to avoid paying over MSRP.\nNintendo Switch 2 | $449.99 at Best Buy\nNintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World | $499.99 at Best Buy\nToday's stock levels are looking... pretty darn good\nAs we saw yesterday, the Switch 2 is readily available to buy at the majority of retailers in the US and UK right now. I'll keep looking throughout the day to find a few of the best bundles and alert you if any good deals come up, but right now, you're best looking at the retailer links above and shopping the one that's most convenient for you.\nThe bundles are at Antonline\nIf you're looking for a side of accessories with your Switch 2 pre-order, the place to be is Antonline.\nKeep in mind, paying for a bundle is going to set you back more than MSRP, but if you want to kill two or three birds with one stone, then this might be the way to go. Spending separately on controllers, games, and peripherals might spread the cost, but if you'd rather have it all right away, Antonline has a bunch of options.\nMy favorite is probably this Mario Kart World / DK Bananza bundle that also gets you a Pro Controller.\nNintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World + Switch 2 Pro Controller + Donky Kong Bananza | $649.97 at Antonline\nShopping in the UK? Here are your best bets for grabbing the console on its own\nIf you want a Switch 2 for as cheap as possible, that means avoiding the Mario Kart World bundle and gunning straight for the console itself. If you're shopping in the UK, here are your best bets:"

      "text": "Forget price hikes - the Nintendo Switch OLED is finally on sale and, honestly, it might just be the right call for new players\nNew to the Switch? Walmart has the deal for you\nLook, I love the Nintendo Switch 2. For Nintendo Switch 2 games. The truth is, I was disappointed in the system's treatment of legacy titles when I reviewed it at launch. The new handheld sports a larger, higher resolution screen and when older Switch titles are plastered across this face, they look worse than they did on the original.\nThat's why the Nintendo Switch OLED's current $50 discount is so appealing. Walmart and Amazon both have the console available for $299.99, down from the original $349.99 MSRP. That's $150 less than the price of the Switch 2 (which currently only has a handful of dedicated games by the way).\nNintendo Switch OLED | $349.99 $299.99 at Walmart\nSave $50 - You're spending $150 less than the price of a Nintendo Switch 2 here, and getting a better visual experience across Ninty's massive library. That's nothing to shake a stick at, especially considering the OLED model's seen price hikes over that $349.99 MSRP recently.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You're new to the catalog\n\u2705 You mostly play in handheld mode\n\u2705 You don't need the latest release\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You need more Donkey Kong in your life\nPrice check: Amazon: $299.99 | Best Buy: $349.99\nThat's without taking recent price increases into account. Nintendo officially upped the MSRP of the Nintendo Switch OLED to a whopping $399.99 at the start of the month - just $50 less than the new Switch 2.\nThankfully, many retailers have stuck with the previous $349.99 MSRP for now - but it also means you're technically saving $100 on a Nintendo handheld, and that's not a sentence I can type very often.\nShould you buy the Nintendo Switch OLED in 2025?\nI wouldn't recommend the Nintendo Switch OLED to everyone right now. Obviously, the Nintendo Switch 2 is the more powerful gaming handheld capable of running beefier games on a bigger, higher resolution screen. The original Nintendo Switch started to show its age a good few years before the new handheld as well, dropping performance in more demanding titles.\nThe fact still remains, though, that I've had the Nintendo Switch 2 since launch and I still use my OLED for older titles. The difference in visual quality on OG Switch games was noticeable from the first moment I tried running Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the new system. Stretching a game designed for a 7-inch HD screen across a 7.9-inch 1080p panel is never going to end well.\nIf you're buying your first Switch and want to make the most of a massive library of existing games rather than waiting for a drip-feed of new releases I'd jump on this Switch OLED offer as soon as possible. To make the most of a Switch 2 right now, you'll need to be super keen on Donkey Kong Banaza, Mario Kart World, or The Legend of Zelda.\nRead more: Nintendo Switch 2 vs Nintendo Switch OLED\n- Nintendo Switch OLED |\n$349.99$299.99 at Walmart - Nintendo Switch OLED |\n$349.99$299.99 at Amazon - Nintendo Switch 2 + MK World | $499 at Walmart\nCheck out all the best Nintendo Switch accessories we've tested so far, or take a look at more of the cheapest Nintendo Switch bundle deals available now.

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nThis is the best reason yet to own a Switch 2, and shows Nintendo at its absolute best. The central destruction mechanic is so much fun, and smart level design keeps it delightful from beginning to end with an adventure rivaling Mario's very best.\nPros\n- +\nDestruction is just as fun as it looks\n- +\nTerrific level variety keeps things fun to the end\n- +\nSurprisingly charming story\nCons\n- -\nPerformance and camera troubles are occasionally annoying\n- -\nSome Bananza transformations aren't very exciting\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nSmashing things is fun, and Donkey Kong Bananza understands that fact better than any other video game I've ever played. Forget about \"See that mountain? You can go there.\" Now it's \"See that mountain? You can obliterate it.\" Bananza's destruction isn't just a flashy gimmick for the Minecraft generation, it's one of the best inventions Nintendo has had in years.\nRelease date: July 17, 2025\nPlatform: Nintendo Switch 2\nDeveloper: In-house\nPublisher: Nintendo\nIf you've played Super Mario Odyssey, you'll recognize its DNA in Donkey Kong Bananza. You'll wander around vast levels completing challenges to grab a central collectable \u2013 in this case, crystalline bananas \u2013 and items that let you unlock outfits that give you a unique look appropriate for each world. The difference is that instead of hopping all over a level's surface to find those items, you'll now be smashing your way through rock and dirt to find them.\nYou play as Donkey Kong, paired up with a version of Pauline far younger than we've seen her in the past, lost somewhere beneath the planet's surface. To fulfill our heroes' dual dreams of \"returning home\" and \"eating every banana,\" you've got to journey to the center of the earth, pursuing a crew of new ape villains. The story isn't the main draw here, but it is a surprisingly compelling extra hook, and the slowly developing friendship between Pauline and DK becomes downright endearing over the plot's twists and turns.\nHey, DK, you awake?\nSmashing the world is Donkey Kong Bananza's primary attraction. The Nintendo Switch 2 face buttons let you jump, punch up, punch down, and punch forward, and those basic actions will carry you through most of the game. Dig down into ground, punch your way forward to carve a tunnel, and smash up to claw your way back out again. There are a few other abilities, too, and while pretty much all of your moves are unlocked from the start, Bananza does a great job of slowly unfolding those mechanics to you over the first few worlds, offering a satisfying sense of progression without actually locking the cool, fun toys away.\nYou do have to unlock Bananza Transformations, which see DK turn into big, super-powered animals ranging from an ostrich to a much bigger-than-usual gorilla. These abilities let you do things like glide across big gaps or punch straight through concrete, and while not every one is a winner, the good ones are very satisfying to use. One transformation, which I won't spoil here, had me in disbelief that the game was actually giving me an ability so powerful.\nLevels have a sort of indestructible skeleton at their heart, but that simply gives you a place to stand if you'd otherwise be digging yourself into the void. (You can see an example of how thoroughly you can destroy a level in the images above.) If you want to raze every recognizable surface to the ground, you can absolutely feel free to do so \u2013 and, in fact, that's a pretty viable strategy if you want to make sure you don't miss a single collectable. With so much to find, from the big bananas to the explosions of gold fragments that satisfyingly clink into your inventory, it feels like you're constantly being rewarded for digging.\nThe joy of blasting a tunnel through a mountain, looking back, and admiring your own mark on the world is pretty self-explanatory, but incredibly it never really gets old. That's thanks largely to wonderful level design that keeps the smashing varied. One stage will have you leaping across trees separated by poison water, tossing seeds around that'll sprout into big leafy platforms that bridge the gaps. Another might have you punching out magical pieces of terrain that'll then reappear in another position, creating a stairway to your next objective. Yet another level could be built around a weird material which, when you rip off a chunk of it, will send you jetting into the sky.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nOh, banana\nWhile all these twists give each level its own flavor, they never feel constraining. In fact, from the earliest hours of the game to the final stages, I found myself so unconstrained that I'd consistently blast past each level's breadcrumb trail while exploring other pathways. Sure, that guy at the level entrance mentioned something about a big, labyrinthine path to reach the other side, but\u2026 well, who needs all that platforming when you can just dig there?\nThis all forms a wild new direction for a Donkey Kong game, but for the nostalgic purists among us \u2013 I assure you, I am one \u2013 it still feels like part of the series. You'll hear new mixes of classic tracks going back to the Rareware-era, the constant refrain of DK64's \"oh, banana,\" and even a handful of 2D challenge stages paying explicit tribute to the most memorable levels of the SNES games. There are some pretty deep-cut references in here that absolutely tickled the kid in me who was obsessed with Donkey Kong Country in the '90s.\nDonkey Kong Bananza also has probably the best form yet of Nintendo's now-standard asynchronous co-op mode. Here, 'player two' grabs a joy-con to give Pauline a dragonborn-style shouting power, pointing a cursor around with mouse controls and belting out words that manifest as big chunks of material that can smash the world just as effectively as DK's fists. You can grab material types with a sort of Photoshop eyedropper tool, and then blast the world with stone or explosives with a click. It's similar to the modes we've had in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Odyssey, but here the second player can actually have a real effect on the world. The added power makes boss fights perhaps a bit too easy, but it's great fun for both players regardless.\nMy only gripes with Donkey Kong Bananza are that the camera can occasionally struggle to show the action when you dig deep underground, and that performance on Switch 2 can occasionally take a dive when there's a whole lot happening on-screen. Neither issue is particularly commonplace, but it does happen just frequently enough to be annoying, and the framerate issues are particularly troublesome in boss battles.\nYet even with those issues in mind, I absolutely loved the roughly 25 hours I spent seeing Donkey Kong Bananza through to its end credits, and I can't wait to drop back in to go for 100% completion. Nintendo's brought Minecraft and Mario together in an incredible combo that pays tribute to DK's past, and it's a genuine must-play for Switch 2 owners.\nDonkey Kong Bananza was reviewed on Nintendo Switch 2 with a code provided by the publisher.\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

Key exclusive titles such as Donkey\u202fKong\u202fBananza and Mario\u202fKart\u202fWorld justify buying the new handheld, though older Switch games run better on the original or OLED models.
