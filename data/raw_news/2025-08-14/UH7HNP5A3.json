  "title": "It's Peak Time to Spot Bright Fireballs During the Dazzling Perseids Meteor Shower",
  "description": "Look up in the sky, and if you're lucky, and in the right spot, you could see dozens of meteors every hour.",
  "content": "Skygazers rejoice, the summer isn't finished with delivering dazzling meteor showers. The last week of July saw dueling meteor showers taking over the sky, but the most popular meteor shower of the year is hitting its peak now. The Perseids meteor shower is about to give you a real light show, provided you're far enough away from light pollution to see it.\n\nPerseids are known for their bright fireballs and plentiful meteors. The show started on July 17, and will run through Aug. 23.\n\nThe reason the Perseids meteor shower is so popular is twofold. First, it takes place in the summer, so going outside and watching it is less uncomfortable than other large meteor showers like Quadrantids, which takes place in wintery January.\n\nThe other reason is that it's one of the most active meteor showers of the year. During its peak, the meteor shower is known to rain down as many as 100 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society. These not only include your typical shooting stars, but also a higher chance for fireballs, which are meteors that explode as they enter orbit. Per NASA, fireballs tend to last longer than standard shooting stars and can come in a variety of different colors.\n\nPerseids come to Earth courtesy of the 109P/Swift-Tuttle comet. Earth's orbit around the sun brings it through Swift-Tuttle's tail every year. The comet itself takes 133 years to orbit the sun. Its last perihelion -- the point at which it's the closest to the sun -- was in 1992. It won't be back until the year 2125. Until then, it leaves behind an excellent tail of dust and debris to feed us yearly meteor showers.\n\nHow to catch the Perseids meteor shower\n\nThe best time to view the Perseids is during its peak, which is this week. During this time, the shower will produce anywhere from 25 to 100 meteors per hour on average. However, since the shower officially lasts for over a month, you have a chance to see a shooting star on any given evening, provided that you're far enough away from light pollution.\n\nThus, if you're planning on watching this year's Perseids during their peak, you'll want to get out of the city and suburbs as far as possible. According to Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environments Office, folks in the city might see one or two meteors from the meteor shower per hour, which is pocket change compared to what those outside city limits might see.\n\nRegardless, once you've arrived at wherever you want to watch the meteors, you'll want to direct your attention to the radiant, or the point at which the meteors will appear to originate. Like all meteors, Perseids are named after the constellation from which they appear. In this case, it's Perseus.\n\nPer Stellarium's free sky map, Perseus will rise from the northeastern horizon across the continental US on the evenings of Aug. 12 and 13. It'll then rise into the eastern sky, where it'll remain until after sunrise. So, in short, point yourself due east and you should be OK. Binoculars may help, but we recommend against telescopes since they'll restrict your view of the sky to a very small portion, which may hinder your meteor-sighting efforts.\n\nThe American Meteor Society also notes that the moon may give viewers some difficulty. Perseids' peak occurs just three days after August's full moon, so the moon will still be mostly full. Thus, it is highly probable that light pollution from the moon may reduce the number of visible meteors by a hefty margin, depending on how things go.",

      "text": "Want to see a meteor shower next week? They come around every year like clockwork and that means planning shooting star trips can be done months in advance. Here's a look at the next one, plus what's coming for the rest of 2025.\nTips for watching\nTo have the best odds of seeing the most meteors during any given shower, the first advice is to get as far away from the big city as logistically possible -- and that also applies to suburbanites. Light pollution is the enemy of space viewing and most meteor showers are barely visible in the suburbs, let alone a big city. From there, you'll want to find the radiant -- also known as the point from which the meteor shower appears to originate -- and then keep your eyes pointed in that direction. The moon's light can also be a negative factor, but since meteor showers occur on specific days, it's up to nature as to whether or not moonlight will affect viewing.\nLyrids\nWhen: Apr. 15 to Apr. 30\nPeak date: Apr. 21 to 22\nMaximum meteor rate: 18 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Lyra\nThings pick up again in April with the Lyrids meteor shower. Its radiant is Lyra, which will rise out of the eastern sky every night during its run. This one is a little bigger than most, having up to 18 meteors per hour. Earth runs through the C/1861 G1 Thatcher comet every April to bring this shower to its citizens. Interestingly, meteors from Lyrids tend to not have trails but can produce some pretty bright fireballs.\nEta Aquariids\nWhen: Apr. 20 to May 21\nPeak date: May 3 to 4\nMaximum meteor rate: 50 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Aquarius\nThe 1P/Halley, famously known as Halley's Comet, is responsible for the Eta Aquariids, and it's the biggest meteor shower to occur during spring with up to 50 meteors per hour. The only downside is that its radiant, Aquarius, doesn't rise out of the southeastern sky until around 4 a.m. local time, meaning you'll have to wake up very early or stay up super late to catch it. On the plus side, the moon will have set by then, meaning the moon won't obstruct the view for this meteor shower.\nAlpha Capricornids\nWhen: July 12 to Aug. 12\nPeak date: July 29 to 30\nMaximum meteor rate: 5 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Capricornus\nAlpha Capricornids is a minor meteor shower that comes from the 169P/NEAT comet. It's not a strong shower, but it is notable for producing some rather large fireballs. It's also equally visible in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. The radiant for this one is Capricornus, which streaks through the south sky and will be visible all night during its peak. Fortunately, the moon won't be too full, so it won't obstruct the view too much.\nSouthern delta Aquariids\nWhen: July 28 to Aug. 12\nPeak date: July 29 to 30\nMaximum meteor rate: 25 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Aquarius\nSouthern delta Aquariids often overshadows the Alpha Capricornids. This meteor shower peaks early, just a day or two after it officially starts, and then tails off through mid-August. Its early peak puts it on the same day as Alpha Capricornids, so if you see a shooting star on July 29 or 30, it might have come from either one. The radiant for this one is Aquarius, which is right next to Capricornus, making the two showers a fine pairing. Researchers aren't 100% certain which comet gives us the Southern delta Aquariids, although the best guess right now is 96P/Machholz.\nPerseids\nWhen: July 17 to Aug. 23\nPeak date: Aug. 12 to 13\nMaximum meteor rate: 100 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Perseus\nPerseids is one of the premier space events that takes place during the summer. It comes from the 109P/Swift-Tuttle comet and is one of the most consistently busy meteor showers of the year. Plus, it takes place over the summer, which is perfect meteor shower weather. The radiant is Perseus, which rises out of the northeastern sky relatively early in the evening and stays up all night. The only downside is that the moon will be almost full during Perseids' peak in 2025, making it more difficult to see the smaller meteors.\nSouthern Taurids\nWhen: Sept. 23 to Nov. 4\nPeak date: Oct. 10 to 11\nMaximum meteor rate: 5 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Taurus\nSouthern Taurids is one of the longest-lasting meteor showers of the year lasting well over a month. It's not a particularly active meteor shower, but since it takes place during several other meteor showers, you may spot one of these while looking for another one. The 2P/Encke comet fuels this one and it peaks a couple of weeks away from Halloween. This one is paired with the Northern Taurids to make the Taurids meteor shower. However, they peak on different days so they're often listed as separate meteor showers.\nOrionids\nWhen: Oct. 2 to Nov. 12\nPeak date: Oct. 22 to 23\nMaximum meteor rate: 20 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Orion\nOrionids is a reasonably active meteor shower that happens mostly during October. It also has the distinction of coming from the famous Halley's Comet just like the Eta Aquariids shower. Unlike Eta Aquariids, the Orionids come out of the Orion constellation, which rises out of the eastern sky in October. Also, the moon will be virtually new, so it'll have one of the darkest skies of any meteor shower this year.\nDraconids\nWhen: Oct. 6 to Oct. 10\nPeak date: Oct. 8\nMaximum meteor rate: 10 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Draco\nDraconids is a minor meteor shower and the shortest one on the list, lasting for all of four days. It hails from the 21/P Giacobini-Zimmer comet and has a fairly decent peak at around 10 meteors per hour. The peak occurs just two days after it starts and then the meteor shower ends two days later. The radiant for Draconids is Draco, which is between the Big Dipper and Little Dipper, making it relatively easy to find in the night sky.\nNorthern Taurids\nWhen: Oct. 13 to Dec. 1\nPeak date: Nov. 8 to 9\nMaximum meteor rate: 5 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Taurus\nNorthern Taurids is the other half of the Taurids meteor shower and this one lasts even longer, going from the middle of October all the way until December. It peaks about halfway through its run on Nov. 8, which is a few weeks later than its southern counterpart. Otherwise, the two are virtually identical. They are both fueled by the 2P/Encke comet and at their best produce around five meteors per hour. For now, researchers believe that this shower comes from a different segment of the Encke comet trail, which is why it's often listed separately from its southern cousin.\nLeonids\nWhen: Nov. 3 to Dec. 2\nPeak date: Nov. 16 to 17\nMaximum meteor rate: 15 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Leo\nJust a few days after the Northern Taurids peaks, the Leonids shower will also peak. Created by the 55P/Tempel-Tuttle comet, Leonids will come from the Leo constellation, which rises in the eastern sky right around 2 a.m. local time for most of its run. This is a bigger meteor shower than the Taurids but a smaller shower than the Orionids. Since all four of them intersect during the first week of November, it may be tough to tell which meteor shower a shooting star comes from. This is especially true since Taurus, Leo, and Orion are all in the eastern sky at this time of year. Leonids often has fast, bright meteors that leave a trail, which may be the only way to differentiate a Leonids meteor from the other three showers.\nGeminids\nWhen: Dec. 4 to Dec. 20\nPeak date: Dec. 14 to 15\nMaximum meteor rate: 120 meteors per hour\nRadiant: Gemini\nGeminids is one of the biggest meteor showers of the year, and it peaks less than two weeks away from Christmas. It's generated by the 3200 Phaethon comet and can show as many as 120 meteors per hour in the right conditions. Geminids is best known for its brighter, slower-moving meteors, making them easier to see in brighter areas like cities or suburbs. It takes place during the cold season, but it can put on quite a show if viewed from outside the big city.\nUrsids\nWhen: Dec. 17 to Dec. 26\nPeak date: Dec. 22 to 23\nMaximum meteor rate: 10 meteors per hour\nRadiant: The Little Dipper\nUrsids begins right after the peak of Geminids and continues until the day after Christmas. Since Geminids ends before Christmas, it is statistically likely that if you've ever watched a Christmas movie that has a shooting star, it likely came from Ursids. The shower peaks on the evening of Dec. 22 from the Little Dipper, which is readily visible in the night sky for most of the evening. Much like Draconids, it disappears almost as fast as it shows up, lasting only nine days in total.\nQuadrantids\nWhen:: Dec. 12, 2025 to Jan. 12, 2026\nPeak date: Jan. 3 to 4, 2026\nMaximum meteor rate: 120 meteors per hour\nRadiant: The Big Dipper\nThe year ends the same way it begins with the Quandrantids meteor shower. It starts in early December and wraps around to the New Year. Thus, while it does have the distinction of being the only meteor shower that occurs twice a year, the peak is always in the first few days of January. Otherwise, it's the same meteor shower as the Quadrantids listed above. So, we'll use this space to deliver a fun fact. Most meteor showers are fueled by comets, chunks of ice floating through the universe that leave long trails that, as Earth moves through them, create meteors. However, Quadrantids is fueled by 2003 EH, which is an asteroid and not a comet. Researchers believe that 2003 EH is potentially a comet that died out and became an asteroid."

      "text": "While meteor showers happen all year, a rarer occurrence is having two meteor showers that peak at the same time. It'll happen this week, on Tuesday.\nThe shooting star show comes courtesy of the Alpha Capricornids and Southern delta Aquariids meteor showers. The former is already happening and runs until Aug. 12, with a peak on Tuesday. Southern delta Aquariids will start on Monday, peaks early on Tuesday and runs until Aug. 12 as well. That means for one evening, the two meteor showers are peaking at the same time, giving stargazers a much better chance at catching a shooting star.\nOf the two, the Southern delta Aquarids is typically the larger meteor shower, tossing upward of 25 meteors per hour during its zenith. Alpha Capricornids is a lesser meteor shower, with about five per hour on average. Combined, they'll output an estimated 30 per hour.\nSee 2 meteor showers at once\nSince the meteors are coming from two different points in the sky, you would think spotting meteors from both would be difficult, but that is far from the truth.\nAlpha Capricornids, which hails from the 169P/NEAT comet, originates from the Capricornus constellation. It will rise from the eastern skies across the continental US around sunset and streak across the southern sky, setting in the western sky at sunrise.\nFor the Southern delta Aquariids, its radiant \u2014 the point from which its meteors seem to originate \u2014 is the Aquarius constellation. Aquarius is right next to Capricornus. That means it also rises out of the eastern horizon, streaks across the southern sky, and sets in the western horizon around dawn.\nIf you have trouble finding either of them, Stellarium's free sky map will help you hunt them down. Set the time, date and location, and you're off to the races. Once you find one, the other one is essentially right there next to it.\nTips on watching meteor showers\nAs per the norm, the tips here are the same as they are for the aurora borealis and planet parades. Light pollution and weather are your two biggest enemies. Since you can only do anything about one of those, let's focus on light pollution. You'll want to drive as far away from the city and suburbs as possible, as the light pollution will make it difficult to see the dimmer meteors. The farther away you are, the better, as even suburban light pollution can obfuscate most meteors.\nOnce out there, you just have to sit and wait. Since the constellations will move across the south as you watch, you may have to rotate your chair if you're out there for a while. Otherwise, a pair of binoculars may help. Telescopes aren't recommended, as they obscure your field of view and may actively obstruct your ability to see meteors."

      "text": "A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky called Radiant. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. The Meteor Data Center of the IAU lists over 900 suspected meteor showers of which about 100 are well established.\nThe meteor showers listed below are the easiest to observe and provide the most activity. Particular attention should be noted to the time and moonlight conditions. All these showers are best seen after midnight. Some are not even visible until after midnight. Showers that peak with the moon\u2019s phase greater than one half illuminated (first quarter to last quarter) will be affected by moonlight and difficult to observe.\nWhile the time each shower is best seen remains much the same year after year, the moonlight conditions change considerably from one year to the next. As we approach the date of each shower's maximum, be sure to consult the latest AMS article about Meteor Showers, which will provide in depth information on each shower and how to best view it.\nWhen is the next meteor shower?\nWell, first of all you need to know that the Perseids are currently active until Saturday 23rd August 2025.\nThe Perseids have peaked on Wednesday 13th August 2025 .\nOn this night, the moon was 84% full.\nHere is the list of the next major meteor showers that will occur after that:\nSouthern Taurids\nStatus: Active from October 13th to November 27th\nPeak: Nov 3-4 2025 (Moon 96% full.)\nAug 12-13, 2025\nPerseids\nCurrently activeActive from July 17th to August 23rd, 2025\nThe Perseids are the most popular meteor shower as they peak on warm August nights as seen from the northern hemisphere. The Perseids are active from July 14 to September 1. They reach a strong maximum on August 12 or 13, depending on the year. Normal rates seen from rural locations range from 50-75 shower members per hour at maximum. The Perseids are particles released from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle during its numerous returns to the inner solar system. They are called Perseids since the radiant (the area of the sky where the meteors seem to originate) is located near the prominent constellation of Perseus the hero when at maximum activity. In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity. Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible.\nShower details - Radiant: 03:17 +58.1\u00b0 - ZHR: 100 - Velocity: 37 miles/sec (swift - 59km/sec) - Parent Object: 109P/Swift-Tuttle\nNext Peak - The Perseids will next peak on the Aug 12-13, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 84% full.\n***Oct 22-23, 2025\nOrionids\nNext period of activity: October 2nd, 2025 to November 12th, 2025The Orionids are a medium strength shower that sometimes reaches high strength activity. In a normal year the Orionids produce 10-20 shower members at maximum. In exceptional years, such as 2006-2009, the peak rates were on par with the Perseids (50-75 per hour). Recent displays have produced low to average displays of this shower. In 2025, a waning crescent moon will rise near dawn and will not affect the shower at all..\nShower details - Radiant: 06:25 +15.8\u00b0 - ZHR: 20 - Velocity: 41 miles/sec (swift - 66km/sec) - Parent Object: 1P/Halley\nNext Peak - The Orionids will next peak on the Oct 22-23, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 2% full.\n***Nov 3-4, 2025\nSouthern Taurids\nNext period of activity: October 13th, 2025 to November 27th, 2025The Southern Taurids are a complex shower made up of two main components, the annual component which peaks on October 14th and the fireball swarm component which peaks on November 4th. Since 2025 is a swarm year, we will list November 4th as the peak. The Taurids (both branches) are rich in fireballs and are often responsible for increased number of fireball reports from September through November.\nShower details - Radiant: 03:34 +14.5\u00b0 - ZHR: 5 - Velocity: 17.7 miles/sec (slow - 28.5km/sec) - Parent Object: 2P/Encke\nNext Peak - The Southern Taurids will next peak on the Nov 3-4, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 96% full.\n***Nov 8-9, 2025\nNorthern Taurids\nNext period of activity: October 13th, 2025 to December 1st, 2025This shower is much like the Southern Taurids, just active a bit later in the year. When the two showers are active simultaneously in late October and early November, there is sometimes a notable increase in the fireball activity.\nShower details - Radiant: 03:53 +22.2\u00b0 - ZHR: 5 - Velocity: 17.6 miles/sec (slow - 28.3km/sec) - Parent Object: 2P/Encke\nNext Peak - The Northern Taurids will next peak on the Nov 8-9, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 83% full.\n***Nov 16-17, 2025\nLeonids\nNext period of activity: November 3rd, 2025 to December 2nd, 2025The Leonids are best known for producing meteor storms in the years of 1833, 1866, 1966, 1999, 2001 and 2002. These outbursts of meteor activity are best seen when the parent object, comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, is near perihelion (closest approach to the sun). Yet it is not the fresh material we see from the comet, but rather debris from earlier returns that also happen to be most dense at the same time. Unfortunately, it appears that the earth will not encounter any dense clouds of debris until 2099. Therefore, when the comet returns in 2031 and 2064, there may not be any meteor storms, but perhaps several good displays of Leonid activity when rates are in excess of 100 per hour. Each passing year also presents new possibilities from old debris fields. In 2024, the waning gibbous moon will rise during the late evening hours and will spoil the best viewing hours for this shower.\nShower details - Radiant: 10:16 +21.8\u00b0 - ZHR: 15 - Velocity: 43.5 miles/sec (swift - 69.7km/sec) - Parent Object: 55P/Tempel-Tuttle\nNext Peak - The Leonids will next peak on the Nov 16-17, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 9% full.\n***Dec 13-14, 2025\nGeminids\nNext period of activity: December 1st, 2025 to December 21st, 2025The Geminids are usually the strongest meteor shower of the year and meteor enthusiasts are certain to circle December 13 and 14 on their calendars. This is the one major shower that provides good activity prior to midnight as the constellation of Gemini is well placed from 22:00 onward. The Geminids are often bright and intensely colored. Due to their medium-slow velocity, persistent trains are not usually seen. These meteors are also seen in the southern hemisphere, but only during the middle of the night and at a reduced rate. In 2025, the moon will have a waning crescent phase on December 13/14, which rises near 2am local standard time. Observations prior to this time will be moon-free. Observations after moon rise can still be successful by facing westward with the rising moon at your back. .\nShower details - Radiant: 07:33 +32.4\u00b0 - ZHR: 150 - Velocity: 21 miles/sec (medium - 33.8km/sec) - Parent Object: 3200 Phaethon (asteroid)\nNext Peak - The Geminids will next peak on the Dec 13-14, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 30% full.\n***Dec 21-22, 2025\nUrsids\nNext period of activity: December 16th, 2025 to December 26th, 2025The Ursids are often neglected due to the fact it peaks just before Christmas and the rates are much less than the Geminds, which peaks just a week before the Ursids. Observers will normally see 5-10 Ursids per hour during the late morning hours on the date of maximum activity. There have been occasional outbursts when rates have exceeded 25 per hour. These outbursts appear unrelated to the perihelion dates of comet 8P/Tuttle. This shower is strictly a northern hemisphere event as the radiant fails to clear the horizon or does so simultaneously with the start of morning twilight as seen from the southern tropics.In 2024, a half-illuminated moon will be present in the morning sky and will obscure the fainter meteors.\nShower details - Radiant: 14:38 +75.4\u00b0 - ZHR: 10 - Velocity: 20.5 miles/sec (medium - 33.1km/sec) - Parent Object: 8P/Tuttle\nNext Peak - The Ursids will next peak on the Dec 21-22, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 3% full.\n***Jan 3-4, 2026\nQuadrantids\nNext period of activity: December 26th, 2025 to January 16th, 2026The Quadrantids have the potential to be the strongest shower of the year but usually fall short due to the short length of maximum activity (6 hours) and the poor weather experienced during early January. The average hourly rates one can expect under dark skies is 25. These meteors usually lack persistent trains but often produce bright fireballs. Due to the high northerly declination (celestial latitude) these meteors are not well seen from the southern hemisphere. Predictions for 2026 show a peak near 00:36 UT on January 4th. This timing favors Asia..Activity will be severely compromised in 2026 as a full moon occurs on January 3rd. The bright moonlight will obscure all but the brightest meteors therefore the best hourly rates are expected to be less than 10.\nShower details - Radiant: 15:20 +49.7\u00b0 - ZHR: 120 - Velocity: 25 miles/sec (medium - 40.4km/sec) - Parent Object: 2003 EH (Asteroid)\nNext Peak - The Quadrantids will next peak on the Jan 3-4, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 100% full.\n***Apr 21-22, 2026\nLyrids\nNext period of activity: April 17th, 2026 to April 26th, 2026The Lyrids are a medium strength shower that usually produces good rates for three nights centered on the maximum. These meteors also usually lack persistent trains but can produce fireballs. These meteors are best seen from the northern hemisphere where the radiant is high in the sky at dawn. Activity from this shower can be seen from the southern hemisphere, but at a lower rate. Maximum is predicted to occur near 13UT on April 22nd. The waning crescent moon will slightly interfere with viewing these meteors in 2025.\nShower details - Radiant: 18:08 +33.3\u00b0 - ZHR: 18 - Velocity: 29 miles/sec (medium - 46.6km/sec) - Parent Object: C/1861 G1 (Thatcher)\nNext Peak - The Lyrids will next peak on the Apr 21-22, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 27% full.\n***May 5-6, 2026\neta Aquariids\nNext period of activity: April 19th, 2026 to May 28th, 2026The Eta Aquariids are a strong shower when viewed from the southern tropics. From the equator northward, they usually only produce medium rates of 10-30 per hour just before dawn. Activity is good for a week centered the night of maximum activity. These are swift meteors that produce a high percentage of persistent trains, but few fireballs. In 2025, a first quarter moon will set long before the radiant rises so circumstances are excellent for viewing this shower. No abnormal activity is expected in 2025.\nShower details - Radiant: 22:32 -1\u00b0 - ZHR: 50 - Velocity: 40.7 miles/sec (swift - 65.4km/sec) - Parent Object: 1P/Halley\nNext Peak - The eta Aquariids will next peak on the May 5-6, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 84% full.\n***Jul 29-30, 2026\nSouthern delta Aquariids\nNext period of activity: July 18th, 2026 to August 12th, 2026The Delta Aquariids are another strong shower best seen from the southern tropics. North of the equator the radiant is located lower in the southern sky and therefore rates are less than seen from further south. These meteors produce good rates for a week centered on the night of maximum. These are usually faint meteors that lack both persistent trains and fireballs. In 2025, a waxing crescent moon will set before the radiant is high in the sky. Therefore circumstances are favorable for viewing this shower during the morning hours..\nShower details - Radiant: 22:40 -16.4\u00b0 - ZHR: 25 - Velocity: 25 miles/sec (medium - 40km/sec) - Parent Object: 96P/Machholz?\nNext Peak - The Southern delta Aquariids will next peak on the Jul 29-30, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 100% full.\n***Jul 29-30, 2026\nalpha Capricornids\nNext period of activity: July 12th, 2026 to August 12th, 2026The Alpha Capricornids are active from July 12 through August 12 with a \"plateau-like\" maximum centered on July 30th. This shower is not very strong and rarely produces in excess of 5 shower members per hour. What is notable about this shower is the number of bright fireballs produced during its activity period. This shower is seen equally well on either side of the equator.\nShower details - Radiant: 20:22 -9.3\u00b0 - ZHR: 5 - Velocity: 14 miles/sec (slow - 22km/sec) - Parent Object: 169P/NEAT\nNext Peak - The alpha Capricornids will next peak on the Jul 29-30, 2026 night. On this night, the moon will be 100% full.\n***"

      "text": "Perseids Meteor Shower\nThe Perseids meteor shower peaks in mid-August, and is the most popular meteor shower of the year.\nFast Facts\n| Comet of Origin | 109P/Swift-Tuttle |\n| Radiant | Constellation Perseus |\n| Active | July 17 to Aug. 23, 2025 (Peak night: Aug. 12-13) |\n| Observed Under Dark Skies | About 25 meteors per hour |\n| Meteor Velocity | 37 miles (59 km) per second |\nAbout the Meteor Shower\nThe Perseids, which peaks in mid-August, is considered the best meteor shower of the year. With swift and bright meteors, Perseids frequently leave long \"wakes\" of light and color behind them as they streak through Earth's atmosphere. The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour. They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\nPerseids are also known for their fireballs. Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak. This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter, with apparent magnitudes greater than -3.\nViewing Tips\nThe Perseids are best viewed in the Northern Hemisphere during the pre-dawn hours, though at times it is possible to view meteors from this shower as early as 10 p.m.\nWhere Do Meteors Come From?\nMeteors come from leftover comet particles and bits from broken asteroids. When comets come around the Sun, they leave a dusty trail behind them. Every year Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows the bits to collide with our atmosphere and disintegrate to create fiery and colorful streaks in the sky.\nThe Comet\nThe pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the Sun once. It was Giovanni Schiaparelli who realized in 1865 that this comet was the source of the Perseids. Comet Swift-Tuttle last visited the inner solar system in 1992.\nComet Swift-Tuttle was discovered in 1862 by Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle. Swift-Tuttle is a large comet: its nucleus is 16 miles (26 kilometers) across. (This is almost twice the size of the object hypothesized to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs.)\nThe Radiant\nTheir radiant \u2013 the point in the sky from which the Perseids appear to come \u2013 is the constellation Perseus. This is also where we get the name for the shower: Perseids. However, the constellation for which a meteor shower is named only serves to aid viewers in determining which shower they are viewing on a given night. The constellation is not the source of the meteors."

  "argos_summary": "The Perseids meteor shower, peaking from August 12-13, 2025, is one of the most popular and active meteor showers of the year, producing up to 100 meteors per hour under optimal conditions. Originating from the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, the shower runs from July 17 to August 23, making it accessible during warm summer nights. To maximize viewing, it's recommended to escape light pollution and focus on the constellation Perseus, although the nearly full moon may hinder visibility.",
