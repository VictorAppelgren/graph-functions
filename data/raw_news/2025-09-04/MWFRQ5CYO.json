  "description": "President Donald Trump pulled a rabbit out of his trade war hat this week, announcing a trade deal with Japan putting 15% tariffs on most Japanese imports.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump pulled a rabbit out of his trade war hat this week, announcing a trade deal with Japan putting 15% tariffs on most Japanese imports.\n\nThe news came just as U.S. companies put out their second-quarter results, and stocks rose a percentage point to record highs, albeit with help from companies like Alphabet $GOOGL which rose 3% as it beat investors\u2019 expectations.\n\nUnder the terms of the trade deal with Japan, the Asian country will cut its own tariffs on U.S. made cars and allow the importation of U.S. rice, a major culture shock in Japan, where subsidies to small farmers keep a key countryside constituency happy. Stocks rose because the deal eased months of uncertainty, sending Japan-related stocks higher \u2014 Toyota $TM rose 35%.\n\nThe deal also boosted confidence that Trump\u2019s threats of sky-high tariffs will end with something more manageable in other areas. Crucially, investors think the deal with Japan could be a template for Trump\u2019s talks with China and the European Union over the next few weeks.\n\nStill, not every industrial sector was able to shrug off Q2 disruptions from tariffs. General Motors $GM profits fell 35% in the second quarter, as tariffs cut more than $1 billion from its net income. The company warned tariffs will take an even bigger bite next quarter. GM imports roughly half the vehicles it sells in the U.S. Shares dropped 8% on the news. GM, which has risen to the number two electric vehicle seller in the U.S., says it has an \u201cinherent advantage\u201d over Tesla $TSLA because its large variety of models (12 EVs to Tesla\u2019s five) will help it weather changing consumer tastes. Still, GM shares did recover nearly all their losses on the Japan trade deal news.\n\nMeanwhile across the automotive sector, Chrysler parent Stellantis $STLA said Monday tariffs cost it $350 million in profits, but the Japan news helped shares rise over 2%. Volvo, the one-time Swedish carmaker now owned by China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group $GELYF said it faced a one-off $1.2 billion charge from tariffs. Volvo $VLVOF says U.S. car tariffs mean it can\u2019t sell the Chinese-made Volvo ES90 EV sedan at a profit here.\n\nJeffries economist Mohit Kumar put a brave face on the apparent result in a comment to Reuters. \u201cWhile negative from a macro point of view, the world can live with 15% or so tariffs,\u201d he said, in a remark which may throw light on the ultimate goal or strategy behind the Trump administration\u2019s broader trade talks.\n\u2022 On track: Union Pacific Railroad $UNP (whose market cap is $140 billion) is in talks to buy smaller rival Norfolk Southern $NSC (which is only worth a lowly $60 billion), to create the country\u2019s largest railroad. A combined railroad would be the only U.S. railroad today to have a network of track and trains spanning the U.S. from coast to coast. That could cut delays and lower freight costs. If the deal wins nods from regulators and unions, it could be the largest M&A deal in the U.S. this year.\n\u2022 From big oil to bigger oil: Chevron $CVX says it\u2019s completed its $53 billion purchase of smaller oil major Hess $HES after prevailing against ExxonMobil $XOM in a dispute over offshore oil assets in South America. Exxon, which owns 45% of the oil rights off Guyana, to Hess\u2019 30%, said it had first refusal rights when Hess decided to sell. But an international arbitration ruled in Chevron\u2019s favor.\n\u2022 Steel sticker shock: Tariffs on U.S. markets are having one effect economists predicted they might: Seeing higher prices on imported goods like steel, U.S. manufacturers of those goods have raised their own prices. Two of the largest U.S. steelmakers, Cleveland-Cliffs $CLF and Steel Dynamics $STLD said they\u2019d raised prices in the second quarter, as tariffs on imported steel jumped from 25% to 50%. \u201cYou always see that as one of the traps of a tariff,\u201d John O\u2019Leary, CEO of Daimler Truck North America told the New York Times. American steel makers, he said, now have \u201cmore headroom to be able to raise the price.\u201d\n\u2022 Softbank\u2019s AI troubles: Six months after Softbank chair Masayoshi Son and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman stood with President Trump to announce Stargate, a $500 billion AI effort, the group has yet to complete a deal for building an AI data center.\n\u2022 Amazon\u2019s price hikes: A deep dive by the Wall Street Journal found that Amazon $AMZN has been hiking prices on thousands of low-cost products, like canned soup and deodorant, even before the tariffs kick in. A can of Campbell\u2019s Chunky Clam Chowder rose 30% on Amazon, and a dispenser of Visine eye drops rose 73% between Jan. 20 and July 1, the paper found. \u201cAmazon cut prices on expensive items while raising them on cheap goods \u2014 small increases that could add up,\u201d the Journal reported. Amazon said the Journal was wrong.\n\nWhat do you think of Big Business This Week? Tell us how you really feel in this survey!\n\u2022 Meme stocks are back: Debt-ridden, Amazon-challenged, fading mall anchor Kohl\u2019s $KSS , whose stock is down 40% in the past 12 months, shot up an astonishing 85% in the wee hours earlier this week, as meme stock buyers focused on the company. Other meme stocks are rising, too, despite challenging market fundamentals.\n\u2022 Time to join Chocaholics Anonymous? Hershey $HSY says it\u2019s raising the cost of candy bars as bad weather, plant disease, and climate change push up the price of cocoa. Prices for the processed bean hit $12,000 a ton in December, and have now dropped back to $8,100, but poor conditions in West Africa, source of 70% of the world\u2019s cocoa, mean prices are going back up again. Hershey\u2019s wholesale prices will rise as much as 20%, but the company promises to keep the retail price of that sweet, brown, sticky stuff below $4 a bar.\n\u2022 Even death doesn\u2019t wipe out your debts: That\u2019s the sad news for the family of the late Mike Lynch, the British tech tycoon who tragically died with his 18-year-old daughter when Lynch\u2019s refitted super yacht capsized and sank last year in a freak storm off the coast of Sicily. Lynch had been celebrating his acquittal in a U.S. fraud trial for allegedly hoodwinking Hewlett-Packard Enterprise $HPE out of billions of dollars with inaccurate financials when he sold it for $11 billion in 2011. But now a British court says Lynch and a former business partner do in fact owe HPE more than 700 million pounds ($945 million) for cooking the books. That would wipe out Lynch\u2019s family fortune.\n\u2022 Smoothie operator: Generous Brands, a low-profile private equity group that owns smoothie-maker Sambazon and Evolution Fresh juices, says it\u2019s following its gut and has agreed to buy canned Kombucha brand Health-Ade for a healthy $500 million from PE investors First Bev and Manna Tree Partners. Consumers are increasingly turning to healthier beverages and big food has been getting in on the game. In March, Pepsico $PEP agreed to buy Poppi, a brand of probiotic sodas, for $2 billion.\n\nGet Big Business This Week in your inbox every week\u2014and read it before everybody else! Sign up today.\n\u2022 TESLA\u2019s income drops 16% \u2014 In yet another quarter of steep decline, Tesla $TSLA saw net income drop to $1.17 billion from $1.4 billion a year earlier. Revenue fell 12%. Tesla\u2019s income from selling clean energy credits to other carmakers fell by more than half from a year earlier to $439 million. Musk\u2019s flagship business is facing a triple hurdle: Tesla still has no new models, former ally Donald Trump\u2019s bill cut the $7,500 tax credit for new EV sales, and Elon\u2019s support of right-wing politicians is driving away the eco-friendly drivers most likely to buy EVs. The company\u2019s shares are now down 21% since Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\u2022 AI is expensive: That\u2019s what Musk is finding out as his xAI project struggles to keep up with its well-funded rivals. As Microsoft $MSFT, Facebook parent Meta $META and OpenAI announce plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on AI systems, Musk is rushing to raise similar amounts. Just weeks after raising $10 billion through sales of debt and a private stock issue, Musk is working with Antonio Gracias and his Valor Equity Partners to raise $12 billion, theWall Street Journal reports. The money would go to buy more Nvidia chips that would be leased to xAI.\n\u2022 AI and fraud risks for banks: With crypto and AI firms hoping to get into the financial services, and existing big banks and trading houses hoping to wind down some of the rules meant to prevent a repeat of the 2008 market meltdown, Fed chair Jerome Powell convened a conference this week to chew it all over. No decisions have been made yet, but one surprise came from OpenAI founder Sam Altman, who warned the bankers that AI could supercharge fraud.\n\u2022 Powell keeps his job: Trump seems to have backed off his threat to fire Powell, apparently after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Trump that pink-slipping Powell would only cause turmoil and raise rates. Powell has already said it\u2019s likely he will cut rates this year, and in any case his term ends next year, so why rush it. \u201cI think he\u2019s done a bad job, but he\u2019s going to be out pretty soon anyway,\u201d Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cEight months, he\u2019ll be out.\u201d It probably didn\u2019t hurt that America\u2019s most important financier, JP Morgan Chase $JPM CEO Jamie Dimon, warned publicly against messing with Powell: \u201cI think the independence of the Fed is absolutely critical,\u201d Dimon told journalists last week. \u201cPlaying around with the Fed can have adverse consequences, the absolute opposite of what you might be hoping for.\u201d\n\u2022 On air, or out of thin air? After winning a $16 million settlement from CBS owner Paramount $PARA A for alleged harm he claimed he suffered from a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris (who lost the 2024 presidential election to him), Trump now claims he has secured another $20 million in free ads and public service messages from CBS. Paramount, which is hoping to win government approval for a sale to Skydance, a movie studio owned by the son of Trump ally and Oracle $ORCL L founder Larry Ellison. Showbiz news site Variety reports that CBS, Skydance, and Trump\u2019s own lawyers have all said there\u2019s no side deal with free ads for Trump. Meanwhile, CBS cancelled Colbert\u2019s late night show last week, much to Trump\u2019s delight.\n\u2022 Murdoch feud deepens over the Journal\u2019s Epstein reporting: Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, after the paper published a story about a licentious letter allegedly written by Trump to his then-friend, convicted sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Trump denies writing the illustrated letter and says he never makes drawings, although some of Trump\u2019s artwork has been sold at charity auctions. Lawyers say it\u2019s unlikely Trump could win such a huge verdict, but Murdoch entities have a history of settling charges for large payouts: Fox News paid the Dominion voting machine company $787.5 million in 2023 for alleging the machines had switched votes from Trump to Joe Biden in 2020. Fox also paid tens of millions of dollars over sexual harassment claims against former host Bill O\u2019Reilly. But the bigger question here is whether taking on Trump will shake one of Murdoch\u2019s biggest revenue streams: the eyeballs of MAGA supporters on Fox News. Shares of Murdoch\u2019s News Corp $NWSA have dropped about 1% since Trump\u2019s lawsuit was filed. The Wall Street Journal has said it stands by its reporting and dropped another bombshell on Wednesday afternoon, reporting that Attorney General Pam Bondi had told Trump his name was in the Epstein Files in the spring \u2014 something Trump later denied to reporters.\n\u2022 Astra-nomical: British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca $AZN says it will invest $50 billion in the U.S. by 2030, as it joins other pharma firms hoping to block President Trump\u2019s threat of 200% percent tariffs on imported drugs.\n\u2022 Netflix and Zoom! Revenue at everyone\u2019s favorite streamer rose 16% from a year earlier in the second quarter to $11 billion, and profits jumped 46% to $3.1 billion. Netflix $NFLX credited a growing number of subscribers, higher subscription prices, and more ad sales.\n\u2022 Switcheroo: Juul got FDA approval to keep selling its e-cigarettes, having convinced the Trump Administration\u2019s FDA that more adults switching from cigarettes to e-cigs (mini-vapers) outweighed the concern that its smokeless, flavored vapes are luring kids into lifelong nicotine habits. Some surveys show vaping by high schoolers has dropped from 27% in 2019 to 8% in 2024. Altria $MO , the company once known as Philip Morris, bought a 35% stake in Juul, and later swapped it for the rights to Juul\u2019s smokeless tobacco patents.\n\nYou\u2019re clearly into smart people talking about even smarter things.

      "text": "Bill O\u2019Reilly, the Fox News commentator who was forced to resign in April, agreed to a $32m sexual harassment settlement in January which the network\u2019s parent knew about when it gave him a new contract the next month, the New York Times reported on Saturday.\nThe previously undisclosed agreement, at least the sixth involving O\u2019Reilly or the company related to harassment charges against him, was \u201cextraordinarily large\u201d for such cases, according to the newspaper, which cited two people \u201cbriefed on the matter\u201d.\n21st Century Fox acknowledged it had been aware of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s settlement with Lis Wiehl, a former Fox News legal analyst, when it signed a contract extension with the O\u2019Reilly Factor host in February.\nIn a statement emailed by spokesman Nathaniel Brown, the company said it \u201cwas informed by Mr O\u2019Reilly that he had settled the matter personally, on financial terms that he and Ms Wiehl had agreed were confidential and not disclosed to the company\u201d.\nNeither O\u2019Reilly or Wiehl could be reached immediately for comment. The Times reported O\u2019Reilly as saying there was no merit to any of the allegations against him and adding: \u201cI never mistreated anyone.\u201d\nAccording to the Times, Rupert Murdoch and his two sons, Lachlan and James, as top executives of 21st Century Fox, decided in January to retain O\u2019Reilly despite being made aware of the fresh complaints. The next month, the company gave O\u2019Reilly a contract extension worth $25m a year.\nThe disclosures follow allegations reported earlier this month by the New York Times and the New Yorker that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted a number of women in incidents dating back to the 1980s. Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations and Weinstein, 65, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.\nThe Weinstein allegations have set off a wave of anger and soul-searching over the issue of sexual harassment and assault. Millions of women have shared their experiences, using the hashtag #MeToo on Twitter and with rolling posts on Facebook.\n21st Century Fox said on Saturday it had added language to the new contract related to harassment, stipulating that O\u2019Reilly faced dismissal if fresh allegations emerged or new information about existing allegations came to light. In April, after advertisers began to flee O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, the company ended the commentator\u2019s two-decade Fox News career.\nIn its statement on Saturday, 21st Century said it acted in April \u201cbased on the terms of this contract\u201d, referring to the deal signed in February.\nThe Times reported on 1 April that Fox or O\u2019Reilly had paid five women a total of $13m to settle harassment claims, before news of the sixth deal emerged. The women either worked for the host or appeared as guests on his program, the paper reported.\nO\u2019Reilly said in a statement at the time that he had settled only to spare his children from the controversy.\nThe O\u2019Reilly Factor was the top-rated show on Fox News. According to ad-tracking firm Kantar Media, it brought in $147.13m in advertising revenue in 2016.\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s exit followed the departure of former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes. He was forced to resign in July 2016 after being accused of sexual misconduct by a number of women including former anchor Gretchen Carlson. Ailes, who died in May, repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\u201c21st Century Fox has taken concerted action to transform Fox News,\u201d the company said on Saturday. Those steps include \u201cinstalling new leadership, overhauling management and on-air talent, expanding training, and increasing the channels through which employees can report harassment or discrimination\u201d."

(Skydance declined to comment.) Paramount has said that its settlement with Trump \u2014 under which it paid $16 million, most of which will go to his future presidential library \u2014 \u201cdoes not include PSAs or anything related to PSAs. Paramount has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties.\u201d The statement from Trump\u2019s legal team about the Paramount settlement issued July 1 did not include any references to advertising or PSAs as part of the agreement.\nBut Trump now claims the settlement over his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d lawsuit is worth \u201cover $36 million\u201d in total. Earlier this month, he told reporters that the settlement was worth \u201clike $32 [million] to maybe $35 million.\u201d A New York Post report published July 2 claimed that Skydance CEO David Ellison had agreed to a \u201csecret side deal\u201d with Trump agreeing to provide an additional $15 million-$20 million worth of ads that \u201csupport conservative causes supported by President Trump.\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nTrump, Paramount and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr have each claimed the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d settlement is unrelated to the administration\u2019s approval of Skydance\u2019s pending $8 billion takeover of Paramount.\nOn Tuesday, lawyers for Paramount and Trump officially entered a joint stipulation of dismissal of Trump\u2019s lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The settlement agreement \u201cdoes not include a statement of apology or regret,\u201d per Paramount.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, regarding Trump\u2019s claim he is getting an extra $20 million in advertising from Skydance, said in a post on X, \u201cThis reeks of corruption.\u201d She previously characterized the Paramount/CBS settlement with Trump as \u201cbribery\u201d and called for an investigation into \u201cwhether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken.\u201d\nOn Monday, Warren and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Skydance\u2019s Ellison, asking whether Skydance and Trump had a \u201csecret side deal\u201d apart from the Paramount settlement \u2014 and whether Skydance had anything to do with CBS\u2019s cancelation of \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\u201cAre we still supposed to believe that canceling Colbert\u2019s show on CBS was \u2018purely a financial decision\u2019?\u201d she said Tuesday.\nHere\u2019s Trump\u2019s full comment, posted on Truth Social Tuesday: \u201cBREAKING NEWS! We have just achieved a BIG AND IMPORTANT WIN in our Historic Lawsuit against 60 Minutes, CBS, and Paramount. Just like ABC and George Slopadopoulos, CBS and its Corporate Owners knew that they defrauded the American People, and were desperate to settle. Paramount/CBS/60 Minutes have today paid $16 Million Dollars in settlement, and we also anticipate receiving $20 Million Dollars more from the new Owners, in Advertising, PSAs, or similar Programming, for a total of over $36 Million Dollars. This is another in a long line of VICTORIES over the Fake News Media, who we are holding to account for their widespread fraud and deceit. The Wall Street Journal, The Failing New York Times, The Washington Post, MSDNC, CNN, and all other Mainstream Media Liars, are ON NOTICE that the days of them being allowed to deceive the American People are OVER. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d"

      "text": "President Donald Trump pulled a rabbit out of his trade war hat this week, announcing a trade deal with Japan putting 15% tariffs on most Japanese imports.\nThe news came just as U.S. companies put out their second-quarter results, and stocks rose a percentage point to record highs, albeit with help from companies like Alphabet $GOOGL which rose 3% as it beat investors\u2019 expectations.\nUnder the terms of the trade deal with Japan, the Asian country will cut its own tariffs on U.S. made cars and allow the importation of U.S. rice, a major culture shock in Japan, where subsidies to small farmers keep a key countryside constituency happy. Stocks rose because the deal eased months of uncertainty, sending Japan-related stocks higher \u2014 Toyota $TM rose 35%.\nThe deal also boosted confidence that Trump\u2019s threats of sky-high tariffs will end with something more manageable in other areas. Crucially, investors think the deal with Japan could be a template for Trump\u2019s talks with China and the European Union over the next few weeks.\nStill, not every industrial sector was able to shrug off Q2 disruptions from tariffs. General Motors $GM profits fell 35% in the second quarter, as tariffs cut more than $1 billion from its net income. The company warned tariffs will take an even bigger bite next quarter. GM imports roughly half the vehicles it sells in the U.S. Shares dropped 8% on the news. GM, which has risen to the number two electric vehicle seller in the U.S., says it has an \u201cinherent advantage\u201d over Tesla $TSLA because its large variety of models (12 EVs to Tesla\u2019s five) will help it weather changing consumer tastes. Still, GM shares did recover nearly all their losses on the Japan trade deal news.\nMeanwhile across the automotive sector, Chrysler parent Stellantis $STLA said Monday tariffs cost it $350 million in profits, but the Japan news helped shares rise over 2%. Volvo, the one-time Swedish carmaker now owned by China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group $GELYF said it faced a one-off $1.2 billion charge from tariffs. Volvo $VLVOF says U.S. car tariffs mean it can\u2019t sell the Chinese-made Volvo ES90 EV sedan at a profit here.\nJeffries economist Mohit Kumar put a brave face on the apparent result in a comment to Reuters. \u201cWhile negative from a macro point of view, the world can live with 15% or so tariffs,\u201d he said, in a remark which may throw light on the ultimate goal or strategy behind the Trump administration\u2019s broader trade talks.\n\u2014Peter S. Green\nWatch Big Business This Week on Cheddar\u2014and YouTube!\nThe usual suspects\n- On track: Union Pacific Railroad $UNP (whose market cap is $140 billion) is in talks to buy smaller rival Norfolk Southern $NSC (which is only worth a lowly $60 billion), to create the country\u2019s largest railroad. A combined railroad would be the only U.S. railroad today to have a network of track and trains spanning the U.S. from coast to coast. That could cut delays and lower freight costs. If the deal wins nods from regulators and unions, it could be the largest M&A deal in the U.S. this year.\n- From big oil to bigger oil: Chevron $CVX says it\u2019s completed its $53 billion purchase of smaller oil major Hess $HES after prevailing against ExxonMobil $XOM in a dispute over offshore oil assets in South America. Exxon, which owns 45% of the oil rights off Guyana, to Hess\u2019 30%, said it had first refusal rights when Hess decided to sell. But an international arbitration ruled in Chevron\u2019s favor.\n- Steel sticker shock: Tariffs on U.S. markets are having one effect economists predicted they might: Seeing higher prices on imported goods like steel, U.S. manufacturers of those goods have raised their own prices. Two of the largest U.S. steelmakers, Cleveland-Cliffs $CLF and Steel Dynamics $STLD said they\u2019d raised prices in the second quarter, as tariffs on imported steel jumped from 25% to 50%. \u201cYou always see that as one of the traps of a tariff,\u201d John O\u2019Leary, CEO of Daimler Truck North America told the New York Times. American steel makers, he said, now have \u201cmore headroom to be able to raise the price.\u201d\n- Softbank\u2019s AI troubles: Six months after Softbank chair Masayoshi Son and OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman stood with President Trump to announce Stargate, a $500 billion AI effort, the group has yet to complete a deal for building an AI data center.\n- Amazon\u2019s price hikes: A deep dive by the Wall Street Journal found that Amazon $AMZN has been hiking prices on thousands of low-cost products, like canned soup and deodorant, even before the tariffs kick in. A can of Campbell\u2019s Chunky Clam Chowder rose 30% on Amazon, and a dispenser of Visine eye drops rose 73% between Jan. 20 and July 1, the paper found. \u201cAmazon cut prices on expensive items while raising them on cheap goods \u2014 small increases that could add up,\u201d the Journal reported. Amazon said the Journal was wrong.\nWhat do you think of Big Business This Week? Tell us how you really feel in this survey!\nThe short stack\n- Meme stocks are back: Debt-ridden, Amazon-challenged, fading mall anchor Kohl\u2019s $KSS , whose stock is down 40% in the past 12 months, shot up an astonishing 85% in the wee hours earlier this week, as meme stock buyers focused on the company. Other meme stocks are rising, too, despite challenging market fundamentals.\n- Time to join Chocaholics Anonymous? Hershey $HSY says it\u2019s raising the cost of candy bars as bad weather, plant disease, and climate change push up the price of cocoa. Prices for the processed bean hit $12,000 a ton in December, and have now dropped back to $8,100, but poor conditions in West Africa, source of 70% of the world\u2019s cocoa, mean prices are going back up again. Hershey\u2019s wholesale prices will rise as much as 20%, but the company promises to keep the retail price of that sweet, brown, sticky stuff below $4 a bar.\n- Even death doesn\u2019t wipe out your debts: That\u2019s the sad news for the family of the late Mike Lynch, the British tech tycoon who tragically died with his 18-year-old daughter when Lynch\u2019s refitted super yacht capsized and sank last year in a freak storm off the coast of Sicily. Lynch had been celebrating his acquittal in a U.S. fraud trial for allegedly hoodwinking Hewlett-Packard Enterprise $HPE out of billions of dollars with inaccurate financials when he sold it for $11 billion in 2011. But now a British court says Lynch and a former business partner do in fact owe HPE more than 700 million pounds ($945 million) for cooking the books. That would wipe out Lynch\u2019s family fortune.\n- Smoothie operator: Generous Brands, a low-profile private equity group that owns smoothie-maker Sambazon and Evolution Fresh juices, says it\u2019s following its gut and has agreed to buy canned Kombucha brand Health-Ade for a healthy $500 million from PE investors First Bev and Manna Tree Partners. Consumers are increasingly turning to healthier beverages and big food has been getting in on the game. In March, Pepsico $PEP agreed to buy Poppi, a brand of probiotic sodas, for $2 billion.\nGet Big Business This Week in your inbox every week\u2014and read it before everybody else! Sign up today.\nElon\u2019s world\n- TESLA\u2019s income drops 16% \u2014 In yet another quarter of steep decline, Tesla $TSLA saw net income drop to $1.17 billion from $1.4 billion a year earlier. Revenue fell 12%. Tesla\u2019s income from selling clean energy credits to other carmakers fell by more than half from a year earlier to $439 million. Musk\u2019s flagship business is facing a triple hurdle: Tesla still has no new models, former ally Donald Trump\u2019s bill cut the $7,500 tax credit for new EV sales, and Elon\u2019s support of right-wing politicians is driving away the eco-friendly drivers most likely to buy EVs. The company\u2019s shares are now down 21% since Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n- AI is expensive: That\u2019s what Musk is finding out as his xAI project struggles to keep up with its well-funded rivals. As Microsoft $MSFT, Facebook parent Meta $META and OpenAI announce plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on AI systems, Musk is rushing to raise similar amounts. Just weeks after raising $10 billion through sales of debt and a private stock issue, Musk is working with Antonio Gracias and his Valor Equity Partners to raise $12 billion, theWall Street Journal reports. The money would go to buy more Nvidia chips that would be leased to xAI.\nTrumplandia\n- AI and fraud risks for banks: With crypto and AI firms hoping to get into the financial services, and existing big banks and trading houses hoping to wind down some of the rules meant to prevent a repeat of the 2008 market meltdown, Fed chair Jerome Powell convened a conference this week to chew it all over. No decisions have been made yet, but one surprise came from OpenAI founder Sam Altman, who warned the bankers that AI could supercharge fraud.\n- Powell keeps his job: Trump seems to have backed off his threat to fire Powell, apparently after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned Trump that pink-slipping Powell would only cause turmoil and raise rates. Powell has already said it\u2019s likely he will cut rates this year, and in any case his term ends next year, so why rush it. \u201cI think he\u2019s done a bad job, but he\u2019s going to be out pretty soon anyway,\u201d Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cEight months, he\u2019ll be out.\u201d It probably didn\u2019t hurt that America\u2019s most important financier, JP Morgan Chase $JPM CEO Jamie Dimon, warned publicly against messing with Powell: \u201cI think the independence of the Fed is absolutely critical,\u201d Dimon told journalists last week. \u201cPlaying around with the Fed can have adverse consequences, the absolute opposite of what you might be hoping for.\u201d\n- On air, or out of thin air? After winning a $16 million settlement from CBS owner Paramount $PARA A for alleged harm he claimed he suffered from a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris (who lost the 2024 presidential election to him), Trump now claims he has secured another $20 million in free ads and public service messages from CBS. Paramount, which is hoping to win government approval for a sale to Skydance, a movie studio owned by the son of Trump ally and Oracle $ORCL L founder Larry Ellison. Showbiz news site Variety reports that CBS, Skydance, and Trump\u2019s own lawyers have all said there\u2019s no side deal with free ads for Trump. Meanwhile, CBS cancelled Colbert\u2019s late night show last week, much to Trump\u2019s delight.\n- Murdoch feud deepens over the Journal\u2019s Epstein reporting: Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, after the paper published a story about a licentious letter allegedly written by Trump to his then-friend, convicted sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Trump denies writing the illustrated letter and says he never makes drawings, although some of Trump\u2019s artwork has been sold at charity auctions. Lawyers say it\u2019s unlikely Trump could win such a huge verdict, but Murdoch entities have a history of settling charges for large payouts: Fox News paid the Dominion voting machine company $787.5 million in 2023 for alleging the machines had switched votes from Trump to Joe Biden in 2020. Fox also paid tens of millions of dollars over sexual harassment claims against former host Bill O\u2019Reilly. But the bigger question here is whether taking on Trump will shake one of Murdoch\u2019s biggest revenue streams: the eyeballs of MAGA supporters on Fox News. Shares of Murdoch\u2019s News Corp $NWSA have dropped about 1% since Trump\u2019s lawsuit was filed. The Wall Street Journal has said it stands by its reporting and dropped another bombshell on Wednesday afternoon, reporting that Attorney General Pam Bondi had told Trump his name was in the Epstein Files in the spring \u2014 something Trump later denied to reporters.\n- Astra-nomical: British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca $AZN says it will invest $50 billion in the U.S. by 2030, as it joins other pharma firms hoping to block President Trump\u2019s threat of 200% percent tariffs on imported drugs.\n- Netflix and Zoom! Revenue at everyone\u2019s favorite streamer rose 16% from a year earlier in the second quarter to $11 billion, and profits jumped 46% to $3.1 billion. Netflix $NFLX credited a growing number of subscribers, higher subscription prices, and more ad sales.\n- Switcheroo: Juul got FDA approval to keep selling its e-cigarettes, having convinced the Trump Administration\u2019s FDA that more adults switching from cigarettes to e-cigs (mini-vapers) outweighed the concern that its smokeless, flavored vapes are luring kids into lifelong nicotine habits. Some surveys show vaping by high schoolers has dropped from 27% in 2019 to 8% in 2024. Altria $MO , the company once known as Philip Morris, bought a 35% stake in Juul, and later swapped it for the rights to Juul\u2019s smokeless tobacco patents.\nWant more Cheddar?\nYou\u2019re clearly into smart people talking about even smarter things.
