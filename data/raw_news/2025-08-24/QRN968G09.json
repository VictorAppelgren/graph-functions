  "description": "Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s seventh studio album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d and Marvel\u2019s \u201cThunderbolts*\u201d starring Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan are some of the new television, films, music and games headed to a device near you",
  "content": "Sabrina Carpenter's seventh studio album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d and Marvel\u2019s \u201cThunderbolts(asterisk)\u201d starring Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan are some of the new television, films, music and games headed to a device near you.\n\nAlso among the streaming offerings worth your time, as selected by The Associated Press\u2019 entertainment journalists: Some of the West\u2019s biggest musicians are getting the K-pop treatment in the TV series \u201cKPopped,\u201d video game maker Sega tries to revive the Shinobi franchise and there's Season 2 of \u201cWith Love, Meghan,\u201d a lifestyle series from the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nNew movies to stream from Aug. 25-31\n\n\u2014 Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cThunderbolts(asterisk)\u201d didn\u2019t make quite the mark in theaters that many expected it to, but the Jake Schreier-directed film was still one of the most acclaimed MCU releases in years. After hitting theaters in early May, \u201cThunderbolts(asterisk)\u201d begins streaming Wednesday on Disney+. With an ensemble including Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell and David Harbour, it follows a gang of ragtag superheroes who reluctantly come together as a team. In my review, I praised it as a return to form for Marvel and \u201can IMAX-sized platform for the increasingly obvious movie-star talents of Florence Pugh.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley and Celia Imrie play elderly amateur sleuths in Chris Columbus\u2019 \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d (Netflix, Thursday). In the film, based on Richard Osman\u2019s 2020 novel, the group attempts to solve a crime from their seniors\u2019 residence, Coopers Chase. Expect a cozy murder mystery, with mature star power.\n\n\u2014 Scott McGehee and David Siegel\u2019s \u201cThe Friend\u201d (Monday on Paramount+) stars Naomi Watts as a New York writer who reluctantly inherits the dog of her deceased mentor (Bill Murray). The dog isn\u2019t just any dog, either, but a mammoth Great Dane named Apollo. The adaptation of Sigrid Nunez\u2019s National Book Award-winning novel is very much a dog movie, but it\u2019s also one about processing grief. In her review, AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr called it \u201cone of those movies people complain they don\u2019t make anymore, although its existence is a reminder that they do still make \u2018them,\u2019 meaning smart, emotionally authentic stories about people who seem real.\u201d\n\nNew music to stream from Aug. 25-31\n\n\u2014 Who's a good girl? Sabrina Carpenter hopes to be when she releases her seventh studio album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend.\u201d It will drop almost exactly a year after she released breakthrough album \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Carpenter has been enlisting a golden retriever puppy and fans to unveil her tracklist on social media. The lead single, \u201cManchild,\u201d hit No. 1 on the charts in June.\n\n\u2014 If you needed a sign of the growing clout of Blood Orange, look no further than the extensive collaborators on his upcoming fifth album, \u201cEssex Honey.\u201d There's Lorde, Caroline Polachek, Daniel Caesar, Mustafa, Turnstile\u2019s Brendan Yates, Tariq Al-Sabir, Wet\u2019s Kelly Zutrau and the actors Naomi Scott and Amandla Stenberg. He even convinced author Zadie Smith to sing. Blood Orange (aka songwriter Dev Hynes, who combines R&B, pop, electronica, indie and funk) says he's exploring his childhood in Essex, England, and calls it a \u201csoundtrack created from a dreamscape of a journey working through grief.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Stans of stans, unite. \u201cStans,\u201d the Marshall Mathers-produced documentary about a cast of superfans of Eminem, directed by Steven Leckart, will debut on Paramount+ on Tuesday. Eminem named the phenomenon 25 years ago with the release of his song \u201cStan\u201d about an obsessive fan, which prompted the Oxford English Dictionary to eventually add the term. The film \"offers a raw, loud and revealing journey across Eminem\u2019s career \u2014 and the passionate audience that has grown with him.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Apple TV+ has a new music competition series featuring iconic songs by some of the world\u2019s biggest Western pop stars as they get the K-pop treatment. \u201cKPopped\u201d features K-pop groups ITZY, JO1, Kiss of Life, Blackswan, STAYC, KEP1ER, Ateez and Billlie teamed up with Western artists like Meg, Kesha, Patti Labelle, Kylie Minogue, the Spice Girls\u2019 Mel B and Emma Bunton, Vanilla Ice, Taylor Dayne, Eve, J Balvin, Ava Max, Boyz II Men, Boy George, TLC and Jess Glynne. Together, offer new spins on classic songs like \u201cIce Ice Baby,\u201d \u201cLady Marmalade,\u201d \u201cWaterfalls,\u201d \u201cMotownphilly\u201d and \u201cKarma Chameleon.\u201d All eight episodes stream Friday, Aug. 29.\n\nNew series to stream from Aug. 25-31\n\n\u2014 The sci-fi comedy \"Upload\" hits Prime Video on Monday for its fourth and final season. Starring Robbie Amell, the series takes place in the not-too-distant future where humans can pay to upload their mind to a virtual afterlife when they die. Amell's Nathan uploads in the first episode and ends up falling for Nora, a human concierge assigned to help his transition go smoothly. Talk about a long-distance relationship! Created by Greg Daniels, who also created \u201cThe Office,\u201d the show deals with themes of class and ethics in technology. Daniels has said he came up with the idea in the late 1980s. It's fascinating to think that his \u201cwhat if\u201d is now, maybe, conceivable?\n\n\u2014 \u201cMy Funeral\u201d is a new Icelandic dark comedy about a man who on the same day as his retirement, a cantankerous man learns he has a incurable brain tumor, and decides to host his own funeral. \u201cMy Funeral\u201d premieres Tuesday on MhZ Choice, a streaming service for international titles.\n\n\u2014 More flower sprinkles! Season 2 of \u201cWith Love, Meghan,\u201d a lifestyle series from the Duchess of Sussex arrives on Netflix on Tuesday. The new episodes feature celebs like Chrissy Teigen, Tan France and chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who visit the former actor living well in Montecito. In the trailer, we see Meghan make cocktails, bake thumbprint cookies with fresh preserves, and roast s'mores. Recently it was announced that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, have extended their deal with Netflix.\n\n\u2014 Prime Video's \u201cThe Terminal List\u201d rewinds with a new prequel series starring Taylor Kitsch's Navy SEAL-turned CIA operative. \u201cThe Terminal List: Dark Wolf\u201d debuts Wednesday. Chris Pratt (who is also working on a second season of the original) also reprises his character. The franchise is based on books by Jack Carr.\n\n\u2014 Thanks to celebrities like Halle Berry and Naomi Watts, menopause has become a more mainstream topic in recent years and a new comedy pokes fun at a woman's journey through what grandma used to call \u201cthe change\u201d or \u201cthe change of life.\u201d \u201cMiddlehood\u201d stars Elena Wohl as a woman going through a bit of a midlife crisis as she deals aging. The eight-episode series premieres on YouTube beginning Wednesday.\n\n\u2014 For those hooked on the love triangle between Belly and brothers Jeremiah and Conrad in Prime Video's \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty,\u201d Netflix has a returning title to offer. Season two of \u201cMy Life with the Walter Boys\u201d arrives on the streamer on Thursday. It follows a teen who moves in with family friends after her parents die and finds herself torn between two brothers. \u201cWalter Boys\u201d is based on a book by Ali Novak that was first published on Wattpad.\n\nNew video games to play from Aug. 25-31\n\n\u2014 The Knightling is hardly your typical dragon slayer \u2014 for starters, he doesn\u2019t even have a sword. He does, however, have a magic shield that he can ride, kind of like a flying saucer. That\u2019s enough to get him around the exotic land of Clesseia as he searches for the legendary Sir Lionstone. His adventure, from Dutch studio Twirlbound, mixes exploration, puzzles and combat across a vast open world, and its colorful animation is reminiscent of the classic Sly Cooper series. The journey begins Thursday on PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.\n\n\u2014 Joe Musashi, on the other hand, has a full assortment of ninja weaponry, including a katana, shuriken and martial arts skills. Joe is the star of Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, Sega\u2019s attempt to revive a franchise that debuted in the arcades back in 1987. The original was a straightforward hack-and-slash, but the reboot offers more parkour challenges across a wide-ranging 2D maze that\u2019s packed with secrets. Fans will also be thrilled to see the return of Yamato, a dog that can transform into a creature big enough to carry Joe out of trouble. Shinobi returns Friday, Aug. 29, on PlayStation 5/4, Xbox X/S/One, Switch and PC.",
