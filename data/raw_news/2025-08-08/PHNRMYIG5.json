  "title": "Dylan Raiola enters Year 2 to less fanfare, but is Nebraska\u2019s QB poised to break out?",
  "description": "After a rocky freshman year, Dylan Raiola enters 2025 as Nebraska\u2019s leader by turning hard lessons into fuel for the Huskers resurgence.",
  "content": "LINCOLN, Neb. \u2014 The odd-couple award inside the Nebraska football program goes to John Butler and Dylan Raiola.\n\nButler is the first-year defensive coordinator whose just-under-the-surface intensity demands attention. Matt Rhule, who plucked Butler last year to direct the Huskers\u2019 secondary after his 10 years in the NFL, said he\u2019s the most competitive person with whom he has worked.\n\nRaiola is the 20-year-old quarterback, set to enter his second season as the Nebraska starter after he shattered freshman records last year at the school for completion percentage and passing yardage. He gives no indication that he\u2019s aware of critics who\u2019d rather mock his headband or his warm-up routine than assess Raiola\u2019s throwing dynamics.\n\nWhen Raiola enters the practice environment, a laid-back exterior opens to reveal an inner fire and thirst to better his game. It is here that he struck a kinship in the early practices of the spring with Butler, who spent six seasons before 2024 with the Buffalo Bills.\n\n\u201cHe came from the league,\u201d Raiola said. \u201cHe knows what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cA constant dialogue,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI don\u2019t initiate it because I\u2019m coaching on defense. But if he\u2019s coming to me with a question, I\u2019ll tell him. There\u2019s no secrets.\u201d\n\nThe Raiola storyline during this offseason that mattered to Rhule and to offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen did not involve anything that drove public awareness around the former five-star prospect. You\u2019ll hear no talk internally about Raiola\u2019s mimicry of Patrick Mahomes or of the apparent dismissal in national conversations of the traits that led Ohio State, Georgia and USC to prioritize their pursuit of Raiola out of high school two years ago.\n\nWhat captivates the Huskers about him? Raiola\u2019s desires to learn and to lead. It is perhaps most on display in how Raiola goes out of his way to match wits with the 52-year-old Butler.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 thing that impresses me about him is his curiosity for football, which is not common,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThat\u2019s very uncommon for all players.\u201d\n\nThe coordinator threw exotic looks at Raiola in offseason drills. The more complexities that the defenders showed the QB, the more engaged Raiola grew in trying to learn from Butler.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a competitive balance for me, where I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, I don\u2019t really want to be messing with the quarterback, but I want to be able to teach our own defense about what he\u2019s seeing,\u201d Butler said.\n\n\u201cHaving been around Josh Allen for a good bit and having competed against guys like (Tom) Brady for a long time, I think that willingness to try to figure it out, that willingness to be like, \u2018I want to know the answers to the test if I can, based on how everything\u2019s put together,\u2019 that\u2019s an elite trait of his.\u201d\n\nButler said he talks often with his defensive players about \u201cexpanding their football brain,\u201d a tactic at which Raiola sets the standard, according to Nebraska coaches and teammates. That he also ranks among the most talented Huskers and plays the most important position bodes well.\n\n\u201cNebraska deserves to be back on the map,\u201d Raiola said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because of me or something that I did. But it\u2019s just the type of program it is. It\u2019s a program ready to go win.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, if it happens for the Huskers this year, Raiola is the most likely figure to stand at the center of the resurgence.\n\nA four-game losing streak for Nebraska hit in the middle of Raiola\u2019s freshman season last fall. It threatened to derail progress in Year 2 for Rhule.\n\nBut the coach envisioned such struggles. He sold Raiola on the value of overcoming them when Rhule pitched the quarterback on the Huskers before he committed to Georgia \u2014 and ultimately flipped to Nebraska days before the signing period opened in December 2023.\n\nRhule told Raiola what he already knew. Raiola could pick one of the most established programs nationally, a team that competed annually for national championships before he arrived. He could be asked to make a big throw to win a game, Rhule said. He might do it.\n\nBut when Raiola got to the NFL and adversity hit, would he be ready?\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Come to Nebraska,\u2019\u201d Rhule said. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s going to be hard. There\u2019ll be adversity. You\u2019ll be frustrated sometimes. But we will eventually do something great.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring that four-game skid, Raiola threw seven interceptions and two touchdowns. Holgorsen showed up to take over the offense before the final loss of the streak at USC.\n\nRaiola and Nebraska had possession, down 28-20 with a first down at the Trojans\u2019 14-yard line in the final seconds. Four times last year in Nebraska losses, Raiola held the ball in the last three minutes with the Huskers tied or behind by one score. They lost all four games.\n\n\u201cWhen I got here,\u201d Holgorsen said, \u201cDylan\u2019s head was swimming a little bit. He kind of hit that freshman wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s out there running things,\u201d the OC said. \u201cHe\u2019s like an extra coach.\u201d\n\nFrom the most painful moment of last season came perhaps the most growth.\n\nIn the regular-season finale against Iowa, Nebraska controlled the flow through three quarters but found itself tied at 10 with 15 minutes to play in a hostile stadium. Three fourth-quarter possessions produced nothing for the Huskers. On the last drive, starting with 1:42 to play, Raiola moved Nebraska to its 43-yard line before he lost a fumble while getting sacked.\n\nIowa\u2019s Drew Stevens kicked a 53-yard field goal as time expired to win it.\n\nRaiola didn\u2019t watch the kick. He looked away, hoping Stevens would miss or that the Huskers could block it.\n\n\u201cIt was a feeling I won\u2019t forget,\u201d the QB said. \u201cThere were a lot of instances like that. But it\u2019s a matter of how you respond and get back up and keep swinging.\u201d\n\nFrom the experience at Iowa, Raiola progressed in managing reads, Rhule said. The QB took a step against the Hawkeyes by keeping his running back inside to pick up blitzes. Raiola recognized the next move \u2014 to change protections at the line of scrimmage so that his back could release and beat the blitz.\n\nHe put the skill into action in the Pinstripe Bowl, Rhule said, as Nebraska beat Boston College to earn a seventh win for the first time since 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the game within the game,\u201d Rhule said. \u201cIt\u2019ll manifest itself, and it won\u2019t be a \u2018wow\u2019 play that will show up on ESPN. It\u2019ll be a check down. His command of those things \u2014 and his willingness to take the play that\u2019s there and not try to make too big of a play \u2014 is what will allow us to play championship football.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust keep controlling the game,\u201d he said. \u201cHis football knowledge is advanced. And so we\u2019re putting a lot of things on him as far as going to the line of scrimmage and getting us in the best play. And he can do that at a very high level.\u201d\n\nRaiola conquered the first challenge placed before him in 2025. He hired a chef and put in extra time with strength coaches and a trainer. A leaner body allowed him to gain quickness. The Huskers want to feature his mobility more regularly than in his first season. By spring, the routine took hold.\n\nRaiola moved on to football-specific challenges \u2014 comparatively easy for him.\n\n\u201cSince that moment he stepped in, you could tell he was different,\u201d offensive guard Henry Lutovsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been that natural leader.\u201d\n\nBut was it natural last year when he was 19 and months out of high school?\n\n\u201cEverybody forgets that he was brand new, just because he\u2019s 6-foot-3 and 225 pounds,\u201d Holgorsen said.\n\nHe led all freshmen and ranked 13th in the FBS with a 67.1 percent completion rate. His 13 starts and the struggles that Raiola endured midseason earned him equity with old and new teammates. Transfer wide receivers Dane Key and Nyziah Hunter talk about Raiola with a degree of respect that could only come with experience.\n\n\u201cHe works his butt off, man,\u201d said running back Emmett Johnson, among Raiola\u2019s closest friends on the roster. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing a great job. He\u2019s becoming a better leader in Year 2. He\u2019s way ahead of where he was last year.\u201d\n\nLess than three weeks from the Nebraska opener, Aug. 28 against Cincinnati at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, maybe he\u2019s not the hotshot who has fans nationally on the edge of their seats to see him perform.\n\nMaybe he\u2019s something more consequential to Nebraska. He\u2019s someone, in the gloom of a morning practice in August, who\u2019s bending the ear of the defensive coordinator on how to decipher disguise in a coverage plan.\n\n\u201cDoing something hard is worth it if you come out on the other side,\u201d Raiola said. \u201cIt\u2019s trusting it, trusting the process. As much as I didn\u2019t want hard things to happen in our program, they happened. And I\u2019m still here now, right?\u201d",

      "text": "LINCOLN, Neb. \u2014 There\u2019s the haircut and Dylan Raiola\u2019s warmup routine in the moments before kickoff. There are the sunglasses, the mannerisms and the way he moves in and out of the pocket, decked out in red. There are the sidearm throws and even the misguided suggestion that his younger brother mimics Patrick Mahomes\u2019 brother.\nAdvertisement\nThe No. 15 jersey \u2014 styled not after Mahomes but Tim Tebow, the former Florida star \u2014 evokes a double take. But under the surface, much more connects Raiola, the Nebraska freshman quarterback, and Mahomes, the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 three-time Super Bowl-winning star.\nA former five-star prospect out of Buford, Ga., Raiola has thrown for 967 yards and eight touchdowns in four college games. His first month was nearly flawless, in fact, until a late meltdown by the Huskers against Illinois last Friday led to a 31-24 loss in overtime.\nOutside of Nebraska, though, his likeness to Mahomes dominates talk about the 19-year-old Raiola.\n\u201cI guess if that\u2019s what people want to say,\u201d Raiola said last month when the conversation erupted, \u201cthat guy is one of the best, so it\u2019s cool.\u201d\nThis side by side of Dylan Raiola and Patrick Mahomes is WILD \ud83d\ude33\n(Via TT/Tanner Gatlin) pic.twitter.com/5TYmGUAVqc\n\u2014 FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) September 10, 2024\nRaiola works extensively, even during the football season, with quarterbacks coach Jeff Christensen and trainer Bobby Stroupe, both of whom helped craft Mahomes into a two-time NFL MVP.\nWhat\u2019s lost amid the memes and social media backlash? Raiola did not connect with Mahomes\u2019 support team as part of a plan to follow his path.\nRaiola found them because of his proximity to Christensen and Stroupe, who operated separately out of north Texas when Raiola attended high school there in 2020 and 2021 \u2014 and because of their connections through Dylan\u2019s father, former Detroit Lions center Dominic Raiola.\nThey see more differences between Raiola and Mahomes than similarities.\n\u201cAll the hyperbole, quite frankly, I could not care less,\u201d said Christensen, a longtime coach and eight-year NFL QB. \u201cYou\u2019ve got two great people, as far as I\u2019m concerned, two great families and two kids who want ownership. They\u2019re accountable. They care about their teammates. They\u2019re good souls. And that\u2019s as far as I go with it.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nStroupe has moved his operation to Kansas City. He spends 10 hours per week during the season, he said, with Mahomes in the type of holistic training sessions documented last year in the Netflix series \u201cQuarterback.\u201d\nHis check-ins with Raiola remain often \u2014 in Lincoln and through digital monitoring of Raiola\u2019s work.\nStroupe said he understands the fascination with measuring the Nebraska QB against the 29-year-old Mahomes. But it misses a larger point, he said.\n\u201cThey do move the same,\u201d Stroupe said. \u201cThey have some dimensions that give them some likeness. I think the way they throw the football, the way they protect the ball is a little different. Dylan\u2019s going to take his own way. He\u2019s going to diverge from Patrick quite a bit.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for Dylan to blaze his own trail.\u201d\nA holistic training approach\nStroupe\u2019s methodology caught the eye of Dominic Raiola, the former All-America center at Nebraska who sought to find the best program for Dylan during his rise as a prospect. Dylan jumped on board last year with Stroupe.\nRanked by On3\u2019s industry average as the No. 3 quarterback in the Class of 2024, he finished his first semester at Nebraska by starring in the spring game. His showing answered many questions about his readiness to step in as a freshman. Raiola then spent several weeks with Stroupe in Kansas City.\nNebraska strength coach Corey Campbell observed some of their sessions. The Stroupe partnership involves Campbell and others at Nebraska who work daily with the Huskers.\nThe arrangement works much like his interactions with Mahomes and the Chiefs, Stroupe said. His relationship with Mahomes dates 20 years.\n\u201cFor me,\u201d Stroupe said, \u201cit\u2019s about nourishing their signature uniqueness and expanding on the things that make them different. Like, what is their unique talent?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhat makes Mahomes unique differs from what makes Raiola unique.\nMahomes\u2019 ability to run on a curve is special. It shows when he extends plays and escapes defenders who run faster in a straight line than Mahomes. He trains the skill with Stroupe, but some qualities come naturally.\nBoth quarterbacks possess a \u201ccalmness,\u201d Stroupe said. Both got their starts athletically in baseball. Raiola\u2019s loading movements and his shoulder anatomy, according to Stroupe, naturally resemble that of the older QB.\nAnd his size, at 6 feet 3 and 230 pounds, is a separator \u2014 Mahomes is listed at 6-2 and 225.\n\u201cHe\u2019s more physically imposing,\u201d Stroupe said. \u201cI think Dylan really does have the potential to be a power type of runner in situations that he wants.\u201d\nHe can run over a middle linebacker, Stroupe said. Of course, Matt Rhule and the Nebraska coaches would prefer that Raiola not.\nIf needed, Stroupe, in collaboration with Campbell and the Nebraska staff, will have him ready.\nAn early focus on greatness\nLast year, when Raiola remained unsigned as a recruit, Christensen talked with Rhule about the QB.\n\u201cHe asked me what I thought about Dylan,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cI said it\u2019s very rare for any 18-year-old kid to come into a major university, especially a Big Ten university, and play at a high level.\n\u201cBut if anybody can do it, it would be him.\u201d\nChristensen has coached Mahomes on the mechanics of playing quarterback since 2017, his rookie year in the NFL. He started with Raiola four years ago.\nMany of the principles in Mahomes\u2019 education apply to Christensen\u2019s work with Raiola. When the coach met Dylan, Christensen said, \u201che was like the young stallion colt that you\u2019re trying to break.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not unlike the path Mahomes took as a colt out of Whitehouse, Texas, before he threw for more than 11,000 yards in three seasons at Texas Tech.\nAdvertisement\nRaiola committed to Ohio State in 2022 but reneged shortly after Rhule took over at Nebraska in November of that year. He then committed to Georgia in May 2023. Nebraska never lost interest. Days before the signing period opened last December, Dylan flipped to Nebraska.\nThe words of Christensen resonated. He told Rhule that Raiola works too hard to fail.\n\u201cHe eats it, sleeps it and drinks it,\u201d Christensen said. \u201cIt means too much to him. Without it being obsessive, it\u2019s just his dream. And he\u2019s one of the rare kids whose actions match his words. He\u2019s driven by the possibility of being great.\u201d\nLike Stroupe, Christensen communicates with Raiola during the season. But Glenn Thomas, the Huskers\u2019 first-year quarterbacks coach, and offensive coordinator Marcus Satterfield handle every piece of game preparation.\n\u201cToo much information can muddy the waters,\u201d Christensen said.\nHis conversations with Raiola focus on fundamentals. For instance, Christensen reminds the QB, as he\u2019s done with Mahomes, about the cause and effect of proper ball flight.\nA fine line exists for Raiola in his process to throw with touch versus zip.\nThis Dylan Raiola pass was pretty \ud83d\ude4c @HuskerFootball #B1GFootball on @CFBONFOX \ud83d\udcfa pic.twitter.com/7cEgDmr17l\n\u2014 Big Ten Football (@B1Gfootball) August 31, 2024\n\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a feel thing for me,\u201d Raiola said. \u201cIt\u2019s an instinct that\u2019s been trained over and over again.\u201d\nHe\u2019s hardly slipped up in four games. His two interceptions in 88 attempts were both ripped from the hands of Nebraska receivers.\n\u201cHis preparation is allowing him to see what\u2019s happening in game time,\u201d Rhule said.\n\u2018Just like Patrick\u2019\nThe Mahomes comp first went viral in July after Nebraska shared a photo of Raiola at the start of the preseason camp.\nHe was simply walking on campus. Looking like Mahomes.\nMahomes, ever the good sport, weighed in on the buzz.\nLil cuzzo!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udfaf https://t.co/PpjiPf2XVc\n\u2014 Patrick Mahomes II (@PatrickMahomes) August 31, 2024\nTwo weeks ago, a question about Raiola surfaced in a Mahomes news conference. The quarterbacks have trained together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool, honestly,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cI was that guy. I grew up watching players. I loved A-Rod (Alex Rodriguez), played shortstop, would try to make plays just like him. It helped me become the athlete that I am.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nEvery Raiola highlight provides more low-hanging fruit to an internet audience. Raiola seems unfazed by the attention.\n\u201cHe has a lot of pride but no ego,\u201d Rhule told NFL Network personality Rich Eisen last week on his radio show. \u201cYou can feel that right off the bat. And so you kind of gravitate to him.\u201d\nAs for the Mahomes comparison, Rhule\u2019s OK with it.\n\u201cThe great thing is, he\u2019s a winner, just like Patrick,\u201d the Nebraska coach said on Eisen\u2019s show.\nSince his fame jumped as a high-level prospect, Raiola has largely avoided social media.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him nervous,\u201d said senior receiver Isaiah Neyor, Raiola\u2019s top target this season. \u201cIt\u2019s just in him. He\u2019s a natural competitor.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s trying his best to act like a normal college athlete.\nHe answers questions from the media twice a week, as scheduled. He\u2019s a fixture in the lower bowl at the Devaney Center to watch the No. 2-ranked Nebraska volleyball team \u2014 usually alongside his sister Taylor, a former TCU volleyball player who works for Nebraska football in a recruiting position.\nTwo years ago, before Rhule called Christensen to inquire about Dylan, and before the Huskers bided their time while the QB helped Georgia recruit its 2024 class, Rhule watched Dylan throw in a workout as a high school junior.\nFresh out of the NFL after two-plus seasons as coach of the Carolina Panthers, Rhule talked when the workout ended with a recruiting staffer from back in Nebraska.\nThe first question for the coach: \u201cHow\u2019d he look?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s Mahomes.\u201d\n(Photos of Dylan Raiola, Patrick Mahomes: Steven Branscombe / Getty Images, Jay Biggerstaff / Imagn Images)"

      "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 The talent in Dylan Raiola\u2019s right arm, the effortless motion, the body awareness and rare processing skills that his father\u2019s former quarterbacks from the Detroit Lions began to notice when the kid was 13, they\u2019re all plain to see.\nHis innate qualities, in fact, developed more quickly than even they envisioned, rocketing Raiola from an unknown junior varsity QB after his freshman season of high school two years ago in Texas to the No. 1 prospect in the Class of 2024.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cRecruiting is an imperfect science,\u201d said Drew Stanton, the former second-round pick out of Michigan State and 13-year NFL QB who has mentored Raiola. \u201cBut when you look at him, it\u2019s a safe bet that he\u2019s going to be an elite quarterback in college.\u201d\nBuzz about Georgia, Nebraska and USC, the perceived favorites in the wake of his December decommitment from Ohio State, often feels inescapable. He pledged to the Buckeyes last May, then played his junior season at Chandler (Ariz.) High School and threw for 2,435 yards and 22 touchdowns.\nRaiola enrolled this week at Pinnacle High School on the north side of Phoenix, from which he plans to graduate in December after playing as a senior, flanked by his brother Dayton, a 2026 QB prospect. In Arizona, their transfer generated more noise and questions about Dylan\u2019s immediate eligibility in the fall.\nNationally, it\u2019s a subplot amid his journey, which resembles \u2014 more than upon first glance \u2014 the path traveled by Texas newcomer Arch Manning, the top-rated prospect in the Class of 2023 and next in an esteemed family line of quarterbacks.\nDylan, from a family of linemen, was unwittingly raised as a QB. He is readymade for college at age 17 in part because of competitors like Matthew Stafford with whom his parents afforded him to rub shoulders early in life.\n\u201cI trust my parents,\u201d Dylan said, \u201cfor letting God lead me through all of this.\u201d\nFaith and family loom always for the Raiolas as grounding forces. They figure to guide Dylan as he chooses a college destination as soon as this spring.\nDominic Raiola played 14 seasons as a center for the Lions after an All-America career at Nebraska; his wife, Yvonne, starred as a swimmer and water polo player in their native Honolulu. She competed collegiately at Hawaii.\nFrom them, Dylan inherited his athleticism, poise and a fighting spirit rooted in their heritage.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat resonates with Polynesian athletes and within the culture itself is just this warrior spirit,\u201d Yvonne said. \u201cThere\u2019s such a loyalty that you have to each other \u2014 the brotherhood and sisterhood. Faith and family is at the root of who we are, what we stand for and what\u2019s important.\n\u201cFootball comes third.\u201d\nDylan gained an ability, too, to compartmentalize \u2014 to tune out the noise. Yvonne keeps track of Dylan\u2019s Twitter account. His sister, Taylor, a junior on the TCU volleyball team, monitors his Instagram profile on her phone. Dylan sees limited bits of the public bickering and commentary.\n\u201cI played for as long as I did and did what I did,\u201d Dominic Raiola said, \u201cbecause I always kept the main as the main thing. You can get caught up with what people are saying, the stars (in recruiting) or how they\u2019re negatively talking about you.\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t take care of business at home, there is no field. And if you don\u2019t take care of business on the field, there are no accolades.\u201d\nAt the small gym setting in a north Scottsdale industrial park, across town from the site of the upcoming Super Bowl, Dylan Raiola found peace this week. He worked out with his brother and a few other athletes.\nDylan, at 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, redistributed weight in recent months. He\u2019s got the build of a college QB. Dayton, too, has grown physically impressive this winter. He shot up to 6 feet, adding 3 inches after Nebraska extended a scholarship offer, his first, in October.\nOn Monday, Dayton wore a red Nebraska sweatshirt to the workout. Dylan donned a black hoodie from the Polynesian Bowl. In the gym, though, no one is interested in Dylan\u2019s choice of clothing and what it might signal about his recruiting.\nGO DEEPER\nNational recruiting big board: The 10 most impactful uncommitted 2024 prospects\nHis time here is an escape. It reminds Dominic of a different day, nearly 30 years ago in Hawaii at the open-air garage gym owned by Olin Kreutz\u2019s grandfather, George Perry.\nRaiola and Kreutz, teammates at St. Louis High School, learned discipline and humility as they pushed the rusted plates.\nKreutz played at Washington and was drafted by the Bears in 1998. Three years ahead of Raiola to enter the NFL, Kreutz also toiled for 14 years as a center \u2014 the first 13 in Chicago.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOlin and I grew up together and constantly were being challenged to uphold this standard that we created,\u201d Dominic said.\nHe feared every year in Detroit that he would get cut.\n\u201cIt was almost like we never made it,\u201d Dominic said.\nDylan was born in 2005 after Dominic\u2019s fourth year in Detroit. That spring, the Lions drafted Dan Orlovsky in the fifth round out of UConn. A year later, the franchise signed Jon Kitna. The Lions drafted Stanton in 2007 and Stafford with the No. 1 pick out of Georgia in 2009.\nThe quarterbacks fit tightly into the lives of Dominic, Yvonne and their family.\n\u201cQuarterbacks are the CEO of the building,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cI always wanted to make sure my CEO was good. I took care of them, protected them.\u201d\nHe watched film with quarterbacks and made calls at the line of scrimmage for them. Taylor said she recalls finding notebooks as a kid at their home in Michigan filled with her dad\u2019s play calls and meeting observations.\n\u201cProbably the smartest player I\u2019ve ever been around,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cDom would be able to see things in real time. It allowed the quarterbacks to just be able to go out and play.\u201d\nDominic asked the quarterbacks and other teammates to \u201cpour into\u201d his kids.\n\u201cWhy not put your kids in the best situation?\u201d he said.\nThey were all uncles to the Raiola children.\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a bunch of kids who would have killed to play games with my uncle Matthew,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cor to have Calvin Johnson pick you up and take you for a jet ski ride.\u201d\nBut all that glamour, she said, meant little unless the Raiolas understood how to accept what the pro athletes offered.\nAt a young age, Dylan gravitated to the quarterbacks.\n\u201cI look for what they have in common,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cThey love their families. They use football as a platform to show the world what they\u2019re all about. They\u2019re great people, always looking to give and provide.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI would be dumb not to listen to those guys. I absorb everything they tell me.\u201d\nDylan studied the movements of Detroit Red Wings goalkeeper Chris Osgood. Same drill when his parents took Dylan to the College World Series.\nHe talked about it nonstop, Taylor said. And his fascination with other sports only served as a preview of what came after Dylan began to play quarterback.\nKitna noticed it first. Dylan had a rocket launcher for an arm. And more than that, he possessed a feel for the QB position.\nDominic and Yvonne moved their family from Michigan to Arizona four years into his NFL retirement to live closer to her family and for Taylor to complete high school at Scottsdale Christian Academy.\nIn 2018, Kitna, following an 18-year pro career, took a coaching job at Brophy Prep in Phoenix. He reconnected with the Raiolas and insisted to Dylan, upon watching him throw in the backyard as an eighth-grader, that he was undoubtedly a quarterback. Kitna predicted that Dylan would rise to rank as the nation\u2019s No. 1 college prospect.\nDominic and Yvonne didn\u2019t know what to think.\n\u201cI thought they were linemen,\u201d he said of Dylan and Dayton, \u201cthat they were an extension of my wife and me. But God had this crazy plan that they were going to be quarterbacks.\u201d\n5 \u2b50\ufe0f Dylan Raiola with a beauty \ud83d\udd25 @RaiolaDylan pic.twitter.com/xGWJfdp0s0\n\u2014 SportsCenter NEXT (@SCNext) October 29, 2022\nDominic said he recognized Dylan\u2019s savviness and that he could throw the ball well. As a catcher in baseball, Dylan attracted attention. His pop time, a scouting tool used to measure the number of seconds that elapse from when the ball hits a catcher\u2019s glove until it is delivered to the center of an intended base, put him on par with some professionals.\nIn Arizona, Dylan met with Todd Stottlemyre, a mindset coach and former big-league pitcher. Stottlemyre gave Dylan books to read and provided tips. When the sessions ended, Dylan went to the quiet of his bedroom for 40 minutes, Dominic said, and unloaded all of it into a notebook.\nAdvertisement\nBut quarterback?\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want anything to do with coaching quarterbacks,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cI don\u2019t know it. I do know where my lane is, and it ain\u2019t quarterbacks.\n\u201cI was fortunate to have connections.\u201d\nWhen Taylor started college at TCU in 2020, the Raiolas moved to Texas. Dylan enrolled at Burleson High School, south of Fort Worth, where Kitna took a job as the football coach.\nDylan played on the JV squad as a freshman, and he starred as a varsity baseball player in the spring of 2021. That June, the Raiolas set out to tour college campuses, matching football camps with baseball competition.\nTheir first stops: Nashville for an Elite 11 event, then Georgia. Dominic said he knew no one at the school, just that Stafford had played for the Bulldogs. Dylan threw at the camp and got a call back to Athens a few days later. Georgia coaches extended an offer, his first.\nYvonne called Taylor to deliver the news.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018What? That\u2019s crazy,'\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know a whole lot about college football, but I knew that Georgia was good.\u201d\nThe offers did not stop.\n\u201cEverybody kept telling us, \u2018This dude is the best quarterback we\u2019ve seen, no matter the class,'\u201d Dominic said.\nDylan started at the varsity level in Burleson as a sophomore. He threw for 3,341 yards and 42 touchdowns and was crowned with the top spot in the 247Sports Composite.\nOffers from Texas, Alabama, Ohio State, Notre Dame and USC poured in.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to speak in cliches,\u201d Stanton said, \u201cbut the kid absolutely lives and breathes football. And he does it in a genuine way. It\u2019s not just his dad saying, \u2018Hey, we want to do this.\u2019 He\u2019s pressing the envelope on his own accord. And I think that\u2019s what is going to make him great.\u201d\nThe ball jumps from Dylan\u2019s hand. His understanding of arm angles and how to generate force with his body is next level, Stanton said. But Dylan separates himself from the pack in other ways.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe was asking very pointed questions about specific things,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cIt was impressive. I realized that I wasn\u2019t dealing with a high school kid as we were having these talks. I was dealing with a high-level thinker.\u201d\nSaid Stafford, the Rams\u2019 Super Bowl-winning QB from a year ago, in a statement provided to The Athletic:\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for Dylan. He\u2019s gonna do great things at the next level. I\u2019ve watched him grow into a great young QB. I told him to make sure he enjoys this time in high school and to always have fun playing the game; and pick a school that you believe in and love.\n\u201cI also told him a couple months ago, by the time he\u2019s done with college, I\u2019ll be done and he can take over my job!\u201d\nDominic was fined multiple times by the NFL for altercations on the field. An incident in November 2014 against the Patriots cost him $10,000 for a cut block and club from behind a defensive player. He was suspended one game a month later for stepping on the ankle of an opponent.\nThough not as fiery, Yvonne competed in water polo with notable ferocity. \u201cPeople thought I was a sweet, nice person,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if you grabbed my suit, there was definitely a feistiness that would come out.\u201d\nYvonne passed her blend of intensity and compassion to Taylor. She\u2019s undersized at 6 feet but plays as a six-rotation outside hitter with a scrappiness, according to her mother.\nDylan, Taylor said, got the best of both parents.\n\u201cHe does a good job of being level-headed,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople call him names, stomp and stand over him. They\u2019ve thrown cans at him as he comes off the field. Dylan is intense. He\u2019s always had that fight in him, but he handles it in a much more quiet way.\u201d\nThe family returned in January 2022 to Arizona, near Yvonne\u2019s family. Stanton operates out of Phoenix. And Dylan, a year after the move from Texas, has traveled to Los Angeles multiple times to work on weekends with instructors at 3DQB, a comprehensive program that offers biometric training, mechanical analysis, nutrition, mental prep and strength training. It touts connections with the likes of Stafford, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Dak Prescott, C.J. Stroud and Bryce Young.\nAdvertisement\nThrough his dad\u2019s connections, Dylan met Joe Burrow and worked out alongside Patrick Mahomes in Texas last summer at APEC, another training center.\n\u201cIt was a surreal moment,\u201d Dylan said.\nMahomes offered great advice, Dylan said, though he doesn\u2019t know if the Super Bowl-bound QB, to whom Dylan has been compared, even knew him from other athletes at the facility. It doesn\u2019t matter, Dylan said. He hopes they cross paths again.\nIn the seven months that Dylan spent committed to Ohio State, recruiting attention slowed, but it did not stop. The fit with the Buckeyes felt right last spring. Things changed.\n\u201cThey do a great job,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t feel the way you did when you committed, it\u2019s too big of a decision to leave it.\n\u201cBut Dylan\u2019s fortunate. He knows what he wants.\u201d\nSaid Yvonne: \u201cDylan\u2019s got a second chance at recruiting. So OK, how can we be better as parents so that he makes the right decision? We\u2019ve made a commitment to being better listeners.\u201d\nDylan wants a relationship. Personal connection is fundamental to his family\u2019s beliefs rooted in the Polynesian culture.\nHe\u2019s found connections with Kirby Smart at Georgia and USC\u2019s Lincoln Riley. New Nebraska coach Matt Rhule gained significant ground for the Huskers after his Nov. 26 hire. Nebraska sent nine assistant coaches to Raiola\u2019s new school last Friday in the final hours of the January contact period.\nRhule used his lone visit of the month on the first day that coaches were allowed to travel.\nPer NCAA rules, Raiola, as a junior, was allowed only to say hello to the visitors, with the exception of Donovan Raiola. Dominic\u2019s brother, retained by Rhule in December to coach the Nebraska offensive line \u2014 the only holdover from the Huskers\u2019 2022 staff \u2014 is subject to no restrictions.\nWhile other recruiters can\u2019t see Dylan again in Arizona until April 15, uncle Donovan can visit at any time. He can stay at the Raiola home.\nAdvertisement\nDylan, too, senses change at Nebraska, which has endured six consecutive losing seasons.\n\u201cMatt Rhule is exactly what Nebraska needed,\u201d he said.\nOf course, USC and Georgia offer immediate opportunities to contend for the national championship.\nDylan attended the 65-7 Georgia win against TCU in the College Football Playoff championship. He then suffered with the Georgia community through the deaths in a car accident of offensive lineman Devin Willock and recruiting assistant Chandler LeCroy.\nLeCroy served as Dylan\u2019s host when he first visited Georgia in June 2021.\n\u201cShe had such a joyful heart,\u201d he said, \u201calways smiling. When you were around her, you could feel the happiness. She loved Georgia football, and she always looked out for our family.\u201d\nThe Raiolas visited USC last weekend while in L.A. for the 3DQB training.\n\u201cCoach Riley is a pretty special guy to me,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cHis track record is amazing, what he\u2019s done with quarterbacks.\u201d\nHe plans a return to USC. Trips are scheduled to revisit Georgia on March 18 and Nebraska on March 25. And other programs such as Michigan and Oregon might remain in the mix.\n\u201cEverything\u2019s open,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cI learned from the first time. I want to be patient and make sure it\u2019s the perfect decision for me.\u201d\nOtherwise, he said, he\u2019s intent this year to take Stafford\u2019s advice and savor his time in high school. \u201cI definitely want to enjoy being a kid.\u201d\nPerhaps, he said, he\u2019ll play baseball this spring. He didn\u2019t last season.\nHis new school, by the way, features Class of 2023 five-star tight end Duce Robinson, a Georgia and USC target, and four-star offensive tackle Elijah Paige, who signed with USC. In the 2019 class, top-rated QB Spencer Rattler signed from Pinnacle to play for Riley at Oklahoma.\nRattler then transferred to South Carolina, playing in 2022 for offensive coordinator Marcus Satterfield, the new OC and quarterbacks coach at Nebraska.\nAdvertisement\nThe plot continues to thicken.\nDylan\u2019s sister Taylor said she believes the right fit, naturally, will feature an environment that feels most like a family around the five-star QB.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not rushing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel the pressure to be committed.\u201d\nAround him, everyone is waiting.\n(Photos: Brendan Moran, Jordan Mansfield / Getty; Megan Mendoza / USA Today; Illustration: John Bradford / The Athletic)"
