      "summary": "Brent crude is trading slightly higher at $67.08 a barrel while gold futures remain flat around $3,388 a troy ounce. China’s Sinopec reported a 40% drop in first‑half net profit to 21.48 billion yuan, citing falling oil prices, whereas Australian miners Northern Star and Whitehaven Coal posted higher annual profits, though Whitehaven’s underlying earnings fell due to a coal price slump. U.S. grain outlooks show a modest decline in Illinois corn yields but still above the three‑year average, and USDA export data for corn and soybeans beat expectations while wheat lagged. Separately, American Industrial Partners agreed to buy International Paper’s global cellulose fibers business for $1.5 billion, and market commentary highlights cautious sentiment ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s upcoming speech amid geopolitical and policy uncertainties.",
