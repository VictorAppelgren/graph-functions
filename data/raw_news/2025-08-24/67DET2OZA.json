  "title": "Is Wall Street Bullish or Bearish on Xylem Stock?",
  "description": "Xylem has underperformed the broader market over the past year, but analysts are moderately optimistic about the stock\u2019s prospects.",
  "content": "Xylem Inc. (XYL), headquartered in Washington, District of Columbia, designs, manufactures, and services engineered products and solutions. With a market cap of $34.5 billion, the company's products include water and wastewater pumps, treatment and testing equipment, industrial pumps, valves, heat exchangers, and dispensing equipment.\n\nShares of this leading global water technology company have underperformed the broader market over the past year. XYL has gained 5.5% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 14.3%. However, in 2025, XYL stock is up 22.3%, surpassing the SPX\u2019s 9% rise on a YTD basis.\n\u2022 Should You Buy the Pullback in Palantir Stock Today?\n\u2022 As SoFi Launches International Money Transfer Services, How Should You Play SOFI Stock?\n\u2022 The Quantum Computing Race Is On: These 2 Stocks Appear Poised to Lead\n\u2022 Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nNarrowing the focus, XYL\u2019s underperformance is also apparent compared to the Global X Clean Water ETF (AQWA). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 10.6% over the past year. However, XYL\u2019s returns on a YTD basis outshine the ETF\u2019s 17.2% gains over the same time frame.\n\nOn Jul. 31, XYL shares closed up by 10.7% after reporting its Q2 results. Its adjusted EPS of $1.26 exceeded Wall Street expectations of $1.14. The company\u2019s revenue was $2.3 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts of $2.2 billion. Xylem expects full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $4.70 to $4.85, and expects revenue in the range of $8.9 billion to $9 billion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect XYL\u2019s EPS to grow 12.7% to $4.81 on a diluted basis. The company\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat or matched the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.\n\nAmong the 20 analysts covering XYL stock, the consensus is a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d That\u2019s based on 11 \u201cStrong Buy\u201d ratings, one \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d and eight \u201cHolds.\u201d\n\nThis configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with 10 analysts suggesting a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 5, UBS kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on XYL and raised the price target to $168, implying a potential upside of 18.5% from current levels.\n\nThe mean price target of $160.07 represents a 12.9% premium to XYL\u2019s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $175 suggests an upside potential of 23.4%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Neha Panjwani did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
