      "summary": "Legionnaire’s disease, a bacterial pneumonia that thrives in warm, stagnant water, is spreading in New York City through large cooling towers, sickening over 100 people and killing five in a recent outbreak. Climate change is amplifying the problem by raising temperatures and humidity, which favor Legionella growth, and is pushing the disease into new regions such as Michigan and other Midwest states. The illness disproportionately affects low‑income communities that rely on aging, poorly maintained air‑conditioning infrastructure, and the death rate can reach 10%. Public health officials warn that early detection, regular inspection of cooling systems, and community water‑system maintenance are essential to curb future outbreaks, yet inspections have fallen sharply in recent years.",
