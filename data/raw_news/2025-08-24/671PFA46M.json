  "title": "Will there be a La Ni\u00f1a this fall? Here's what forecasters predict and what it means for the weather",
  "description": "NOAA forecasts suggest we could experience La Ni\u00f1a conditions in the fall and early winter. However, this potential La Ni\u00f1a spell is unlikely to break records.",
  "content": "Atlantic hurricanes like Hurricane Erin (pictured here) are more likely to occur during a La Ni\u00f1a.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a conditions could develop in the fall and early winter, but they will probably be weak and short-lived, forecasters say.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a is the cold phase of the -Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a natural climate pattern of atmospheric and sea temperature changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean. During La Ni\u00f1a, the jet stream shifts northward, bringing wetter conditions and cooler winters to the northern U.S., while the southern U.S. experiences drier conditions and warmer winters. A La Ni\u00f1a also tends to ramp up hurricane activity .\n\nConditions for this phase , but they didn't stick around long enough to be considered an official La Ni\u00f1a event in the historical record. The latest from the National Weather Service indicated that we could be in for something similar in the coming months.\n\nA period of La Ni\u00f1a conditions is favored for the fall and early winter, and there's a 21% chance that the current July-to-September period will qualify. The likelihood then rises to more than 50% for overlapping 3-month periods between September and January. Still, forecasters aren't expecting massive weather shifts.\n\n\"If La Ni\u00f1a forms, it's likely to be weak, meaning La Ni\u00f1a wouldn't exert a strong influence over the winter,\" , a research professor at the University of Miami and lead writer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's , told Live Science in an email.\n\nThe ENSO cycle triggers a warm El Ni\u00f1o phase and then a cold La Ni\u00f1a phase every two to seven years, on average, with each phase lasting around nine to 12 months. However, the timing of these phases varies, and they're difficult to predict.\n\nThe phases are defined by changes in the sea surface temperature of the Ni\u00f1o region of the east-central Pacific and a shift in atmospheric conditions, which impact the Pacific jet stream. El Ni\u00f1o conditions occur when the sea surface temperature is 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit (0.5 degrees Celsius) higher than the long-term average, while La Ni\u00f1a conditions happen when the sea surface temperature falls 0.9 F below the long-term average.\n\nWe were due to enter a La Ni\u00f1a last summer, but the conditions didn't develop until December. That delayed start meant that La Ni\u00f1a didn't have time to gain strength before the onset of winter.\n\nLast year's warmer-than-average ocean temperatures might have played a role in the delay. Earth was in an El Ni\u00f1o between May 2023 and March 2024, which contributed to during that period. However, the planet has continued to warm with , regardless of what ENSO is doing .\n\nLast winter's La Ni\u00f1a spell didn't make it into the record books because the temperature didn't remain below the 0.9 F threshold for at least five \u2014 periods of three months. The latest data suggest that La Ni\u00f1a conditions are more likely than not in just three of these upcoming periods across the fall and winter, and thus any spell is unlikely to be an official La Ni\u00f1a.\n\n\"It's very possible we'll end up with another winter like 2024-25, with a few months of La Ni\u00f1a conditions, not quite enough to qualify as a La Ni\u00f1a event in our historic record,\" Becker said. \"However, last winter's impacts ended up looking like those we'd expect during a moderately strong La Ni\u00f1a.\"",

      "text": "515-mile-long lightning bolt that spanned 5 states is the longest on record\nA lightning \"megaflash\" that zipped across five U.S. states has set a new record for the longest ever detected.\nA lightning bolt that spanned five states in the Great Plains has set a new record for the longest lightning bolt ever recorded, the World Meteorological Organization has confirmed.\nThe \"megaflash\" zipped across 515 miles (829 kilometers) from eastern Texas through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas to near Kansas City, Missouri, in seven seconds, beating the previous record of 477 miles (768 km).\nThe flash occurred on Oct. 22, 2017, but it was too long to be fully measured by ground-based sensors at the time. Now, a new study that used data from a geostationary satellite has finally documented the massive scope of the bolt. The researchers published their findings Thursday (July 31) in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.\n\"It is likely that even greater extremes still exist, and that we will be able to observe them as additional high-quality lightning measurements accumulate over time,\" study senior author Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University, said in a statement.\nExactly how lightning gets its initial spark is still contested. But scientists know it arises when electrons pool in one region of a storm cloud, thus creating an ionized path in the air between which the electrons can flow from regions of negative to positive charge.\nIn some storm clouds, particularly the huge clusters that form over hotspots such as the Great Plains, understudied dynamics within the clouds can lead to discharges that stretch beyond 60 miles (100 km) \u2014 earning them the title of \"megaflashes.\"\nRelated: Lightning on Earth is sparked by a powerful chain reaction from outer space, simulations show\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nIn the study, the scientists reconstructed the flash's length by analyzing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's GOES-16 satellite \u2014 one of four of the agency's satellites with mappers that continuously monitor the ground for zaps of lightning. Using new algorithms, the scientists separated the bolt from millions of other light flashes to reveal its full extent.\n\"Our weather satellites carry very exacting lightning detection equipment that we can use to document the millisecond when a lightning flash starts and how far it travels,\" Cerveny said.\nExperts say that, beyond highlighting the impressive advancements in new weather-monitoring technologies, the discovery is an important reminder that lightning can strike far from the storm cells where it was initially generated.\n\"It illustrates the threat of the newly recognized 'bolt from the gray,'\" analogous to the 'bolt from the blue' from isolated cells, but one that can travel many hundreds of kilometers from the main charge generating region,\" co-author Walt Lyons, president of FMA Research, a forensic meteorology investigation firm in Fort Collins, Colorado, said in a statement.\n\"If lightning is within 10 km [6.2 miles] as found with reliable lightning data, go to the lightning safe building or vehicle,\" he added. \"As these extreme cases show, lightning can arrive within seconds over a long distance, but they are embedded within larger thunderstorms, so be aware.\"\nBen Turner is a U.K. based staff writer at Live Science.

      "text": "La Ni\u00f1a is dead after just a few months. What happened?\nThe La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern ended last month as Pacific Ocean temperatures rose and the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation cycle entered a neutral state, according to the NOAA.\nThe long-awaited La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern has finished after just a few months, scientists just announced.\nLa Ni\u00f1a is the cold phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, a natural climate pattern of atmospheric and sea temperature changes in the tropical Pacific Ocean, a region that stretches from Mexico to Peru. The latest La Ni\u00f1a was supposed to start last summer and was long overdue by the time it finally arrived in December.\nA delayed start meant the La Ni\u00f1a didn't have time to gain strength before winter started. So, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced that the La Ni\u00f1a was officially underway on Jan. 9, researchers expected it to be shorter than usual. And that's proven to be the case.\nNOAA's latest data revealed that the tropical Pacific warmed up again in March, so the La Ni\u00f1a is officially over. We're now in a neutral state in the ENSO cycle, which means there isn't an active El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a.\n\"After just a few months of La Ni\u00f1a conditions, the tropical Pacific is now ENSO-neutral, and forecasters expect neutral to continue through the Northern Hemisphere summer,\" Emily Becker, a research associate professor in the atmospheric sciences department at the University of Miami, wrote Thursday (April 10) in the NOAA ENSO blog.\nRelated: 'Major disruption' has caused Arctic polar vortex to slide off North Pole, scientists say\nThe ENSO cycle triggers a warm El Ni\u00f1o and then a cold La Ni\u00f1a every two to seven years on average, but they aren't always on time and the duration of each varies. The last El Ni\u00f1o lasted from May 2023 to March 2024 and contributed to record-breaking heat in those years.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nA La Ni\u00f1a event typically brings colder and wetter winters to the northern U.S. and Canada while the southern U.S. becomes warmer and drier, according to the NOAA. La Ni\u00f1a typically brings down global temperatures. However, global warming has meant that 2025 has continued the trend of record-breaking heat from previous years despite the La Ni\u00f1a.\nBoth El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are marked by changes in the sea surface temperature in part of the east-central Pacific. A La Ni\u00f1a begins when temperatures fall more than 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit (0.5 degrees Celsius) below the long-term average temperature for the region, which first happened in December.\nResearchers aren't certain why the latest La Ni\u00f1a was so delayed, but warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in 2024 might have played a role. The March data revealed that temperatures are now minus 0.018 F (minus 0.01 C) relative to the average, so well above the La Ni\u00f1a threshold and almost identical to the long-term average.\nWhat happens next?\nResearchers expect the tropical Pacific to remain ENSO-neutral through the summer and, more likely than not, through the fall as well, according to the NOAA ENSO blog.\nENSO-neutral doesn't mean that we'll have average or predictable weather going forward \u2014 there are plenty of other climate patterns having an effect. In fact, some land areas have a repeatable weather pattern during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events, so the weather is less predictable during ENSO-neutral, according to NOAA.\nPatrick Pester is the trending news writer at Live Science.

Within less than four days, it turned some 42,000 acres (17,000 hectares) of forests and agricultural land into ashes \u2014 an area larger than France's capital Paris.\nThe scope of the fire was captured in dramatic images taken by the high-resolution Pleiades Neo satellites operated by the European aerospace giant Airbus.\nAt its peak strength, the blaze was devouring about 2,470 acres (1,000 hectares) of land per hour, fanned by strong winds blowing from the Mediterranean Sea. Within two days of its ignition, the fire devoured 40,000 acres (16,000 hectares). At least one person died, and 13 others were injured as the fire engulfed several villages in the wine-making region, according to the BBC.\nThe Pleiades Neo images, taken the day after the fire started, reveal swaths of scorched land as well as burning hotspots and thick plumes of smoke covering the land. In some images, firefighting planes flying over the affected region can be seen.\nNASA's Terra and Landsat 9 satellites also spotted the fire, revealing its fast-paced progress. The Terra image, obtained with the Moderate Resolution Images Spectroradiometer (MODIS), shows the situation in natural colors at 11:20 a.m. local time on Aug. 6.\nThe false-color images from Landsat 9, obtained one hour later, are a combination of shortwave infrared, near infrared and optical wavelengths, which together allow it to reveal the freshly burned ground that would otherwise be obscured by a thick layer of smoke.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nFirefighters mostly contained the wildfire by Thursday evening, Aug. 7, according to Al Jazeera, but local authorities said it would take days to completely extinguish the remaining burning spots.\nFrance's officials attributed the fire, the worst to have hit the country since 1949, to worsening climate change. France's popular Mediterranean coast has been hit particularly hard this year, registering over 9,000 wildfire breakouts since the beginning of the summer season, according to Al Jazeera.\nThe summer of 2025 is shaping up as one of the hottest on record in western Europe, with temperature records having been broken in the month of June, according to the E.U. environmental service Copernicus."

      "text": "What is El Ni\u00f1o?\nEl Ni\u00f1o is a climate cycle in which waters off the tropical eastern Pacific are warmer than usual, which in turn affects global weather patterns.\nEl Ni\u00f1o is a climate cycle in the Pacific Ocean which impacts weather patterns around the world.\nThe cycle begins when warm water in the western tropical Pacific Ocean shifts eastward along the equator toward the coast of South America. Normally, this warm water pools near Indonesia and the Philippines. During an El Ni\u00f1o, the Pacific's warmest surface waters sit offshore of northwestern South America.\nThe location of tropical storms shifts eastward during an El Ni\u00f1o because atmospheric moisture is fuel for thunderstorms, and the greatest amount of evaporation takes place above the ocean's warmest water.\nThe opposite of El Ni\u00f1o is La Ni\u00f1a, which is when the waters of the tropical eastern Pacific are colder than normal and trade winds blow more strongly than usual.\nCollectively, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are parts of an oscillation in the ocean-atmosphere system called the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO cycle, which also has a neutral phase.\nHow long will El Ni\u00f1o last?\nEl Ni\u00f1os occur every three to five years but may come as frequently as every two years or as rarely as every seven years. Typically, El Ni\u00f1os occur more frequently than La Ni\u00f1as. Each event usually lasts nine to 12 months. They often begin to form in spring, reach peak strength between December and January, and then decay by May of the following year.\nClimate scientists at NOAA say there is a more than 95% chance that the current El Ni\u00f1o event will persist into 2024. They expect warmer-than-average conditions that will gradually strengthen into the Northern Hemisphere's fall and winter.\nWhat causes El Ni\u00f1o?\nScientists do not yet understand in detail what triggers an El Ni\u00f1o cycle. Not all El Ni\u00f1os are the same, nor do the atmosphere and ocean always follow the same patterns from one El Ni\u00f1o to another.\nTo forecast an El Ni\u00f1o, scientists monitor several regions across the Pacific.\n\"You have to think of each region as an ocean sloshing around,\" said Neville Sweijd, director of the Alliance for Collaboration on Climate and Earth Systems Science (ACCESS) in South Africa. \"Sometimes it sloshes to one side, and sometimes it sloshes to the other. That's El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a.\"\nExperts \"monitor the average sea-surface temperature in each region and use that to form a model,\" he told Live Science. \"The models will then predict the likelihood of the manifestation.\"\nIn normal, non-El Ni\u00f1o conditions, trade winds blow toward the west across the tropical Pacific, away from South America. These winds pile up warm surface water in the western Pacific so that the sea surface is about 1.5 feet (0.5 meters) higher offshore Indonesia than it is offshore Ecuador. Higher sea-surface temperature causes water levels to expand and rise, and also shifts rainfall from land to ocean.\nIn a non El Ni\u00f1o year, the sea-surface temperature is also about 14 degrees Fahrenheit (8 degrees Celsius) warmer in the western Pacific. Cooler ocean temperatures dominate offshore northwest South America, due to an upwelling of cold water from deeper levels.\nForecasters declare an official El Ni\u00f1o when they see both ocean temperatures and rainfall from storms veer to the east. Experts who monitor El Ni\u00f1o also look for prevailing trade winds to weaken. These changes set up a feedback loop between the atmosphere and the ocean that boosts El Ni\u00f1o conditions.\nWhat is the El Ni\u00f1o forecast for the 2023-2024 winter?\nAfter months of warning, on June 8, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed the arrival of the latest El Ni\u00f1o event.\nEl Ni\u00f1o for the 2023-2024 winter is forecast to be very strong, which means normal sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean are expected to deviate dramatically from their normal averages. However, their strength does not directly correspond to the severity of their impacts, as this relationship can vary considerably between cycles.\n\"Their effects vary depending on the intensity, duration, time of year when it develops, and the interaction with other modes of climate variability,\" said \u00c1lvaro Silva, a climate expert at the World Meteorological Organization. \"Not all regions of the world are affected, and even within a region, the impacts can be different.\"\nThe current El Ni\u00f1o event is expected to push global temperatures into uncharted territory and contribute to global warming crossing the critical 2.7 F (1.5 C) threshold within the next five years. It will most likely intensify extreme weather events associated with climate change \u2014 such as heat waves, drought and heavy rainfall \u2014 in certain areas.\n\"El Ni\u00f1o is a strong contributing factor to some of the extremes we have experienced in the past and that we are likely to experience in the next months,\" Silva told Live Science. \"It is very likely that this year or next year we will see the warmest year on record.\"\nDoes El Ni\u00f1o cause more rain, or drought?\nDuring an El Ni\u00f1o, the trade winds weaken in the central and western Pacific. Surface water off South America warms up because there is less upwelling of the cold water from below to cool the surface. The clouds and rainstorms associated with warm ocean waters also shift eastward. The warm waters release so much energy into the atmosphere that weather changes all over the planet.\nAn El Ni\u00f1o creates stronger wind shear and more stable air over the Atlantic, which makes it harder for hurricanes to form there. However, the warmer-than-average ocean temperatures boost eastern Pacific hurricanes, contributing to more active tropical storm seasons.\nStrong El Ni\u00f1os are also associated with above-average precipitation in the southern United States. The cloudier weather typically causes below-average winter temperatures in that part of the country, while temperatures tilt warmer than average in the northern U.S. Rainfall is often below average in the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the Pacific Northwest during an El Ni\u00f1o, according to NOAA.\nRecord rainfall often strikes Peru, Chile and Ecuador during an El Ni\u00f1o year. Fish catches offshore South America are typically lower than normal because the marine life migrates to the north and south, following colder water.\nEl Ni\u00f1o also affects precipitation in other areas, including Indonesia and northeastern South America, which tend toward drier-than-normal conditions. Temperatures in Australia and Southeast Asia run hotter than average. El Ni\u00f1o-caused drought can be widespread, affecting southern Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Australia, the Pacific Islands and the Canadian prairies.\nUnlike El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a events are characterized by a sustained cooling effect around the equator and eastern tropical Pacific. This often results in stronger and more frequent hurricanes across North America and can lead to heavy flooding in many Pacific Island nations, as well as droughts along the west coast of South America.\nWhat were past El Ni\u00f1o years like?\nThe last El Ni\u00f1o event occurred between February and August 2019, but its impacts were relatively weak. One of the strongest in recent decades was the El Ni\u00f1o that developed in the winter of 1997 to 1998. It resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries from severe storms, heatwaves, floods, fires and drought. In the US, devastating storms in the south damaged infrastructure and crops, while the north experienced above-normal temperatures and very little rain and snowfall.\nBetween July 2020 and March 2023, a rare triple-dip La Ni\u00f1a upended weather patterns around the world. The three-year event was partly responsible for record-breaking rain and severe flooding in Australia, a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season in 2020 and the third most active hurricane season in 2021.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nAimee Gabay is an independent journalist based in London, U.K. Focusing on land rights, nature and climate change, her reporting has appeared in Al Jazeera, Mongabay and New Scientist."

      "text": "Strongest nor'easters along US East Coast are becoming more intense as the world warms, study suggests\nA new study finds the strongest nor'easters have intensified over the last 80 years, with a 6% increase in peak wind speeds.\nThe strongest nor'easters \u2014 a type of North Atlantic storm that can produce devastating impacts along the U.S. East Coast \u2014 appear to be intensifying as the world warms, a new study finds.\nResearchers found that the maximum wind speeds and hourly precipitation rates of the strongest nor'easters have increased since 1940.\nThe trends identified have \"profound implications\" for people living across the eastern coast of North America, given that these storms bring damaging winds, heavy snowfall and significant coastal flooding, the researchers reported in a paper published July 14 in the journal PNAS.\n\"While there is no apparent trend in the average intensity of nor'easters, we found that the strongest nor'easters \u2014 which do the most damage and have the most impact \u2014 are indeed getting stronger,\" study co-author Michael Mann, a presidential distinguished professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania, told Live Science.\nNor'easters are a type of extratropical cyclone (ETC) \u2014 storms that originate outside the tropics \u2014 that form along the U.S. East Coast, particularly during late fall through early spring. These storms often cause severe damage and societal disruption because they tend to pass over densely populated regions, such as the Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. metro areas.\nSome of the most infamous nor'easters include the \"Perfect Storm\" in 1991; the \"Storm of the Century\" in 1993, one of the deadliest of these events on record, which claimed 208 lives; \"Snowmageddon\" in 2010; and the January 2018 blizzard.\nRelated: La Ni\u00f1a is dead \u2014 what that means for this year's hurricanes and weather\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nGiven the potential consequences, it is crucial to understand how nor'easters are changing in response to human-caused climate change, the authors said. Yet nor'easters have traditionally received far less attention from climate researchers than tropical cyclones have.\nAnd while there is a general consensus among climate scientists that ETCs will likely decline in frequency as arctic warming decreases the temperature gradient between polar and subtropical regions, there is less agreement regarding potential changes in the future intensity of these storms.\nIn an attempt to address some of these outstanding issues and challenges, Mann and colleagues set out to create a \"virtual atlas\" of nor'easters that could serve as a reliable historical database of these storms, he told Live Science. The study involved applying a cyclone-tracking algorithm to a climate dataset covering the period from 1940 to the present.\nUsing this approach, the team identified 900 nor'easters over this period \u2014 an average of around 11 per year. The researchers then looked at trends over time, focusing on two key storm characteristics: intensity, as measured by peak sustained winds, and the average precipitation per hour.\nThey found only a very small, statistically insignificant increase in the average intensity of all nor'easters over the study period. But among the strongest storms specifically, the authors observed a trend of increasing intensity over time \u2014 and the stronger the storm, the more pronounced that trend appeared.\nFor the most intense nor'easters \u2014 those in the top 1% \u2014 the researchers observed an increase over the 85-year study period from peak wind speeds of around 69 mph (111 km/h) to roughly 74 mph (119 km/h). This is an increase of about 6 percent, which might seem modest \u2014 but Mann said it corresponds to a \"sizable\" increase of roughly 20% in the destructive potential of these storms.\nThe trends the researchers observed regarding intensity and precipitation rates among the strongest nor'easters have likely been driven by increases in ocean temperatures and the higher capacity of a warming atmosphere to hold moisture, according to the researchers.\nAllison Michaelis, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth, Atmosphere, and Environment at Northern Illinois University who was not involved in the PNAS study, told Live Science that the latest research adds \"important\" context regarding historical nor'easter trends.\n\"Previous studies that have examined nor'easters, or East Coast storms more generally, are more limited in scope,\" she said. \"The most practical implication, as noted by the authors, is the potential for an increased risk of coastal flooding along the East Coast,\" which would directly impact people, property and infrastructure in the region.\nCounterintuitively, stronger nor'easters may also raise the possibility of increased winter cold-air outbreaks in inland regions along the U.S. East Coast. This is because these storms can pull cold air down from the North, as was the case in the Mid-Atlantic region with the January 2018 blizzard.\n\"The potential for greater likelihood of future super-nor'easters, akin to the 1993 Storm of the Century and Feb 2010 Snowmaggedon \u2026 portends prospects of paralyzing snowfalls, dangerous storm surges, and episodic cold extremes, underscoring the urgent need for coordinated efforts to assess and mitigate the devastating impacts of future such storms,\" the authors wrote in the paper.\nEdmund Chang, a professor in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University who was not involved with the study, told Live Science the latest research was largely well conducted, with the data supporting the conclusions.\nPrevious studies published by Chang and colleagues have predicted that there will be an increase in the intensity of storms close to the northeastern U.S. under warming, meaning the number of strong storms is projected to increase over that region.\n\"The results of [the PNAS] paper are consistent with those projections, but might suggest that the proposed increase in storm intensity over this region is appearing earlier than climate models predict,\" Chang said.\nEditor's note: This article was updated at 12:37 p.m. ET to correct the headline and summary, which previously stated nor'easters have become 20% more destructive.\nAristos is a freelance science reporter who has previously worked for Newsweek, IBTimes UK and The World Weekly.

      "text": "Impacts of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a on the hurricane season\nWith the approach of the 2014 hurricane season and the strong potential for El Ni\u00f1o to develop during the next few months, the effect that El Ni\u00f1o has on both the Atlantic and Pacific hurricanes seasons is worth exploring. The hurricane impacts of El Ni\u00f1o and its counterpart La Ni\u00f1a are like a see-saw between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, strengthening hurricane activity in one region while weakening it in the other.\nSimply put, El Ni\u00f1o favors stronger hurricane activity in the central and eastern Pacific basins, and suppresses it in the Atlantic basin (Figure 1). Conversely, La Ni\u00f1a suppresses hurricane activity in the central and eastern Pacific basins, and enhances it in the Atlantic basin (Figure 2).\nThese impacts are primarily caused by changes in the vertical wind shear, which refers to the change in wind speed and direction between roughly 5,000-35,000 ft. above the ground. Strong vertical wind shear can rip a developing hurricane apart, or even prevent it from forming.\nENSO perturbs tropical and subtropical atmospheric circulation\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, the area of tropical Pacific convection and its associated Hadley circulation expand eastward from the western Pacific, sometimes extending to the west coast of South America. (A tutorial on El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a can be found at the NOAA Climate Prediction Center website.) At the same time, the equatorial Walker circulation is weaker than average.\nThese conditions produce an anomalous upper-level, ridge-trough pattern in the subtropics, with an amplified ridge over the subtropical Pacific in the area north of the enhanced convection, and a downstream trough over the Caribbean Sea and western tropical Atlantic. Over the central and eastern Pacific, the enhanced subtropical ridge is associated with weaker upper-level winds and reduced vertical wind shear, which favors more hurricane activity.\nOver the Atlantic basin, the amplified trough is associated with stronger upper-level westerly winds and stronger lower-level easterly trade winds, both of which increase the vertical wind shear and suppress hurricane activity. In addition to enhanced vertical wind shear, El Ni\u00f1o suppresses Atlantic hurricane activity by increasing the amount of sinking motion and increasing the atmospheric stability.\nLa Ni\u00f1a has opposite impacts across the Pacific and Atlantic basins. During La Ni\u00f1a, the area of tropical convection and its Hadley circulation is retracted westward to the western Pacific and Indonesia, and the equatorial Walker circulation is enhanced. Convection is typically absent across the eastern half of the equatorial Pacific.\nIn the upper atmosphere, these conditions produce an amplified trough over the subtropical Pacific in the area north of the suppressed convection, and a downstream ridge over the Caribbean Sea and western tropical Atlantic. Over the central and eastern subtropical Pacific, the enhanced trough is associated with stronger upper-level winds and stronger vertical wind shear, which suppress hurricane activity. Over the Atlantic basin, the anomalous upper-level ridge is associated with weaker upper- and lower- level winds, both of which reduce the vertical wind shear and increased hurricane activity. La Ni\u00f1a also favors increased Atlantic hurricane activity by decreasing the amount of sinking motion and decreasing the atmospheric stability.\nENSO phases interact with other climate patterns that influence hurricanes\nAnother prominent climate factor to influence Atlantic hurricane activity is the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) (Goldenberg et al. 2001, Bell and Chelliah 2006). The warm phase of the AMO is associated with high-activity eras for Atlantic hurricanes, such as has been in place since 1995. Conversely, the cold phase of the AMO is associated with low-activity eras (such as the period 1971-1994).\nThe warm phase of the AMO reflects warmer SSTs across the Atlantic hurricane Main Development Region (MDR, Figure 3). A key atmospheric feature of this pattern is a stronger West African monsoon, which produces a westward extension of the upper-level easterly winds (near 35,000 ft), along with weaker easterly trade winds in the lower atmosphere (near 5,000 ft).\nThis wind pattern is very conducive to increased Atlantic hurricane activity, partly because it results in weaker vertical wind shear. The weaker trade winds also contribute to a more conducive structure (i.e. increased cyclonic shear) of the mid-level (near 10,000 ft) African Easterly Jet (AEJ), favoring hurricane development from tropical cloud systems (i.e. easterly waves) moving westward from Africa. At the same time, these wind patterns are associated with a more northward push into the MDR of deep tropical moisture and unstable air, each of which also favors stronger hurricanes.\nThe hurricane activity in a given season often reflects a combination of the multi-decadal signals and ENSO. During an Atlantic high-activity era, El Ni\u00f1o typically results in a near-normal season, and La Ni\u00f1a produces an above-normal season. During an Atlantic low-activity era, El Ni\u00f1o typically results in a below-normal season and La Ni\u00f1a results in a near-normal season (Bell and Chelliah 2006).\nSimilarly for the central and eastern Pacific basins, the combination of a low-activity era and El Ni\u00f1o often produces a near-normal season, while La Ni\u00f1a produces a below-normal season. For a Pacific high-activity era, El Ni\u00f1o often produces an above-normal season, while La Ni\u00f1a produces a near-normal season.\nThis year the expectation that El Ni\u00f1o will develop, combined with the multi-decadal climate signals results in a forecast for a near- or below-normal season in the Atlantic, and a near- or above-normal season in both the central and eastern Pacific.

      "text": "2024 was the hottest year on record, and the 1st to breach the 1.5 C global warming limit, data reveals\nScientists have warned that the Paris Agreement to limit global warming will likely be breached as data reveals 2024 was the hottest year in human history.\nFor the first time, global warming exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels in 2024, new data has shown. That makes 2024 the hottest year on record.\nEarth's average temperature in 2024 was around 2.9 F (1.6 C) above pre-industrial levels as greenhouse gas emissions hit an all-time high, according to the European Commission's Copernicus Climate Service.\nAnd the effects of climate breakdown, and the human suffering it causes, are already evident \u2014 in unprecedented heatwaves, storms, droughts, floods and wildfires witnessed around the world.\n\"We are now teetering on the edge of passing the 1.5\u00baC level defined in the Paris Agreement and the average of the last two years is already above this level,\" Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), said in a statement. \"These high global temperatures, coupled with record global atmospheric water vapour levels in 2024, meant unprecedented heatwaves and heavy rainfall events, causing misery for millions of people.\"\nGlobal warming of 2 C (3.6 F) is considered an important threshold, as warming beyond this greatly increases the likelihood of devastating and irreversible climate breakdown. This includes the collapse of most of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, extreme heat waves, severe droughts, water stress, and extreme weather across large parts of the globe.\nRelated: The most important and shocking climate stories of 2024\nAround 200 countries pledged to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 C or under in the 2015 Paris Agreement. As this target refers to an average taken over more than two decades, today's news doesn't mean the agreement is defunct, but it does make meeting the target perilously uncertain.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\"There's an extremely high likelihood that we will overshoot the long-term average of 1.5 C and the Paris Agreement limit,\" Burgess said at a news conference on Thursday (Jan 9.).\nLast year's record temperatures can be partly explained by El Ni\u00f1o, a climate cycle lasting between 9-12 months that causes waters in the eastern tropical Pacific to grow warmer than usual, affecting global weather patterns.\nHowever, following El Ni\u00f1o's end in April 2024, temperatures did not return to their previous averages \u2014 sparking debate among scientists about whether other weather patterns, cuts to shipping pollution, or reductions in cloud cover could be driving the apparent acceleration in global warming.\n\"Not every year is going to break records, but the long-term trend is clear,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York, said in a statement. \"We're already seeing the impact in extreme rainfall, heat waves, and increased flood risk, which are going to keep getting worse as long as emissions continue.\"\nIt's too early to say what this means for 2025. Global sea surface temperatures, which hit a record high in 2024, appear to now be cooling to more typical levels. And La Ni\u00f1a, El Ni\u00f1o's cooler counterpart, has developed in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, which should reduce temperatures further.\n\"All of the internationally produced global temperature datasets show that 2024 was the hottest year since records began in 1850,\" Carlo Buontempo, Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in the statement. \"Humanity is in charge of its own destiny but how we respond to the climate challenge should be based on evidence. The future is in our hands \u2014 swift and decisive action can still alter the trajectory of our future climate.\"\nBen Turner is a U.K. based staff writer at Live Science.

      "text": "Climate change: Facts about our warming planet\nDiscover important facts about what climate change is, what's causing it, and what we can do to stop it.\nHow much Earth has warmed since 1850: about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius)\nWhat causes climate change: Gases trapping heat in the atmosphere\nThe effects of a warming planet: Increased heat waves, flooding, wildfires, hurricanes and more\nClimate change is any long-term shift in average weather patterns. Climate change has occurred many times in Earth's history, and for many different reasons. The changes in global temperature and weather patterns seen today, however, are caused by things humans do, like driving cars or burning coal. And today's climate change is happening much faster than natural climate variations that occurred in the past.\nScientists have many ways to track the climate over time. These methods have made it clear that today's climate change is linked to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane.\nOn average, greenhouse gases increase global temperatures. This is why climate change is sometimes called global warming. However, most researchers today prefer the term \"climate change\" because weather and climate vary around the globe, so even if the world is hotter overall, some regions may actually get colder. For example, warming global average temperatures might alter the flow of the jet stream, the major air current that affects the weather in North America. This could lead to periods of extreme cold in some areas.\n5 fast facts about climate change\n- Since 1982, Earth has warmed 0.36 F (0.20 C) every decade.\n- About 3.6 billion people live in areas that make them highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n- Climate change could cost the world between $1.7 trillion and $3.1 trillion per year by 2050.\n- Scientists say that if Earth warms by more than 3.6 F (2 C), there will be disastrous outcomes.\n- Developing and low-income countries will be hit the hardest by climate change.\nEverything you need to know about climate change\nIs climate change real?\nScientists agree that climate change is real and caused by human activity. We can measure the effects of global warming because the climate of the past is recorded in ice, sediments, cave formations, coral reefs and even tree rings. Researchers can look at chemical signals \u2014 such as the CO2 trapped inside glaciers \u2014 to determine what atmospheric conditions were like in the past. They can study microscopic fossilized pollen to learn what vegetation used to thrive in any given area. Scientists can also measure tree rings to get a season-by-season record of temperature and moisture. Sediments in the ocean can even provide a window into what the climate was like millions of years ago.\nHumans started keeping their own detailed records of the climate during the industrial revolution, a period of rapid technological advancement beginning in the late 18th century. Measures of things like land temperature began to improve in the late 1800s, and ship captains started keeping a wealth of ocean-based weather data in their logs. The development of satellite technology in the 1970s provided an explosion of data, including how much ice there is at the poles, the temperatures at the ocean's surface, and cloud coverage.\nAll in all, these records show that Earth's global average temperature has increased by about 1.8 F (1 C) since the industrial revolution. Climate change has sped up in the past few decades, with the planet warming about 0.36 F (0.2 C) every 10 years.\nWhat causes climate change?\nClimate change is caused by greenhouse gases trapping heat in Earth's atmosphere. Greenhouse gases include CO2, methane and nitrous oxide. They are called greenhouse gases because they trap heat from the sun's rays near Earth's surface, much like the glass walls of a greenhouse keep heat inside. Small changes in the amounts of greenhouse gases in the air can add up to major changes on a global scale.\nThe burning of fossil fuels \u2014 such as coal, oil and natural gas \u2014 is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock, like cows and sheep, are also a source of greenhouse gases. Plants help scrub greenhouse gases from the air, so when people cut down trees across a large area, greenhouse gas emissions rise.\nBefore the industrial revolution, there were about 280 CO2 molecules for every million molecules in the atmosphere, or 280 parts per million (ppm). As of 2021, the global average level of CO2 was 419 ppm \u2014 more than 100 ppm higher than the level has been in the past 800,000 years. Carbon is also building up in the atmosphere faster than in the past. The heat-trapping ability of all that extra carbon has translated to rising global average temperatures. And the world is getting hotter, faster: Two-thirds of the warming that's taken place since 1880 has occurred since 1975.\nWhat are the effects of climate change?\nClimate change is creating a warmer world with rising sea levels and more dangerous weather. It is also messing up ecosystems around the world.\nSome of the most dramatic changes can be seen in the Arctic, where sea ice is melting. Even the oldest sea ice, which usually sticks around year after year, is getting thinner. Global sea ice levels hit a low in 2025, and scientists now think we could see the first summer with no ice in the Arctic sometime between 2040 and 2060.\nMelting ice has already caused seas to rise. The global average sea level has risen by 8 to 9 inches (21 to 24 centimeters) since 1880. For coastal areas of the U.S., this sea level rise has resulted in three to nine times more flooding when tides are high.\nClimate change is affecting the oceans, too. Ocean water absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, which creates a chemical reaction that causes ocean acidification. Ocean surface waters have become 30% more acidic since the beginning of the industrial revolution. When water is too acidic, corals can't build their carbonate skeletons, and shelled animals \u2014 such as clams and some types of plankton \u2014 can die.\nClimate change is even affecting when spring weather appears. Spring is arriving earlier in the United States. Climate models now suggest that early springs could be the norm by 2050. But late freezes will likely still occur, creating conditions in which plants could sprout leaves early in the season and then be damaged by cold temperatures.\nDroughts and wildfires will also likely become more common. Extreme wildfires have more than doubled worldwide, and fire seasons are getting longer and more intense. Climate models predict that droughts will become more frequent and last longer.\nCan we stop climate change?\nHumans have already triggered major changes to Earth's climate, but it's still possible to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change. To do that, we would need to slash greenhouse gas emissions.\nIf all human greenhouse gas emissions stopped immediately, Earth would likely continue to warm, because CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Some scientists have proposed a system called carbon capture and storage \u2014 a method that removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 to fix this issue. Carbon capture and storage may be possible, but it's so expensive that it's currently unlikely to happen.\nEven if we could remove the carbon that's already in the atmosphere, preventing future warming requires humans to stop spewing greenhouse gases now. Slowing climate change is a collective effort that will require collaboration among countries, states and cities, as well as major adjustments to the way the world operates. The most ambitious effort to stop global warming so far is the Paris Agreement. This international treaty between 195 countries aims to keep warming below 3.6 F (2 C). So far, however, most countries are not meeting the goals they set for themselves. The U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2025, when Donald Trump began his second term as president.\nClimate change pictures\nWildfires\nClimate change is causing wildfire season to become longer and more intense.\nMelting glaciers\nGlaciers, such as this one in Iceland, are melting, which is contributing to sea level rise.\nRising sea levels\nRising sea levels, a major consequence of climate change, are already affecting Tierra Bomba Island, Colombia.\nExtreme weather\nClimate change is making extreme weather events such as hurricanes, flooding and heat waves more common.\nDiscover more about climate change\n\u2014Could climate change make humans go extinct?\n\u2014Which animals are most likely to survive climate change?\n\u2014What are the effects of global warming?\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nStephanie Pappas is a contributing writer for Live Science, covering topics ranging from geoscience to archaeology to the human brain and behavior.

With the exception of the easternmost Ni\u00f1o-1+2 index (+0.8\u00b0C), the latest weekly Ni\u00f1o SST index values ranged from -0.3\u00b0C to +0.0\u00b0C [Fig. 2]. Subsurface temperature anomalies in the eastern Pacific Ocean became weakly negative over the past month [Fig. 3], with below-average temperatures generally observed between 25- and 200-meters [Fig. 4]. Low-level wind anomalies were easterly over the east-central and eastern tropical Pacific, while upper-level wind anomalies were westerly over the west-central and eastern tropical Pacific. Convection remained enhanced over a small region of Indonesia and was suppressed over the western tropical Pacific [Fig. 5]. Collectively, the coupled ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical Pacific reflected ENSO-neutral.\nThe IRI predictions indicate ENSO-neutral is most likely to persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter 2025-26 [Fig. 6]. However, similar to last month, the North American Multi-Model Ensemble favors La Ni\u00f1a conditions for a short duration during the Northern Hemisphere fall and early winter. Based on this guidance and recent changes in the tropical Pacific, the forecast team narrowly favors La Ni\u00f1a thresholds being reached in three overlapping, 3-month seasons (Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index \u2264 -0.5\u00b0C during September-November, October-December, and November-January). In summary, ENSO-neutral is most likely through the late Northern Hemisphere summer 2025 (56% chance in August-October). Thereafter, a brief period of La Ni\u00f1a conditions is favored in the fall and early winter 2025-26 before reverting to ENSO-neutral [Fig. 7].\nThis discussion is a consolidated effort of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA's National Weather Service, and their funded institutions.

      "text": "January 2025 hottest on record despite US cold and La Ni\u00f1a\nLa Ni\u00f1a and record cold temperatures in the U.S. should have made Earth cooler, but January 2025 was still the hottest on record, with an average global warming of 3.15 F (1.75 C) above pre-industrial levels.\nLast month was the hottest January on record, climate scientists have announced \u2014 despite the onset of a cold climate pattern in the Pacific and parts of the U.S. experiencing record-breaking cold.\nGlobal surface air temperatures averaged 55.81 degrees Fahrenheit (13.23 degrees Celsius) in January 2025, up from 55.65 F (13.14 C) in 2024 \u2014 the previous hottest January on record. That increase isn't huge, but scientists expected temperatures to be cooler this year.\nEarth entered La Ni\u00f1a in January, which is the cold phase of a natural climate pattern called the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation cycle. The El Ni\u00f1o phase pushes global temperatures up, which happened in 2023 and 2024, while La Ni\u00f1a typically brings them down. However, the current La Ni\u00f1a arrived later than scientists expected and is unusually weak.\nThe unusually high temperatures in January 2025 continue an ominous trend of global warming. Last year was the hottest year on record and the first full year to breach 2.7 F (1.5 C) of warming above pre-industrial levels \u2014 the estimated average temperature between 1850 and 1900. World leaders previously agreed to limit warming to preferably below 2.7 F and well below 3.6 F (2 C) in the 2015 Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty.\nIn January this year, the warming was 3.15 F (1.75 C) above pre-industrial levels. This marks the 18th month out of the last 19 to exceed 2.7 F, according to a statement released by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\"January 2025 is another surprising month, continuing the record temperatures observed throughout the last two years, despite the development of La Ni\u00f1a conditions in the tropical Pacific and their temporary cooling effect on global temperatures,\" Samantha Burgess, the strategic lead for climate at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which implements the Copernicus program, said in the statement.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nU.S. colder than average\nWeather patterns vary across the planet, so a global increase in average temperature doesn't necessarily mean that every region experiences warming. Overall, the U.S. was colder than average in January, with thundersnow striking the East Coast and Midwest and historic snow storms coating the Deep South and Gulf Coast. However, dry conditions in Southern California contributed to the deadly wildfires that devastated Los Angeles, while places like Minnesota saw record-breaking warmth.\nWarmer-than-average temperatures were also reported north of the contiguous U.S. Alaska was 5 F (2.8 C) above average, The Washington Post reported. Northeastern and northwestern Canada were also relatively warm, according to the Copernicus program's statement.\nAcross the globe, Australia baked in historic heatwaves, while southern South America, Africa, Antarctica, Siberia and parts of Europe all experienced mostly above-average temperatures.\nGlobal warming is primarily attributed to humans releasing record amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, according to a statement released by the United Nations. Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084) and other greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.\nClimate change threatens billions of people. The effects of global warming include fueling extreme weather such as wildfires; raising sea levels that threaten coastal communities; and drying agricultural lands, which in turn compromises humanity's ability to grow food.

      "text": "Earth appears to be developing new never-before-seen human-made seasons, study finds\nSeasons are more than just divisions of time \u2014 they are our connection with nature.\nThroughout history, people have viewed seasons as relatively stable, recurrent blocks of time that neatly align farming, cultural celebrations and routines with nature's cycles. But the seasons as we know them are changing. Human activity is rapidly transforming the Earth, and once reliable seasonal patterns are becoming unfamiliar.\nIn our recent study, we argue that new seasons are surfacing. These emergent seasons are entirely novel and anthropogenic (in other words, made by humans).\nExamples include \"haze seasons\" in the northern and equatorial nations of south-east Asia, when the sky is filled with smoke for several weeks. This is caused by widespread burning of vegetation to clear forests and make way for agriculture during particularly dry times of year.\nOr there is the annual \"trash season\", during which tidal patterns bring plastic to the shores of Bali, Indonesia, between November and March.\nAt the same time, some seasons are disappearing altogether, with profound consequences for ecosystems and cultures. These extinct seasons can encompass drastically altered or terminated migratory animal behavior, such as the decline of seabird breeding seasons in northern England.\nClimate change is also calling time on traditional winter sport seasons by making snow scarcer in alpine regions.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nNature's new rhythms\nPerhaps more common are \"syncopated seasons\". The changes are akin to new emphases on beats or off-beats in familiar music that capture the listener's attention.\nSyncopated seasons include hotter summers and milder winters in temperate climates, with increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather that exposes more people and ecosystems to stress.\nThe timings of key seasonal events, like when leaves fall or certain migratory species arrive, are becoming more unpredictable. We coined the term \"arrhythmic seasons\", a concept borrowed from cardiology, to refer to abnormal rhythms which include earlier springs or breeding seasons, longer summers or growing seasons, and shorter winters or hibernating seasons.\nChanging seasonal patterns throw the interdependent life cycles of plants and animals out of sync with each other, and disrupt the communities that are economically, socially and culturally dependent on them.\nIn northern Thailand, human activity has reshaped nature's rhythms and affected the supply of water and food in turn. Communities along the Mekong river's tributaries have relied on the seasonal flow of rivers to fish and farm for generations.\nAt first, upstream dams disrupted these cycles by blocking fish migration and preventing the accumulation of sediment that farms need for soil. More recently, climate change has shifted rainfall patterns and made dry seasons longer and rainy seasons shorter but more intense, bringing fires and further uncertainty to farmers.\nLet's rethink time\nHow we react to changing seasonal patterns can either worsen or improve environmental conditions. In south-east Asia, public awareness of the \"haze season\" has led to better forecasting, the installation of air filters in homes and the establishment of public health initiatives.\nThese efforts help communities adapt. But if society only uses adaptive fixes like these, it can make the haze worse over time by failing to tackle its root causes. By recognizing this new season, societies might normalize the recurrence of haze and isolate anyone who demands the government and businesses deal with deforestation and burning.\nPowerful institutions like these shape narratives about seasonal crises to minimize their responsibility and shift blame elsewhere. Understanding these dynamics is crucial to fostering accountability and ensuring fair responses.\nThe shifting seasons require us to rethink our relationship with time and the environment. Today, most of us think about time in terms of days, hours and minutes, which is a globalized standard used everywhere from smartphones to train timetables.\nBut this way of keeping time forgets older and more local ways of understanding time \u2014 those that are shaped by natural rhythms, such as the arrival of the rainy season, or solar and lunar cycles, rooted in the lives and cultures of different communities.\nDiverse perspectives, especially those from Indigenous knowledge systems, can enhance our ability to respond to environmental changes. Integrating alternative time-keeping methods into mainstream practices could foster fairer and more effective solutions to environmental problems.\nSeasons are more than just divisions of time \u2014 they connect us with nature.

      "text": "Scientists discover changes to the polar vortex that are plunging parts of US into deep freeze\nWhen the polar vortex stretches, North America feels the chill. New research reveals some of the stratospheric patterns controlling these cold snaps.\nThough global temperatures are warming, winters in the Northern Hemisphere are still marked by cold snaps and extreme snowfall events \u2014 sometimes to an unprecedented extent, such as the 2021 deep freeze in Texas and Oklahoma that caused over $1 billion in damage.\nNow, a new study suggests that these cold extremes are due to an increasingly common pattern in the polar vortex, the zone of low pressure that usually circulates over the Arctic. Disruptions to this vortex cause it to deform and stretch, spewing cold air into Canada and the U.S. These disruptions are becoming more common as the Arctic warms.\n\"Overwhelmingly, extreme cold and severe winter weather, heavy snowstorms and deep snow, are associated with these stretched events,\" study co-author Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research and a visiting scientist at MIT, told Live Science.\nCohen and his team looked at how these events evolve in the stratosphere, the middle layer of the atmosphere that starts about 12 miles (19 kilometers) up. Understanding how these patterns shift could help meteorologists make longer-range forecasts, said Andrea Lopez Lang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison who was not involved in the research.\n\"Knowing this information is useful for a lot of applications in energy [and] applications in insurance or reinsurance,\" Lang told Live Science. \"How cold is it going to get? Are pipes going to burst? Are insurance claims going to spike this winter?\"\nUsually, the polar vortex circulates around the North Pole like a spinning top. Occasionally, it collapses dramatically, which usually leads to polar air rushing toward northern Europe and Asia. These collapses can sometimes cause cold snaps in North America \u2014 but not always.\n\"There's been this big question mark over what happens in North America,\" Lang said.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nRelated: US suffers record-breaking cold: What's going on with the polar vortex?\nCohen and his colleagues looked at stratosphere data from satellite observations between 1980 and 2021, as well as winter weather records from the same period. They found that, short of total collapse, the polar vortex often wobbles and stretches, like a figure skater flinging out an arm for balance in a tricky spin. There were five different common patterns in the stratosphere, the researchers reported in the journal Science Advances on July 11, and two in particular were linked to cold weather dipping into Canada and the U.S. during these stretch events.\nStretch events are increasing in general, Cohen said, but there has also been a shift in the type of stretches.\nOne of the stratospheric patterns tends to bring cold air toward the East Coast, while the other creates a chill in the Midwest and Plains region. Since 2015, the researchers found, the westerly pattern has been more common. It's not entirely clear why, but this shift seems to be associated with La Ni\u00f1a, a pattern of unusually cold temperatures to the equatorial Pacific Ocean. In the last couple of decades, there have been multiple multiyear La Ni\u00f1a events.\nThe researchers were able to detect some regularities in the way the polar vortex shifts between the five patterns, which might help improve forecasts over the two- to six-week period, Cohen said. \"In that shorter range is the poorest accuracy,\" he said. \"This paper can be helpful in that timeframe.\"\nOne big question is how these polar vortex trends might change over time as the globe warms, Lang said.\nCohen and his team have been looking at that question as well. The polar vortex is controlled by waves in the atmosphere, he said, and right now the most influential standing wave is over Eurasia, with a warm ridge to the west and a cooler trough to the east, which in turn is driven by patterns of warming in the Arctic.\nCurrently, melting sea ice is increasing the temperature differences between west and east, strengthening the wave that can disrupt the vortex, Cohen said. If the sea ice disappeared, the pattern might collapse and flip. Instead of surprisingly cold winter events despite overall global warming, winter might suddenly become much toastier.\n\"We could become more like the Southern Hemisphere where you rarely get a breakdown of the polar vortex,\" Cohen said, \"and it would probably mean warmer midlatitudes and a colder Arctic.\"\nStephanie Pappas is a contributing writer for Live Science, covering topics ranging from geoscience to archaeology to the human brain and behavior.

Erin then weakened and strengthened again and, at the time of writing, is a Category 4 with sustained wind speeds of about 130 mph (215 km/h).\nThe tropical storm is located just east of the southeastern Bahamas and is expected to travel between Bermuda and the East Coast by the middle of the week, according to a National Hurricane Center (NHC) update, published Monday (Aug. 18). While Erin isn't set to make landfall, it will likely threaten coastlines with dangerous waves and flooding.\nOn Sunday (Aug. 17), the National Weather Service issued a coastal flood watch for the East Coast, with flooding forecast as early as Tuesday (Aug. 19). The Outer Banks islands off North Carolina are expected to be especially vulnerable. Dare County, which includes a large section of the Outer Banks, issued a state of emergency on Sunday with a mandatory evacuation order for Hatteras Island in anticipation of the flooding.\nAnd the buzzsawing-passage of the storm could give extra energy to wind-driven waves, giving them enough energy to reach enormous heights.\n\"The latest forecast does indeed indicate that the largest significant wave height could reach values in excess of 50 feet with an associated most likely largest wave of more than 100 feet,\" Jean Bidlot, an ocean and earth system modeling scientist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, told Newsweek.\nThe NHC also warned that the hurricane will lead to dangerous ocean conditions affecting the Bahamas, Bermuda, East Coast and Atlantic Canada over the next several days. \"These rough ocean conditions will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents,\" representatives wrote in the update.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nRelated: Here's why storm surge during hurricanes can be so catastrophic\nA hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone, or a rapidly rotating storm that forms over tropical oceans. For a tropical cyclone to be classed as a hurricane, it must generate maximum sustained wind speeds of 74 mph (119 km/h) or greater, according to NOAA. There are then an additional five categories of hurricanes, defined by increasing wind speeds from the 74 mph hurricane threshold (Category 1), all the way up to 157 mph (252 km/h) or higher (Category 5).\nHurricane Erin raced up the hurricane categories, from a Category 1 on Friday (Aug. 15) to a Category 5 on Saturday, making it one of the fastest intensifying storms in the history of the Atlantic, CNN Weather reported. The storm then weakend to a Category 3 on Sunday (Aug. 17), before picking up steam once more.\nMore hurricanes are rapidly-intensifying in the Atlantic as climate change causes atmospheric and sea temperature to soar. Since March 2023, average sea surface temperatures around the world have broken records, with warming waters adding extra energy to hurricanes as they grow.\nAs a Category 4, Erin is considered a major hurricane with sustained wind speeds of 130 to 156 mph (209 to 251 km/h) that would cause \"catastrophic damage\" to property, if there were any in its path. The hurricane also covers a large area, with its strong winds extending outward about 230 miles (370 km) and upwards about 80 miles (130 km), according to the NHC update.\nForecasters expect the hurricane to strengthen again on Monday, before experiencing some weakening overnight. However, regardless of this variation, Erin will continue to be a major hurricane that poses significant risks.\n\"Even though some weakening is forecast beginning tonight, Erin will remain a large and dangerous major hurricane through the middle of this week,\" NHC representatives wrote.\nPatrick Pester is the trending news writer at Live Science.

  "argos_summary": "The piece discusses the current weak and short\u2011lived La\u202fNi\u00f1a conditions that are unlikely to qualify as an official ENSO event, noting that forecasters expect only brief La\u202fNi\u00f1a spells before a return to neutral. It highlights how such a phase can boost Atlantic hurricane activity, citing the rapid intensification of Hurricane\u202fErin to Category\u202f5 and its potential impact on the U.S. East Coast. The article also reports a record\u2011length lightning \u201cmegaflash\u201d across five U.S. states, a massive wildfire in southern France that burned an area larger than Paris, and the continued rise of global temperatures despite La\u202fNi\u00f1a\u2019s cooling effect, with January\u202f2025 still the hottest on record. Finally, it touches on polar vortex disruptions that are driving extreme cold snaps in North America and the broader implications of climate change for weather extremes and seasonal patterns.",
