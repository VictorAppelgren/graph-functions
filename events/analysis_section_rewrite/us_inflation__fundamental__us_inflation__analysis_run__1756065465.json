      "feedback": "Strong start on a multi‑year horizon, but to reach world‑class quality you need a tighter, principle‑driven frame and disciplined source discipline. Actionable edits: (1) Replace the narrative with an explicit regime map anchored in first principles: invariants such as AI‑driven productivity (growth vs displacement), real rate differentials and policy reaction functions, terms of trade/BoP pressures from industrial reshoring, and net external position effects from tariff regimes; define regimes (A) AI‑led productivity upgrade with retraining, (B) tariff/industrial policy shock, (C) policy retrenchment or escalation, and (D) tariff relief or geopolitical realignment, with clear transition conditions (e.g., pace of automation, unemployment/wage signals, policy pivots). (2) Tie the causal chain explicitly to market pricing: AI adoption shifts supply‑side potential; consumer demand and credit constraints respond to safety nets; sectoral repricing (Ford‑type cyclicals, EV/AI capex beneficiaries) follows, with a defined transmission path from policy to capex to earnings to multiples. (3) Build a base case plus well‑defined catalysts/triggers/invalidation: catalysts include: major AI capex announcements and data‑center buildouts; visible retraining/workforce programs; tariff announcements or relaxations; earnings surprises in chip/EV supply chains; invalidation if productivity surprise is stronger than feared or if UBI/training programs meaningfully stabilize employment; (4) Quantify and triangulate with numbers from sources: cite Brookings’ 25% exposure (NL5YYTLF2) and Finland UBI trial outcomes (NL5YYTLF2), Ford’s 17% YTD 2025 rise and 5.18% dividend as near‑term income support (22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW), EV losses and margins (Ford’s Model E loss ~$1.3B; Q2 margin ~4.3% and ROIC ~10.1% per the Fool pieces—cite 22PL3Q360 and W2622L6WW), total return framing (4) to stress the cash‑flow basis; include real‑world retirement cost scales where relevant (YVQU6QCY4, GOBankingRates sources); (5) Clean up citation discipline: remove stray “(3)(11)” or “(12)” tokens and anchor every assertion to an actual SOURCE MATERIAL ID (e.g., NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, SGB2PAZGK, YVQU6QCY4, 4, 8–16 as their respective IDs), and reconcile conflicts (UBI efficacy vs. identity psychology; tariff inflation vs domestic investment stimulus) within the same framework rather than as side notes; (6) Improve structure and clarity: present a concise base‑case paragraph followed by a short “what to watch” list (AI capex, unemployment, wage dynamics, chip‑equipment spend, energy costs, tariff trajectories) and a risk matrix (policy missteps, faster fragmentation, geopolitical shocks). In short, tighten the linkage from invariant anchors through regime cases to market prices, back it with precise numbers from the sourced articles, fix citation integrity, and spell out explicit catalysts and invalidation points to elevate the piece to world‑class standard.",
