  "content": "Wasn\u2019t sure I should work on this during this week, because I was not sure the felon would still be in office or even alive. He appears seriously ill, what with the cankles, the bruising on his wrists, and the fakery being done to pretend he\u2019s still healthy. However, he made an appearance yesterday, in which he apparently punished Colorado for not loving him.\n\nEven if he is sick, he\u2019s still in power and the MSM is not always doing their job. Besides, it\u2019s not just the felon who does not want you to see these stories, it is all the evil people propping him up.\n\nWhen and if he does go, this feature (when/if I continue) will need to be retooled. In the meantime, here\u2019s this week\u2019s take. Help spread these bits, and, of course, add what you can.\n\nSpeaker Johnson closed down the House early in order not to deal with the Epstein files. Given how the felon has reacted to this whole business, there must be something serious in them.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has already demanded them.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s not just the Oversight Committee, but others in Congress, who are determined to get the files.\n\nAs we know, the felon\u2019s Department of Injustice is currently in charge of *the files* \u2014 but there are many other sources that could give information.\n\nA major source are the survivors of the crimes, with a press conference to be held today:\n\nHope it goes well. These women get threatened a lot, so I am concerned.\n\nAnyway, this story isn\u2019t getting buried, and I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re going to hear from the victims instead of the perpetrators and the accessories after the fact (those participating in the cover up).\n\nI really wish the MSM or someone could find out more. There are other sources.\n\nGiven how many crimes the felon has already gotten away with, I wonder what in these files bothers him so much?\n\nTHE WORLD HATES / IS LAUGHING AT THE FELON.\n\nThe felon has not made us stronger. In fact, he is deliberately weakening us, by destroying our relationships with allies and pandering to dictators and by using the armies to threaten citizens rather than, you know, actual threats. Because much of the rest of the world is less myopic about our politics, they can see better what he is doing.\n\nI think it only makes sense if he\u2019s trying to turn us all into serfs.\n\nI can\u2019t go through all the countries that he\u2019s hurting, but as an expat, I feel it. It\u2019s often embarrassing to be an American; I notice the loss of respect.\n\nThe felon has the weirdest relationship with Russia, or at least with Putin. You\u2019d think that becoming a billionaire on his own and being president of the world\u2019s most powerful country would reduce his Vladdy-Daddy issues, but that meeting in Alaska proved he\u2019s still in thrall.\n\nIt does not work both ways. Putin has no respect for the felon, which was so obvious at that meeting in Alaska. So much so that even the WH staff was freaked out by how poorly the felon did (this was mentioned in a recent Elephant in the Room podcast from Rick Wilson, and this long-time GOP operative certainly has sources in the GOP).\n\nAnd although Putin is trying to increase his influence \u2014 going after Vance \u2014 most Americans don\u2019t want to be Russians. Many heard for years how the Soviet Union was the enemy, and that sort of childhood brainwashing lingers, even in Maga brains.\n\nKos had a diary about how unhappy the families that took putin\u2019s offer to move there. Of course they discovered it was terrible. But one interesting thing was how few families did it: only two. Russia is not popular.\n\nThe felon has a huge tariff on India\u2019s products, because he\u2019s angry with Modi. Why? Because Modi wouldn\u2019t nominate him for the Nobel peace prize. Mujib Mashal, Anupreeta Das, Tyler Pager, New York Times\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India was losing patience with President Trump. Mr. Trump had been saying \u2014 repeatedly, publicly, exuberantly \u2014 that he had \u201csolved\u201d the military conflict between India and Pakistan, a dispute that dates back more than 75 years and is far deeper and more complicated than Mr. Trump was making it out to be. During a phone call on June 17, Mr. Trump brought it up again, saying how proud he was of ending the military escalation. He mentioned that Pakistan was going to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, an honor for which he had been openly campaigning. The not-so-subtle implication, according to people familiar with the call, was that Mr. Modi should do the same. The Indian leader bristled. He told Mr. Trump that U.S. involvement had nothing to do with the recent cease-fire. It had been settled directly between India and Pakistan. \u2702\ufe0f But what Mr. Trump wants most from Mr. Modi is a political nonstarter. If Mr. Modi were to be perceived as having caved to American pressure for a cease-fire with a weaker nation, the costs at home would be enormous. Mr. Modi\u2019s strongman identity depends, in large part, on how tough he is on Pakistan. Acknowledging that Mr. Trump had a role, let alone nominating him for a Nobel for it, would be seen as surrender. For Pakistan, which has found itself in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces recently, the decision to nominate him for the prize came quickly.\n\nThe felon was claiming that he\u2019s punishing India for continuing to buy Russian oil (unlikely). But it\u2019s really the lack of the nomination for the Nobel.\n\nNote here we have to acknowledge the NYT, which does good work when it chooses.\n\nBecause the felon is such an idiot \u2014 well, maybe not, if his goal is to promote Putin \u2014 we are much weaker in the world. People are laughing at him and are pitying the rest of us.\n\nHave done a couple of diaries on this subject, and it\u2019s coming Important because, well, the president\u2019s health is important but also need to weaken his image. And we need to be aware of it, because certainly other countries are counting on it and the WH is doing everything they can to hide it.\n\nThere are even rumors that he is dead! (Don\u2019t think so, not yet, anyway)\n\nBut he dodged the media (perhaps he had trouble talking). I saw another picture with his jaw hanging open. The other pictures of him supposedly playing golf have been dismissed, with just a wee bit of research, as photos from earlier occasions.\n\nWhether or not he\u2019s about to find out whether or not he\u2019s getting into heaven or not, this story weakens him. In 2015/2016 they kept harping about Clinton\u2019s cold and saying she was at death\u2019s door.\n\nI really appreciated this: Trump Must Resign Now Since Corporate Media Won\u2019t Call for His Resignation, I Will Allison Gill, Mueller She Wrote, from August 31\n\ntRump\u2019s tariffs are a bust. First, they have been ruled (again!) illegal Paul Wiseman, Lindsay Whitehurst AP\n\nHowever, the 159 billion is not what the convicted con artist is claiming. He is claiming that the US has taken in 8 trillion. From Caleb Naysmith, Yahoo Finance\n\nThe article notes there has been a rise in investments, but that this is due to investments in AI and not due to the deals that the felon has trumpeted but which do not push back.\n\nWe have had less job growth and threats of inflation:\n\nOf course, if the tariffs don\u2019t happen, then that source of inflation is gone. But the uncertainty makes it difficult for businesses to stock inventory, and the fact that immigrants are scared to work in fields right now are two sources of inflation that may not disappear even with the cancellation of tariffs.\n\nAnd, as SCOTUS tends to give the felon anything he wants, they may reverse the decisions of the lower courts.\n\nThis is my favorite, because it shows we are not taking this lightly.\n\n\ud83c\udfa9 zman157, for the DKOS diary on Citizen Patrols in DC. It shows how DC Night Patrols Are Showing How to Fight Trump\u2019s Occupation Dave Zirin and Chuck Modiano, The Nation, August 29\n\nWith only their cell phones, medical kits, and the confidence to assert their rights, volunteer night patrols follow and record the armed troops who have taken over the capital. These night patrols watch over the city to ensure that people are protected from state violence, false arrest, abduction, and harassment. Failing that, their goal is to document the constitutional violations or brutality they witness, so people can see the truths about the occupation that a compliant, largely incurious media are not showing. Their footage has gone viral and exposed the mainstream media\u2019s lies about how happy DC residents are to see the South Carolina National Guard marching by their kid\u2019s elementary school. \u2702\ufe0f This week a group of fed-up military veterans associated with the group FLARE USA, which stands for For Liberation And Resistance Everywhere, have joined in on the overnight cop-watch efforts. \u201cWe are also here to disrupt ICE Raids,\u201d retired marine Mathew Gordon told us. \u201cICE is kidnapping people off the streets, and we are doing everything they possibly can to make their lives miserable.\u201d These vets go to ICE checkpoints and pepper the agents with harsh questions on camera about the immorality and illegality of their actions until they leave. When FLARE vets approach National Guard members, they employ a calmer, less confrontational strategy, educating them about their rights to challenge orders they think could be illegal. Gordon said this was more effective since \u201cmost are much younger and don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d FLARE will have a series of actions next week.\n\nI was so excited to see this because I was hoping people were doing this: giving these military folk the idea that they do not need to obey unconstitutional orders\n\nCourts. The felon has been ruled against many times by courts; here\u2019s another:\n\nThe GOP\u2019s popularity is a reflection of the felon\u2019s.\n\nEveryone has heard about how Drey won in Iowa.\n\nBut we\u2019re overperforming in other special elections. \ud83c\udfa9 bilboteach\n\nAnd constituents are telling the GOP what they think, out loud and loud:\n\nFrom the linked article at Mother Jones, here are some of the reactions (my formatting):\n\nNote there are more examples.\n\nAnd here is the crowd for Bernie Sanders in Maine with Graham Platner, the D running against Susan Collins:\n\nMore to add? Please put in the comments.\n\n\ud83d\udc26 I do a lot of other writing. Newest offerings: Messing with the Myths \u2014 two books so far in this series. Older offerings: the Crow Nickels (chronicles), about crows who want to save birdkind from extinction (Hunters of the Feather). Mysteries based on Jane Austen\u2019s novels, such as The Meryton Murders. Others based on history and Greek mythology, e.g., Jocasta: The Mother-Wife of Oedipus.

      "text": "The DC Night Patrols Are Showing Cities How to Fight Trump\u2019s Occupation\nWith only their cell phones, medical kits, and the confidence to assert their rights, volunteer night patrols follow and record the armed troops who have taken over the capital.\nOccupied Washington, DC\u2014When the night comes, it is not just the National Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and a jumpy police department walking the streets. In an otherwise eerily quiet city, the people are present as well. Armed only with cell phones, medical kits, and the confidence to assert their dwindling rights, groups of local residents trail and record Trump\u2019s occupation forces. They\u2019re known as the night patrols.\nThese night patrols watch over the city to ensure that people are protected from state violence, false arrest, abduction, and harassment. Failing that, their goal is to document the constitutional violations or brutality they witness, so people can see the truths about the occupation that a compliant, largely incurious media are not showing. Their footage has gone viral and exposed the mainstream media\u2019s lies about how happy DC residents are to see the South Carolina National Guard marching by their kid\u2019s elementary school.\nThere is no centralized night-patrol planning committee. People in different groups don\u2019t necessarily know each other, but everyone with whom we spoke was either experienced in this kind of work through previous cop-watch trainings or are compelled by what is happening to play their part in making sure the foot soldiers of the surveillance state know they too are being surveilled.\nWhile we do not know the number of unconstitutional jailings that have happened over the last two weeks, the angry reactions of federal judges when these cases come before the bench speak to how violently careless, amateurish, and dangerous Trump\u2019s police state\u2019s conduct has been. This is unsurprising given that the chief DC prosecutor is another Fox News incompetent: the sloppy, allegedly soused Jeanine Pirro. We now have in DC a military fascism run as cheaply and poorly as one of Trump\u2019s failed casinos. If Trump were the fascist leader of Italy in the 1920s, the trains would not have run on time. (Unfortunately the Trump administration has also seized control of DC\u2019s Union Station, so set your watch to the coming ineptitude.) It\u2019s maddening, but people are pushing back, and the night patrols are on the front lines.\nEvery night patrol is different. One volunteer told us that it \u201cfluctuates depending on events and community needs. Different crews have their own rhythms.\u201d Sometimes that means groups are small\u2014maybe just three or four people\u2014and other times it means flooding the streets with rallies that turn into patrols when the speeches are done. Above all else, it is a commitment to peaceful, legal, and direct confrontation. The people who do night patrol work are serious, and if you volunteer, they expect you to know what you are doing or listen to those who do.\nWe spoke to night patroller Ash Lazarus Orr, who described the patrols as consisting of \u201ca lot of young people, a lot of people of color, queer and trans folks,people who have been directly impacted by policing, and folks with street medic backgrounds. It skews toward people who already know what it\u2019s like to be criminalized.\u201d\nThese efforts are supported by work going on across the city, including cop-watch trainings, court-watch trainings, \u201cknow your rights\u201d guides, handbooks on filming the police, and jail support by the Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network.\nThe patrols do more than just bear witness. Orr has had to bandage terrified people beaten by and fleeing DC\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, returning home at sunrise with his clothes stained with blood.\nAnother time, Orr said, he saw officers trying to arrest a man over a burned-out taillight \u201cwhile his two young children sat alone in the car, crying.\u201d \u201cThankfully,\u201d he explained, \u201cour group managed to put pressure on these officers [phone cameras out and ready], and they eventually let the man and his children go.\u201d That happens more often than you\u2019d think. Weapons and a free pass to beat people doesn\u2019t mean that they have the resolve to do this awful work when confronted with people with cameras.\nRecently a night patrol captured ICE and the MPD arresting without cause a Black corporate attorney and West Point graduate named Paul Bryant at 2:00 am in Logan Circle. The police and feds on the scene asked his name and why he was out at that hour. Bryant refused to answer, as is his right. He was released the next day after the judge excoriated the DC prosecutors. A lawsuit is now expected.\nThe night patrols are clearly making a difference. Many of the occupying forces have shifted their tactics from walking around and harassing people to a \u201cjump out\u201d strategy in which they stay in their cars until screeching to a halt and storming out to accost people. Their selections are, no doubt, driven by shameless racial profiling. No rights are read, no badges shown. When it\u2019s ICE, their faces are covered. These terrifying \u201cjump-outs\u201d are not new to Washington, DC; the DC Justice Lab has long called them \u201cDC\u2019s scarier version of stop-and-frisk.\u201d They are supposed to be unconstitutional. Yet it\u2019s a sign of the effectiveness of the night patrols that they are resorting to this tactic in order to avoid people\u2019s questions, cameras, and assertion of rights. The armed occupiers aren\u2019t defending the Constitution. They fear it.\nWhile one tactic is to work in smaller groups like Orr, another has been to mobilize cop-watch rallies or \u201cDefend the District\u201d go-go shows in order to draw in people\u2014especially youth\u2014for larger showings of strength. \u201cGo-go is the native music of Washington, DC,\u201d one attendee told us. \u201cThis music has been used for our resistance time and time again.\u201d\nThe attendee added that there is \u201cjoy in the revolution,\u201d and that it is important to show the occupation forces that they are unafraid: \u201cThere are police everywhere. We are outside. We are not scared of you. This is our home!\u201d\nAt one such event, Frankie Seabron, an organizer with Harriet\u2019s Wildest Dreams (HWD) said, \u201cWe need to keep Black people in this city safe. We need to keep youth, migrants, and our unhoused people safe. Because those are the people who this fascist system is targeting.\u201d\nPopular\n\u201cswipe left below to view more authors\u201dSwipe \u2192Last Saturday, the DC Against Trump Coalition (DCAT) started a rally at 14th and U in one of DC\u2019s curfew zones, where minors are barred from gathering after 8 pm, allowing police to target Black youths as soon as the sun goes down. The event ended with groups of protesters patrolling different areas of DC up until 4 am.\nThis is becoming its own method of organizing. During the last week, the night patrols have grown in number and frequency. They often occur after mobilizing rallies from organizations and coalitions like FreeDC, HWD, DCAT, and the independent DC media group Liberation Lens. It can be dizzying keeping up, but FreeDC\u2019s calendar is a good start.\nThis week a group of fed-up military veterans associated with the group FLARE USA, which stands for For Liberation And Resistance Everywhere, have joined in on the overnight cop-watch efforts. \u201cWe are also here to disrupt ICE Raids,\u201d retired marine Mathew Gordon told us. \u201cICE is kidnapping people off the streets, and we are doing everything they possibly can to make their lives miserable.\u201d These vets go to ICE checkpoints and pepper the agents with harsh questions on camera about the immorality and illegality of their actions until they leave.\nWhen FLARE vets approach National Guard members, they employ a calmer, less confrontational strategy, educating them about their rights to challenge orders they think could be illegal. Gordon said this was more effective since \u201cmost are much younger and don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d FLARE will have a series of actions next week.\n\u201cWe feel that deploying the US military to the streets of Washington, DC, to police our own citizens is unconstitutional,\u201d Gordon told us. \u201cWe took an oath to support and defend this country against all enemies foreign and domestic\u2014that is our oath, and that oath doesn\u2019t expire.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a common and familiar refrain at protests, which in DC has become more than slogan\u2014it\u2019s an organizing principle. Ty Hopson Powell at the Defend the District go-go rally repeated it to us as he explained the importance of grassroots organizing: \u201cIt is us that will save us! It is the message that we have been saying on the streets for years as frontline organizers who are the most invested in this work. WE WILL SAVE US! They won\u2019t save us.\u201d\nLocal government institutions certainly will not, as Washington\u2019s Mayor Muriel Bowser has made perfectly clear. Even though 80 percent of the city feels \u201cless safe\u201d since the occupation began, Bowser is in open collaboration with Trump, praising him earlier this week for what she pointedly calls \u201cthe surge\u201d and undercutting not only the people she represents but also other cities facing down this regime\u2019s threats to make urban militarization the new normal.\nThe failures of Bowser and the city government to stand up for its residents means Powell\u2019s words have never rang truer. No one is coming to save the people in DC\u2014and yet, no one should bet against the people of DC saving themselves. \u201cWhat does keep us safe is people showing up for one another,\u201d said Orr. \u201cCop watch, night patrols, mutual aid\u2014these are ways communities step in to protect each other when institutions only cause harm. When we document, de-escalate, offer medical care, or simply stand beside someone in crisis, we\u2019re proving that safety comes from solidarity, not surveillance.\u201d\nDoing this kind of work empowers communities, and the videos expose the truth of life under occupation more effectively than a thousand empty speeches. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about individuals playing hero,\u201d said Barr. \u201cIt\u2019s about collective accountability and care. The most important thing is to start where you are, with the skills and resources you already have.\u201d"

      "text": "Court finds Trump\u2019s tariffs an illegal use of emergency power, but leaves them in place for now\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Donald Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs on almost every country on earth but left in place for now his effort to build a protectionist wall around the American economy.\nThe ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found Trump overstepped his authority under an emergency powers law, a major legal blow that largely upheld a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York.\n\u201cIt seems unlikely that Congress intended to \u2026 grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\u201d the judges wrote in a 7-4 ruling.\nBut they did not strike down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration until mid-October to appeal to the Supreme Court.\nThe president vowed to do just that. \u201cIf allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform.\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said Trump had acted lawfully, and \u201cwe look forward to ultimate victory on this matter.\u201d\nAn attorney for small businesses affected by the tariffs, meanwhile, said the ruling shows Trump doesn\u2019t have unlimited power to impose tariffs on his own. \u201cThis decision protects American businesses and consumers from the uncertainty and harm caused by these unlawful tariffs,\u201d said Jeffrey Schwab, director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center.\nStill, it remains unclear whether businesses will see any effects from the decision, said National Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin.\n\u201cIf these tariffs are ultimately struck down, it ought to serve as a wake up call for Congress to reclaim its constitutional mandate to regulate duties and bring some long-term certainty for U.S. businesses and relief for consumers,\u201d Colvin said.\nDemocratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said he plans to force votes on \u201crepealing these harmful, regressive taxes at every opportunity.\u201d\nPutting pressure on allies\nThe ruling complicates Trump\u2019s ambitions to upend decades of American trade policy completely on his own. Trump has alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act. His tariffs \u2014 and the erratic way he\u2019s rolled them out \u2014 have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.\nBut he\u2019s also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting one-sided trade deals and to bring tens of billions of dollars into the federal Treasury to help pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\n\u201cThe administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy,\u201d Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.\nA dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday\u2019s ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \u201cis not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions,\u201d which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariff authorities to the president.\nThe government has argued that if the tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it\u2019s collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.\nRevenue from tariffs now totals $159 billion, more than double what it was at the same point the year before. Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \u201cfinancial ruin\u201d for the United States.\n\u201cFor all the tariffs that have been collected under IEEPA, you\u2019re going to see folks request refunds and more refunds,\u201d said trade attorney Ryan Majerus, a partner at King & Spalding and a former White House economic adviser.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, accused the judges of interfering with the president\u2019s central role in foreign policy and vowed to appeal.\nWhat tariffs are in question\nThe ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA):\n\u2014 The sweeping tariffs he announced April 2 \u2014 \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d he called it \u2014 when he imposed \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits and a \u201cbaseline\u201d 10% tariff on just about everyone else. Those tariff rates have since been revised by Trump, in some cases after trade negotiations, and generally went into effect Aug. 7.\nThe national emergency underlying the tariffs, Trump said, was the long-running gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from the rest of the world. The president started to levy modified tariff rates in August, but goods from countries with which the U.S. runs a surplus also face the taxes.\n\u2014 The \u201ctrafficking tariffs\u201d he announced Feb. 1 on imports from Canada, China and Mexico and later refined. These were designed to get those countries to do more to stop what he declared a national emergency: the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants across their borders into the United States. The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over the decades, lawmakers have ceded authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.\nBut Trump\u2019s assertion that IEEPA essentially gives him unlimited power to tax imports quickly drew legal challenges \u2014 at least seven cases. No president had ever used the law to justify tariffs, though IEEPA had been used frequently to impose export restrictions and other sanctions on U.S. adversaries such as Iran and North Korea.\nThe plaintiffs argued that the emergency power law does not authorize the use of tariffs.\nThey also noted that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u201d threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits \u2014 in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them \u2014 for 49 straight years and in good times and bad.\nEmergency powers\nThe Trump administration argued that courts approved President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis that arose from the chaos that followed his decision to end a policy linking the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With the Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA.\nIn May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs \u201cexceed any authority granted to the President\u201d under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.\nIn the case of the drug trafficking and immigration tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, the trade court ruled that the levies did not meet IEEPA\u2019s requirement that they \u201cdeal with\u201d the problem they were supposed to address.\nThe court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.\nNor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Joe Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.\nTrump could potentially cite alternative authorities to impose import taxes, though they are more limited. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for instance, allows the president to tax imports from countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits at 15% for 150 days.\nLikewise, Section 301 of the same 1974 law allows the president to tax imports from countries found to have engaged in unfair trade practices after an investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Trump used Section 301 authority to launch his first-term trade war with China.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Mark Sherman and Josh Boak contributed to this story."

The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York. But the 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe ruling was a big setback for Trump, whose erratic trade policies have rocked financial markets, paralyzed businesses with uncertainty and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.\nWhich tariffs did the court knock down?\nThe court\u2019s decision centers on the tariffs Trump slapped in April on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.\nTrump on April 2 \u2014 Liberation Day, he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.\nThe president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the United States \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did \u2014 including the United Kingdom, Japan and the European Union \u2014 and agreed to lopsided deals with Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.\nThose that didn\u2019t knuckle under \u2014 or otherwise incurred Trump\u2019s wrath \u2014 got hit harder earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.\nClaiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval, Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act by declaring the United States\u2019 longstanding trade deficits \u201ca national emergency.\u201d\nIn February, he\u2019d invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the U.S. border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.\nThe U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Trump has made the most of it.\nThe court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.\nNor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Joe Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.\nWhy did the court rule against the president?\nThe administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.\nIn May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs \u201cexceed any authority granted to the President\u2019\u2019 under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.\nOn Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \u201cit seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\u201d\nA dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday\u2019s ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \u201cis not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions,\u201d which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.\nSo where does this leave Trump\u2019s trade agenda?\nThe government has argued that if Trump\u2019s tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it\u2019s collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before. Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \u201cfinancial ruin\u201d for the United States.\nIt could also put Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.\n\u201cWhile existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,\u201d Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.\nThe president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. \u201cIf allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\u201d he wrote on his social media platform.\nTrump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act. For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.\nThe administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and autos. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot simply be imposed at the president\u2019s own discretion."

      "text": "Over the weekend, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster authorized the deployment of 200 South Carolina National Guard troops to participate in President Donald Trump\u2019s federal takeover of Washington, D.C.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard is an intimidation tactic by an authoritarian administration, and Governor McMaster is complicit,\u201d said ACLU of South Carolina Executive Director Jace Woodrum. \u201cThe President has once again demonstrated his willingness to use our military against our country\u2019s own people. Governor McMaster is empowering this extraordinary abuse of power instead of keeping our troops at home where they\u2019re needed.\u201d\nThe Trump administration called National Guard units to the nation\u2019s capital last week under the pretext of crime control, despite violent crime in the District being at a 30-year low. The Wall Street Journal has reported that National Guard troops may receive orders \u201cto start carrying weapons in the coming days.\u201d As the national ACLU has warned, National Guard troops are generally not trained in local policing or de-escalation and should never be used for federal immigration purposes.\nThe ACLU of the District of Columbia has also condemned the actions of the Trump administration and of the governors who authorized National Guard deployments to Washington D.C. In a statement on Sunday, ACLU of the District of Columbia Executive Director Monica Hopkins said the following:\n\u201cThe deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops and more federal agents onto D.C. streets is a brazen abuse of power meant to intimidate and create fear in the nation\u2019s capital. This is an unnecessary overstep to micromanage D.C. under a phony emergency, causing real harm to residents and visitors \u2014 all to advance the Trump administration\u2019s political agenda. The ACLU-D.C. will continue to monitor the use of D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure that the constitutional rights of our community are protected. We need the nation to join us in the fight for statehood so that D.C. residents are treated like those in every other state and have the same guardrails against federal overreach.\u201d"

      "text": "Federal court blocks Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs under emergency powers law\nFederal court blocks Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs under emergency powers law\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal court on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law, swiftly throwing into doubt Trump\u2019s signature set of economic policies that have rattled global financial markets, frustrated trade partners and raised broader fears about inflation intensifying and the economy slumping.\nThe ruling from a three-judge panel at the New York-based U.S. Court of International Trade came after several lawsuits arguing Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs exceeded his authority and left the country\u2019s trade policy dependent on his whims.\nTrump has repeatedly said the tariffs would force manufacturers to bring back factory jobs to the U.S. and generate enough revenue to reduce federal budget deficits. He used the tariffs as a negotiating cudgel in hopes of forcing other nations to negotiate agreements that favored the U.S., suggesting he would simply set the rates himself if the terms were unsatisfactory.\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said that trade deficits amount to a national emergency \u201cthat has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base \u2014 facts that the court did not dispute.\u201d\nThe administration, he said, remains \u201ccommitted to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.\u201d\nBut for now, Trump might not have the threat of import taxes to exact his will on the world economy as he had intended, since doing so would require congressional approval. What remains unclear is whether the White House will respond to the ruling by pausing all of its emergency power tariffs in the interim.\nTrump might still be able to temporarily launch import taxes of 15% for 150 days on nations with which the U.S. runs a substantial trade deficit. The ruling notes that a president has this authority under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974.\nThe ruling amounted to a categorical rejection of the legal underpinnings of some of Trump\u2019s signature and most controversial actions of his four-month-old second term. The administration swiftly filed notice of appeal \u2014 and the Supreme Court will almost certainly be called upon to lend a final answer \u2014 but it casts a sharp blow.\nThe case was heard by three judges: Timothy Reif, who was appointed by Trump, Jane Restani, named to the bench by President Ronald Reagan and Gary Katzmann, an appointee of President Barack Obama.\n\u201cThe Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,\u201d the court wrote, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\nThe ruling left in place any tariffs that Trump put in place using his Section 232 powers from the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. He put a 25% tax on most imported autos and parts, as well as on all foreign-made steel and aluminum. Those tariffs depend on a Commerce Department investigation that reveals national security risks from imported products.\nIt was filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal court that deals specifically with civil lawsuits involving international trade law.\nWhile tariffs must typically be approved by Congress, Trump has said he has the power to act to address the trade deficits he calls a national emergency.\nHe is facing at least seven lawsuits challenging the levies. The plaintiffs argued that the emergency powers law does not authorize the use of tariffs, and even if it did, the trade deficit is not an emergency because the U.S. has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years.\nTrump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America\u2019s massive and long-standing trade deficits. He earlier plastered levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.\nHis administration argues that courts approved then-President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the \u201cpolitical\u201d question of whether the president\u2019s rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law.\nTrump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for U.S. economic growth. So far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world\u2019s largest economy.\nThe lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, V.O.S. Selections, whose owner has said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive.\nA dozen states also filed suit, led by Oregon. \u201cThis ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can\u2019t be made on the president\u2019s whim,\u201d Attorney General Dan Rayfield said.\nOregon Sen. Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the tariffs had \u201cjacked up prices on groceries and cars, threatened shortages of essential goods and wrecked supply chains for American businesses large and small.\u2033\n___\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller and Paul Wiseman contributed to this story.\n___\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the last name of Judge Gary Katzmann, from Katzman in earlier versions of the story."

One CEO calls it \u2018end of days\u2019\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Rick Woldenberg thought he had come up with a sure-fire plan to protect his Chicago-area educational toy company from President Donald Trump\u2019s massive new taxes on Chinese imports.\n\u201cWhen he announced a 20% tariff, I made a plan to survive 40%, and I thought I was being very clever,\u201d said Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a third-generation family business that has been manufacturing in China for four decades. \u201cI had worked out that for a very modest price increase, we could withstand 40% tariffs, which was an unthinkable increase in costs.\u201d\nHis worst-case scenario wasn\u2019t worst-case enough. Not even close.\nThe American president quickly upped the ante with China, raising the levy to 54% to offset what he said were China\u2019s unfair trade practices. Then, enraged when China retaliated with tariffs of its own, he upped the levies to a staggering 145%.\nWoldenberg reckons that will push Learning Resource\u2019s tariff bill from $2.3 million last year to $100.2 million in 2025. \u201cI wish I had $100 million,\u201d he said. \u201cHonest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days.\u201d\n\u2018Addicted\u2019 to low-price Chinese goods\nIt might at least be the end of an era of inexpensive consumer goods in America. For four decades, and especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, Americans have relied on Chinese factories for everything from smartphones to Christmas ornaments.\nAs tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2014 and geopolitical rivals \u2014 have risen over the past decade, Mexico and Canada have supplanted China as America\u2019s top source of imported goods and services. But China is still No. 3 \u2014 and second behind Mexico in goods alone \u2014 and continues to dominate in many categories.\nChina produces 97% of America\u2019s imported baby carriages, 96% of its artificial flowers and umbrellas, 95% of its fireworks, 93% of its children\u2019s coloring books and 90% of its combs, according to a report from the Macquarie investment bank.\nOver the years, U.S. companies have set up supply chains that depend on thousands of Chinese factories. Low tariffs greased the system. As recently as January 2018, U.S. tariffs on China averaged just over 3%, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\u201cAmerican consumers created China,\u201d said Joe Jurken, founder of the ABC Group in Milwaukee, which helps U.S. businesses manage supply chains in Asia. \u201cAmerican buyers, the consumers, got addicted to cheap pricing. And the brands and the retailers got addicted to the ease of buying from China.\u201d\nSlower growth and higher prices\nNow Trump, demanding that manufacturers return production to the U.S., is swinging a tariff sledgehammer at the American importers and the Chinese factories they rely on.\n\u201cThe consequences of tariffs at this scale could be apocalyptic at many levels,\u201d said David French, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Retail Foundation.\nThe Yale University Budget Lab estimates the tariffs that Trump has announced globally since taking office would lower U.S. economic growth by 1.1 percentage points in 2025.\nThe tariffs are also likely to push up prices. The University of Michigan\u2019s survey of consumer sentiment, out Friday, found Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.\n\u201cInflation\u2019s going up in the United States,\u201d said Stephen Roach, former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and now at Yale Law School\u2019s China Center. \u201cConsumers have figured this out as well.\u201d\n\u2018No business can run on uncertainty\u2019\nIt\u2019s not just the size of Trump\u2019s tariffs that has businesses bewildered and scrambling; it\u2019s the speed and the unpredictability with which the president is rolling them out.\nOn Wednesday, the White House said the tariffs on China would hit 125%. A day later, it corrected that: No, the tariffs would be 145%, including a previously announced 20% to pressure China to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.\nChina in turn has imposed a 125% tariff on the U.S. effective Saturday.\n\u201cThere is so much uncertainty,\u201d said Isaac Larian, the founder of MGA Entertainment, which makes L.O.L. and Bratz dolls, among other toys. \u201cAnd no business can run on uncertainty.\u201d\nHis company gets 65% of its product from Chinese factories, a share he is trying to winnow down to 40% by the end of the year. MGA also manufactures in India, Vietnam and Indonesia, but Trump is threatening to levy heavy tariffs on those countries, too, after delaying them for 90 days.\nLarian estimates the price of Bratz dolls could go from $15 to $40 and L.O.L. dolls could double to $20 by this year\u2019s holiday season.\nEven his Little Tikes brand, which is made in Ohio, is not immune. Little Tikes depends on screws and other parts from China. Larian figures the price for its toy cars could rise to $90 from a suggested retail price of $65.\nMGA would likely cut orders for the fourth quarter because he is worried that higher prices will scare off consumers, he said.\nCalling off China production plans\nMarc Rosenberg, founder and CEO of The Edge Desk in Deerfield, Illinois, invested millions of dollars of his own money to develop $1,000 ergonomic chairs, which were to start production in China next month.\nNow he is delaying production while exploring markets outside the U.S., including Germany and Italy, where his chairs would not face Trump\u2019s triple-digit tariffs. He said he wants to see how the situation plays out.\nHe had looked for ways to make the chairs in the U.S. and had discussions with potential suppliers in Michigan, but the costs would have been 25% to 30% higher.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the skilled labor to do this stuff, and they didn\u2019t have the desire to do it,\u201d Rosenberg said.\nMaking Chinese imports go \u2018kaput\u2019\nWoldenberg\u2019s company in Vernon Hills, Illinois, has been in the family since 1916. It was started by his grandfather as a laboratory supply company and evolved over the years into Learning Resources.\nThe company specializes in educational toys such as Botley: The Coding Robot and the brainteaser Kanoodle. It employs about 500 people \u2014 90% in the U.S. \u2014 and makes about 2,400 products in China.\nWoldenberg is reeling from the size and suddenness of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\u201cThe products I make in China, about 60% of what I do, become economically unviable overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an instant, snap of a finger, they\u2019re kaput.\u201d\nHe described Trump\u2019s call for factories to return to the U.S. as \u201ca joke.\u201d\n\u201cI have been looking for American manufacturers for a long time ... and I have come up with zero companies to partner with,\u201d he said.\nThe tariffs, unless they are reduced or eliminated, will wipe out thousands of small Chinese suppliers, Woldenberg predicted.\nThat would spell disaster for companies like his that have installed expensive tools and molds in Chinese factories, he said. The stand to lose not only their manufacturing base but also possibly their tools, which could get caught up in bankruptcies in China.\nLearning Resources has about 10,000 molds, weighing collectively more than 5 million pounds (2.2 million kilograms), in China.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you just bring in a canvas bag, zip it up and walk out,\u201d Woldenberg said. \u201cThere is no idle manufacturing hub standing fully equipped, full of engineers and qualified people waiting for me to show up with 10,000 molds to make 2,000 products.\u201d\n___\nThis story has been corrected to indicate MGA Entertainment manufactures in Indonesia, not Cambodia.\n___\nD\u2019Innocenzio reported from New York."

      "text": "There is a genre of MAGA conservative so right wing, so brain dead, that they go through the immense hassle of moving themselves and their family to Russia\u2014where gay and transgender people supposedly don\u2019t exist, and \u2026 well, that appears to be the bulk of the motivation for fleeing. They imagine a utopia where \u201ctraditional values\u201d rule and \u201cwokeness\u201d is banished, even if it means embracing Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\nRussia hasn\u2019t just welcomed these ideological expats, it also markets itself as a refuge for them. In 2023, a Russian immigration lawyer publicly pitched a \u201cmigrant village\u201d outside Moscow, designed to house hundreds of American and Canadian families who want a life of wholesome, state-approved traditionalism. Russian media breathlessly claimed that about 200 families were eager to sign up.\nIn reality? By mid-2025, the grand vision had fizzled into just two occupied homes\u2014one of them belonging to a family you\u2019re about to meet\u2014and a PR stunt that played better on state TV than on the ground.\nPutin, of course, loves these Americans for propaganda purposes\u2014until the cameras stop rolling. Then he leaves them to fend for themselves in a country with a hostile climate, significant language, cultural, and legal barriers, and an economy best described as \u201cSoviet nostalgia with fewer working elevators.\u201d Let\u2019s meet a few of these true believers.\nThe Hare family\nLeo and Chantelle Hare decided they\u2019d had enough of the United States after encountering, in their words, \u201ctoo many lesbians\u201d in their children\u2019s school. In Russia, they saw a land free from LGBTQ+ \u201cindoctrination\u201d and overflowing with wholesome, patriarchal virtue.\nSo they sold everything, boarded a plane with their three kids, and landed in Russia\u2019s icy embrace, only to immediately run into a wall of bureaucracy. No housing. No work. No social safety net. They latched onto a series of local pastors and other samaritans for temporary shelter\u2014because socialism is apparently fine when it\u2019s keeping them warm and fed. They just call it \u201chospitality\u201d when it\u2019s for them.\nFor months, they ping-ponged from one free lodging to another, enjoying the sort of community aid they\u2019d denounce as \u201cwoke handouts\u201d if it came in the form of an American food stamp card. For all their rants about rejecting a \u201cnanny state,\u201d they traded the U.S. safety net they despise for a patchwork of Russian church basements and borrowed couches.\nThen, in a display of impeccable financial judgment, they invested nearly all their savings in a shady business scheme that\u2019s now collapsing. Instead of cutting their losses, they\u2019ve convinced themselves that divine providence will intervene. Actually, they think Putin himself will hear of their plight and personally step in to save them. Because nothing says \u201ceffective leader of a nuclear superpower\u201d like micromanaging the bad investment choices of a couple from Texas.\nThey seem to genuinely believe that, between murdering his neighbors and crushing dissent, Putin will carve out time in his schedule to track down some shady small-town grifter and get the Hares\u2019 money back. But if Putin can\u2019t do it, they\u2019ve got a backup plan: \u201cJesus is our lawyer.\u201d And he\u2019s probably the only attorney in Russia who will work for free.\nThe Huffman family\nTexan father of six Derek Huffman was done with America\u2019s \u201cwoke culture\u201d\u2014the \u201cLGBT indoctrination,\u201d the toxic dyes in food, the government overreach, and the, uh, discrimination they faced, in Texas, as a white family.\n\u201cAs a white family, [we were] being told we're racist and not given the same opportunities because of the colour of our skin,\" he said.\nBut that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. The Huffmans\u2019 world was turned upside down when his daughter learned about\u2014gasp!\u2014lesbians.\n\u201cThe final straw was when we found out my daughter Sophia learnt about lesbians from a girl in her class,\u201d Huffman told Russian state TV. \u201cShe didn\u2019t fully understand it, but for us, that was enough to realize something had to change.\u201d\nHis daughter clearly didn\u2019t care about the existence of lesbians, but apparently even Texas was too woke for Huffman. Seeking a purer, safer life, the family relocated to Russia under the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cshared values\u201d visa\u2014a three-year residency scheme pitched as a sanctuary for those fleeing \u201cdestructive neoliberal ideology.\u201d\n\u201cThe city was cleaner, safer, and more orderly than we ever imagined,\u201d Huffman gushed to Russian state media after a visit to Moscow. \u201cMost importantly, we found a place that respected our values\u2014where we finally felt at home.\u201d The family was one of the two ending up in the American Village.\nBut three years was too long to wait for citizenship, so Huffman decided to speed things up the Russian way: by joining the army. He signed up in May expecting a civilian post\u2014welding, maybe mechanics, or even a war correspondent gig\u2014anything to support his family without actually facing danger.\nInstead, this being Putin\u2019s Russia, everyone had a good laugh and handed him a rifle. With zero military experience and no Russian language skills, Huffman was rushed through basic training\u2014conducted entirely in a language he didn\u2019t understand\u2014and deployed near the Ukrainian front.\nHis wife DeAnna called it \u201cbeing thrown to the wolves,\u201d and said he hadn\u2019t been paid, while also being asked to \u201cdonate\u201d 10,000 rubles for supplies. And truly becoming Russian, DeAnna also admitted that she was a former alcoholic and had started drinking again due to the stress.\nIn June, Huffman posted a Father\u2019s Day message\u2014camouflage-clad, longing for home, promising he\u2019d \u201cdo whatever it takes to be safe and to come home to you.\u201d Months later, there\u2019s been no confirmed update, only periodic rumors of his death.\nAt one point, his family briefly launched a Telegram channel with a single post\u2014his wife and daughters in tears, pleading, \u201cWe are asking the United States government to save this family.\u201d It was quickly deleted, perhaps after they realized that President Donald Trump cared exactly as much about them as Putin does\u2014which is to say, absolutely nothing.\nThe Feenstra family\nArend and Anneesa Feenstra were Canadian farmers, but in their minds, the gay hordes loomed large, threatening the very existence of their large family.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t feel safe for our children there in the future anymore,\u201d said Arend on Russian state TV. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of left-wing ideology, LGBTQ+, trans, just a lot of things that we don\u2019t agree with that they teach there now, and we wanted to get away from that for our children.\u201d\nWith eight kids, the odds were decent at least one of them might eventually veer away from godly heterosexuality, so the Feenstras packed up and headed to Russia. But reality hit hard and fast.\nTheir first crisis? Using the restroom. \u201cI needed to use the washroom, and on the doors it said male and female, but I didn\u2019t know which was which!\u201d Anneesa recounted. Arend helpfully added, \u201cIn America, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem, it\u2019s free-for-all in the bathrooms, but now in our world it matters!\u201d Turns out, they\u2019d assumed every sign in Russia\u2014a country with its own language and alphabet\u2014would be in English.\nThey also hadn\u2019t considered that Russia gets cold in the winter\u2014an astonishing revelation for people who emigrated from Canada\u2014the country famous for hockey, snow, and temperatures that can freeze your eyelashes. Apparently, \u201ctraditional values\u201d don\u2019t include checking the weather. They soon needed charity from locals to stay warm, which they accepted without hesitation\u2014because when the freebies are for them, it\u2019s just good Christian fellowship, not the dreaded handouts they despise.\nThen came the financial hiccup: Russia doesn\u2019t accept Visa or Mastercard due to Ukraine War sanctions, and their new Russian bank account was frozen after a large transfer. The language barrier made it nearly impossible to fix.\nOn YouTube\u2014because of course they document every misstep online\u2014Anneesa broke down in tears. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in this country at this point. I\u2019m ready to jump on a plane and get out of here,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit the first snag where you have to engage logic in this country and it\u2019s very, very frustrating.\u201d\nBut Russia isn\u2019t the land of the free or the brave, and they quickly learned that public criticism of the country is not encouraged. The video vanished, replaced with a groveling apology: Anneesa hadn\u2019t meant she was disappointed in Russia, they clarified, just \u201cvery frustrated in this country right now.\u201d\nBy the time a Christian Science Monitor reporter visited, Arend had mastered the art of being a model subject of an authoritarian regime. Asked about Putin and Russia\u2019s political system, he dutifully avoided any criticism, instead echoing state propaganda. \u201cI have yet to meet anyone who doesn\u2019t like Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment here works together with the people for a common goal.\u201d\nThe Villa family\nOkay, this one isn\u2019t MAGA, but more of a victim of Russia\u2019s propaganda.\nFrancine Villa, a Black woman disillusioned by systemic racism and police violence in the U.S., decided the answer was to move somewhere she believed race didn\u2019t matter. That somewhere, according to her, was her birth country of Russia. She relocated in 2019 and quickly became a darling of Russian state media\u2014smiling in interviews, praising the country\u2019s racial harmony, and holding herself up as living proof that Western criticism of Russia was overblown. For the Kremlin, she was gold: a walking, talking rebuttal to accusations of Russian racism.\nBut propaganda stardom has a short shelf life. Once the photo ops were over, reality came crashing in. Her neighbors tried to prevent her from entering her apartment and attacked her\u2014beating her and her baby and shouting racial slurs. The police did nothing, of course. Not a report filed, not an arrest made.\nVilla later posted a video online showing her face swollen and bruised, eyes puffy from crying, detailing the attack and the official indifference. The country she\u2019d praised as a racial safe haven revealed itself as a place where racism isn\u2019t just tolerated, it\u2019s part of the furniture. Of course, she asks for \u201chelp,\u201d though who is supposed to render that aid in her racial utopia is unclear.\nVilla had fled a country with imperfect but existing civil rights protections for one where she had none\u2014and found herself abandoned by the very system she helped promote. In America, she might have had a lawyer. In Russia, maybe she should try the Hare family\u2019s approach and call Jesus."

      "text": "Trump Claims \u2018$8 Trillion in Tariff Revenue\u2019 Amid \u2018Hundreds of Thousands of New Jobs\u2019 in Confusing Labor Day Post\nThe official White House account on X (formerly Twitter) marked Labor Day with a celebratory post touting the success of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies. The post, however, quickly sparked confusion and scrutiny after it claimed that tariffs had generated \u201c$8 trillion in tariff revenue\u201d for the United States.\nThe image, featuring Trump outside the White House holding a signed document, included bold text reading, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies have helped drive more than $8 trillion in new U.S. investment, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs\u201d:\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nThis Quantum Computing Stock Is Poised to Dominate. Why Analysts Think You Should Buy It Here.\n-\nNetflix\u2019s (NFLX) Unusual Options Presents an Opportunity Before Its Volatility Skew Widens\nThe Numbers Don\u2019t Add Up\nThe main issue, however, is that $8 trillion in tariff revenue is highly implausible. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, total tariff collections during 2025 so far have amounted to $142 billion, however. While tariff revenues are on the rise, the amount is overstated by many multiples.\nBy contrast, $8 trillion would equal nearly a third of the U.S. GDP \u2014 an amount impossible to generate from tariffs in such a short period.\nThe image attached to the post is most likely a typo, as the original post states \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies have helped drive more than $8 trillion in new U.S. investment, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.\u201d\nMeaning the amount was likely supposed to represent the claimed $8 trillion in new investments coming into the U.S. While the total amount is difficult to confirm, it\u2019s similarly not clear what this is based on or when the money will be invested. Other claims have come in from the Trump Administration putting the number at \u201calmost $10 trillion.\u201d While the numbers might be inflated, there has been a notable increase in U.S.-based investments in recent months due to massive investments being made in artificial intelligence. And, notwithstanding any counterbalancing downsides, there have been massive investments made in the U.S. in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nOfficial Communications?\nThe discrepancy raises questions about the vetting of official White House communications. Posts on the administration\u2019s official account are intended to represent official policy and data, and errors can have outsized political consequences."

The report came a day after Trump hinted at such a move himself, calling Chicago a \u201cmess\u201d and Mayor Brandon Johnson \u201cincompetent.\u201d Citing officials familiar, the Post reports that the plan could include mobilizing a few thousand members of the National Guard to take to Chicago\u2019s streets by next month.\nIn a series of posts on X on Saturday night, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) said the Trump administration had not reached out to state officials to offer, or even ask if they needed, federal support. \u201cThere is no emergency that warrants the President of the United States federalizing the [Illinois National Guard], deploying the National Guard from other states, or sending active duty military within our own borders,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cDonald Trump is attempting to manufacture a crisis, politicize Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he\u2019s causing families.\u201d\nJohnson also affirmed in a statement Friday that the city had not received any indication from the federal government that such a deployment was in the works. He said it would be unnecessary, pointing to the fact that shootings, homicides, and robberies all declined by more than 30 percent in the first half of the year compared to last year.\nOn CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday morning, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Trump had \u201cno basis, no authority\u201d to send troops to Chicago and that he was trying \u201cto manufacture a crisis.\u201d And Rahm Emanuel, the city\u2019s former mayor, said on CNN that such a deployment \u201cwould not be about fighting crime\u201d but would instead be about facilitating Trump\u2019s crackdown on cities with progressive immigration policies in pursuit of his mass deportation agenda.\nChicago is not the only city that Trump apparently has his sights on. In a Sunday morning Truth Social rant, the president floated the idea of sending troops to Baltimore after Gov. Wes Moore (D-Md.) wrote a letter to the White House this week inviting him to visit Maryland to \u201cdiscuss strategies for effective public safety policy\u201d and go on a \u201cpublic safety walk.\u201d Moore also noted that homicides have dropped in the state in recent years and that the Baltimore Police Department reported an approximately 20-percent drop in homicides and nonfatal shootings in the first six months of the year. On CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Moore told host Margaret Brennan that Trump was living in \u201cblissful ignorance\u201d and invoking \u201c1980s scare tactics.\u201d\nIndeed, it\u2019s worth remembering that while Trump talks about cleaning up city streets and cutting down on crime, his administration has cut hundreds of millions of dollars to support victims of crimes; as my colleague Stephanie Mencimer pointed out, local organizations involved in violence reduction in DC lost more than a half million dollars as a result."

He similarly last week threatened to impose a 50% tax on goods from the European Union starting in June, only to delay the tariff hike until July 9 so that negotiations can occur while the baseline 10% tariff continues to be charged. Similar dramas have played out over autos, electronics and the universal tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 that were based in part on individual trade deficits with other countries.\nIn each case, Trump generally took the stock market on a roller coaster. Investors sold-off when the tariff threats were announced as they implied slower economic growth and higher prices, which would hurt companies\u2019 profits. Stocks then rebounded after Trump stepped back.\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the S&P 500 stock index was up slightly so far this year. But the index was down as much as 15% on the year on April 8, a reflection of the volatility that Trump\u2019s changing policies have created.\nHe said that approach has led to $14 trillion in new investment in the U.S., a figure that appears to be artificially high and has not been fully verified by economic data.\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever say what you said,\u201d Trump said with regard to the notion of him chickening out. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s the nastiest question.\u201d\nTrump said that EU officials would not be negotiating if not for his 50% tariff, saying he usually has the opposite problem of being \u201ctoo tough.\u201d"

      "text": "TRENTON, Ohio (WKRC) \u2014 Yelling, shouting, and interruptions marked a contentious town hall meeting for Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson on Wednesday.\nThe event, held at Edgewood Middle School, drew hundreds of attendees who were divided in their support and opposition to the Republican congressman.\nLangdon Guenther, a town hall attendee, expressed his dissatisfaction, saying he would rate the meeting at a \"D-minus.\"\n\"D-minus, yeah. Totally opposed to him,\" said Guenther.\nIn contrast, Zach Stacy, another attendee, praised Davidson's resilience during the town hall.\n\"I'd give the guy an 'A' for taking haymakers like he did and still being able to try to get to as many questions,\" said Stacy.\nDavidson addressed several topics, receiving both applause and boos from the crowd. He reiterated his support for President Trump and his policies.\n\"The judges tried, tried to stop us and President Trump's agenda, but nothing is stopping this train; it's moving forward full speed ahead,\" said Davidson.\nHowever, some attendees vocally opposed Davidson's views on immigration and the use of the National Guard in Washington, D.C.\nDavidson defended the deployment.\n\"The National Guard is going to stay until the city is ready, and I'm glad the Ohio National Guard is there and Gov. DeWine for sending them there,\" said Davidson.\nFollowing the town hall, Davidson expressed surprise at the number of people who came to voice their frustrations.\n\"Unfortunately, that characterized a lot of it, and, you know, when we talked to people and got feedback, there were Democrats, Republicans, and independents that just left because they were frustrated. They couldn't get questions,\" Davidson said. \"I tried to basically serve the people that wanted to come have an actual town hall, and it was disappointing that a lot of other people were very disruptive.\"\nAudience members were required to submit written questions to a moderator, leaving many disappointed that they could not confront Davidson directly. Despite the disruptions, several attendees expressed continued support for the congressman.\nDavidson stated that upon returning to Washington next week, one of his primary focuses will be on figuring out how to fund the government."

  "argos_summary": "The piece portrays former President Donald Trump as ill and politically weakened, while highlighting court challenges that have invalidated many of his emergency\u2011power tariffs. It notes the U.S. appeals court\u2019s ruling that Trump\u2019s broad tariff program exceeds presidential authority, leaving only limited tariffs under the Trade Act of 1974 in place. The article also references Trump\u2019s ongoing attempts to use the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and his rhetoric about forcing other countries to negotiate, amid growing domestic and international backlash. Overall, the narrative frames Trump\u2019s trade and security policies as overreaching and legally vulnerable, suggesting a decline in his political influence.",
