  "description": "Fundraising for the firm\u2019s third Asia-Pacific private credit fund came to a standstill earlier in 2025 following the announcement in December that BlackRock was buying private credit firm HPS, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.

  "content": "BlackRock Inc. paused fundraising earlier this year for its latest Asian private credit strategy amid its merger with HPS Investment Partners, people familiar with the matter said, adding to uncertainties for the firm\u2019s ambitions for the asset class in the region.\n\nFundraising for the firm\u2019s third Asia-Pacific private credit fund came to a standstill earlier in 2025 following the announcement in December that BlackRock was buying private credit firm HPS, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. The New York-based firm completed its acquisition of HPS on July 1.\n\u2022 We Need a Reality Check on Crime, Safety and Transit\n\nThe pause adds to recent challenges. A key investor in BlackRock\u2019s private funds, Arch Capital Group, is in talks to sell at least $350 million of certain stakes following disappointing performance in some of them and a series of senior departures, Bloomberg News reported last month. Moreover, BlackRock Asia-Pacific Private Credit Opp. Fund II had only secured less than half of its $1 billion target.\n\nMeanwhile, BlackRock and Abu Dhabi state-owned wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co. mutually agreed to unwind their private credit partnership due to difficulty in sourcing deals, other people familiar with the matter said in June.\n\nBlackRock was targeting to raise about $1 billion for the third Asia-Pacific private credit fund, and fundraising had started in the fourth quarter of 2023, the people said. Internal discussions with HPS executives on how to proceed are poised to take place but it\u2019s unclear when, they added. BlackRock declined to comment.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s merger with HPS came as part of a larger push by its co-founder Larry Fink to cement the firm\u2019s future in private markets. The asset manager also recently set its first-ever firmwide target for private market fundraising at $400 billion by 2030.\n\u2022 Taco Bell\u2019s Not-So-Secret Sauce: An Endless Stream of New Stuff\n\u2022 Staff Cuts and Turmoil Hit the CFTC While the Crypto It Oversees Booms\n\u2022 Women\u2019s Earnings Never Really Recover After They Have Children",

The company was aiming to raise about $1 billion for its third Asia-Pacific private credit fund, with initial fundraising starting in Q4 2023. This comes amidst ongoing challenges for BlackRock, including a potential sale of at least $350 million of certain stakes to key investor Arch Capital Group following disappointing performance in some of its own funds and a series of senior departures.
