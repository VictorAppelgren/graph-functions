  "title": "NASA takes a trip to Seattle area to thank suppliers for work on the next moonshot",
  "description": "The first crewed flight around the moon since Apollo is still months away, but NASA is already thanking its suppliers for the trip.",
  "content": "REDMOND, Wash. \u2014 The first crewed flight around the moon in more than 50 years is still months away, but NASA is already saying thank you to L3Harris Technologies\u2019 Aerojet Rocketdyne segment and other suppliers who are making the trip possible.\n\nToday, NASA\u2019s road trip brought agency officials \u2014 plus astronaut Woody Hoburg \u2014 to the L3Harris facility in Redmond, which has contributed propulsion systems to NASA missions ranging from space shuttle flights to the Voyager probes\u2019 journeys to the edge of the solar system.\n\nNow NASA is getting ready to launch four astronauts on a round-the-moon mission known as Artemis 2, powered in part by hardware built in Redmond. Hoburg, who spent six months on the International Space Station in 2023 and is awaiting his next crew assignment, told an audience of about 200 L3Harris employees and VIPs that the Artemis 2 crew is well aware of the company\u2019s contribution.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re depending on you, and they know they can count on you,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for all the hard work you\u2019re doing to make this amazing adventure possible.\u201d\n\nThe Artemis 2 mission is currently targeted for launch in April, or perhaps even earlier, said Howard Hu, NASA\u2019s program manager for the Orion crew vehicle. The mission after that, Artemis 3, is due to lift off no earlier than mid-2027 with the goal of landing astronauts on the lunar surface for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972.\n\nL3Harris\u2019 Aerojet Redmond team delivered the hardware for those two Artemis missions \u2014 including auxiliary engines for Orion\u2019s European-built service module \u2014 years ago. Now the team is working on thrusters for missions as far out as Artemis 8, which is scheduled to go the moon no earlier than 2033.\n\nWith the advent of the Trump administration and new management at NASA, the long-term plan for crewed moon missions has been in flux.\n\nThe White House initially sought to cancel the Space Launch System and Orion programs after Artemis 3, and instead focus on a commercial alternative for Mars missions, such as SpaceX\u2019s Starship launch system. But Congress voted to stay the course \u2014 and Don Mahr, director of program management at L3Harris\u2019 Redmond facility, told GeekWire that NASA has told its suppliers to continue executing the current plan, at least for now.\n\nAmit Kshatriya, NASA\u2019s deputy associate administrator for the Moon to Mars Program, said propulsion systems from L3Harris will continue to be essential components in NASA\u2019s toolbox even if the long-term plan for Artemis changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the wrong argument to think about picking one thing or another,\u201d he said. \u201cThe right argument is, how do we stimulate and create missions and capability across the country in all sorts of different capability classes.\u201d\n\nKshatriya said that NASA\u2019s needs are almost certain to change \u201cfive years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now,\u201d and that L3Harris has demonstrated it\u2019ll be able to keep up.\n\n\u201cA shop like this is the DNA that we need to keep going, which is why we\u2019re so excited to be here,\u201d he said.\n\nHoburg is excited as well. \u201cWe\u2019re using the moon as a proving ground to figure out how to get to Mars, so it\u2019s a really exciting time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Artemis 2 crew that\u2019s embarking on this mission, they\u2019re the pathfinders that are starting a sequence of missions. \u2026 It\u2019s going to be the next step in space.\u201d\n\nDoes Hoburg want to go to the moon? His answer was diplomatic. \u201cI want the United States of America to go to the moon,\u201d he told GeekWire. \u201cIt is time to do it. I would love to get to fly one of those missions myself, but I\u2019m proud of our country that we\u2019re leading and executing these missions.\u201d\n\nDuring today\u2019s thank-you gathering in Redmond, four L3Harris Aerojet employees received awards from NASA for their contributions to the Artemis program. Brett Mendenhall and Richard Mirabella were given NASA\u2019s Silver Snoopy Award, which must be pinned onto the winner\u2019s lapel by an astronaut. \u201cThat was the part where I try not to draw any blood,\u201d Hoburg quipped.\n\nCamille Samonte received the NASA Space Flight Awareness Trailblazer Award, and Cory Houck won the SFA Management Award.",

      "text": "Silver Snoopy award\n| Silver Snoopy Award | |\n|---|---|\n| Awarded for | Outstanding achievements related to human flight safety or mission success. Presented personally by astronauts as their own recognition of excellence. |\n| Country | United States |\n| Presented by | NASA Astronauts |\n| First award | 1968 |\n| Website | Official website |\nThe Silver Snoopy award is a special honor awarded to NASA employees and contractors for outstanding achievements related to human flight safety or mission success.[1][2] The award certificate states that it is \"In Appreciation\" \"For professionalism, dedication and outstanding support that greatly enhanced space flight safety and mission success.\"[3] The award depicts Snoopy, a character from the Peanuts comic strip created by Charles M. Schulz.\nThe award is given personally by NASA astronauts as it represents the astronauts' own recognition of excellence.[1] It is presented at the workplace of the recipient with the recipient's coworkers present. The Silver Snoopy award is one of several awards overseen by the Space Flight Awareness (SFA) program at NASA.\nThe award consists of a sterling silver \"Silver Snoopy\" lapel pin flown during a NASA mission, a commendation letter (stating the mission the Silver Snoopy pin was flown on) and a signed, framed Silver Snoopy certificate. Snoopy decals and posters are also given to the recipient.\nHistory\n[edit]After the completion of the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA wanted a way to promote greater awareness among its employees and contractors of the impact they had on flight safety, the flight crews and their missions.[4] NASA wanted to use a symbol for spaceflight that would be well known and accepted by the public, similar to the recognition received by the United States Forest Service's Smokey Bear.\nThe idea for the Silver Snoopy award came from Al Chop, who was director of the public affairs office for the Manned Spacecraft Center (now called the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center). He wanted to create an award featuring Snoopy as an astronaut to be given by astronauts in recognition of outstanding contributions by employees.[5]\nCharles M. Schulz, who was an avid supporter of the U.S. space program, welcomed the idea of using Snoopy for the award. Schulz and United Feature Syndicate (the distributor of the Peanuts comic strip) agreed to let NASA use \"Snoopy the Astronaut\" at no cost.[4] Schulz himself drew the image the award pin was based on. He also drew promotional art for posters to promote the award program.[5]\nRequirements\n[edit]Employees of NASA or one of its contractors can be considered for a Silver Snoopy award if they have satisfied one or more of the following criteria:[1]\n- Significantly contributed beyond their normal work requirements to the development and implementation of human spaceflight programs while ensuring quality and safety.\n- Accomplished single specific achievements that have had significant impact on attainment of a particular human spaceflight program goal while ensuring quality and safety.\n- Contributed to a major cost saving or a series of lesser cost savings pertaining directly to human spaceflight programs.\n- Has been instrumental in developing modifications to human spaceflight mission hardware, software, or materials that increase reliability, efficiency, or performance.\n- Assisted in operational improvements that increase efficiency or performance.\n- Has been a key player in developing a beneficial process improvement of significant magnitude.\n- Contributed significantly beyond fundamental task accountabilities in support of the NASA programs.\n- Sustained quality performance over an extended period of time in support of human spaceflight programs.\nRecipients\n[edit]Since 1968, the program has awarded almost fifteen thousand people with a Silver Snoopy, as of January 2016[update].[6][7]\nSilver Snoopy awards are limited to no more than 1% of eligible recipients. An individual can only receive one Silver Snoopy Award in their lifetime. However, Michael Arrington, a journalist at the Marshall Space Flight Center, received two. The award is not given posthumously or as a recognition award for an individual's longevity, retirement, or separation from service. In the event that a pin is lost, it may be replaced with a non-flown pin at the SFA Panel's discretion. It is a high honor within NASA.[1]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b c d \"Silver Snoopy Award\".
