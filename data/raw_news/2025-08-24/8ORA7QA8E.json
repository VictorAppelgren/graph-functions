  "content": "Your support helps us to tell the story From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Your support makes all the difference.\n\nBoxer Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr. was released Sunday from a prison in northern Mexico where he was sent in August after being deported from the United States.\n\nThe boxer, son of Mexican boxing great Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, is awaiting trial on accusations of involvement with cartels and illegally trafficking arms into Mexico.\n\nCh\u00e1vez was released after a judge in the northern Mexican city of Hermosillo said he wouldn't have to remain jailed in the lead-up to the trial, but that he was prohibited from leaving Mexico, a federal agent told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The judge also set a three-month period for further investigation into the case.\n\nCh\u00e1vez\u2019s lawyer, Rub\u00e9n Fernando Ben\u00edtez Alvarez described the claims against his client as \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201curban legends.\u201d\n\nCh\u00e1vez was detained in the U.S. in July after a high-profile match against American Jake Paul in Los Angeles. Mexican authorities had an order out for his arrest since 2023, but Mexico\u2019s president said authorities hadn\u2019t yet detained him because he was mostly in the U.S.\n\nThe case against Ch\u00e1vez is part of a broader investigation that Mexican prosecutors launched in 2019 against the Sinaloa Cartel for organized crime, human trafficking, arms trafficking and drug trafficking, following a complaint filed by the United States.",
