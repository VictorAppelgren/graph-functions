  "title": "These CFOs are devoting 25% of their AI budgets to agentic AI",
  "description": "More than a third of all chief financial officers surveyed are pursuing an aggressive AI strategy, compared to only 3% in 2020.",
  "content": "\u2022 34% of global CFOs have adopted an aggressive AI investment strategy.\n\u2022 61% embrace AI agents and digital labor in order to autonomously perform tasks.\n\u2022 CFOs are dedicating a quarter of their AI budgets to agentic AI\n\nMore than 9 out of 10 (96%) of chief financial officers (CFOs) have an aggressive AI strategy, compared to only 3% in 2020, according to a global survey of 261 CFOs conducted by Salesforce Research. There is a strong shift from cautious spending to a strategic and more aggressive focus on AI for both productivity gains and long-term revenue growth.\n\nAccording to recent data from the global CFO survey, there's a fundamental rethinking underway in how CFOs evaluate these investments. Specifically, over half (61%) of those surveyed indicate that AI agents -- digital labor capable of performing tasks autonomously -- are changing CFOs' approach to ROI. They are moving beyond traditional metrics to measure the success of technology investments, now encompassing a broader range of business outcomes.\n\nAlso: How AI agents can generate $450 billion by 2028 - and what stands in the way\n\nAccording to McKinsey research, the rise of autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital agents, is moving from pilot projects to practical applications. Autonomous AI agents are now enabling companies to be built like a stealth aircraft.\n\nAgentic AI is an artificial intelligence system capable of independently planning and executing complex, multistep tasks. Built on foundation models, these agents can autonomously perform actions, communicate with one another, and adapt to new information. Significant advancements have emerged, from general agent platforms to specialized agents designed for deep research.\n\nCompanies like Salesforce have already realized over a million AI conversations powered by agentic AI, with incredible business results in 2025. According to Capgemini, research from other industry analyst firms validates the economic impact of AI, including a $450 billion market associated with agentic AI by 2028. This year's technology developments highlight a future where technology is more adaptive, collaborative, and essential for solving global problems.\n\nIn 2024, 65% of CFOs were focused on accelerating the ROI of their tech investments. Now, there's a growing understanding that AI's value extends beyond immediate cost savings to achieving long-term business outcomes.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from the 261 global CFO survey by Salesforce:\n\nThe urgency for developing an AI strategy is at its peak\n\u2022 In 2020, 70% of CFOs adhered to a conservative AI strategy. As recently as two years ago, that number was 34%. In 2025, only 4% of CFOs maintain a conservative AI strategy, and a third have officially adopted an aggressive approach.\n\nA significant portion of CFO budgets is dedicated to agentic AI investments\n\u2022 On average, CFOs report dedicating 25% of their current total AI budget to AI agents.\n\u2022 Six out of 10 CFOs believe AI agents and digital labor are critical for competing in the current economic climate and will continue to be so. And 64% of CFOs report that AI agents and digital labor are influencing their approach to business spending.\n\u2022 None Over a third (35%) of CFOs acknowledge that AI necessitates a riskier mindset regarding technology investments.\n\nAlso: Business leaders continue to push workers toward daily use of AI\n\nAI investments are about accelerating productivity and boosting revenues\n\u2022 74% of CFOs believe that AI agents will not only cut costs but also drive revenue.\n\u2022 CFOs implementing AI agents expect these agents to increase company revenue by almost 20%.\n\u2022 55% of CFOs think AI agents will take on more strategic work than routine tasks.\n\u2022 72% of CFOs say AI agents will transform their business model.\n\nThese figures highlight the significant potential of AI agents in both financial and strategic capacities within organizations.\n\u2022 AI is delivering both short and long-term benefits -- 61% of CFOs say AI agents change how they evaluate ROI.\n\u2022 CFOs are evaluating benefits based on several factors, including cost savings, risk compliance, revenue growth, productivity and efficiency gains, and faster decision-making velocity. AI is also helping CFOs implement better financial controls.\n\nBusiness leaders continue to push workers toward daily use of AI. Salesforce and Slack surveyed 5,000 desk workers across the globe and found that daily AI usage has more than doubled in the past six months. Yet research suggests only 34% of organizations have policies for using generative AI, and even fewer have effective training programs in place. CFOs and human resource leaders must partner to ensure that their company's AI business strategy includes all employees and key stakeholders.\n\nAlso: Is HR ready for AI?\n\nThe healthiest companies of the future are autonomous companies. Autonomous companies utilize a hybrid workforce, embracing AI-first strategies and digital labor to scale speed, scale, and intelligence.",

  "summary": "A global survey of 261 CFOs conducted by Salesforce Research revealed that 95% of chief financial officers (CFOs) have an aggressive AI strategy, compared to only 3% in 2020. This shift is seen as a shift from cautious spending to a more aggressive focus on AI for productivity gains and long-term revenue growth. Over half of the respondents indicated that AI agents, digital labor capable of performing tasks autonomously, are changing CFO's approach to ROI and are expanding beyond traditional metrics to measure the success of technology investments. Agentic AI is an artificial intelligence system capable of planning and executing complex tasks. The survey also revealed that CFO budgets are typically dedicated to agentic AI, with 25% of these spending estimates. The study also revealed the potential of AI agents in both financial and strategic capacities within organizations.",

      "text": "Business leaders continue to push workers toward daily use of AI\nDaily AI usage for desk workers has grown by 233% since the beginning of the year, according to Salesforce's latest Slack Workforce Index based on a survey of 5,000 desk workers globally. AI now helps to create a competitive advantage by providing 64% more productivity and 81% more job satisfaction for those who use AI versus colleagues who don't.\nAnd the benefits of AI go far beyond task automation. Since November 2024, AI adoption among workers has risen 50%, with 60% of workers now using AI. The use of AI is now a daily habit. Adoption of digital labor is also on the rise, with 40% of workers having worked with an agent, and 23% of them have offloaded tasks to agents to complete on their behalf.\nAlso: Your next job? Managing a fleet of AI agents\nWelcome to the age of hybrid work and the autonomous enterprise, where businesses will augment the human workforce with AI agents, according to research from technology specialist MuleSoft. Further validating the rise in desk workers' use of AI, the top seven trends that Mulesoft suggests are shaping digital transformation in 2025 include three centered around the adoption of AI agents.\n- House of AI agents: The autonomous enterprise built on a \"house of agents\" will take hold, as organizations augment the human workforce with AI, freeing them to focus on more valuable work.\n- Mature agentics: Autonomous AI agents will become a critical building block for the modern digital enterprise as AI strategies reach a new level of maturity.\n- Multi-agent architectures: These technologies will demand built-in governance guardrails to mitigate security and privacy risks without impacting user productivity.\nRecent research from 200 global chief human resources officers (CHROs) also shows that AI agent deployments will grow 327% during the next two years. HR chiefs recognize the transformative power of agents. Organizations must focus on strategy, skills, and teamwork to create successful hybrid workplaces.\nCHROs plan to expand their digital labor in the next two years, investing in AI agents to increase productivity, according to the latest Salesforce global research. This widespread integration of agents is expected to yield a 30% gain in overall productivity, underscoring the compelling business case for embracing AI in operational processes. This projected integration of AI agents is expected to drive considerable changes in workforce skill sets and the overall structural design of businesses.\nAlso: 15 new jobs AI is creating - including 'Synthetic reality producer'\nRegarding structure, CHROs foresee a significant need to redeploy nearly a quarter of their global workforce (24%) to accommodate new roles and responsibilities due to implementing digital labor. This trend highlights the proactive measures HR leaders must take to adapt to this evolving landscape.\nHere are some of the key findings on how desk workers are enthusiastically embracing AI on a daily basis.\nAI enhances employee productivity\nAI is making workers more productive and enabling them to grow into more creative, strategic work. Compared to non-users, daily AI users are more likely to report \"very good\" productivity (64%), focus (58%), and job satisfaction (81%). The top three ways AI and AI agents have increased worker productivity are:\n- Eliminating the need for extensive research.\n- Assisting with writing/communication.\n- Helping brainstorm to overcome creative blocks.\nAlso: 5 ways to turn AI's time-saving magic into your productivity superpower\nHere are the ways AI makes daily users more productive:\n- Provide quick information, eliminating extensive research (51%).\n- Assist with writing and communication, saving time and effort (50%).\n- Help brainstorming and overcoming creative blocks (45%).\n- Automate repetitive tasks, freeing time for complex work (44%).\n- Provide real-time feedback, improving performance (44%).\n- Integrate tools, automating data flow and streamlining work (39%).\n- Enable workers to expand expertise, reducing reliance on colleagues (39%).\n- Decrease the need to attend meetings live, freeing time (25%).\nAI is expanding the capability of desk workers. The survey found that 96% of AI users have used AI to perform tasks they didn't have the skills to do themselves. Some example use cases of AI agents for desk workers are:\n- 72% want AI agents to augment or automate brainstorming.\n- 80% want AI agents to assist with research for deal support.\n- 82% want AI agents to create presentations.\nAlso: How to turn ChatGPT into your AI coding power tool - and double your output\nDaily users of AI agents are also more confident in their work and more than two times more likely to express high trust in AI across areas like data protection, accuracy, and decision-making.\nAI enhances employee connections\nAI is improving employee engagement and sense of belonging. Daily AI users are 246% more likely to feel more connected to colleagues and report a 62% higher sense of belonging at work. More than 1 in 3 Gen Z workers are feeling more connected at work. These digital natives have not changed the way they engage and collaborate with teammates; 50% said AI is not impacting their ability to engage at work. In fact, 29% of Gen Z noted that AI actually helped increase their engagement.\nExecutive workers take the lead on daily use of AI\nDaily use of AI for executives is at 43%, compared to 35% of senior managers and 23% of middle managers who use AI every day. Millennials are also emerging as the surprise AI power users at work. Thirty percent of millennials say they thoroughly understand AI agents -- edging out even Gen Z (22%). And 68% of millennials use AI for strategic work like drafting, summarizing, and ideating.\nIt is encouraging to see business leaders adopting daily use of AI and leading by example. It is also important to note that desk workers are expanding their skills and ability to deliver more positive outcomes by increasing their daily usage of AI, including the adoption of digital labor where they can proactively transfer low-value, low-effort work to AI agents.\nAlso: The battle-tested tips CEOs swear by when change hits from every direction\nThe future of work is hybrid, human and digital labor, co-creating value at scale, at speed of need, to ensure stakeholder success. One of the key takeaways to re-emphasize is that 96% of workers have used AI to perform tasks they previously didn't have the skills to do themselves. The best use of AI is not just for cognitive transfer (workload shifting from humans to agents) but also cognitive upgrades, where AI agents help improve the skills and capabilities of the human employees.\nWant more stories about AI?

But shortly after OpenAI's ChatGPT was released, I asked it to write a WordPress plugin for my wife's e-commerce site. When it did, and the plugin worked, I was indeed surprised.\nThat was the beginning of my deep exploration into chatbots and AI-assisted programming. Since then, I've subjected 14 large language models (LLMs) to four real-world tests.\nAlso: Apple's secret sauce is exactly what AI is missing\nUnfortunately, not all chatbots can code alike. It's been a little over two years since that first test, and even now, four of the 13 LLMs I tested can't create working plugins.\nThe short version\nIn this article, I'll show you how each LLM performed against my tests. There are now five chatbots I recommend you use.\nTwo of them, ChatGPT Plus and Perplexity Pro, cost $20 per month each. The free versions of the same chatbots do well enough that you could probably get by without paying. Two other recommended products are from Google and Microsoft. Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 is free, but you're limited to so few queries that you really can't use it without paying.\nAlso: I tested 10 AI content detectors - and these 5 correctly identified AI text every time\nMicrosoft has several Copilot licenses, which can get pricey, but I used the free version with surprisingly good results. The final one, Claude 4 Sonnet, is the free version of Claude. Oddly enough, the free version beat the paid-for version, so we're not recommending Claude 4 Opus.\nBut the rest, whether free or paid, are not so great. I won't risk my programming projects with them or recommend that you do, until their performance improves.\nI've written lots about using AIs to help with programming. Unless it's a small, simple project like my wife's plugin, AIs can't write entire apps or programs. But they excel at writing a few lines and are not bad at fixing code.\nRather than repeat everything I've written, go ahead and read this article: How to use ChatGPT to write code.\nIf you want to understand my coding tests, why I've chosen them, and why they're relevant to this review of the 13 LLMs, read this article: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability.\nThe AI coding leaderboard\nLet's start with a comparative look at how the chatbots performed, as of this installment of our best-of roundup:\nNext, let's look at each chatbot individually. I'm back up to discussing 14 chatbots, because we're splitting out Claude 4 Sonnet and Claude 4 Opus as separate tests. GPT-4 is no longer included since OpenAI has sunsetted that LLM. Ready? Let's go.\n- Passed all tests\n- Solid coding results\n- Mac app\n- Hallucinations\n- No Windows app yet\n- Sometimes uncooperative\n- Price: $20/mo\n- LLM: GPT-4o, GPT-3.5\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: Yes\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nChatGPT Plus with GPT-4o passed all my tests. One of my favorite features is the availability of a dedicated app. When I test web programming, I have my browser set on one thing, my IDE open, and the ChatGPT Mac app running on a separate screen.\nAlso: I put GPT-4o through my coding tests and it aced them - except for one weird result\nIn addition, Logitech's Prompt Builder, which can be activated with a mouse button, can be set up to utilize the upgraded GPT-4o and connect to your OpenAI account, allowing for a simple thumb tap to run a prompt, which is very convenient.\nThe only thing I didn't like was that one of my GPT-4o tests resulted in a dual-choice answer, and one of those answers was wrong. I'd rather it just gave me the correct answer. Even so, a quick test confirmed which answer would work. However, that issue was a bit annoying.\n- Multiple LLMs\n- Search criteria displayed\n- Good sourcing\n- Email-only login\n- No desktop app\n- Price: $20/mo\n- LLM: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Sonar Large, Claude 3 Opus, Llama 3.1 405B\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: No\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nI seriously considered listing Perplexity Pro as the best overall AI chatbot for coding, but one failing kept it out of the top slot: how you log in. Perplexity doesn't use a username/password or passkey and doesn't have multi-factor authentication. All the tool does is email you a login PIN. The AI doesn't have a separate desktop app, as ChatGPT does for Macs.\nWhat sets Perplexity apart from other tools is that it can run multiple LLMs. While you can't set an LLM for a given session, you can easily go into the settings and choose the active model.\nAlso: Can Perplexity Pro help you code? It aced my programming tests - thanks to GPT-4\nFor programming, you'll probably want to stick to GPT-4o, because that model aced all our tests. But it might be interesting to cross-check your code across the different LLMs. For example, if you have GPT-4o write some regular expression code, you might consider switching to a different LLM to see what that model thinks of the generated code.\nAs we'll see below, most LLMs are unreliable, so don't take the results as gospel. However, you can use the results to check your original code. It's sort of like an AI-driven code review.\nJust don't forget to switch back to GPT-4o.\n- Price: Free for limited use, then token-based pricing\n- LLM: Gemini Pro 2.5\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nThe last time I looked at Gemini, it failed miserably. Not quite as bad as Copilot at the time, but bad. Gemini Pro 2.5, however, has performed quite admirably. My only real issue with it is access. I found myself cut off from the free version after only running two of the four tests.\nAlso: Gemini Pro 2.5 is a stunningly capable coding assistant - and a big threat to ChatGPT\nI waited a day and then ran the third test, and got cut off again. Finally, on the third day, I ran my fourth test. Obviously, you can't do any real programming if you can only ask one or two questions before being shut down. So, if you sign up with Gemini Pro 2.5, be aware that Google charges by tokens (basically, the amount of AI you use). That can make it quite difficult to predict your expenses.\n- Price: Free for basic Copilot, or fees for other Copilot licenses\n- LLM: Undisclosed\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nIn all my previous analyses of Microsoft Copilot, the results were the worst of the LLMs. Copilot got nothing right. It was astonishing how bad it was. But I said then that, \"The one positive thing is that Microsoft always learns from its mistakes. So, I'll check back later and see if this result improves.\"\nAlso: I retested Microsoft Copilot's AI coding skills in 2025 and now it's got serious game\nAnd boy, did it ever. This time out, Microsoft passed all four of my tests. Even better, it did this with the free version of Copilot. Yes, Microsoft has many paid programs for Copilot, but if you want to give it the AI spin, point yourself to Copilot and use it.\n- Price: Free\n- LLM: Claude 4\n- Desktop browser interface: No\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 4 of 4\nThis is one of those times when AI implementations can be real head-scratchers. In our previous tests, Claude 4 Sonnet finished at the bottom of the barrel, failing all four of our tests. This time, however, Sonnet passed every test. So, what's the head-scratcher? Opus, the Claude 4 model, which is a fee-paid version, did not do as well: it failed half the tests.\nAlso: Anthropic's free Claude 4 Sonnet aced my coding tests - but its paid Opus model somehow didn't\nSo, yes. The free version worked like a champ. And the one you're paying anywhere from $20 to $250 a month for, depending on the plan? Well, that one failed half of the tests. Go figure.\n- Different LLM than ChatGPT\n- Good descriptions\n- Free access\n- Only available in browser mode\n- Free access likely only temporary\n- Price: Free (for now)\n- LLM: Grok-1\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 3 of 4\nI have to say, Grok surprised me. I guess I didn't have high hopes for an LLM that appeared tacked on to the social network formerly known as Twitter. However, X is now owned by Elon Musk, and two of Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX, have towering AI capabilities.\nIt's unclear how much Tesla and SpaceX AI DNA is in Grok, but we can assume there will likely be more work. As of now, Grok is the only LLM not based on OpenAI LLMs that made it into the recommended list.\nAlso: X's Grok did surprisingly well in my AI coding tests\nGrok did make one mistake, but it was a relatively minor one that a slightly more comprehensive prompt could easily remedy. Yes, it failed the test. But by passing the others and even doing an almost perfect job on the one it passed, Grok earned itself a spot as a contender.\nStay tuned. This is an AI to watch.\n- Free\n- Passed most tests\n- Prompt throttling\n- Could cut you off in the middle of whatever you're working on\n- Price: Free\n- LLM: GPT-4o, GPT-3.5\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: Yes\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: Yes\n- Tests passed: 3 of 4 in GPT-3.5 mode\nChatGPT is available to anyone for free. While both the Plus and free versions support GPT-4o, which passed all my programming tests, the free app has limitations.\nOpenAI treats free ChatGPT users as if they're in the cheap seats. If traffic is high or the servers are busy, the free version of ChatGPT will only make GPT-3.5 available to free users. The tool will only allow you a certain number of queries before it downgrades or shuts you off.\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to write code - and my favorite trick to debug what it generates\nI've had several occasions when the free version of ChatGPT effectively told me I'd asked too many questions.\nChatGPT is a great tool, as long as you don't mind it shutting down. Even GPT-3.5 did better on the tests than all the other chatbots, and the test it failed was for a fairly obscure programming tool produced by a lone programmer in Australia.\nSo, if budget is important to you and you can wait when you're cut off, then use ChatGPT for free.\n- Free\n- Passed most tests\n- Range of research tools\n- Limited to GPT-3.5\n- Throttles prompt results\n- Price: Free\n- LLM: GPT-3.5\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: No\n- Tests passed: 3 of 4\nI'm threading a pretty fine needle here, but because Perplexity AI's free version is based on GPT-3.5, the test results were measurably better than the other AI chatbots.\nAlso: 5 reasons why I prefer Perplexity over every other AI chatbot\nFrom a programming perspective, that's pretty much the whole story. However, from a research and organization perspective, my ZDNET colleague Steven Vaughan-Nichols prefers Perplexity over the other AIs.\nHe likes how Perplexity provides more complete sources for research questions, cites its sources, organizes the replies, and offers questions for further searches.\nSo, if you're programming, but also working on other research, consider the free version of Perplexity.\n- Free\n- Open source\n- Efficient resource utilization\n- Weak general knowledge\n- Small ecosystem\n- Limited integrations\n- Price: Free for chatbot, fees for API\n- LLM: DeepSeek MoE\n- Desktop browser interface: Yes\n- Dedicated Mac app: No\n- Dedicated Windows app: No\n- Multi-factor authentication: No\n- Tests passed: 3 of 4\nWhile DeepSeek R1 is the new reasoning hotness from China that has all the pundits punditing, the real power right now (at least according to our tests) is DeepSeek V3. This chatbot passed almost all of our coding tests, doing as well as the (now mostly discontinued) ChatGPT 3.5.\nAlso: I tested DeepSeek's R1 and V3 coding skills - and we're not all doomed (yet)\nWhere DeepSeek V3 fell was in its knowledge of somewhat more obscure programming environments. Still, it beat Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot, and Meta's Meta AI, which is quite an accomplishment. We'll be keeping a close watch on each DeepSeek model, so stay tuned.\nChatbots to avoid for programming help\nI tested 13 LLMs, and nine passed most of my tests this time around. The other chatbots, including a few pitched as great for programming, only passed one of my tests.\nAlso: The five biggest mistakes people make when prompting an AI\nI'm mentioning them here because people will ask, and I did test them thoroughly. Some of these bots are fine for other work, so I'll point you to their general reviews if you're curious about their functionality.\nDeepSeek R1\nUnlike DeepSeek V3, the advanced reasoning version, DeepSeek R1, did not showcase its reasoning capabilities in our programming tests. Unusually, the new failure area was one that's not all that hard, even for a basic AI -- the regular expression code for our string function test.\nAlso: Tech prophet Mary Meeker just dropped a massive report on AI trends - here's your TL;DR\nBut that's why we are running these real-world tests. It's never clear where an AI will hallucinate or just plain fail, and before you go believing all the hype about DeepSeek R1 taking the crown away from ChatGPT, run some programming tests. So far, while I'm impressed with the much-reduced resource utilization and the open-source nature of the product, its coding quality output is inconsistent.\nGitHub Copilot\nGitHub's Copilot integrates quite seamlessly with VS Code. The AI makes asking for coding help quick and productive, especially when working in context. That's why it's so disappointing that the code the AI outputs is often very wrong.\nAlso: I put GitHub Copilot's AI to the test - and it just might be terrible at writing code\nI can't, in good conscience, recommend you use the GitHub Copilot extensions for VS Code. I'm concerned that the temptation will be too great to insert blocks of code without sufficient testing -- and that GitHub Copilot's produced code is not ready for production use. Try again next year.\nClaude 4 Opus\nIn a completely baffling turn of events, the paid-for version of the Claude 4 model, Opus, failed half of my tests. What makes this result baffling is that the free version, Claude 4 Sonnet, passed them all. I don't know what to say apart from AI can be weird.\nAlso: Anthropic's free Claude 4 Sonnet aced my coding tests - but its paid Opus model somehow didn't\nMeta AI\nMeta AI is Facebook's general-purpose AI. As you can see above, it failed three of our four tests.\nAlso: 15 ways AI saved me time at work in 2024 - and how I plan to use it in 2025\nThe AI generated a nice user interface, but with zero functionality. It also found my annoying bug, which is a fairly serious challenge. Given the specific knowledge required to find the bug, I was surprised that the AI choked on a simple regular expression challenge. But it did.\nMeta Code Llama\nMeta Code Llama is Facebook's AI explicitly designed for coding help. It's something you can download and install on your server. I tested the AI running on a Hugging Face AI instance.\nAlso: Can Meta AI code? I tested it against Llama, Gemini, and ChatGPT - it wasn't even close\nWeirdly, even though both Meta AI and Meta Code Llama choked on three of four of my tests, they choked on different problems. AIs can't be counted on to give the same answer twice, but this result was a surprise. We'll see if that changes over time.\nBut I like [insert name here]. Does this mean I have to use a different chatbot?\nProbably not. I've limited my tests to day-to-day programming tasks. None of the bots has been asked to talk like a pirate, write prose, or draw a picture. In the same way we use different productivity tools to accomplish specific tasks, feel free to choose the AI that helps you complete the task at hand.\nThe only issue is if you're on a budget and are paying for a pro version. Then, find the AI that does most of what you want, so you don't have to pay for too many AI add-ons.\nIt's only a matter of time\nThe results of my tests were pretty surprising, especially given the significant improvements by Microsoft and Google. However, this area of innovation is improving at warp speed, so we'll be back with updated tests and results over time. Stay tuned.\nHave you used any of these AI chatbots for programming?

When I first tested these detectors, the best result was 66% correct from one of three available checkers. My most recent set of tests, in February 2025, used up to 10 checkers -- and three of them had perfect scores. This time, just a couple of months later, five detectors boasted perfect scores.\nWhat I'm testing for and how I'm doing it\nBefore I go on, though, let's discuss plagiarism and how it relates to our problem. Merriam-Webster defines \"plagiarize\" as \"to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own; use (another's production) without crediting the source.\"\nThis definition fits AI-created content well. While someone using an AI tool like Notion AI or ChatGPT isn't stealing content, if that person doesn't credit the words as coming from an AI and claims them as their own, it still meets the dictionary definition of plagiarism.\nAlso: The dead giveaway that ChatGPT wrote your content - and how to work around it\nTo test the AI detectors, I'm using five blocks of text. Two were written by me and three were written by ChatGPT. To test a content detector, I feed each block to the detector separately and record the result. If the detector is correct, I consider the test passed; if it's wrong, I consider it failed.\nWhen a detector provides a percentage, I treat anything above 70% as a strong probability -- whether in favor of human-written or AI-written content -- and consider that the detector's answer. If you want to test a content detector yourself using the same text blocks, you can pull them from this document.\nThe overall results\nTo evaluate AI detectors, I reran my five-test series across 10 detectors. In other words, I cut and pasted 50 individual tests (I had a lot of coffee).\nDetectors I tested include BrandWell, Copyleaks, GPT-2 Output Detector, GPTZero, Grammarly, Monica, Originality.ai, QuillBot, Undetectable.ai, Writer.com, and ZeroGPT.\nAlso: How I personalized my ChatGPT conversations - why it's a game changer\nFor this update, I added Copyleaks and Monica. I dropped Writefull from my tests because it discontinued its GPT detector. Content Guardian requested inclusion, but I didn't hear back in time for testing accounts.\nThis table shows overall results. As you can see, five detectors correctly identified human and AI text in all tests.\nI tried to ascertain whether there was a tangible pattern of improvement over time, so I constructed a chart comparing the five-test set over time. So far, I've run this series six times, but there's no strong trend. I did increase the number of detectors tested and swapped out a few, but the only consistent result is that Test 5 was reliably identified as human across detectors and dates.\nI'll continue to test over time, and hopefully I'll see reliability trend consistently upward.\nWhile there have been some perfect scores, I don't recommend relying solely on these tools to validate human-written content. As shown, writing from non-native speakers often gets rated as generated by an AI.\nEven though my hand-crafted content has mostly been rated human-written this round, one detector (GPTZero) declared itself too uncertain to judge, and another (Copyleaks) declared it AI-written. The results are wildly inconsistent across systems.\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot, and notable alternatives\nBottom line: I would advocate caution before relying on the results of any -- or all -- of these tools.\nHow each AI content detector performed\nNow, let's look at each individual testing tool, listed alphabetically.\nBrandWell AI Content Detection (Accuracy 40%)\nThis tool was originally produced by an AI content generation firm, Content at Scale. It later migrated to BrandWell.ai, a new name for an AI-centric marketing services company.\nAlso: AI-generated images are a legal mess - and still a very human process\nUnfortunately, its accuracy was low. The tool was unable to tell if the AI-generated content in Test 2 was human or AI, as shown in this screenshot:\nCopyleaks (Accuracy 80%)\nI find it amusing that Copyleaks declares itself \"the most accurate AI detector with over 99% accuracy\" when more than half of tested detectors performed better. But marketing folks will be marketing folks -- superlatives are as hard for them to resist as barking at a squirrel (and the FedEx truck, and all the neighbor kids) is for my dog.\nAlso: 5 quick ways Apple's AI tools can fine-tune your writing on the fly\nThe company's primary offering is a plagiarism checker sold to educational institutions, publishers, and enterprises seeking to ensure content originality and uphold academic integrity.\nGPT-2 Output Detector (Accuracy 60%)\nThis tool was built using a machine-learning hub managed by New York-based AI company Hugging Face. While the company has received $40 million in funding to develop its natural language library, the GPT-2 detector appears to be a user-created tool using the Hugging Face Transformers library.\nGPTZero (Accuracy 80%)\nGPTZero has clearly been growing. When I first tested it, the site was bare-bones -- it wasn't even clear whether GPTZero was a company or just someone's passion project. Now, the company has a full team with a mission of \"protecting what's human.\" It offers AI validation tools and a plagiarism checker.\nAlso: The most popular AI tools of 2025 (and what that even means)\nUnfortunately, performance seems to have declined. In my last two runs, GPTZero correctly identified my text as human-generated. This time, it declared that same text as AI-generated.\nGrammarly (Accuracy 40%)\nGrammarly is well known for helping writers produce grammatically correct content -- that's not what I'm testing here. Grammarly can check for plagiarism and AI content. In the grammar checker, there's a Plagiarism and AI Text Check button in the lower-right corner:\nI'm not measuring plagiarism checker accuracy here, but even though Grammarly's AI-check accuracy was poor, the site correctly identified the test text as previously published.\nMonica (Accuracy 100%)\nMonica is a new entrant. This service offers an all-in-one AI assistant with a wide range of services. Users can choose from various large language models.\nAlso: 5 ways ChatGPT can help you write essays\nThe company calls Monica the \"Best AI Detector Online,\" but it looks like it runs content through other detectors including ZeroGPT, GPTZero, and Copyleaks. Weirdly, both GPTZero and Copyleaks didn't perform well in my tests, but Monica -- and ZeroGPT -- did.\nWe're giving it 100% because it earned that rating, but I'll see how it stands up in future tests.\nOriginality.ai (Accuracy 100%)\nOriginality.ai is a commercial service that bills itself as an AI and plagiarism checker. The company sells usage credits: I used 30 credits for this article. They sell 2,000 credits for $12.95 per month. I pumped 1,400 words through the system and used just 1.5% of my monthly allocation.\nQuillBot (Accuracy 100%)\nThe last few times I tested QuillBot, results were wildly inconsistent -- multiple passes of the same text yielded wildly different scores. This time, however, it was rock solid and 100% correct. So I'm giving it the win. I'll check back in a few months to see if it holds onto this performance.\nUndetectable.ai (Accuracy 100%)\nUndetectable.ai's big claim is that it can \"humanize\" AI-generated text so detectors won't flag it. I haven't tested that feature -- it bothers me as a professional author and educator, because it seems like cheating.\nAlso: Why you should ignore 99% of AI tools - and which four I use every day\nHowever, the company also has an AI detector, which was very much on point.\nThe AI detector passed all five tests. Notice the indicators showing flags for other detectors. The company said, \"We developed multiple detector algorithms modeled after those major detectors to provide a federated and consensus-based approach. They do not directly feed into the listed models; rather, the models are each trained based on results they've generated. When it says those models flagged it, it's based on the algorithm we created and updated for those models.\"\nAlso: Only 8% of Americans would pay extra for AI, according to ZDNET-Aberdeen research\nI do have a question about the OpenAI flag, since OpenAI's content detector was discontinued in 2023 due to low accuracy. Even so, Undetectable.ai detected all five tests, earning a perfect 100%.\nWriter.com AI Content Detector (Accuracy 40%)\nWriter.com is a service that generates AI writing for corporate teams. Its AI Content Detector tool can scan for generated content. Unfortunately, its accuracy was low. It identified every text block as human-written, even though three of the six tests were written by ChatGPT.\nZeroGPT (Accuracy 100%)\nZeroGPT has matured since I last evaluated it. Then, no company name was listed, and the site was peppered with Google ads and lacked clear monetization. The service worked fairly well but seemed sketchy.\nAlso: Will AI destroy human creativity? No - and here's why\nThat sketchy feeling is gone. ZeroGPT now presents as a typical SaaS service, complete with pricing, company name, and contact information. Its accuracy increased as well: last time it was 80%; this time it scored 5 out of 5.\nIs it human, or is it AI?\nWhat about you? Have you tried AI content detectors like Copyleaks, Monica, or ZeroGPT? How accurate have they been in your experience? Have you used these tools to protect academic or editorial integrity? Have you encountered situations where human-written work was mistakenly flagged as AI? Are there detectors you trust more than others for evaluating originality?

      "text": "A million customer conversations with AI agents yielded this surprising lesson\nSalesforce has had over one million AI agent-customer conversations. The company launched AI agents on its Salesforce Help site in October 2024, a full-screen experience that makes getting support simpler and more intuitive. With more than 60 million visits each year, Salesforce Help offers a wide range of product content through organized directories, search, and direct support.\nHaving handled a million support requests since the launch of AI agents, Salesforce has encountered a wide spectrum of inquiries, from the mundane \"How do I cook spaghetti?\" to the unconventional \"Only answer in hip-hop lyrics.\" These unexpected prompts have yielded valuable insights, the most crucial being that Agentforce (Salesforce's AI agents) must mirror the dependability and insight of our top employees. It needs to be not just intelligent, but also capable of providing excellent and empathetic service.\nAlso: 5 ways to be great AI agent manager, according to business leaders\nSalesforce began with a restricted rollout and targeted content, allowing us to learn quickly, iterate, and enhance the system. Today, these AI agents provide consistent, multilingual service at scale, leveraging a diverse set of reliable data.\nHere are three best practice recommendations for every organization integrating AI into their service approach.\n1. AI agents: Content is king, variety is queen\nThe effectiveness of AI agents hinges entirely on the quality and accessibility of their content. Imagine an AI agent trying to provide accurate responses with outdated information -- it's practically useless. That's why our AI agents are built to leverage a vast repository of more than 740,000 reliable and relevant pieces of content. Also, the content is both structured and mostly unstructured data. This ensures that you receive precise and current answers, thereby streamlining your search for information and delivering faster results. Grounding the AI models with business intelligence and relevant and accurate data is what enables AI agents to have a contextual understanding of how to best service customer inquiries.\nBut not all content is good content. Salesforce quickly realized that some of its vast content was outdated, used conflicting acronyms across different products, or existed in formats that were not AI-ready. So, Salesforce built processes and leveraged its human subject-matter experts to identify issues and help update content regularly.\nThe true potential of AI agents in delivering exceptional, personalized customer experiences hinges on their ability to seamlessly access, process, and synthesize both structured and unstructured data. This dual-faceted approach is not merely beneficial; it is absolutely critical for moving beyond rudimentary responses to truly intelligent and contextually rich interactions.\nUnstructured data is the bedrock of contextual understanding. Unstructured data, often overlooked in its raw form, represents a vast ocean of invaluable insights. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n- Knowledge articles: Comprehensive guides, FAQs, troubleshooting steps, and product documentation provide the foundational knowledge for AI agents to answer a wide array of complex questions.\n- Customer interaction logs: Transcripts of past chats, call recordings, email correspondence, and social media interactions offer a rich history of customer inquiries, pain points, and successful resolutions. This historical context is paramount for understanding recurring issues and tailoring future responses.\n- Product forums and community discussions: User-generated content, discussions about product features, bugs, workarounds, and best practices shared by the community offer real-world perspectives and solutions that might not be formally documented.\n- Internal communications: Memos, internal wikis, training materials, and departmental updates can provide agents with critical internal context regarding policies, upcoming changes, and specialized departmental knowledge.\n- External sources: Relevant industry news, competitor analysis, and broader market trends can help AI agents provide more holistic and informed responses, especially when addressing strategic customer inquiries.\nThis unstructured data provides the crucial context necessary to interpret intricate inquiries, understand nuances, and offer solutions that go beyond simple keyword matching. Without it, AI agents would be limited to generic responses, often failing to address the specific subtleties of a customer's situation.\nAlso: The AI complexity paradox: More productivity, more responsibilities\nStructured data enables personalization and strategic actions. While unstructured data provides the \"what\" and \"why,\" structured data provides the \"who\" and \"how.\" This type of data is meticulously organized and easily searchable, allowing for immediate and actionable insights.\n- Customer relationship management (CRM) data: Essential information includes customer name, account history, purchase records, service level agreements, preferred contact methods, and past support tickets. Identifying a customer's success plan, for instance, allows the AI agent to prioritize responses, escalate issues appropriately, and recommend tailored resources that align with their service tier.\n- Transactional data: Order history, billing information, payment status, and subscription details are vital for addressing specific account-related inquiries and providing accurate, real-time updates.\n- Product usage data: Information on how a customer interacts with a product or service can reveal patterns of usage, potential pain points, and opportunities for proactive engagement or feature recommendations.\n- Internal business metrics: Performance data, inventory levels, and service availability can inform AI agents about resource constraints or provide accurate timelines for resolutions.\nBy integrating structured data, AI agents can personalize recommendations, proactively address potential issues, and provide solutions that are directly relevant to a specific customer's profile and needs. It allows for a move from generic problem-solving to highly individualized and strategic customer engagement.\nAlso: How businesses are accelerating time to agentic AI value\nThe power of diverse data source integration is delivered with zero-copy networks. The true breakthrough in empowering AI agents lies in the seamless integration of these diverse data sources. The zero-copy network and data cloud are designed precisely for this purpose. They eliminate the need for costly and complex data replication, instead providing a unified, real-time view across all your organizational data. This integrated approach reveals a critical insight: A significant portion of the context required for effective self-service and agent-assisted interactions resides within unstructured data. By bringing together the rich narrative of unstructured content with the precise, actionable insights of structured data, we create a holistic understanding of the customer and their needs.\nThis unified approach empowers AI agents to:\nDeliver highly accurate responses: By cross-referencing information from various sources, agents can validate facts and provide solutions with a high degree of certainty.\nProvide relevant and contextual solutions: Understanding the full scope of a customer's situation, including their history, preferences, and the specific details of their inquiry, allows for deeply relevant and personalized recommendations.\nEnhance self-service capabilities: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can help customers access a wealth of knowledge and resolve their issues independently and efficiently.\nImprove agent efficiency: When AI agents can quickly access all necessary information, human agents can focus on more complex, empathetic, or strategic interactions, rather than spending time searching for data.\nProactively address customer needs: By analyzing combined data, AI can anticipate potential issues or opportunities, leading to proactive outreach and a more satisfying customer journey.\nAlso: Business leaders continue to push workers toward daily use of AI\nIn essence, the combination of structured and unstructured data, seamlessly integrated through a zero-copy network, transforms AI agents from simple information retrieval tools into powerful, intelligent entities capable of delivering accurate, relevant, and highly personalized responses that precisely meet and even anticipate your needs. This is the foundation of next-generation customer service and truly intelligent AI.\n2. A smart AI agent has a dynamic brain and a caring heart\nFor an AI agent to be truly effective, it requires a dynamic \"brain\" that continuously learns and adapts, rather than relying on static scripts. This living system, which we call the knowledge cycle, integrates both structured and unstructured data, comprehends user intent, and consistently improves through feedback and analytics. This advanced approach is what enables Agentforce to provide precise, context-aware responses at scale, moving far beyond the limitations of a traditional knowledge base.\nAlso: Your next job? Managing a fleet of AI agents\nDuring our pilot phase, we implemented weekly performance reviews, real-time monitoring, and AI-powered evaluation tools to constantly test and refine the quality of answers. We updated content, refined prompts, and fine-tuned retrievers, all informed by actual usage data and human review. Today, this intelligent system is embedded within Agentforce, empowering it to become smarter with each passing day.\nHowever, the science of knowledge is just one aspect. To genuinely serve customers, an agent also needs something more profound: a \"heart.\"\nExample learnings:\nDon't be too restrictive: Early on, AI agents were not to discuss competitors. But this unexpectedly blocked answers about key integrations we do have content for. Salesforce learned to coach AI agents with high-level guidance -- for example, \"put Salesforce's best interest in everything you do\" -- and it instantly understood the nuance. That was a game-changer.\nCustomers ask different types of questions: As customers got more comfortable, they started asking fundamental questions about their Salesforce relationship, like \"Who is my Account Executive?\" or \"What products do I own?\" This revealed a completely new way customers want to interact with AI, pushing us beyond simple Q&A to provide deeper, contextualized experiences\nPeople still want humans: Initially, the aim was for low human hand-off rates, even getting down to 1%. The feedback was startling; Salesforce realized that they had made it too difficult for customers to reach a human when truly needed. So, Salesforce adjusted to ensure that if a customer wants or needs to talk to a human, they can. The focus remains on customer success, not case deflection.\nAlso: 4 ways to turn AI into your business advantage\n3. Prioritizing empathy from the outset\nThe true measure of the service cycle's success isn't defined solely by an agent's technical prowess or immediate problem-solving capabilities. Its core essence resides in the profound impact on the customer's emotional experience throughout the entire interaction. A critical lesson learned and reinforced through countless customer engagements is that even the most accurate or technically sound solution can be rendered inconsequential if its delivery is mishandled or lacks a human touch. The \"what\" of the answer is important, but \"how\" it's delivered is paramount.\nThis realization led to a fundamental shift in the training philosophy, not just for the human support engineers, but also for the intelligent automation, Agentforce. Just as we meticulously train our human support engineers to consistently lead with empathy in every customer interaction, it became imperative to imbue Agentforce with this same foundational principle. It's not enough for an AI to be smart; it must also be emotionally intelligent and responsive to the human element of service.\nAlso: Perplexity joins high-powered, high-priced AI race - here's everything 'Max' includes\nConsider a highly sensitive and high-stakes scenario, such as a Salesforce outage -- a situation that can induce significant stress and frustration for our customers. In such a critical moment, the immediate response from our agent, whether human or AI, is not to immediately dive into complex technical troubleshooting or present a list of potential fixes. Instead, the interaction intentionally begins with a clear and heartfelt empathetic acknowledgment. Phrases like \"I'm truly sorry to hear that you're experiencing this issue\" or \"I understand how frustrating an outage can be\" serve to validate the customer's feelings and establish a connection based on understanding and shared concern.\nFollowing this empathetic opening, the response shifts to convey a tangible sense of urgency and commitment to swift resolution: \"I'll get you connected to a dedicated support engineer as fast as possible to resolve this for you,\" or \"Rest assured, we are actively working on this, and I'll ensure you get the immediate attention you need.\" This initial exchange is deliberately not about technical knowledge or diagnostic steps. It's about unequivocally prioritizing customer success and well-being above all else. It's about demonstrating that we hear them, we understand their plight, and we are mobilizing resources to help.\nAlso: How I used ChatGPT to quickly fix a critical plugin - without touching a line of code\nThis strategic approach transforms Agentforce from merely being a smart tool capable of processing information and executing tasks into a truly trusted partner in the customer's journey. By mirroring the best practices of our most empathetic human support engineers, Agentforce transcends its technical capabilities to foster a sense of reliability, understanding, and genuine care. This human-centric design ensures that even in the most challenging situations, the customer feels heard, respected, and confident that their needs are being addressed with both urgency and compassion, thereby elevating the entire service experience.\nKey lesson: Prioritizing the human element in AI-powered service\nInitially, the focus on efficiency led to an overly low 1% human hand-off rate within AI agents. This made it difficult for customers to connect with a human representative, negatively impacting satisfaction and public perception.\nSalesforce learned that empathy and soft skills -- the heart of service -- are as crucial as data accuracy and organization -- the brain or knowledge cycle. While the initial launch prioritized the brain, Salesforce quickly realized the importance of how an agent makes customers feel. For critical situations like an outage, an agent needs to convey empathy and urgency, not just troubleshoot.\nAlso: AI agents will be ambient, but not autonomous - what that means for us\nTherefore, Salesforce adjusted the hand-off rate to 4%, ensuring seamless human connections to build trust and satisfaction. By mastering both the heart and brain cycles, AI agents deliver the exceptional, empathetic customer experiences expected from Salesforce.\nThe path to becoming an autonomous enterprise, using a hybrid workforce of humans and digital labor powered by AI agents, will require constant experimentation and learning. Go fast, but don't hurry. A balanced approach, using your organization's brains and hearts, will be key to success. Once you start, you will never go back. The benefits are too good to pass up -- for your customers, employees, business partners, and communities. And with every conversation, you will find ways to improve.

I'll dig into just about any AI-related technology and see what I can make it do. Many of you have read my ongoing shootouts comparing AIs for programming and AI content checkers, among other kinds of tools.\nBut that's using AI in a rigorous lab environment to provide test results to ZDNET readers. Like many of you, I've also started using AI to augment my workflow and increase my productivity.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\nI wear a lot of hats; I run a small business with my wife, who also has her own business, where I'm the tech guy and designer. I also work with a number of industry groups. I have a fairly popular security software product for WordPress users. And I'm constantly working on projects, ranging from 3D printing the ultimate charging tower, to trying to make an AI-assisted Etsy store, to composing and publishing music, and using an AI for help with some of the marketing activities.\nI should note that I never, ever use AI to produce my core content. No article, song, or social media post is ever written using an AI tool. My work product is mine. But I do use AI to help me get through other aspects of my workload.\nI have a particular interest in how AI helps programming, how AI can support graphics work, and how AI can support video production.\nHere are the tools I'm willing to pay for -- and why.\n1. ChatGPT Plus - $20/mo\nSpeaking of AI and programming, it has essentially doubled my programming output. I use AI to help me with common-knowledge programming. I talked about it in-depth in my 25 tips article, but the core benefit is getting ChatGPT to write code for published APIs, so I don't have to spend time searching for code examples and trying to reverse-engineer comments on various programming boards.\nAnd yes, I mentioned ChatGPT. While more chatbots capable of passing my programming tests have been introduced in the last year, ChatGPT does the job well enough, and hey, who wants another monthly fee?\nAlso: How ChatGPT actually works (and why it's been so game-changing)\nIn fact, that's a big part of why I'm paying $20/mo for ChatGPT Plus. Sure, I've signed up and paid for some of the other AIs just to test them, but ChatGPT Plus is the only chatbot I have found so consistently useful that I keep it as a regularly used tool.\nI use ChatGPT for lots of research tasks, sometimes throwing math problems at it, and all sorts of other questions and problems I'm dealing with. While I never take its output as an unimpeachable source of truth, I do find ChatGPT to be a very useful sounding board, substantially more so than a quick Google search.\nNow, to be fair, I did outline five ways that an AI could help me in Gmail. If Gemini could do these things reliably, I'd sign back up in a heartbeat. But I just don't need the current email message I'm reading summarized, and I sure don't need it to write a friendlier or more professional version of whatever I've currently written. I tried Gmail's new AI unsubscribe feature, and it only found about 10 newsletters, yet I get thousands of emails and hundreds of newsletter-style messages every day. So, I'm leaving that one unbought.\n2. Midjourney - $10/mo\nI played around a lot with DALL-E, ChatGPT's earlier image generation tool. But recently, OpenAI introduced a new image generator in GPT-4o, and it's quite the beast. I have found that it generates great results, but it has more guardrails than another tool I pay for, Midjourney.\nAlso: I tested 10 AI content detectors - and these 5 correctly identified AI text every time\nBut even though I get image generation with my $20/mo ChatGPT Plus fee, I pay an extra $10/mo for Midjourney. Why?\nOne of the reasons is subjective. I like a lot of the images I get with Midjourney. Midjourney also allows me to describe artist styles, and lets me riff off a vast array of stylistic choices. ChatGPT, perhaps because of guardrails imposed by OpenAI, doesn't present as many choices.\nBut I also have two specific and objective reasons for paying for Midjourney. First, because image generation is so subjective, it's nice to have a variety of tools when seeking a representation of what you have in your head. I'll try different prompts and even the same prompts with both tools and take what works best.\nAlso: How to selectively modify a Midjourney image to create an artistic statement\nSecond, every month I generate a promotional image for my wife's online business. She has an e-commerce site that supports a popular hobby. Each month, on her very active Facebook group, she gives a craft-along theme to her users. I generate an image for that theme. Over the months, I've found that Midjourney does a far better job of generating an image that incorporates elements of the hobby. That said, some months I bounce back and forth between both tools until I can get an image that meets her business's needs.\nBecause Midjourney shaves what used to be two to three hours of work pushing pixels in Photoshop to generate those images down to about 10 minutes, it's worth the $10/month to me just for that project.\nPhotoshop Generative Fill - Honorable mention\nIn the title of this article, I said I pay for two AI tools. That's sort of true. I pay for Adobe's Creative Cloud suite in addition to ChatGPT Plus and Midjourney. But since I've been using and paying for Creative Cloud -- and before that, Photoshop -- long before there was generative fill, I'm not counting it in my AI tools list.\nAlso: I use Photoshop's AI tool every day - here are my 5 essential tips for the best results\nIf Adobe removed generative fill tomorrow, I'd still pay for Photoshop. To be clear, I don't like paying for it. It's costly, and the two-computer license limitation is restrictive. But a few years back, I tried switching to Affinity Photo, which at the time was $50 (it's now $70). That one-time fee is roughly what I pay each month for Creative Cloud, so it had a lot of potential.\nTo be clear, Affinity Photo is a fine application. But I've been using Photoshop since before the Clinton administration. To say I have Photoshop muscle memory is an understatement. It's a product I use almost every day. Switching to another application, while I could do it if I had to, slows down my workflow considerably.\nAlso: What to do if Generative Fill is grayed out in Adobe Photoshop AI\nSo, I don't consider my monthly expense for Creative Cloud to be an AI expense. That said, I find generative fill (and its various other AI tricks) very helpful. I often use it in concert with Midjourney and ChatGPT image generation.\nThree tools I'm thinking about\nI run a business online and, as such, rely on a wide variety of cloud services. Those fees add up, and now they're all going up in price. So while it might be nice to add more AI tools, I'm keeping it under control. It's very easy to just click OK and find yourself spending hundreds of dollars more every month.\nThat said, I am thinking about adding three more tools. I'm a bit hesitant, because each one has its annoyances and limitations, but they're on the short list for a quick order if I can ever justify an immediate performance improvement on one project or another.\nNotion AI\nThe first is Notion AI. I am deeply invested in Notion for all my project work. I also use it to write and organize all my articles, as well as schedule them, plan them, research them, and capture notes and assets. Notion AI is interesting because it would work like NotebookLM, limiting its knowledge base to my Notion account. That could be very useful as I work on more projects. But at one point, when Notion overcharged my wife's account, they were completely unsupportive and unsympathetic. So, I hesitate to give them more business.\nNotebookLM Pro\nGoogle's NotebookLM Pro is another contender. Now that Pocket, the article archiving service, is being discontinued, I considered using NotebookLM Pro as a replacement. The idea that I could save articles in NotebookLM as sources and then have the AI review them, summarize them, and analyze them seemed ideal, especially as a research tool.\nBut... the free version of NotebookLM only allows 50 sources per notebook. The Pro version, which is normally another $20/mo ( you can usually get a few starter months at a discounted rate), increases that limit, but only to 300 sources per notebook. My archive has well over 30,000 sources, which is beyond NotebookLM's limits. There is a $249/month plan (yowzah!), but all Google will say about limits is \"Highest limits and best model capabilities (later this year)\". What does that even mean?\nDescript\nDescript (for $16-$24/mo) is an AI video editing tool. This isn't a tool that does text-to-video generation. Instead, it's a tool that helps you take your video clips and edit them. Right now, I'm a very big Final Cut Pro user. Final Cut has added some AI features, but it lags far behind DaVinci Pro and Premiere Pro (because Apple lagging in AI is no surprise, right?).\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to write code - and my top trick for debugging what it generates\nDescript automatically removes filler words and retakes, cleans up sound quality without any fuss, and does automatic multicam editing. It also promises to take long-form videos and automatically create clip videos, which could be a huge time-saver. The product also has some more \"out there\" features which I wouldn't use, including fake avatar generation and fake speech generation.\nThe thing is, Descript is aimed more at multiple talking head videos. I'm not sure it could handle the sort of in-depth technical hands-on project videos I do. So, it's still in the \"maybe someday\" category, for now at least.\nWhat do you use?\nDo you pay for any AI tools? Which ones, and why? Is there an AI tool that you strongly recommend I should be using that I didn't mention?

      "text": "How AI agents can generate $450 billion by 2028 - and what stands in the way\nAgentic AI is one of the fastest-emerging technologies in business, with the potential to generate $450 billion in economic value through revenue uplift and cost savings across surveyed countries by 2028, according to the Rise of agentic AI: How trust is the key to human-AI collaboration. The new report from Capgemini Research Institute reveals insights from a survey of 1,500 senior executives across 14 countries on the emergence of AI agents as a transformative force in business.\nAlso: My 8 ChatGPT Agent tests produced only 1 near-perfect result - and a lot of alternative facts\nKey findings from the Capgemini report\n- A $450 billion opportunity: By 2028, AI agents could generate up to $450 billion in economic value through revenue growth and cost savings across surveyed markets.\n- Adoption is accelerating, but maturity remains low: Only 2% of organizations have deployed AI agents at scale, 12% at partial scale, 23% have launched pilots, and 61% are exploring deployment. Fifteen percent of business processes are expected to reach semi- or full autonomy in the next 12 months. However, fewer than one in five organizations report high maturity with respect to the data and technology infrastructure needed to implement agentic AI.\n- Trust in fully autonomous AI agents is declining: It dropped from 43% to 27% in one year. Ethical concerns, lack of transparency, and limited understanding of agentic capabilities are key barriers. Ethical concerns around AI, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the \"AI black box,\" are prevalent, but few organizations act decisively to mitigate them.\n- Human-AI collaboration is the future: By 2028, 38% of organizations will have AI agents as team members within human teams. Blended teams -- where humans and AI agents collaborate -- will become the norm, driving productivity and innovation. This means that in three years, organizations expect to have AI agents as members within human-supervised teams; AI agents must be seen not as tools, but as part of the team.\nWhat are AI agents and agentic AI?\nHere is Capgemini's definition: \"AI agents are programs/platforms/software that are connected to the business environment with a defined boundary, make decisions autonomously, and act to achieve specific goals with or without human intervention. With the latest advances in reasoning AI models, AI agents are able to break down tasks, 'reason' through potential pathways to find solutions to the given problem, try those solutions, and present successful outcomes.\"\nCapgemini notes that the capabilities of AI agents are increasing fast, and the costs to operate and develop AI agents is declining. AI agents are one of the top technology trends for 2025.\nMy 10 key takeaways from Capgemini's research\n- AI agents' impact on the economy\nAI agents could generate around $450 billion in total economic value in the 14 countries surveyed by 2028. Organizations with scaled implementation are projected to generate around $382 million (2.5% of annual revenue) on average over the next three years, while we expect others to generate around $76 million (0.5% of annual revenue). This applies to an average organization with $15 billion in annual revenues. Capgemini expects that surveyed organizations will collectively achieve $19 billion in gains over the next 12 months, with this figure projected to increase to $92 billion by the third year.\nOther predictions outside of Capgemini include:\nAlso: Is HR ready for AI?\nGoldman Sachs predicts that Gen AI will drive a 6.1% rise in US GDP over the next decade -- by 2028, this translates to around $540 billion in the US.\nIDC forecasts that AI technologies overall will influence 3.5% of global GDP by 2030 -- by 2028, this implies an impact of around $1.9 trillion globally.\nMIT research estimates that a combination of AI capabilities could automate around one-fifth (slightly over 20%) of value-added tasks.\n2. Business confidence in AI agents\nA substantial 93% anticipate that organizations that have successfully scaled the implementation of AI agents within the next 12 months will achieve a competitive advantage.\nAlso: Business leaders continue to push workers toward daily use of AI\n3. Adoption of AI agents is on the rise\nCurrently, 23% of organizations have initiated AI agent pilot projects, while 14% have progressed to partial or full-scale implementation. About 30% are exploring AI agents, and another 31% are preparing for experimentation or deployment within the next six to 12 months. In fact, the pace of AI agent adoption mirrors the rapid trajectory seen with generative AI.\n4. Businesses on on their way to becoming autonomous\nMany organizations that claim to be implementing AI agents are deploying solutions with limited autonomy. As many as 85% of business processes are expected to be at low levels of autonomy in the next 12 months. Industries noted in the Capgemini report include automotive, financial services, life sciences, telecom, and retail -- with specific company examples and use cases.\nAlso: Your next job? Managing a fleet of AI agents\nThe report noted that 62% of companies prefer to partner with solution providers, such as Salesforce and system integrators, to implement or tailor already available AI agents. The ready availability of in-built agents, pre-existing integrations with legacy systems, and staff fluency in using these tools likely contribute to the preference.\n5. AI agent future roadmaps are evolving\nCapgemini found that 16% of organizations have developed a strategy and roadmap to implement agentic AI. Research found that 39% of organizations don't have a strategy, but have multiple initiatives across functions to develop innovative solutions that can be scaled up.\n6. AI leadership is key to accelerating AI agent roadmaps\nThe need for dedicated leadership to oversee AI agent initiatives is also a priority, with 26% appointing new leaders specifically for AI agents and 59% delegating this responsibility to existing AI or gen AI leadership.\n7. Preferred agentic AI pricing models vary\nOver half of organizations prefer consumption-based pricing for AI models within AI agents. Consumption-based (55%), platform-based (43%), and license-based(37%) models are the preferred pricing models among organizations for agentic AI solutions.\n8. Customer-facing business functions most likely to adopt AI agents\nCustomer services and support, IT, and sales are the functions where most executives predict that AI agents will be actively performing at least one process or sub-process daily within the next 12 months. These functions often involve high volumes of interaction, require responsiveness over precision, and depend on contextual, conversational engagement.\nAlso: The death of spreadsheets: 6 reasons why AI will soon be the dominant business reporting tool\n9. Fully autonomous business capabilities are a longer journey\nDigital labor will handle one process by 2028, as 58% of business functions are likely to have AI agents handling at least one process or sub-process daily within three years. Over the next 12 months, we expect AI agents with Level 3 autonomy or higher to manage 15% of processes and subprocesses in each business function. This will rise to 25% within the next one to three years. Fully autonomous AI agents (Level 5) are expected to handle around 4% of business processes within three years. Capgemini noted that in the next 12 months, it expects AI agents to make 6% of day-to-day decisions, increasing to 8% in one to three years. And 25% of processes within a business function are expected to be handled by AI agents with Level 3 or higher autonomy by 2028.\n10. Trust in AI agents is key to accelerating adoption\nAlmost half (47%) of organizations in the implementation phase report above average level of trust in AI agents, compared with 37% that are still in the exploration phase. This strong correlation between trust and implementation confirms that trust plays a crucial role in the adoption of AI agents. Only 22% of executives trust fully autonomous AI agents for enterprise applications, down from 43% in 2024. The gap is widening in the wrong direction.\nAlso: Beyond the AI trust gap: A leader's playbook\nThe decline in trust is not limited to AI agents; it extends to AI and gen AI as well. Capgemini noted that half of organizations have insufficient knowledge of AI agents' capabilities. Employee skills and AI infrastructure maturity add to the trust deficiency. Over four in five (82%) organizations report low-to-medium maturity across dimensions such as computing, integration, orchestration, fine-tuning, and cybersecurity.\nThe Capgemini report concludes with this powerful reminder:\n\"The winners in this next wave of AI will not be those who simply deploy more AI tools. Rather, they will be those who rethink their business, reimagine workflows, reskill their workforces, restructure their organizations, and embed ethical safeguards from the outset.\"\nI believe AI agents may represent the biggest technological impact on businesses ever. This is not about new technology. This is about a new world. The most successful and resilient businesses of the future will be autonomous. Autonomous businesses will have a hybrid workforce -- humans and digital labor, leveraging AI agents to augment and upgrade human capabilities. AI agents will be used for both cognitive transfer and cognitive upgrade opportunities. Autonomous businesses will also position themselves to best take advantage of the new stability-performance business operating models.\nAlso: Why smart businesses use AI to offload tasks and supercharge their teams\nTo learn more about the Rise of agentic AI: How trust is the key to human-AI collaboration report from the Capgemini Research Institute, you can visit here.\nWant more stories about AI?

      "text": "Coding with AI? My top 5 tips for vetting its output - and staying out of trouble\nOur story begins, as many stories do, with a man and his AI. The man, like many men, is a bit of a geek and a bit of a programmer. He also needs a haircut.\nThe AI is the culmination of thousands of years of human advancement, all put to the service of making the man's life a little easier. The man, of course, is me. I'm that guy.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\nUnfortunately, while AI can be incredibly brilliant, it also has a propensity to lie, mislead, and make shockingly stupid mistakes. It is the stupid part that we will be discussing in this article.\nAnecdotal evidence does have value. My reports on how I've solved some problems quickly with AI are real. The programs I used AI to write with are still in use. I have used AI to help speed up aspects of my programming flow, especially when I focus on the sweet spots where I'm less productive and the AI is quite knowledgeable, like writing functions that call publicly published APIs.\nAlso: I'm an AI tools expert, and these are the only two I pay for (plus three I'm considering)\nYou know how we got here. Generative AI burst onto the scene at the cusp of 2023 and has been blasting its way into knowledge work ever since.\nOne area, as the narrative goes, where AI truly shines is its ability to write code and help manage IT systems. Those claims are not untrue. I have shown, several times, how AI has solved coding and systems engineering problems I have personally experienced.\nAI coding in the real world: What science reveals\nNew tools always come with big promises. But do they deliver in real-world settings?\nMost of my reporting on programming effectiveness has been based on personal anecdotal evidence: my own programming experiences using AI. But I'm one guy. I have limited time to devote to programming and, like every programmer, I have certain areas where I spend most of my coding time.\nAlso: I tested 10 AI content detectors - and these 5 correctly identified AI text every time\nRecently, though, a nonprofit research organization called METR (Model Evaluation & Threat Research) did a more thorough analysis of AI coding productivity.\nTheir methodology seems sound. They worked with 16 experienced open-source developers who have actively contributed to large, popular repositories. The METR analysts provided those developers with 246 issues from the repositories that needed fixing. The coders were given about half the issues where they had to work on their own, and about half where they could use an AI for help.\nThe results were striking and unexpected. While the developers themselves estimated that AI assistance increased their productivity by an average of 24%, METR's analytics showed instead that AI assistance slowed them down by an average of 19%.\nThat's a bit of a head-scratcher. METR put together a list of factors that might explain the slowdown, including over-optimism about AI usefulness, high-developer familiarity with their repositories (and less AI knowledge), the complexity of large repositories, lack of AI reliability, and an ongoing problem where the AI refuses to use \"important tacit knowledge or context.\"\nAlso: How AI coding agents could destroy open-source software\nI would suggest that two other factors might have limited effectiveness:\nChoice of problem: The developers were told which issues they had to use AI help on and which issues they couldn't. My experience suggests knowledgeable developers must choose where to use AI based on the problem that needs to be solved. In my case, for example, getting the AI to write a regular expression (something I don't like doing and I'm fairly crappy at) would save me a lot more time than getting the AI to modify unique code I've already written, work on regularly, and know inside and out.\nChoice of AI: According to the report, the developers used Cursor, an AI-centric fork of VS Code, which used Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet at the time. When I tested 3.5 Sonnet, the results were terrible, with Sonnet failing three out of four of my tests. Subsequently, my tests of Claude 4 Sonnet were considerably better. METR reported that developers rejected more than 65% of the code the AI generated. That's going to take time.\nThat time when ChatGPT suggested nuking my system\nMETRs results are interesting. AI is clearly a double-edged sword when it comes to coding help. But there's also no doubt that AI can provide considerable value to coders. If anything, I think this test once again proves the contention that AI is a great tool for experienced programmers, but a potential high-risk resource for newbies.\nAlso: Why I'm switching to VS Code. Hint: It's all about AI tool integration\nLet's look at a concrete example, one that could have cost me a lot of time and trouble if I followed ChatGPT's advice.\nI was setting up a Docker container on my home lab using Portainer (a tool that helps manage Docker containers). For some reason, Portainer would not enable the Deploy button to create the container.\nIt had been a long day, so I didn't see the obvious problem. Instead, I asked ChatGPT. I fed ChatGPT screenshots of the configuration, as well as my Docker configuration file.\nChatGPT recommended that I uninstall and reinstall Portainer. It also suggested I remove Docker from the Linux distro and use the package manager to reinstall it. These actions would have had the effect of killing all my containers.\nOf note, ChatGPT didn't recommend or ask if I had backups of the containers. It just gave me the command line sequences it recommended I cut and paste to delete and rebuild Portainer and Docker. It was a wildly destructive and irresponsible recommendation.\nThe irony is that ChatGPT never figured out why Portainer wouldn't let me deploy the new container, but I did. It turns out I never filled out the container's name field. That's it.\nAlso: What is AI vibe coding? It's all the rage but it's not for everyone - here's why\nBecause I'm fairly experienced, I hesitated when ChatGPT told me to nuke my installation. However, someone relying on the AI for advice could have potentially brought down an entire server for want of typing in a container name.\nOverconfident and underinformed AIs: A dangerous combo\nI've also experienced the AI going completely off the rails. I've experienced it giving advice that was not only completely useless, but also presented with the apparent confidence of an expert.\nAlso: Google's Jules AI coding agent built a new feature I could actually ship - while I made coffee\nIf you're going to use AI tools to support your development or IT work, these tips might keep you out of trouble:\n- If there's not much publicly available information, the AI can't help. But the AI will make stuff up based on what little it knows, without admitting that it is lacking experience.\n- Like my dog, once the AI gets fixated on one thing, it often refuses to look at alternatives. If the AI is stuck on one approach, don't make the mistake of believing that its polite recommendations about a new approach are real. It's still going down the same rabbit hole. Start a new session.\n- If you don't know a lot, don't rely on the AI. Keep up your learning. Experienced devs can tell the difference between what will work and what won't. But if you're trying to put all the coding on the back of the AI, you won't know when or where it goes wrong or how to fix it.\n- Coders often use specific tools for specific tasks. A website might be built using Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Flask, and Jinja. You choose each tool because you know what it does well. Choose your AI tools the same way. For example, I don't use AI for business logic, but I gain productivity using AI to write API calls and public knowledge, where it can save me a lot of time.\n- Test everything an AI produces. Everything. Line by individual line. The AI can save a ton of time, but it can also make enormous mistakes. Yes, taking the time and energy to test by hand can help prevent errors. If the AI offers to write unit tests, let it. But test the tests.\nBased on your experience level, here's how I recommend you think about AI assistance:\n- If you know nothing about a subject or skill: AI can help you pass as if you do, but it could be amazingly wrong, and you might not know.\n- If you're an expert in a subject or skill: AI can help, but it will piss you off. Your expertise gets used not only to separate the AI-stupid from the AI-useful, but to carefully craft a path where AI can actually help.\n- If you're in between: AI is a mixed bag. It could help you or get you in trouble. Don't delegate your skill-building to the AI because it could leave you behind.\nAlso: How I used ChatGPT to analyze, debug, and rewrite a broken plugin from scratch - in an hour\nGenerative AI can be an excellent helper for experienced developers and IT pros, especially when used for targeted, well-understood tasks. But its confidence can be deceptive and dangerous.\nAI can be useful, but always double-check its work.\nHave you used AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude to help with your development or IT work? Did they speed things up, or nearly blow things up? Are you more confident or more cautious when using AI on critical systems? Have you found specific use cases where AI really shines, or where it fails hilariously? Let us know in the comments below.\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

      "text": "How AI amplifies these other tech trends that matter most to business in 2025\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- AI agents are the technologies that matter most for companies in 2025.\n- AI stands out not only as a powerful technology wave on its own but also as a foundational amplifier of other trends.\n- Autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital AI agents, are moving from pilot projects to practical applications.\nWhich frontier technologies matter most for companies in 2025? According to McKinsey research, there are 13 new frontier technologies that matter most to companies, including agentic AI.\nAlso: How AI agents can generate $450 billion by 2028 - and what stands in the way\nResearch from other industry analyst firms validate the economic impact of AI, including a $450 billion market associated with agentic AI by 2028. This year's technology developments highlight a future where technology is more adaptive, collaborative, and essential for solving global problems.\nMcKinsey saw this across various fields, from the increasing prevalence of robotics and autonomous systems to the critical need for responsible AI innovations. McKinsey identified a set of themes that capture the impact of these frontier technologies, including:\n- The rise of autonomous systems - Autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital agents, are moving from pilot projects to practical applications. Autonomous AI agents are now enabling companies to be built like a stealth aircraft.\n- New human-machine collaboration models - Human-machine interaction is entering a new phase defined by more natural interfaces, multimodal inputs, and adaptive intelligence.\n- Scaling challenges - The surging demand for compute-intensive workloads -- especially from gen AI, robotics, and immersive environments -- is creating new demands on global infrastructure.\n- Regional and national competition - Global competition over critical technologies has intensified.

      "text": "Is HR ready for AI?\nA report from technology analyst firm Valoir has found that most companies are either already leveraging AI for HR activities, such as recruiting, learning, and talent management, or they plan to do so within the next 24 months.\nHowever, there's a significant gap in terms of policies, practices, and training for safe and effective AI adoption. Only 34% of organizations have a policy on generative AI (gen AI), and even fewer offer effective training.\nAlso: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon\nThis result suggests that HR departments must prioritize developing robust policies, guidance, and training to ensure AI adoption maximizes benefits while minimizing risks within HR and across the rest of the organization.\nWhat you need to know\nHere are some of the key findings from Valoir's research:\n- Recruiting is the most common area where gen AI is used in organizations today, with more than 30% of organizations reporting usage and an additional 36% planning to adopt the technology for recruiting in the next 24 months.\n- The rate of adoption of AI for training and development, core HR, and performance management has doubled in the past two years.\n- Multiple HR areas are ripe for AI automation, including recruiting, payroll management, and performance management.\n- The lack of AI skills and expertise is the biggest hurdle for AI adoption, as noted by 37% of HR organizations, followed by immaturity of AI solutions (15%), and regulatory or compliance concerns (15%).\n- Only 34% of organizations have a policy on the use of gen AI, and even fewer have a policy on the ethical use of AI.\n- Only 31% of organizations have training for the effective use of AI. This proportion has more than doubled since 2023, indicating progress. However, only 10% of organizations have a training or development program in place for workers whose jobs or roles are at risk of replacement.\nUnderstanding the value of AI in HR\nHR leaders see the most potential benefit from AI in the areas of recruiting (25%), training and development (18%), core HR (11%), performance management (10%), and workforce management (10%).\nTalent management, which was the third-ranked area for AI's perceived value potential in 2023, fell behind core HR, performance management, and workforce management in 2025.\nAlso: You've heard about AI killing jobs, but here are 15 news ones AI could create\nThe driver behind the increased value of AI in HR is that gen AI's authoring, recommendation, and summarization capabilities have vastly improved in the past two years.\nData remains a challenge, especially accessing external sources. Data silos make it more difficult to apply AI for analysis without data harmonization and integration of multiple sources.\nPotential risks for AI in HR\nThe use of AI in HR brings not just FOMO (fear of missing out) but also FOMU (fear of messing up). The intersection of people, data, and money leaves very little room for error.\nThe potential for errors when scaling AI-driven automation in recruiting, payroll, and performance management may lead HR leaders to pause their implementations to ensure data quality and AI governance policies minimize potential risks.\nAlso: 5 ways you can plug the widening AI skills gap at your business\nThe top areas of risk include payroll management (25%), recruiting (24%), performance management (22%), core HR (7%), and talent management (6%). HR leaders are also concerned about biases in AI algorithms due to poor model training, flawed data used to train the models, and poorly governed access to personal and confidential employee data.\nData compromises and security are risk factors, and without guardrails and training, applications and employees can expose confidential HR data to language models.\nIn addition, AIs can continue to deliver hallucinations. Biases and toxicity are risk factors. Placing a human in the loop continues to be a recommended practice to reduce these risk factors.\nHow different HR functions use AI\nRecruiting leads other HR functions in adopting AI. Almost a third (30%) of recruiting staff use AI to support some activities. Training and development and talent management are the second-largest adopters of AI in HR.\nAlso: AI won't take your job, but this definitely will\nValoir found that 65% of organizations are either currently using AI or planning to apply AI to recruiting within the next 24 months. Payroll management and benefits management continue to be the areas with the lowest adoption of AI due to the risks associated with using sensitive employee data.\nBarriers to the adoption of AI by HR\nThe biggest barriers are a lack of AI skills and expertise (37%), immaturity of AI solutions (15%), and regulatory or compliance concerns (15%). In 2023, only 26% of HR leaders cited skills and expertise as the main barrier hindering their adoption efforts.\nAlso: The most critical job skill you need to thrive in the AI revolution\nOther practical reasons for slow adoption of AI in HR: resistance to change; poor AI marketing and messaging, and internal leadership advocacy; and lack of policies, training, and communication plans.\nValoir's findings highlight just how far many organizations still have to go:\n- Only 37% of organizations have a policy for using AI.\n- Just 33% had a policy addressing the ethical use of AI.\n- Only 31% had training for the effective use of AI\n- A mere 9% had training plans in place for employees whose jobs might be displaced by AI.\nThe sense of urgency for adopting AI technologies in HR is growing rapidly. Valoir's research highlights that organizations must work hard to realize the full benefits of AI. To learn more about the Valoir research, you can visit here."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nHow AI can help design your company like a stealth aircraft\nThe Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, the first stealth aircraft, had a striking design driven by radar invisibility rather than intimidation. Its flat, triangular surfaces minimized radar detection but caused instability in yaw, pitch, and roll -- the three dimensions of flight control.\nMost aircraft are designed to be stable, allowing pilots to easily control their movement and return to a steady course after disturbances. Stability is crucial for safety and ease of flight, exemplified by the Cessna 172 Skyhawk, a highly stable trainer aircraft forgiving of pilot error. However, some aircraft prioritize performance, like fighter jets that require high maneuverability, which inherently reduces stability. Traditionally, aircraft design involved a trade-off between stability and performance.\nAlso: 5 ways you can plug the widening AI skills gap at your business\nThe F-117 overcame its inherent instability through fly-by-wire technology, where computer systems assist pilots by controlling the aircraft's surfaces electronically, unlike traditional mechanical systems. This innovation decoupled the stability requirement from the pursuit of specific performance goals like stealth.\nFly-by-wire is now common, and its evolution has led to Intelligent Flight Control Systems (IFCS) powered by artificial intelligence (AI). These systems go beyond stabilization, actively working to achieve the pilot's objectives, predict failures, and even compensate for damage, optimizing performance in flight. The development of fly-by-wire and IFCS demonstrates a shift in aircraft design. Previously, human limitations necessitated compromises in stability for performance. Now, technology manages stability, allowing for the design of aircraft optimized for specific outcomes like passenger safety, radar evasion, combat effectiveness, or fuel efficiency, removing prior constraints.\nThis trade-off between stability and performance isn't unique to aircraft; it applies to various product and system designs, influenced by the desired level of control. Control can be achieved by either stabilizing behavior for easier manipulation (down-control) or amplifying behavior for greater impact (up-control), depending on the user's expertise. Down-control prioritizes ease of use and forgiveness through stabilization, often sacrificing performance. Up-control prioritizes specific performance characteristics like speed and precision, often at the cost of stability.\nConsider a beginner tennis player needing a forgiving racket (down-control) versus an expert wanting a responsive racket for strategic play (up-control). This distinction exists in running shoes (stability versus speed), skis (ease versus performance), kitchen knives (general use versus specialized precision), and photography (automated assistance versus manual control).\nAlso: Why WFH isn't dead and how digital-first companies have a big AI advantage\nThe integration of AI fundamentally alters this compromise by managing stability, allowing users and designers to focus on and achieve maximum performance, leading to entirely new system possibilities. This concept extends to business. While stability is often seen as desirable, especially in turbulent times, an overemphasis on it might hinder high performance. Ultimately, AI allows organizations to move beyond the traditional stability-performance trade-off, designing for maximum performance while maintaining stability, creating new avenues for innovation and competitive advantage by delivering both reliability and high performance simultaneously.\nWe've always needed to find compromises between making something easy for us to use and manage, and making us perform at a high level. The more stable a system is, the easier it is for us to use and manage; the higher performing it is, the more unstable it tends to be. At some performance point, the system becomes so unstable that it's impossible for a human to use/manage it -- and there's no point in designing a system like that.\nAlso: Tech leaders are seemingly rushing to deploy agentic AI - here's why\nFar from being inherently unstable, our businesses -- which are a type of system -- are actually built for stability. Our hierarchical organization structure, our departmental systems and silos, our business processes are all intentionally designed to be stable. We talk about pillars and foundations, and a form of resilience that sounds a lot more like resistance to \"tumultuous times\" than embracing them or seeing opportunity in them. It's a truism that humans hate change, and we see that in business all the time.\nPowerful and advanced technology like AI means we do not have to make that design compromise or trade-off anymore. We can design for high performance and activate AI to take care of the instability for us. Our companies today are conventionally super-stable because that makes them easy for us to manage and because we think it gives them survivability amid external turbulence, chaos, instability, whatever you want to call it. But that super stability makes it very hard for them to adjust course and even harder to achieve high performance.\nAlso: How AI can help you finally demolish your business's mounting technical debt\nThe unrecognized effects of blockage on corporate success are significant, and growing faster than ever before. Blockages, waste, silos are all part of it. AI offers us the opportunity to redesign them -- to make them high-performance without losing the appearance and feeling of stability. It's not a matter of making them respond to instability; it's a matter of making them inherently unstable themselves to achieve high performance, but managing that instability with AI.\nThis is an important inflection point for business leaders. There's a fork in the road and the choice is between a path that's very unfamiliar but with nonlinear potential and a path that's very familiar but destined for obsolescence. That second path is the one designed for and led by humans.\nThis article was co-authored by Henry King, co-author of Boundless and a new book, Autonomous, Wiley October 2025.\nWant more stories about AI?
