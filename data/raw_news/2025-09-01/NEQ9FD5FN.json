      "text": "When is Labor Day 2025? What to know about holiday's history and why it is celebrated\nWith the sun setting earlier and pumpkin spice lattes returning to menus, summer is wrapping up. It also means Labor Day is approaching, which marks the traditional end of summer as schools reopen, and vacationers return from trips.\nDuring the three-day Labor Day weekend, many Americans will travel, shop for deals online and in-store and maybe sneak in one final visit to the beach or neighborhood pool.\nHowever, the federal holiday is much more than just the summer's last hurrah. Observed each year on the first Monday of September, Labor Day is also a celebration of the hard-won achievements of America's labor movement and a recognition of what workers have contributed to the nation's prosperity.\nHere's what to know about the Labor Day holiday, including when it is in 2025 and how it started.\nWhen is Labor Day in 2025?\nThis year, Labor Day falls on Monday, Sept. 1.\nWhy is Labor Day celebrated?\nRooted in the labor movement of the 19th century, the Labor Day holiday originated during a dismal time for America's workers, who faced long hours, low wages and unsafe conditions.\nAs labor unions and activists advocated and fought for better treatment for workers at the height of the Industrial Revolution, the idea arose to establish a day dedicated to celebrating the members of trade and labor unions, according to History.com.\nHow did Labor Day begin?\nTwo workers can make a solid claim to the title of Labor Day's official founder, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\nSome records show that it was Peter J. McGuire, the co-founder of the American Federation of Labor, who in 1882 first suggested the idea for the holiday. However, recent research supports the contention that machinist Matthew Maguire proposed the holiday in 1882, while serving as secretary of the Central Labor Union in New York.\nRegardless of who started the holiday, Labor Day soon became recognized by labor activists and individual states long before it became a federal holiday.\nOrganized by the Central Labor Union, the Labor Day holiday was first celebrated in New York City in 1882, according to the labor department. On that day, 10,000 workers took unpaid time off to march from City Hall to Union Square, according to History.com.\nNew York was also the first state to introduce a bill recognizing Labor Day, but Oregon was the first to pass such a law in 1887, the labor department states. By 1894, 32 states had adopted the holiday.\nWhen did Labor Day first become federally recognized?\nLabor Day became a national holiday in 1894 when President Grover Cleveland signed a law passed by Congress designating the first Monday in September a holiday for workers.\nThe federal recognition was hard-won, having come after a wave of unrest among workers and labor activists brought the issue of workers' rights into public view.\nIn May that year, employees of the Pullman Palace Car Company in Chicago went on strike to protest wage cuts and the firing of union representatives, according to History.com. A month later, the government dispatched troops to Chicago to break up a boycott of the Pullman railway cars initiated by labor activist Eugene V. Debs, unleashing a wave of fatal riots.\nCongress quickly passed an act making Labor Day a legal holiday in the District of Columbia and the territories. By June 28, Cleveland signed it into law.\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Observed the first Monday in September, Labor Day is an annual celebration of the social and economic achievements of American workers. The holiday is rooted in the late nineteenth century, when labor activists pushed for a federal holiday to recognize the many contributions workers have made to America\u2019s strength, prosperity, and well-being.\nEarly Adopters\nBefore it was a federal holiday, Labor Day was recognized by labor activists and individual states. After municipal ordinances were passed in 1885 and 1886, a movement developed to secure state legislation. New York was the first state to introduce a bill, but Oregon was the first to pass a law recognizing Labor Day, on February 21, 1887. During 1887, four more states \u2013 Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York \u2013 passed laws creating a Labor Day holiday. By the end of the decade Connecticut, Nebraska and Pennsylvania had followed suit. By 1894, 23 more states had adopted the holiday, and on June 28, 1894, Congress passed an act making the first Monday in September of each year a legal holiday.\nMcGuire v. Maguire: Who Founded Labor Day?\nWho first proposed the holiday for workers? It\u2019s not entirely clear, but two workers can make a solid claim to the Founder of Labor Day title.\nSome records show that in 1882, Peter J. McGuire, general secretary of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and a co-founder of the American Federation of Labor, suggested setting aside a day for a \"general holiday for the laboring classes\" to honor those \"who from rude nature have delved and carved all the grandeur we behold.\"\nBut Peter McGuire's place in Labor Day history has not gone unchallenged. Many believe that machinist Matthew Maguire, not Peter McGuire, founded the holiday.\nRecent research seems to support the contention that Matthew Maguire, later the secretary of Local 344 of the International Association of Machinists in Paterson, New Jersey, proposed the holiday in 1882 while serving as secretary of the Central Labor Union in New York.\nAccording to the New Jersey Historical Society, after President Cleveland signed the law creating a national Labor Day, the Paterson Morning Call published an opinion piece stating that \"the souvenir pen should go to Alderman Matthew Maguire of this city, who is the undisputed author of Labor Day as a holiday.\" Both Maguire and McGuire attended the country\u2019s first Labor Day parade in New York City that year.\nThe First Labor Day\nThe first Labor Day holiday was celebrated on Tuesday, September 5, 1882, in New York City, in accordance with the plans of the Central Labor Union. The Central Labor Union held its second Labor Day holiday just a year later, on September 5, 1883.\nBy 1894, 23 more states had adopted the holiday, and on June 28, 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed a law making the first Monday in September of each year a national holiday.\nA Nationwide Holiday\nMany Americans celebrate Labor Day with parades and parties \u2013 festivities very similar to those outlined by the first proposal for a holiday, which suggested that the day should be observed with \u2013 a street parade to exhibit \"the strength and esprit de corps of the trade and labor organizations\" of the community, followed by a festival for the recreation and amusement of the workers and their families. This became the pattern for the celebrations of Labor Day.\nSpeeches by prominent men and women were introduced later, as more emphasis was placed upon the economic and civic significance of the holiday. Still later, by a resolution of the American Federation of Labor convention of 1909, the Sunday preceding Labor Day was adopted as Labor Sunday and dedicated to the spiritual and educational aspects of the labor movement.\nAmerican labor has raised the nation\u2019s standard of living and contributed to the greatest production the world has ever known and the labor movement has brought us closer to the realization of our traditional ideals of economic and political democracy. It is appropriate, therefore, that the nation pays tribute on Labor Day to the creator of so much of the nation's strength, freedom, and leadership \u2013 the American worker.\nMore Resources\nLabor Hall of Honor\nCurious about America\u2019s labor leaders?
