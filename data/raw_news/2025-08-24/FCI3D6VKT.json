      "text": "It was a busy week for the Hampton Hasselhoffs.\nLifeguards at Hampton Beach in New Hampshire last week rescued more than 140 people who were caught in rip currents, including 51 rescues on Aug. 12 alone, officials said.\n\u201cAll patrons were rescued safely without [any] further medical attention needed,\u201d State Beach Patrol Chief Patrick Murphy said by email.\nLifeguards performed 144 rescues last week from rip currents, and 20 more people were rescued over the weekend, though not all from rip currents, he said.\n\u201cWith Hurricane Erin coming up the coast, the NH State Beach Patrol-Ocean Lifeguards are encouraging all beachgoers to always swim near a lifeguard,\u201d Murphy wrote.\nHampton Beach has lifeguard coverage from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., he said.\nLast year, 66 people died in rip currents along US shores, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A rip current is a powerful, narrow channel of water flowing away from the beach and often extending through the breaker zone where waves form.\nPeople caught in a rip current should not try to fight it but go out with the current, then swim parallel to the shoreline before turning back toward the shore.\nAdvertisement\nErin is on track to pass hundreds of miles from the East Coast, but the Category 4 storm will still produce some rough surf and dangerous rip currents along New England\u2019s coastline, starting Tuesday.\nErin continues to churn in the Atlantic, packing winds of 140 miles per hour and is expected to begin turning north over the next several days and parallel the East Coast. The high surf and rip currents are forecast to ramp up Thursday and Friday as the storm passes the Northeast, the Globe\u2019s weather team reported Monday.\nAdvertisement\nMaterial from prior Globe stories was used in this report.\nTravis Andersen can be reached at travis.andersen@globe.com."
