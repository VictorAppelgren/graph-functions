      "feedback": "Your draft violates the required format and key content rules. 1) The “Up/Down” lines must be exactly four, each with the fields Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability % and must reference a canonical handle (e.g., dxy, ust10y, spx) with a causal chain and a specific catalyst window (Fed September meeting, July CPI, etc.). 2) The “Buy” line is invalid; replace it with a swing‑trade line that follows the same structure and includes explicit entry, stop, target, R/R, invalidation, trigger, probability, and confidence. 3) All probabilities must be evidence‑based; cite the IDs only when stating a specific fact or number (e.g., “Fed cuts → 0.5‑1 % DXY rise (XTQIQRP5K)”). 4) Remove any generic statements (“moderate CPI”, “stable tariffs”) unless tied to a concrete catalyst and handle. 5) Ensure the trade/outlook plan is for a tradable asset (e.g., dxy) and uses the exact naming convention (dxy, ust10y, spx). 6) Do not include a trailing reference list; keep citations inline.  Rewrite the draft to a 4‑line movers‑and‑scenarios section plus a single swing‑trade line that meets the above specifications.",
