  "content": "\u2022 US President Trump said he would be placing chip tariffs \u201cvery shortly,\u201d which will be \u201cfairly substantial\u201d, but signalled Apple (AAPL) and others will be safe during his dinner with tech CEOs at the White House on Thursday, according to CNBC.\n\u2022 Fed\u2019s Williams (voter) reiterated that he expects gradual interest rate cuts over time, while he declined to comment if the market's September rate cut view is correct.\n\u2022 US President Trump said they are going to get the war in Ukraine settled; US Defense Department said two Venezuelan military aircraft flew near a US Navy vessel in international waters.\n\u2022 APAC stocks mostly took their cues from the gains on Wall Street; European equity futures indicate a positive cash market open with Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.2% after the cash market finished with gains of 0.4% on Thursday.\n\n2. Listen to this report in the market open podcast (available on Apple and Spotify)\n\u2022 US stocks closed in the green with outperformance in the Russell 2000 while T-Notes firmed across the curve with the Dollar posting marginal gains. The focus was largely on data and Fed speak ahead of NFP on Friday, in which Challenger Layoffs accelerated while the ADP National Employment print fell below analyst expectations. Initial Jobless Claims also continued to rise above analyst forecasts, although Continued Claims declined to 1.94mln, beneath forecasts. Unit Labour Cost revisions for Q2 were revised down, below forecasts, while productivity was revised up, above the consensus. Trade data saw a widening deficit, while the ISM Services PMI report beat forecasts, with prices paid and employment little changed, but business activity and new orders accelerated. Fed speak saw Williams lean dovish, noting he sees reduced upside risk to inflation from tariffs, and that balancing has moved a bit more towards the Fed's job mandate. However, he declined to comment when asked if market pricing for the September meeting is correct.\n\u2022 SPX +0.83% at 6,502, NDX +0.93% at 23,633, DJI +0.77% at 45,621, RUT +1.26% at 2,380.\n\u2022 US President Trump said he would be placing chip tariffs \u201cvery shortly,\u201d which will be \u201cfairly substantial\u201d, but signalled Apple (AAPL) and others will be safe during his dinner with tech CEOs at the White House on Thursday, according to CNBC.\n\u2022 US President Trump is reportedly preparing to start North American trade deal renegotiations and public consultations on the key US trade deal with Mexico and Canada, which will be the first acts of a likely lengthy and contentious review, according to WSJ.\n\u2022 White House said US President Trump signed an Executive Order officially implementing the US-Japan trade agreement, while it added that Japan is working towards an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of US rice procurements and the US will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports. It was later reported that Japan and the US issued a memorandum of understanding on the USD 550bln plans with investments to be made up to January 19th, 2029.\n\u2022 Japanese PM Ishiba reiterated they will work to minimise the impacts on the economy and employment, while he added the US and Japan tariff agreement is very meaningful and it is important to implement the agreement sincerely and promptly.\n\u2022 Japan's top trade negotiator Akazawa said Japan agreed to issue joint statements on the US request and they signed an MOU on Japan's investment package. Akazawa said nothing had changed from the July 22nd agreement with regards to the USD 550bln investment package and the amended executive order does not mention most-favoured-nation treatment for pharma and chips, and will continue to push for the treatment. Furthermore, he said their stance that additional tariffs themselves are regrettable remains unchanged, as well as stated that lower auto tariffs will take effect within up to two weeks.\n\u2022 Mexican President Sheinbaum said Mexico is considering tariffs on imports from countries that do not have trade agreements, including China.\n\u2022 Ecuador\u2019s Foreign Minister said they are working towards a trade agreement with the US after meeting with US Secretary of State Rubio, while Rubio noted they have made much progress on tariff negotiations and hopes to have a positive announcement soon.\n\u2022 Anthropic is to stop selling AI services to majority Chinese-owned groups and is trying to limit the ability of Beijing to use its technology to benefit China\u2019s military and intelligence services, while Anthropic's policy will also apply to US adversaries including Russia, Iran and North Korea, according to FT.\n\u2022 Fed\u2019s Williams (voter) reiterated that he expects gradual interest rate cuts over time if the economy meets his forecasts. Williams also commented that they are always watching broader trends of data, not one report, and sees a gradual cooling in the job market. Williams sees reduced upside risk to inflation from tariffs and said it may take longer to gauge the full impact of tariffs in inflation data, while he added it is good to see tariffs not driving persistent inflation thus far, and he declined to comment if the market's September rate cut view is correct.\n\u2022 Fed's Goolsbee (2025 voter) said the labour market might be deteriorating and inflation might be picking back up, while he added there is a bit of wait and see because of uncertainty and that rates are better indicators for the labour market than raw job growth. Goolsbee also commented that the impact of tariffs on price increases is dependent on sector and noted the September Fed meeting is a live meeting, but he hasn't made up his mind.\n\u2022 Fed Governor nominee Miran said the Fed does not control the long-end of the curve, and if confirmed, he will push back on the Fed straying from the mandate, while he declined to say he would advise Trump not to fire Fed members. Furthermore, Miran said no one in the Trump administration has asked him to lower interest rates and said he has not spoken with anyone at the White House about a possible nomination for a longer Fed term.\n\u2022 US President Trump made a fresh plea for a ruling allowing him to oust Fed's Cook, according to Bloomberg.\n\u2022 US President Trump is to sign an order on Friday to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War, according to a White House official. However, a CBS News reporter noted regarding President Trump signing an executive order to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War, that it will be a secondary title as an official name change requires an Act of Congress.\n\u2022 APAC stocks mostly took their cues from the gains on Wall Street where participants digested soft labour metrics and dovish Fed speak ahead of today's NFP report.\n\u2022 ASX 200 was led higher by outperformance in real estate, tech and consumer discretionary, although gains were capped with the commodity-related sectors, consumer staples and utilities at the other end of the spectrum.\n\u2022 Nikkei 225 rallied at the open and briefly returned to above the 43,000 level after US President Trump signed an Executive Order to officially implement the US-Japan trade deal in which the US will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, although some of the gains were pared amid a firmer yen and an acceleration in Labour Cash Earnings.\n\u2022 Hang Seng and Shanghai Comp conformed to the constructive mood following recent tech-related support pledges by Beijing and with DeepSeek targeting an AI agent release by year-end, while reports also noted the PBoC may inject reasonably ample liquidity this month and that cities in China are said to examine new tactics to buy unsold homes.\n\u2022 US equity futures mostly lingered around this week's best levels after recent dovish tailwinds and as key US jobs data looms.\n\u2022 European equity futures indicate a positive cash market open with Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.2% after the cash market finished with gains of 0.4% on Thursday.\n\u2022 DXY marginally softened overnight as participants braced for the incoming Non-Farm Payrolls report, which follows predominantly weaker jobs-related data releases on Thursday. There were also recent dovish-leaning comments from Fed's Williams who expects gradual interest rate cuts over time if the economy meets his forecasts, while he also sees a gradual cooling in the job market and reduced upside risk to inflation from tariffs, but declined to comment on whether the market's September rate cut view is correct.\n\u2022 EUR/USD rebounded from yesterday's trough to gain a firmer footing at the 1.1600 handle but with further upside capped by a lack of major catalysts from the bloc.\n\u2022 GBP/USD mildly gained amid the softer dollar and with participants also awaiting UK Retail Sales data scheduled later.\n\u2022 USD/JPY trickled closer towards the 148.00 level to the downside after mixed data including the hotter-than-expected Labour Cash Earnings which showed the fastest pace of increase in seven months, while Real Cash Earnings unexpectedly grew for the first time in seven months.\n\u2022 Antipodeans eked modest gains alongside the mostly constructive mood, but with the upside capped in the absence of data from both Australia and New Zealand.\n\u2022 10yr UST futures slightly extended on the prior day's rally owing to soft labour gauges and dovish Fed speak.\n\u2022 Bund futures held on to gains after EU Retail Sales missed and heading into German Factory orders data.\n\u2022 10yr JGB futures tracked the gains in global counterparts despite mixed data releases from Japan including firmer-than-expected Labour Cash Earnings.\n\u2022 Crude futures were contained after recent declines and reports that OPEC-8 are mulling another production hike at the meeting on Sunday, while demand was also not helped by the surprise build in the weekly EIA headline crude stockpiles.\n\u2022 US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks w/e 2.415M vs. Exp. -2.031M (Prev. -2.392M).\n\u2022 OPEC August Oil output +360k BPD from July to 27.84mln BPD, according to the Reuters survey.\n\u2022 Russian Deputy PM Novak said OPEC-8 are not discussing production increase now and no agenda has been set for the upcoming OPEC+ meeting yet, while he added that current market conditions and forecasts are to be considered. Novak also said the OPEC+ deal shows its effectiveness and the level of implementation of OPEC+ deal is 102% in January-August.\n\u2022 Spot gold kept afloat in rangebound trade after yesterday's sideways price action and with the NFP report on the horizon.\n\u2022 Copper futures steadily gained alongside the mostly positive risk appetite in the Asia-Pac region.\n\u2022 Bitcoin gradually edged higher after returning to above the USD 111k level.\n\u2022 PBoC may inject reasonably ample liquidity into the money markets this month, according to China Securities Journal.\n\u2022 IDF spokesperson said their forces are operating within Gaza City and currently control 40% of the city's territory, according to journalist Amichai Stein.\n\u2022 White House envoy Witkoff met with Qatari officials in Paris and discussed with them efforts to reach a hostage deal that would end the war in Gaza, according to Axios' Ravid citing sources.\n\u2022 US President Trump said he will speak to Russian President Putin in the near future and they are going to get the war in Ukraine settled.\n\u2022 US is to cut some security funds for European countries bordering Russia, as Washington pushes NATO allies to pay more towards their own defence, according to FT.\n\u2022 Kremlin's Peskov said security guarantees for Ukraine cannot be provided by foreign military contingents, while the Kremlin said the level of the Russian negotiating team with Ukraine is already quite high and a huge amount of work needs to be done before there could be a meeting between Russia and Ukraine at a higher or the highest level, according to RIA.\n\u2022 South Korea, Japan and US militaries will conduct a joint aerial, naval and cyber defence exercise from September 15th.\n\u2022 North Korean leader Kim returned to North Korea following a summit with Chinese President Xi, while Kim told Xi about strengthening strategic cooperation and protecting common interests in international and regional issues. Furthermore, the leaders exchanged candid opinions on strengthening high-ranking strategic communication and Kim said that North Korea will continue to support China to protect its sovereignty, territory and development interests, according to KCNA.\n\u2022 US Secretary of State Rubio announced a new US visa restriction policy and will restrict US visas for Central American nationals who act on behalf of China.\n\u2022 US and Taiwanese defence officials held secret talks in Alaska, according to FT.\n\u2022 US Defense Department said two Venezuelan military aircraft flew near a US Navy vessel in international waters.",

      "text": "Newsquawk US Market Wrap: Stocks and bonds bid into NFP\n-\nSNAPSHOT: Equities up, Treasuries up, Crude down, Dollar up. -\nREAR VIEW: Fed's Williams leans dovish; Initial jobless claims rise above forecast; ADP misses; Challenger Layoffs accelerate; Trade deficit widens; ISM Services PMI beats; Labour costs revised down, productivity up; Miran focuses on Fed independence; DoJ opens criminal investigation into Fed's Cook; US lowers Japan auto tariffs; Mexico mulls tariffs on China; Soft Swiss CPI; Russia says OPEC have not spoken about production hike; China firms still keen on NVDA chips. -\nCOMING UP: Data: German Industrial Orders (Jul), French Trade Balance, EZ Employment (Final), GDP Revised (Q2), UK Retail Sales (Aug), EZ GDP Revised (Q2), US Jobs Report (Aug), Canadian Jobs Report (Aug) Speakers: Fed\u2019s Goolsbee Supply: Japan, Australia\nMARKET WRAP\nStocks closed green on Thursday with outperformance in the Russell while T-Notes firmed across the curve with the Dollar posting marginal gains. The focus on Thursday was largely on data and Fed speak ahead of NFP on Friday. On data, Challenger Layoffs accelerated while the ADP National Employment print fell below analyst expectations. Initial Jobless Claims also continued to rise above analyst forecasts, although Continued Claims declined to 1.94mln, beneath forecasts. Unit Labour Cost revisions for Q2 were revised down, below forecasts, while productivity was revised up, above the consensus. Trade data saw a widening deficit, while the ISM Services PMI report beat forecasts, with prices paid and employment little changed, but business activity and new orders accelerated. Fed speak saw Williams lean dovish, noting he sees reduced upside risk to inflation from tariffs, and that balancing has moved a bit more towards the Fed's job mandate. However, he declined to comment when asked if market pricing for the September meeting is correct. T-Notes were bid throughout the session following the miss in ADP, and rising jobless claims added to labour market concerns. The Dollar outperformed while antipodes lagged as all eyes turn to NFP, ahead of CPI, PPI and the BLS Benchmark revisions next week. Crude prices were hit with pressure seen ahead of the OPEC-8 meeting this weekend, with expectations for them now to implement another production hike, although Russia Deputy PM Novak suggested they have not spoken about this yet. On trade, Japan and the US are in the final stage of talks to implement lower tariffs on Japanese auto imports, while Mexican President Sheinbaum said Mexico is mulling tariffs on imports from other countries, including China. Miran's board hearing largely focused on Fed independence, while WSJ reported that the DoJ has opened a criminal investigation into Fed Governor Cook.\nUS\nFED'S WILLIAMS: The NY Fed President largely reiterated recent remarks, noting he expects gradual rate cuts over time if the economy meets his forecasts. He said the Fed must balance its inflation and job market risks right now, noting monetary policy is modestly restrictive and appropriate for the current economy. On the economy, Williams said trade and immigration factors are slowing activity, noting GDP will grow 1.25-1.50% this year (vs Fed median projection of 1.4%). He also sees the jobless rate reaching 4.5% next year (in line with the Fed's median view for 2025 and 2026). He expects PCE between 3.00-3.25% this year (vs Fed median of 3.00%), and 2.5% in 2026 (vs Fed median of 2.4%). He does expect inflation back at target in 2027. On tariffs, Williams said tariffs are likely to add 1.00-1.50% to inflation this year, but fortunately, he is not seeing signs of amplification or second-round effects from tariffs on broader inflation trends. On the labour market, he said it is cooling to pre-pandemic levels, but it is currently in balance. He also noted that balancing has moved a bit more towards the Fed's job mandate. On the bond market, he said it is relatively calm; he does not see abnormal moves. On prices, he noted the overall trend in services inflation has been favourable, while core goods inflation has shifted higher on tariffs. However, he sees reduced upside risk to inflation from tariffs, and it is good to see tariffs are not driving persistent inflation so far. However, it may take longer to gauge the full impact of tariffs on inflation data.\nISM SERVICES PMI: ISM Services PMI rose to 52.0 from 50.1, and above the expected 51.0. Within the release, Business Activity and New Orders encouragingly rose to 55.0 (exp. 53.0, prev. 52.6) and 56.0 (prev. 50.3), respectively. Employment was little changed at 46.5 from 46.4, but still firmly remained in contractionary territory, while prices paid declined to 69.2 from 69.9. In the respondents' answers, unsurprisingly, tariffs dominated the tape, with one noting, \"We are starting to see the impact of tariffs on the cost of imported goods. For our company, this is primarily for goods from Asia and South America. We expect to see the full effect of tariffs in our cost of goods sold by October.\u201d Pantheon Macroeconomics adds that, for now, they retain their view that weak wage growth and downward pressure on margins from subdued demand will mean core services inflation remains contained. But the risks to that view probably lie to the upside.\nJOBLESS CLAIMS: Initial jobless claims (w/e 30th Aug) rose to 237k from 229k, above the expected 230k, meaning the 4wk average ticked higher to 231k from 228.5k. Continued claims (w/e 23rd Aug) fell to 1.94mln from 1.944mln, light of the forecasted 1.962mln. Regarding the contributors to the NSA data, the largest were Connecticut 2,949, Tennessee 2,906, and New York 1,804, while Kentucky had the biggest decline of -2,889. On the data, Oxford Economics noted \u201cNew claims by federal workers have declined after an initial pop following a Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump admin to proceed with layoffs. It appears that more workers than previously thought will be leaving the federal workforce through deferred resignations, and those workers won't show up in the claims data.\u201d\nUS INTERNATIONAL TRADE: The US International Trade balance saw the deficit widen to 78.38bln from the prior 59.1bln, wider than the expected deficit of 75.7bln. Exports rose USD 0.8bln to USD 280.5bln, while imports rose USD 20bln to USD 358.8bln. The July increase in the goods and services deficit reflected an increase in the goods deficit of USD 18.2bln to USD 103.9bln and a decrease in the services surplus of USD 1.1bln to USD 25.6bln. Regarding China, the deficit increased to 17.11bln in July from 9.51bln in June, with exports little changed, but imports rising to 26.4bln from 18.9bln. Meanwhile, the EU deficit widened to 19.1bln from 8.1bln, with exports falling to 46.7bln from 49.8bln. Imports rose to USD 65.9bln from 57.9bln. On the data, Oxford Economics highlight that while imports bounced back, over half the increase was due to gold as \"trade policy and safe-haven demand brought about a resurgence in trade\". Within the import data, industrial supplies and materials rose USD 12.5bln, with capital goods rising by USD 4.7bln. However, Gold made up USD 9.6bln of imports. Oxford Economics highlight that excluding gold, imports rose 3.3%, while exports fell 0.1%. On the capital goods imports, Oxford Economics write that goods linked to AI and data centres are still a source of resilience for imports. Overall, OxEco says, \"It's early in the quarter, but the risk is that trade does not provide as large of a boost to Q3 GDP if imports remain resilient.\" Note, imports are a subtraction in the GDP equation.\nCHALLENGER LAYOFFS: Challenger layoffs came in at 85.979k in August, rising from 62.075k seen in July, with August\u2019s total the highest for the month since 2020. Within the release, it notes employers announced plans to add 1,494 jobs in August, the lowest total for the month since Challenger began tracking hiring plans in 2009. Challenger adds, \u201cSeptember is typically when we begin to see large seasonal hiring announcements, which foretell how Retailers expect the holiday season to go. Coming off the lowest August on record for hiring plans, it may be a troubling sign\u201d.\nADP NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT: ADP national employment for August saw 54k private-payrolls jobs added, shy of the expected 65k and the prior, marginally revised higher, 106k. In terms of median change in annual pay, job-stayers were unchanged at 4.4%, while job-changers ticked higher to 7.1% from 7.0%. ADP chief economist said, \u201cThe year started with strong job growth, but that momentum has been whipsawed by uncertainty\u201d, and \u201ca variety of things could explain the hiring slowdown, including labor shortages, skittish consumers, and AI disruptions.\u201d\nUNIT LABOUR COST REVISIONS (Q2 25): Unit labour costs in the nonfarm business sector rose 1.0%, less than the expected 1.2% (prev. 1.6%), corresponding with a 4.3% increase in hourly compensation (prev. 4.0%) and a 3.3% jump in productivity (exp. 2.7%, prev. 2.4%). Output jumped 4.4% (prev. 3.7%) with hours worked rising 1.1% (prev. 1.3%). Oxford Economics notes the upward revision to productivity growth is overstated, given the 1.8% decline in Q1, and the trend in trend in unit labour costs is consistent with a moderate pace of services inflation.\nFIXED INCOME\nTREASURY FUTURES (Z5) SETTLED 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 112-27\nT-Notes catch bid on dovish Williams and mixed data ahead of NFP. At settlement, 2-year -2.4bps at 3.588%, 3-year -3.1bps at 3.547%, 5-year -3.8bps at 3.647%, 7-year -4.4bps at 3.870%, 10-year -4.4bps at 4.167%, 20-year -3.3bps at 4.810%, 30-year -3.0bps at 4.862%.\nINFLATION BREAKEVENS: 1-year BEI -4.9bps at 3.219%, 3-year BEI -2.8bps at 2.757%, 5-year BEI -2.3bps at 2.474%, 10-year BEI -1.7bps at 2.372%, 30-year BEI -1.4bps at 2.272%.\nTHE DAY: T-Notes were bid throughout the session with gains led by the belly following a slew of economic data and Fed speak ahead of NFP. On data, Challenger Layoffs accelerated while the ADP National Employment print fell below analyst expectations - adding to the labour market slowdown fears ahead of NFP on Friday. Initial Jobless Claims also continued to rise above analyst forecasts, although Continued Claims declined to 1.94mln, beneath forecasts. Unit Labour Cost revisions for Q2 were revised down, below forecasts, while productivity was revised up, above the consensus. Trade data saw a widening deficit, while the ISM Services PMI report beat forecasts, with prices paid and employment little changed, but business activity and new orders accelerated. The weak ADP data saw Treasuries rise into the 13:30/08:30 data, where two-way price action was seen, before selling off marginally after the PMI report.\nThereafter, focus turned to Fed speak, namely, NY Fed President Williams, who reiterated he expects gradual interest rate cuts over time, but noted that balancing has moved a bit more towards the Fed's job mandate. He also said he sees reduced upside risk to inflation from tariffs. However, he did not comment when asked if market pricing for the September rate cut view is correct, perhaps as he is waiting for the NFP report on Friday. Meanwhile, Fed Governor Nominee Miran spoke at the hearing, stressing the importance of Fed independence. He also implied he would stay on as CEA Chair to ensure a smooth switchback when his term as Fed Governor expires in January. Regarding Fed Governor Cook, WSJ reported that the DoJ has opened a criminal investigation into Cook and issued subpoenas as part of an inquiry into mortgage fraud. All eyes turn to the NFP on Friday before the Fed blackout period commences from Saturday. Next week, the focus is on PPI and CPI data, as well as the BLS benchmark revisions.

Prices found a floor in the European morning; however, modest upticks were seen after Russian Deputy PM Novak said the OPEC-8 are not discussing a production increase now. As a reminder, the OPEC-8 announced a c. 547k BPD production increase for September, following the 411k BPD hike for August, with the upcoming meeting set to discuss production levels for October. Note, regarding August production, Reuters found that output from OPEC overall increased by 360k BPD, while Bloomberg reported a 400k BPD increase. In the weekly EIA data, which was delayed a day due to Labor Day, crude stocks saw a surprise build, in fitting with the private metrics. Distillates saw an unexpected build, and Gasoline saw a larger-than-anticipated draw, both following the API figures seen on Tuesday. Crude production fell 16k W/W to 13.423mln. WTI and Brent saw earlier lows of USD 62.72/bbl and 66.35/bbl, respectively, against later highs of 63.84/bbl and 67.41/bbl. All traders await the pivotal US jobs report on Friday ahead of the aforementioned OPEC+ meeting on Sunday.\nEQUITIES\n-\nCLOSES: SPX +0.83% at 6,502, NDX +0.93% at 23,633, DJI +0.77% at 45,621, RUT +1.26% at 2,380. -\nSECTORS: Consumer Discretionary +2.25%, Communication Services +1.12%, Industrials +1.09%, Financials +1.00%, Real Estate +0.64%, Energy +0.60%, Technology +0.55%, Health +0.36%, Materials +0.23%, Consumer Staples +0.09%, Utilities -0.16% -\nEUROPEAN CLOSES: Euro Stoxx 50 +0.37% at 5,345, Dax 40 +0.81% at 23,787, FTSE 100 +0.42% at 9,217, CAC 40 -0.27% at 7,699, FTSE MIB +0.49% at 41,990, IBEX 35 +0.87% at 14,918, PSI +1.32% at 7,749, SMI +1.54% at 12,388, AEX +1.34% at 900.\nSTOCK SPECIFICS:\n-\nNvidia (NVDA): Chinese firms still keen on NVDA chips -\nSalesforce (CRM): Q2 nos. topped but guidance was soft & analysts said it points to muted growth -\nBYD (BYDDY): Cut 2025 sales target by 16% to 4.6mln vehicles -\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters (AEO): EPS & rev. topped as Sydney Sweeney ads seen driving sales -\nT.Rowe Price Group (TROW): GS to buy $1bln of TROW stock in private-funds deal -\nSAIC (SAIC): Top line missed & cut FY rev. outlook -\nC3.ai (AI): Reported an adj. loss that was wider than expected.

On the data footing, ADP national employment showed private payrolls added fewer jobs than expected, which comes ahead of the pivotal jobs report tomorrow, which will shape expectations for the Fed at the upcoming meeting. Reminder, the ADP does not have the closest correlation to the US jobs report. US international trade showed a deeper deficit than expected, while initial jobless claims topped expectations and even printed outside the top end of the forecast range. Lastly, ISM Services PMI saw the headline and business activity impress, while prices paid encouragingly declined. Elsewhere, Fed\u2019s Williams reiterated he expects gradual interest rate cuts over time if the economy meets his forecasts, and in later remarks, declined to comment on whether the market's Sept. rate cut view is correct.\nG10 FX was lower across the board against the Dollar, albeit to varying degrees, with GBP and EUR the relative \u2018outperformers\u2019 and Antipodeans the laggards. AUD/USD and NZD/USD saw lows of 0.6502 and 0.5834, respectively, but little follow-through was seen from the larger-than-expected Australian goods balance overnight.\nJPY was choppy on Thursday, with USD/JPY trading between 147.82-148.77, as the Yen noticed some modest strength after Reuters cited Japanese sources, saying Japan and the US are in the final stage of talks to implement lower tariffs on Japanese auto imports; reductions could take effect within 10-14 days after a US presidential executive order. Before this, Japanese trade negotiator Akazawa stated that he will visit the US as administrative issues have been resolved, and he will continue to push for a presidential order for what has been agreed on tariffs.\nAs mentioned, the Euro and Pound outperformed, with the fiscal picture remaining front and centre for the latter. For the single-currency, markets await EZ Q3 and Q4 data prints await as the impact of the US administration's trade policies are felt across the Eurozone. Meanwhile, the ECB\u2019s confab next week is widely anticipated to leave rates unchanged. French political tensions also remain a part of the narrative ahead of next Monday's confidence vote in PM Bayrou. A softer-than-expected outturn for EZ retail had little sway on price action.\nCHF was weighed on by Swiss CPI unexpectedly declining M/M in August, which resulted in immediate Swissy weakness due to the softer print. Similarly, the SEK saw some pressure on CPIF data, as the metrics increased the odds of the Riksbank cutting as soon as the September meeting.\nEMFX was mixed. On the trade front, Mexican President Sheinbaum stated Mexico is considering tariffs on imports from countries that do not have trade agreements, including China. Re. rate decisions, Goldman Sachs sees CBRT cutting key rate by 200bps in next week's meeting, vs. its prior view of 350bps cut. Meanwhile, NBP\u2019s Glapinski spoke heavily and noted inflation risk in the quarters ahead, and would like to cut further, as long as forecasts point to CPI moderating.\n04 Sep 2025 - 21:40- EquitiesResearch Sheet- Source: Newsquawk\nSubscribe Now to Newsquawk\nClick here for a 1 week free trial\nNewsquawk provides audio news and commentary for over 15,000professional traders and brokers worldwide.
