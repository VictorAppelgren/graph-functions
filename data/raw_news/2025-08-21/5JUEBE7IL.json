      "text": "In this article, we will be looking at the 11 Best Dividend Stocks with a Consistent 3-Year Payout History.\nInflation is showing signs of a cooldown as political changes are impacting the economy. The consumer price index in July went up by 2.7% year-over-year. Slightly below the Wall Street forecasts, the value fuels market optimism for a September rate cut, according to CNBC. Lower rates often increase the attractiveness of equities with consistent dividend payouts, since their yields are perceived as better than declining bond returns.\nThe U.S. President\u2019s tariff agenda is heavily influencing the policy stage. A lasting inflation was expected following the tariff announcements. However, the top Federal Reserve contenders, Stephen Miran and James Bullard, argued that the possibility of such inflation is low. Their claims stand parallel to Trump\u2019s pro-growth stance and solidify the case for a possibly steeper rate cut soon. Bullard suggested that the Fed could trim a full percentage point over the next year.\nHowever, uncertainty is looming, and the dividend stocks with hedge fund accumulations point to a safe haven for investors seeking stable incomes. Accordingly, we have put together a list of 11 best dividend stocks with a consistent 3-year payout history that the hedge funds are betting on. Stay with us as we count them down from 11 to 1. The top 5 might just make it into your portfolio.\nOur Methodology\nWe have followed a few criteria when compiling our list of 11 best dividend stocks with a consistent 3-year payout history. Primarily, we included only those stocks with a dividend yield of 3% or more and a 3-year positive dividend growth to ensure optimal and stable income. For ranking the stocks, we have used the number of hedge funds as of the first quarter of 2025. We gathered this data from the Insider Monkey database. All the data used in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of August 13, 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n11. HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. (NYSE:HASI)\nDividend Yield: 6.41%\nNo. of Hedge Funds: 18\nDividend History: 12 years\nHA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. (NYSE:HASI) holds a spot among our list of 11 best dividend stocks with a consistent 3-year payout history.

With 18 hedge funds holding stakes in the company, the stock benefits from institutional confidence in its long-term cash flow potential.\n10. ONE Gas, Inc. (NYSE:OGS)\nDividend Yield: 3.53%\nNo. of Hedge Funds: 23\nDividend History: 11 years\nONE Gas, Inc. (NYSE:OGS) makes it into our list of 11 best dividend stocks with a consistent 3-year payout history.

Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR)\nDividend Yield: 4.92%\nNo. of Hedge Funds: 28\nDividend History: 16 years\nPortland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) ranks among our list of 11 best dividend stocks with a consistent 3-year payout history. Top executives make bold sales amid an application for holding company reorganization and positive second-quarter results.\nPortland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) is a Fortune 1000 public utility engaged in the business of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity across western parts of the state. The Oregon-based company covers close to two-thirds of the state\u2019s commercial and industrial activity. Including hydropower, wind, solar, and battery storage, the company has the capacity to generate over 3,300 MW.\nIn July, the company applied for a holding company reorganization to the Oregon Public Utilities Commission (OPUC). Also, it has requested a $72 million revenue increase effective April 1, 2026, for its distribution system and a $46 million increase effective October 31 for the Seaside Battery Energy Storage System.\nDuring the month, it has also released its Q2 earnings reports, where it reported a revenue of $807 million that exceeded the analysts\u2019 forecasts of $797.97 million. The company also noted a 16.5% increase in industrial load demand, specifically from data centers, signaling a high growth in this sector.\nHowever, in the initial weeks of August, the top executives of the company, including the VP and CIO John Teeruk Kochavatr, the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Joseph R JR Trpik, and VP John Carter McFarland, sold more than a total of 10,000 of the company\u2019s shares.\nPortland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) offers a notable 4.92% dividend yield that elevates its income appeal, while the ownership from 28 hedge funds suggests optimism in the company\u2019s shareholder value creation."

      "text": "In this article, we will be looking at the 11 best short-term stocks to invest in.\nThe latter half of the 2025 market is caught between conflicting signals. July\u2019s controversial jobs report indicated the nonfarm payrolls rising by just 73,000, with three-month average job gains now less than a third of last year\u2019s pace, pointing to a economic slowdown in the U.S. According to CNBC, this has prompted Goldman Sachs to reduce the growth forecast to just 1% for the remainder of 2025 citing weaker job growth and reduced consumer spending in the face of tariff-related inflation.\nOn the other hand, despite these warnings, the market remains resilient and continues to thrive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by just 1.7% over the past month. And with President Trump\u2019s announcement on the matter, optimism is brimming around possible Fed rate cuts and a breakthrough in U.S.-EU trade talks. Inflation concerns have been toned down, leading the traders to assign a nearly 90% probability of a rate cut in September. The improved sentiment has created short-term opportunities for investors to capitalize on.\nShort-term opportunities often emerge in uncertain macro environments, and right now, the mix of market resilience and shifting Fed expectations is building such a setup. With that in mind, let\u2019s look into our picks for the 11 best short-term stocks to consider. The top 5 might surprise you.\nOur Methodology\nWhen putting together our list of 11 best short-term stocks to invest in, we followed a few criteria. Primarily, we considered small caps and above for making this list. All the stocks on our list have a 1-year negative performance and a positive performance this week, which are used for recognizing their short-term return-generating potential. For ranking the stocks, we have used their 1-year negative performances. All the data used in the article was taken from financial databases and analyst reports, with all information updated as of August 7, 2025.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR)\nPerformance 1 Year: -2.32%\nEnergizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR) ranks among our list of 11 best short-term stocks to invest in. The company sees mixed analysts\u2019 opinions amid the company\u2019s release of the Q3 earnings report for 2025.\nMissouri-based company, Energizer Holdings, Inc.

With a comprehensive portfolio that includes brands like Energizer, Eveready, Rayovac, and Varta, the company markets automotive and personal care products to retailers, distributors, and direct consumers across various channels in over 165 countries.\nIn its 2025 third-quarter earnings report, released on August 4, 2025, the company announced that it exceeded its outlook across net sales, adjusted gross margin, and adjusted EPS. Particularly, the recent acquisition of Advanced Power Solutions NV (APS NV) contributed $20.8 million to Net Sales. In addition to this, Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR)\u2019s \u201cProject Momentum\u201d delivered approximately $12 million in savings during the quarter, indicating successful internal operational efficiency initiatives.\nAcknowledging the growth, analysts, including Truist and UBS, raised their price target on the stock. Truist raised the price target from $30 to $35 while UBS raised it from $23 to $29. On the other hand, Canaccord Genuity maintains a Hold rating on Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ENR), signaling mixed opinions on the stock.\nThe company gained 27.23% this week, sharply reversing its modest annual decline of 2.32%, increasing its appeal to investors seeking short-term investments in the consumer staples sector.\n10. Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER)\nPerformance 1 Year: -12.17%\nTeradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) earns a rank in our list of 11 best short-term stocks to invest in. The company experienced an upward movement in stock price following better performance in the Semiconductor Test segment and the launch of Magnum 7H.\nHeadquartered in Massachusetts, Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) designs, manufactures, and sells automated test equipment for semiconductors and electronics. The company also focuses on robotics solutions, including collaborative and mobile robots through subsidiaries like Universal Robots and Mobile Industrial Robots.\nOn July 29, 2025, Teradyne, Inc.

      "text": "In this article, we will be looking at the 11 best short squeeze stocks to buy now.\nThe latest U.S. tariff wave has created a suitable environment where short squeeze investments will thrive. On August 7, 2025, President Donald Trump\u2019s reciprocal duties came into effect, slapping steep rates on dozens of trading partners. According to CNBC, Syria faces a 41% tariff, Laos and Myanmar at 40%, and Switzerland at 39% after a failed last-minute deal. Brazil and India feel the tightest squeeze as they face 50% duties, effective by the end of this month. Even the U.S. allies were not spared, as 15% tariffs were imposed on the EU, Japan, and South Korea\nIn addition to disrupting the supply chains, the ripples from these trade shocks could potentially impact the investors\u2019 decisions. Stocks under the industries heavily exposed to tariffs often attract significant short interest since traders bet on earnings pressure and valuation declines.

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.
