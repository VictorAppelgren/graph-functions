      "feedback": "The draft conflates dxy and S&P 500 drivers, diluting causal clarity. Tighten focus to dxy only, removing any S&P 500 references. Replace the generic “Fed rate cut compresses 10‑yr yield” line with a precise transmission chain: Fed cut → 10‑yr yield drop → lower equity discount rate → higher equity valuations → risk‑on sentiment → +0.5‑1 % dxy (Z7O1DCHS7). Consolidate the two “up” lines into one probability‑weighted line (e.g., Up | Sep 12‑17 | Fed cut + sticky CPI → +0.5‑1 % dxy (Z7O1DCHS7) | Fed minutes, CPI, tariff policy | 55%). Merge the two “down” lines into a single probability‑weighted line (Down | Sep 12‑15 | Lower CPI or Cook lawsuit resolution → −0.5‑1 % dxy (Z7O1DCHS7) | CPI release, Cook status | 35%). Eliminate the “1‑2 wks” line that lacks a clear catalyst and violates the 4‑line rule. Ensure each line contains only one driver, one watch‑list, and one probability. Finally, add a Swing Trade line for dxy: “Up | Sep 12‑17 | Fed cut + sticky CPI → +0.5‑1 % dxy (Z7O1DCHS7) | Entry 102.0, Stop 101.0, Target 103.5, R/R 2:1, Invalidation: Fed keeps rates, CPI < 2.5% | 55% | 80.” This keeps the analysis concise, evidence‑driven, and fully aligned with the asset and catalyst requirements.",
