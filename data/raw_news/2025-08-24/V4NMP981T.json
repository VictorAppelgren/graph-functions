  "description": "Mark Gurman says Apple's latest addition to its smart home lineup might be closer than you think.",
  "content": "What\u2019s happened? In today\u2019s Power On newsletter, Apple expert Mark Gurman suggested Apple might release a new HomePod mini as early as this fall, and the long-awaited HomePod with a screen could arrive next year.\n\u2022 If correct, this prediction will put the HomePod and Apple\u2019s smart home system in direct competition with a newly-upgraded Alexa and Gemini for Home.\n\u2022 The platform will come with a dedicated home-focused operating system called Charismatic.\n\u2022 This will be the first screen-focused HomeKit device.\n\nWhy this is important: The HomePod was originally expected in the first quarter of 2025, but analysts began predicting a delay even before the new year rolled around. That delay was expected to reach into the third quarter of 2025, but most predictions lacked any real background information.\n\u2022 Gurman\u2019s suggestion is the strongest source that has appeared so far.\n\u2022 He also indicates that an improved Siri is still a long way off, and that Apple is speaking with Google for a way to use Gemini with Siri.\n\u2022 As the core of the HomeKit system, Siri likely won\u2019t be able to compete with Alexa+ and Gemini for Home.\n\nWhy should I care? Apple has always lagged behind Google and Amazon in the smart home market, and the arrival of the HomePod with a screen isn\u2019t an exception. However, it might not matter; if you\u2019re an Apple fan, this could be the perfect option for filling the gap in the market.\n\u2022 A new HomePod with screen could potentially be the centerpiece for an Apple-focused smart home setup, granting all the benefits that other platforms enjoy.\n\u2022 The device itself is likely to be attractive on its own if it follows Apple\u2019s design policies.",

      "text": "Rumors about an Apple HomePod with a screen have been swirling for years now, with Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posting on X about a potential HomePod with a seven-inch touchscreen coming sometime in 2024. While that quite obviously didn\u2019t come to pass, the rumors of a smart display HomePod have never disappeared, and in the past few months have resurfaced, with Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman posting about the potential last November and then again this January, saying it could be \u201cApple\u2019s most significant release of the year.\u201d Add to it, on March 20, a team at Macworld discovered some changes in the iOS 18.4 beta that could point to a new display-laden HomePod, and Ming-Chi Kuo posted on X two days later their certainty of a HomePod with a screen entering production in Q3 of 2025, soon after WWDC 2025 begins on June 9.\nThere\u2019s a lot we expect to hear about at WWDC, including information on iOS19, the new macOS16, watchOS 12, iPadOS 19, and tvOS 19. With all signs pointing towards the announcement of the Apple HomePod with a Screen, here\u2019s everything we know so far.\nHomePod with a screen release date and price rumors\nBased on the information from Ming-Chi Kuo, it\u2019s expected that the HomePod with a screen will enter into production sometime after WWDC in June, which would put it on track to be released this fall. While HomePod releases have often been during the beginning months of a calendar year, an end-of-year release would follow the release timing of the HomePod Mini, which came out in November of 2020.\nWe\u2019re unsure what the new HomePod might cost, but judging from the current HomePod pricing of $299, the screen version will likely be more than that \u2014 perhaps in the $400-500 range. This would put it at a step higher than any of its smarthome hub competitors. The Google Nest Hub Max currently priced at $229, and even the largest of the Echo Show line \u2014 the Echo Show 21 \u2014 is at the lower end of that range at $400. And that\u2019s with a 21-inch display, which is far larger than what\u2019s expected on the HomePod.\nWhat the rumors say about the HomePod with a screen\nBoth Ming-Chi Kuo and Mark Gurman have indicated that the new HomePod will include the A18 chip, have a 7-inch screen, and incorporate Apple Intelligence. The Apple Intelligence integration has apparently been what held back its release.\nThere\u2019s practically nothing known about the potential physical design of the HomePod with a screen, apart from a now-deleted supposed leaked image. Speculation ranges from the screen found on the top of the current HomePod just getting a size increase, to something similar to the Nest Hub Max, with a front-facing screen.\nWhat we can be certain of, is that if we do see a HomePod with a screen, it will be touch-enabled."

      "text": "What\u2019s happened? Google has announced Gemini for Home, a way to integrate all the power of Gemini AI with your smart home setup. The company says the move makes it \u201cboth more powerful and easier to use than Google Assistant.\u201d\n- Trigger words remain the same; you\u2019ll still say, \u201cHey Google\u201d to get started.\n- Users will be able to make more natural, fluid requests instead of sticking with rigid phrase structures.\n- The Gemini Live functionality will let you have a back-and-forth talk with Gemini right from your Google smart home devices.\nWhy this is important: Amazon recently launched Alexa+, a service that brings similar functionality to the Alexa platform. Gemini for Home could match and potentially exceed Alexa+ in terms fo capabilities.\n- Gemini for Home lets users issue multiple commands at once instead of one at a time.\n- It also simplifies day-to-day tasks, with one example being \u201cadd the ingredients to make an authentic Italian lasagna to my shopping list.\u201d\n- Gemini For Home makes media discovery easier and allows users to request vague content, such as saying \u201cplay the song of the year winner from 1990.\u201d\nWhy should I care? The addition of true AI capabilities to the smart home assistant can take a home from just smart to bloody brilliant. Gemini for Home (and also Alexa+) represents another step toward the kind of intuitive smart home experience companies have strived for since the beginning.\n- Gemini can make even complex tasks, like telling a bedtime story, significantly easier.\n- You can ask for help troubleshooting common household problems.\n- Gemini for Home means your smart assistant can be an actual assistant, rather than a go-between for issuing commands to smart devices."

      "text": "For years, I\u2019ve dreamed of a true smart home system \u2014 one that adapts to how I use it and takes independent actions before I have to ask. When Alexa+ was first announced, I hoped it would be the step forward I\u2019ve been waiting for, and while it\u2019s certainly an improvement, I believe there\u2019s still a lot of room for growth.\nConversationally, Alexa has never been on par with Google Assistant. Alexa requires users to use the trigger phrase for each command, while Google Assistant would listen for a few seconds after completing a task for further instructions. That made Google more natural to converse with. On the other hand, Alexa felt like a better option for smart home use, even if vocal commands were more stilted.\nAlexa+ has definitely taken its conversational skills up a notch, but while the upgrade is a huge step forward, it still hasn\u2019t reached its full potential. For now, Alexa+ is only available in early access, and like any kind of beta, it still has a few bugs to work out. Reception overall has been mixed. Some users love the changes, but others think the upgrades are moving in the wrong direction.\nI can see both sides of the argument. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new, and what I think Alexa+ still needs to work on.\nConversation feels a lot less robotic\nWhen you ask the base version of Alexa a question, she\u2019ll answer. And sometimes that answer feels like it can go on forever. While the original model has a tendency to drone on (and tack extraneous information on the end of an answer), Alexa+ is better at handling interruptions.\nAlexa+ seems like she wants to have a conversation with you, and the assistant will remember details you tell it. That said, I can only assume anything I say to Alexa is being beamed straight to Amazon headquarters. While it\u2019s doubtful there\u2019s any information about me that corporations don\u2019t know \u2014 a hazard of being an AI- and smart home-enthusiast \u2014 I am still uneasy about sharing too much.\nThe service isn\u2019t cheap\nAlexa+ is absolutely another way to pull users into the Prime ecosystem. The upgrade is currently priced at $19.99 per month for non-Prime users, while Prime subscribers get it for free. And once you\u2019re a Prime subscriber, why wouldn\u2019t you take advantage of the free shipping, Prime Video, and other offers?\nSome users have expressed concerns that Alexa+ might one day have a free, ad-supported tier. While that\u2019s a common way to cover costs for companies, most users don\u2019t want to broadcast advertisements into their home. In a recent investor call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy suggested that some Alexa+ product recommendations could be sponsored, rather than genuine suggestions.\nAlexa+ is actually a decent artist, but other skills miss the mark\nOne of the upgrades Alexa received is the ability to generate content. More specifically, you can ask it to draw or paint a picture based on voice input. It\u2019s a fun way to pass a few minutes here and there, and it\u2019s something kids will appreciate. I don\u2019t see any real use for the feature outside of entertainment, however.\nAmazon wants Alexa+ to be more of an AI agent than an assistant, with the ability to perform complex tasks with a simple command. One of the commonly promoted features is making a reservation, but there\u2019s a caveat: Alexa+ can only do that if the restaurant in question works with OpenTable. That\u2019s currently the only partner Amazon has, although more are expected to join in the future.\nSmart home controls have received a major improvement, though. It\u2019s easy to set up routines now through voice commands alone, versus fighting through the often-obtuse Alexa app. For instance, I could say, \u201cAlexa, each day at 7 AM, turn on my office light and turn on the plug for the kettle.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good start, but the journey ahead is long\nAlexa+ brings in some serious upgrades that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated, but if you only make a judgement based on the published documentation, you\u2019ll be disappointed. Amazon\u2019s blog posts about Alexa+ make it seem like an AI tool that takes all the best parts of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and others and rolls them into one, and it definitely isn\u2019t that.\nIt\u2019s by far the smartest home assistant available, and as it continues to develop and sand down its rough edges, I can see it becoming nearly indispensable. The ability to add documents is truly awesome, as it means you can share a schedule or document that Alexa can pull knowledge from.\nHowever, Google just announced Gemini for Home, a service that will integrate Gemini into the existing Google Home setup and replace the aging Google Assistant. Part of what makes Alexa+ so powerful is its use of LLMs, but Gemini has proven its worth time and time again. With Gemini for Home stepping into the arena, the competition just became a lot more fierce.\nI\u2019m cautiously impressed by what I\u2019ve seen so far, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to pop the champagne and celebrate just yet. Alexa+ will only get better with time, and I look forward to revisiting it when all of the kinks have been ironed out."
