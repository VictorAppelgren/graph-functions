      "feedback": "Actionable feedback: tighten the piece to world-class by strictly enforcing the 4-mover/2-up-2-down structure, and anchor each line to a single, testable Ford catalyst drawn directly from the material (near-term Model E EBIT swing and tariff stabilization; medium-term EV profitability and disciplined capex; near-term policy/tariff risk; longer-term demand/cost of capital dynamics). Ground every mover in first-principles logic (base regime = EV cash flow neutral or positive per unit margins versus WACC; bear regime = EV losses persist with multiple compression; bull regime = durable EV profitability expands ROIC and multiple) and use precise thresholds in “What to watch” (e.g., Model E EBITDA trajectory and gross margin stability; EV capex pacing; tariff pass-through rate; auto-financing costs) with citations after the supporting facts (W2622L6WW, 22PL3Q360, EPJYXB7DX, GX057ADL7DX, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, FOM34PUWA, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, S15934PBQ, Q4G7EPJJ6). Base probabilities must be clearly evidence-informed; if you assign 40/28/25/7, annotate the rationale in-line (e.g., “near-term catalyst visibility high” or “bear case contingent on tariff/escalation”), rather than leaving them as numeric placeholders. Remove or clearly separate non-Ford cross-asset material (Pacaso, Range, HeartSciences, UAS) into a concise watchlist so the Movers/Outlook remain Ford-centric and signal-to-noise is preserved. Tighten the Swing Trade trigger so it’s testable (e.g., “Trigger: Model E EBIT turns positive for two consecutive quarters; Invalidation: Model E EBIT remains negative for two straight quarters or EV gross margin deteriorates below X%”), and specify entry as a concrete price or price band rather than “near current Ford price,” with explicit Stop, Target, R/R, and a defined Invalidation/Trigger rubric. Ensure the Outlook line is 1–2 lines, clearly tradable, with Direction, Horizon, Expected path/levels, Decision signals, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability %, and Confidence; keep the narrative anchored to the 9x mid-cycle base and the 8–10x band, so all numbers tie back to the sourced metrics. Finally, proofread for consistent citation placement (IDs after relevant facts), eliminate redundancies, and present the four movers in exactly the required format with crisp, non-contradictory logic.",
