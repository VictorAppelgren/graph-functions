  "title": "'South Park' roasts ICE officers and Kristi Noem in savage new episode",
  "description": "Remember when Kristi Noem shot her dog? \"South Park\" won't let you forget.",
  "content": "After tearing into President Donald Trump in its Season 27 premiere, South Park continues to take shots at Trump's administration in Season 27, episode 2.\n\nTitled \"Got A Nut,\" the episode revisits the premiere episode's controversial portrayal of Trump, once again depicting him in bed with Satan and portraying him with a micropenis. But Trump isn't the only target of this episode's satire. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers are on the chopping block, along with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, and Vice President JD Vance.\n\nThis episode's portrayal of ICE officers makes South Park's Aug. 5 social media takedown of the DHS look tame.\n\nIn the episode, South Park Elementary guidance counselor Mr. Mackey gets fired due to the government \"cutting back on unnecessary expenses\" \u2014 a reference to the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) extensive cuts across the government.\n\nHow is Mr. Mackey going to make his money? (Or, as the episode keeps saying, \"get his nut\"?) Well, thanks to the promise of a $100,000 salary and a hefty signing bonus, he joins up with ICE. South Park mocks ICE's recruitment process, with the show's version requiring no background checks or prior qualifications. The episode's Aug. 6 airdate coincided with the DHS' announcement that it would be removing age limits for new hires.\n\n\"We don't ask for experience,\" South Park's ICE recruitment video says, adding later: \"If you need a job, it's a job to have.\"\n\nDespite claiming to be proud of their jobs, all ICE officers in South Park cover their faces with masks in shame. The show is gesturing out to the waves of real-life masked ICE officers, an unsettling visual that has caused concern.\n\nSouth Park's ICE officers, Mr. Mackey included, set out to detain as many immigrants as they can, with their racial profiling taking them to a Dora the Explorer live show. (Dora winds up forced to give massages in Mar-a-Lago.) Later, they head to heaven to detain angels they don't feel belong there.\n\nThroughout the raids, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has one directive for her recruits: \"If it's brown, it goes down.\"\n\nKristi Noem goes on a puppy-killing rampage in South Park.\n\nNoem's role as DHS Secretary isn't the only way South Park lampoons her. On top of a running gag about her Botox melting her face off, South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone lean hard on Noem's own admission that she shot and killed her 14-month-old dog in a gravel pit after it showed signs of aggressive behavior.\n\n\"A few years ago, I had to put my puppy down by shooting it in the face, because sometimes doing what\u2019s important means doing what\u2019s hard,\" Noem declares in an ICE orientation video.\n\nShe then spends the rest of the episode brutally shooting puppies in the head, including a service dog at the Dora the Explorer show and Superman's own superdog, Krypto. In the episode's end tag, she even shoots her way through a pet store. If Noem keeps appearing on South Park, no dog in the show is safe.\n\nNoem isn't the only member of Trump's administration to pop up in \"Got A Nut.\" Vice President JD Vance also makes an appearance, styled after the character Tattoo from Fantasy Island.\n\nVance doesn't get as much screen time as Noem or Trump, but what little he gets sure is memorable. Trump berates him for being \"stupid\" and kicks him out of frame. Later, Vance volunteers to rub baby oil on Satan in a scene that also sees the return of South Park Trump's animated micropenis.\n\nVance had a simple social media reaction to his portrayal on South Park, writing on X, \"Well, I've finally made it.\"\n\nWhile most of \"Got A Nut\" focuses on Mr. Mackey's time with ICE, a side plot introduces the show's take on right-wing personality Charlie Kirk. Cartman gets mad at his classmate Clyde Donovan for starting a right-wing debate podcast where he spews inflammatory ideas about abortion, women, and Jews. According to Cartman, that's his shtick! So he takes it upon himself to become the true \"master debater,\" debuting a Kirk-style haircut and beginning a podcast of his own.\n\nThrough Cartman, South Park eerily recreates Kirk's aggressive debate style. He even parrots the right-wing talking point \"What is a woman?\" which is meant to delegitimize the experiences of trans women. In an episode full of cutting satire, Cartman's Kirk-isms may be among the show's most accurate.\n\nAs South Park continues its Season 27 run, the question becomes, \"Who from the Trump administration will the show spoof next?\"\n\nSouth Park is now streaming on Paramount+. New episodes air Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET on Comedy Central, and stream the next day on Paramount+.",

Do I think that's possible? Though I'd like to answer that question, I'd like to plead the fourth, 12th and 22nd Amendment,\" Oliver said. \"But even if that's the case, and Trump eventually ends up consumed by a conspiracy monster he cynically helped create and now can't control, then at least that'll be a slither of something that's frankly been in short supply in this whole Epstein story \u2014 and that is actual justice.\"\nFor more late night coverage of the growing Trump/Epstein story, check out Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and The Daily Show.\nTopics John Oliver"

      "text": "'Superman' review: Can James Gunn's reboot get DC back on track?\nThere's a lot riding on James Gunn's Superman, both as a reboot of DC's movie universe and as the world's reintroduction to the Man of Steel. It's fitting, then, that its closest analog is Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Disney's ambitious 2015 relaunch of a galaxy far, far away. Like The Force Awakens, Superman similarly leaves plot threads dangling in mid-air, but papers over its flaws by moving at a million miles an hour and centering a charismatic cast.\nOn one hand, Superman is big summer fun, with just enough laughs and action to get by. However, it also makes several lofty promises, by way of narrative and theme, that it doesn't always keep. It's a grand old time (until it isn't). But its off-kilter visual approach is surprisingly effective, shaping the contours of a detailed, politically charged comic book universe that, for better or worse, never slows down.\nMore than anything, it's a promise of something greater on the horizon. This is at once fitting for the tone of this new Superman \u2014 a folksy, optimistic Boy Scout, who is embodied by actor David Corenswet with aplomb \u2014 and a tremendous bummer for anyone hoping for this to be the next big landmark blockbuster \u00e0 la The Avengers. For most viewers, it'll likely be hard not to walk away with mixed emotions.\nWhat is Superman about?\nFew superhero films have so effectively captured the feeling of picking up a random issue of a long-running comic series and being dropped into the action in media res. It's a novel, energetic approach to establishing a shared universe, and it begins with Superman crash-landing in the snow \u2014 battered and bloody \u2014 before being assisted, at his icy fortress, by polite droids he refers to as his \"Superman robots.\" With his chaotic superdog Krypto by his side, his animatronic helpers nurse this vulnerable version of the famous hero back to health and help him back in the saddle, as he resumes his battle against the Hammer of Boravia, an armored villain floating above Metropolis.\nIt's quickly revealed that the Hammer is actually an entirely different villain in disguise \u2014 one secret identity hilariously concealing another \u2014 who answers to the genius business magnate Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), amidst his scheme to destroy the Man of Steel. With these parameters swiftly established, Superman takes a beat to introduce us to its characters and world in a delightful fashion; this is one of the only times the movie takes a breather, allowing the music and production design to do the talking, as the world is slowly but surely fleshed out from the ground up. The score is electric at times \u2014 pun intended \u2014 though it's most memorable when composers John Murphy and David Fleming aren't charged with recreating John Williams' motifs from 1978's Superman: The Movie.\nAs Corenswet's adorably awkward Clark Kent tries to figure out Luthor's plan, his cautious interactions with strong-headed Daily Planet journalist Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan), and his playfulness with meek co-worker/best friend Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) drop us right in the middle of pre-existing relationships, which go hand in hand with rapid-fire exposition. The fictitious, militarized nation of Boravia (a DC mainstay since 1939) has, with U.S. backing, been planning to invade the poor and ill-equipped country of Jarhanpur (a more recent comic addition). And Luthor appears to be somehow involved. Intentional or otherwise, this premise has unavoidable parallels to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, as Superman's role in the brouhaha \u2014 directly threatening the U.S.-allied Boravian president (Zlatko Buri\u0107) until he stands down \u2014 draws political and journalistic ire.\nSuperman is a politically charged summer blockbuster.\nLois, who acts standoffish with Clark at work but dates him in private (and knows his secret identity), challenges the Man of Steel on his tactics. This establishes a Superman who is, on one hand, politically ignorant, but on the other, so willing to do the right thing that geopolitical nuances are of no consequence to him \u2014 as long as it stops innocent people from getting hurt. However, Luthor's plot is a lot more complicated (and more charged, from a real-world standpoint) than a single ground invasion. With permission from the U.S. government, the seething billionaire scientist has created an entire pocket dimension, in which he seeks to imprison political opponents \u2014 including Superman \u2014 on the grounds that the alien hero doesn't deserve due process.\nIn an era where cruel holding facilities like Alligator Alcatraz have been dominating headlines, a story of dehumanizing and delegitimizing immigrants so they can be dropped into legal limbo with government backing is nothing if not politically urgent. It's also the one idea on which Superman entirely follows up on, with the aforementioned pocket universe becoming the venue for an emotional wallop of a scene, as well as a delightfully strange action set-piece with its own unique physics, the likes of which no superhero movie has seen.\nHowever, the more that Superman and his allies uncover Luthor's plot \u2014 involving everything from giant kaiju to child endangerment and political false flags \u2014 the less his villainous plans seem to matter thematically. This serves largely as a conduit for mile-a-minute action with some (admittedly raucous) comedy beats. The film ends up overstuffed with super-powered supporting characters, to the point that Superman's own ethical quandaries feel too easily resolved. In a subplot that sees the Man of Steel villainized in the public eye after being so beloved \u2014 thanks to a smart and surprising spin on his Kryptonian father Jor-El's usual mission to have him lead us mere mortals \u2014 Superman is set up to reckon with the two halves of his identity: the human and the alien. But this conflict ends up nominal at best, with a conclusion (or lack thereof) that gives its aliens-as-immigrants metaphor some unsavory optics.\nAt the movie's core lies a tale of internal dilemma over American identity in 2025, and the cruelty of nativism as enacted and permitted by government forces. However, actually accessing this story \u2014 rather than simply gesturing towards it \u2014 often proves too difficult for Gunn's haphazard approach. Superman moves faster than a speeding bullet, hopping between plot points practically at light speed. Its disparate parts are just about held together by accomplished, thoughtful approaches to character and action, which keep the movie speeding along.\nSuperman looks and feels like a superhero movie should.\nThe film's trailers have given several viewers pause, in particular, because of its wide-angle lenses that exaggerate movement, whipping through contorted space in disorienting ways. However, in context, this approach from Gunn and cinematographer Henry Braham ends up enormously impactful and assists in the movie's frenetic feel. Unfortunately, there are a handful of shots with wonky CGI, but they're kept to a minimum and are easy enough to ignore when things zip past the screen at lightspeed.\nThe action feels larger than life, and dazzlingly superhuman, especially when Superman's rival vigilante team, the Justice Gang, gets involved: winged warrior Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced), cocky intergalactic protector the Green Lantern/Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), and cool-as-ice tech wiz Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi), who's likely to be your kid's new favorite hero. While Hawkgirl, unfortunately, gets the short end of the stick, her compatriots arrive as fully formed pieces of a larger superhero puzzle whose surface we've only just begun to explore.\nThe human supporting characters are all functional too. Hoult ensures that deep-seated jealousy radiates off every order Luthor barks at his henchmen. Some of these even take the form of alphanumeric attack combinations yelled at his super-powered cronies, who he commands like some kind of evil chess mastermind trying to check-mate the Man of Steel. Brosnahan's Lois, though she ends up with more of a plot purpose than an emotional one, has a real presence and gusto about her. And although Gisondo's Olsen is saddled with hints of unfortunately unpleasant misogyny \u2014 it wouldn't be a James Gunn comedy without some \u2014 he has an infectious enthusiasm.\nDavid Corenswet soars as Superman.\nAt the center of it all is Corenswet, who veers between an \"aw, shucks\" folksiness and stern authority. You can trace his transformations between mild-mannered reporter and Man of Steel through his tone of voice alone, and while there's much more Superman to be found \u2014 the film doesn't spend nearly enough time on the Clark half of his life \u2014 it leaves you wanting more of him. That's both a strength and a major flaw: The characters are well-rounded, but the movie eventually loses all sense of emotional arc in its final act. Even Superman's established ethos, of befriending everyday people (including immigrants) and of searching for the kindest, most humane ways to deal with major threats, ends up tossed out the window in favor of verbose speeches and third-act theatrics with world-ending stakes.\nIn Superman, Gunn has created what may be the single most Silver Age comic book saga ever put to screen. It\u2019s a goofy live-action cartoon in which the effects of Kryptonite are akin to a shellfish allergy, and in which bad guys get punched so hard their teeth bounce off the camera. Yet its story retains a deeply human core, framing Superman as not just a dog lover, but a man with the earnestness of a golden retriever.\nHowever, the movie\u2019s breakneck pace renders those human elements secondary once it's all said and done. It has vital, meaningful themes surrounding what Superman's allegiance to truth, justice, and \"the American way\" truly means in 2025, with a brash penchant for the political in a manner that most Hollywood blockbusters tend not to touch. But in the end, it rushes past these tenets of its story, in service of big-idea fireworks that make its creative ambitions feel a little too small.\nSuperman premieres in theaters July 11.\nSiddhant Adlakha is a film critic and entertainment journalist originally from Mumbai.

RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20.

These numbers come from Nielsen, which defines the total number of viewers by global watch time divided by run time over the course of the first three days the episode was out, from July 24 to July 26.\nThe episode also earned South Park its biggest linear season premiere share since 1999 and was up 68 percent from from its Season 26 premiere. In addition, the episode brought in South Park's best season premiere rating since 2022.\nThe premiere went viral on social media as well, with Paramount claiming it's the \"#1 most social episode ever for South Park.\" #SouthPark trended on X for over 12 hours (five of which were spent in the top spot), and at the time of writing this, the Trump deepfake PSA has raked in 4.4 million views on YouTube.\nFollowing the premiere, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers bashed South Park in a statement sent to Variety, Rolling Stone, and The Hollywood Reporter among other outlets.\n\"This show hasn\u2019t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention,\" Rogers said in the statement. \"President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country\u2019s history \u2013 and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump\u2019s hot streak.\"\nFor a \"fourth-rate show,\" though, it's clear people are watching.\nTopics Donald Trump Streaming\nBelen Edwards is an Entertainment Reporter at Mashable.

      "text": "In American life, a growing and forbidding visual rises: The law-enforcement officer in a mask\nFederal immigration agents seeking to detain a Honduran landscaper chased him into a Southern California surgical center and quickly found themselves in a tense standoff as clinic staff demanded to see identification and a warrant. He was eventually arrested.\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In a matter of months, it has become a regular sight around the country \u2014 immigration enforcement agents detaining people and taking them into custody, often as public anger and outcry unfold around them. But in the process, something has disappeared: the agents\u2019 faces, covered by caps, sunglasses, pulled-up neck gaiters or balaclavas, effectively rendering them unidentifiable.\nWith the year only half over, the covered face \u2014 as deployed by law enforcement in a wave of immigration crackdowns directed by President Donald Trump\u2019s White House \u2014 has become one of the most potent and contentious visuals of 2025.\nThe increase in high-profile immigration enforcement was already contentious between those opposed to the actions of Trump\u2019s administration and those in support of them. The sight of masked agents carrying it out is creating a whole new level of conflict, in a way that has no real comparison in the U.S. history of policing.\nTrump administration officials have consistently defended the practice, saying that immigration agents have faced strident and increasing harassment in public and online as they have gone about their enforcement in service of Trump\u2019s drive toward mass deportation, and hiding their identities is for their and their families\u2019 safety to avoid things like death threats and doxing, where someone\u2019s personal information is released without their permission on the internet.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I\u2019m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, their family on the line because people don\u2019t like what immigration enforcement is,\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons said last month.\nThere\u2019s pushback, as expected\nDemocrats and others, including the several state attorneys general, have pushed back, saying the use of face masks generates public fear and should be halted.\nIn a letter to Lyons last week, a group of Democratic senators said the stepped-up immigration enforcement in workplaces, restaurants and other sites was already causing dismay and the increasingly common sight of masked agents \u201crepresents a clear attempt to compound that fear and chaos \u2013 and to avoid accountability for agents\u2019 actions.\u201d\nIn American culture, covering one\u2019s face has often gone hand in hand with assumptions of negative behavior. Think bandits donning bandanas in cowboy movies, or robbers putting on ski masks before pulling a heist on a bank. Even comic-book superheroes who cover their faces have been swept up in storylines in recent years that derisively refer to them as \u201cmasks\u201d and say their decision to hide their identities while enforcing justice is transgressive.\nAnd the presence of masked police or paramilitary forces in other countries has been seen by Americans as antithetical to promised democracy and justice for all \u2014 and to the common-law principle of being able to face your accusers.\nMask-wearing overall in American life took another hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many Trump supporters scoffed at notions that protective masks would insulate people from the deadly virus and scorned people who wore them. More recently, Trump has come out against masks, at least when they\u2019re being worn by protestors. He posted on social media last month that demonstrators wearing masks should be arrested.\nGiven all that cultural context, it\u2019s even more problematic that those enforcing laws be the ones with their faces covered, said Tobias Winright, professor of moral theology at St. Patrick\u2019s Pontifical University in Maynooth, Ireland. He has worked in law enforcement in the U.S. and writes frequently about policing ethics.\nIf \u201cwhat you\u2019re doing is above board and right,\u201d he said, \u201cthen why conceal your identity?\u201d\nPower gives different symbols different meanings\nFor those who question why it\u2019s different for law enforcement to wear masks if protestors and non-law enforcement personnel are doing it, it\u2019s because symbols have different meanings based on the power and position of the people using them, said Alison Kinney, author of \u201cHood,\u201d a book about that clothing item and the various ways people have used it.\n\u201cICE agents are agents of the state. and they\u2019re invested with not only power but also with protections in carrying out their job,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that job is also supposed to be public service. It\u2019s also supposed to be accountable and responsible to the public.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so they have a greater responsibility for transparency and accountability and making themselves known so that we can hold them accountable for the justice or injustice of their actions,\u201d she said.\nConcerns over how law enforcement is held accountable to the public have come up before. Advocates pushed for officers to wear body cameras and demanded that police officers have visible names and badge numbers. But there hasn\u2019t previously been much discussion around police masking because there isn\u2019t a history of it being done in any kind of official widespread way in the United States, outside of SWAT- or undercover-type operations, Winright said.\nThe most high-profile example of mask-wearing in American history for the purpose of hiding identity is also its most negative one \u2014 racist attacks carried out by the members of the Ku Klux Klan.\nThe masks served a purpose, of course, of keeping the wearers\u2019 identities secret, said Elaine Frantz, a history professor at Kent State University and author of \u201cKu-Klux: The Birth of the Klan during Reconstruction.\u201d But they also made it easier for those wearing them to commit violent acts against others, she said.\n\u201cOne thing about a mask is it kind of works like being behind a riot shield,\u201d Frantz said. \u201cWhen you have more of separation from the person you\u2019re attacking, it\u2019s easier to dehumanize that person.\u201d\nWinright said he hoped law enforcement mask-wearing wouldn\u2019t be normalized. There has been at least one expansion into local policing. In Nassau County, on Long Island just outside New York City, County Executive Bruce Blakeman last week signed an executive order allowing police officers to wear masks during certain types of work, including working with immigration agents.\nWinright is concerned, though, that the move could strain police-community relations even more, thus putting officers at even more risk.\n\u201cWearing a mask seems to increase fear and decrease trust, and policing from federal to local in America needs trust and transparency and community relations that are positive,\u201d he said.\nHe added: \u201cThe harms, the risks, are greater by wearing masks, not only to the individual officers, but to the profession itself, as well as to the United States society. It\u2019s just going to further exacerbate the us-versus-them polarization, the lack of trust, and that\u2019s the probably the last thing we need right now.\u201d"

      "text": "South Dakota governor, a potential Trump running mate, writes in new book about killing her dog\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem \u2014 a potential running mate for presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump \u2014 is getting attention again. This time, it\u2019s for a new book where she writes about killing an unruly dog, and a smelly goat, too.\nThe Guardian obtained a copy of Noem\u2019s soon-to-be released book, \u201cNo Going Back: The Truth on What\u2019s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward.\u201d In it, she tells the story of the ill-fated Cricket, a 14-month-old wirehaired pointer she was training for pheasant hunting.\nShe writes, according to the Guardian, that the tale was included to show her willingness to do anything \u201cdifficult, messy and ugly\u201d if it has to be done. But backlash was swift against the Republican governor, who just a month ago drew attention and criticism for posting an infomercial-like video about cosmetic dental surgery she received out-of-state.\nIn her book, Noem writes that she took Cricket on a hunting trip with older dogs in hopes of calming down the wild puppy. Instead, Cricket chased the pheasants while \u201chaving the time of her life.\u201d\nOn the way home from the hunting trip, Noem writes that she stopped to talk to a family. Cricket got out of Noem\u2019s truck and attacked and killed some of the family\u2019s chickens, then bit the governor.\nNoem apologized profusely, wrote the distraught family a check for the deceased chickens, and helped them dispose of the carcasses, she writes. Cricket \u201cwas the picture of joy\u201d as all that unfolded.\n\u201cI hated that dog,\u201d Noem writes, deeming her \u201cuntrainable.\u201d\n\u201cAt that moment,\u201d Noem writes, \u201cI realized I had to put her down.\u201d She led Cricket to a gravel pit and killed her.\nThat wasn\u2019t all. Noem writes that her family also owned a \u201cnasty and mean\u201d male goat that smelled bad and liked to chase her kids. She decided to go ahead and kill the goat, too. She writes that the goat survived the first shot, so she went back to the truck, got another shell, then shot him again, killing him.\nSoon thereafter, a school bus dropped off Noem\u2019s children. Her daughter asked, \u201cHey, where\u2019s Cricket?\u201d Noem writes.\nThe excerpts drew immediate criticism on social media platforms, where many posted photos of their own pets. President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign surfaced the story on social media alongside a photo of Noem with Trump.\nThe Lincoln Project, a conservative group that opposes Trump, posted a video that it called a \u201cpublic service announcement,\u201d showing badly behaved dogs and explaining that \u201cshooting your dog in the face is not an option.\u201d\n\u201cYou down old dogs, hurt dogs, and sick dogs humanely, not by shooting them and tossing them in a gravel pit,\u201d Rick Wilson of the Lincoln Project wrote on X. \u201cUnsporting and deliberately cruel ... but she wrote this to prove the cruelty is the point.\u201d\nNoem took to social media to defend herself.\n\u201cWe love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm,\u201d she said on X. \u201cSadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years.\u201d\nShe urged readers to preorder her book if they want \u201cmore real, honest, and politically INcorrect stories that\u2019ll have the media gasping.\u201d\nRepublican strategist Alice Stewart said that while some Republican voters might appreciate the story \u201cas a testament to her grit,\u201d it ultimately creates a distraction for Noem.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never a good look when people think you\u2019re mistreating animals,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI have a dog I love like a child and I can\u2019t imagine thinking about doing that, I can\u2019t imagine doing that, and I can\u2019t imagine writing about it in a book and telling all the world.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time Noem has grabbed national attention.\nIn 2019, she stood behind the state\u2019s anti-meth campaign even as it became the subject of some mockery for the tagline \u201cMeth. We\u2019re on it.\u201d Noem said the campaign got people talking about the methamphetamine epidemic and helped lead some to treatment.\nLast month, Noem posted a nearly five-minute video on X lavishing praise on a team of cosmetic dentists in Texas for giving her a smile she said she can be proud of. \u201cI love my new family at Smile Texas!\u201d she wrote.\nSouth Dakota law bans gifts of over $100 from lobbyists to public officials and their immediate family. A violation is a misdemeanor punishable up to a year in jail and/or a $2,000 fine. The state attorney general\u2019s office has declined to answer questions about whether the gift ban applies to people who are not registered lobbyists."

      "text": "Scammers could win big thanks to DOGE's government cuts\nScammers had a big year in 2024, new data from the Federal Trade Commission shows.\nCriminals stole $12.5 billion from Americans, according to official reports filed with the government, amounting to a 25 percent increase over the previous year. But that figure doesn't account for unreported thefts. When accounting for underreporting, the FTC estimates that scammers actually robbed people of at least $158 billion in 2023.\nWhile fraud reports remained stable in 2024, the percentage of people who said they'd been the victim of financial fraud increased from 27 percent to 38 percent (not all who report fraud are successfully separated from their money). That spike could indicate that scammers are becoming even more adept at swindling their victims or more people are admitting to being ripped off \u2014 or both.\nRegardless of why more people are reporting financial fraud, experts worry that government cuts, including those implemented by Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, will expose consumers to even greater fraud risk.\nReduced staff and fewer resources could hamper the government's ability to respond to consumer reports of fraud, investigate complaints, and regulate products and platforms that scammers rely on to steal from their victims, says John Breyault, VP of Public Policy of the National Consumers League.\n\"The cuts [from] DOGE [are] making consumers more vulnerable to fraud,\" Breyault says.\nWhat cuts at federal agencies mean for consumers\nDOGE recently attempted to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency that regulates financial institutions and curbs predatory business practices.\nThe CFPB was poised to gain oversight of major digital payment apps like Venmo and CashApp that scammers rely on to defraud people, pending Congressional approval. The Senate, however, recently voted to repeal that rule, which had been finalized at the end of the Biden administration.\nEven if the CFPB ultimately supervised the apps, it's unclear whether the agency would have the capacity to evaluate and investigate related complaints on behalf of consumers.\nA CFPB official recently testified that the agency's Office of Consumer Response handles about 350,000 consumer complaints each month, adding that a stop-work order issued by the agency's new head resulted in a massive backlog. The New York Times reported that the CFPB's consumer response team had been brought back in to deal with 16,000 complaints. Mashable reached out to CFPB for comment but did not receive a response.\nGiven the upheaval, Breayault says he's no longer confident in directing consumers to file a complaint with the CFPB. Instead, he's directing them to their state attorney general, who also has the authority to investigate predatory business practices and fraud on behalf of consumers.\nWhile the FTC, which spearheads much of the government's consumer fraud work, has been spared of wholesale cuts so far, at least a dozen probationary employees were recently fired, according to The Verge.\nThose terminations included Bureau of Consumer Protection employees, who receive complaints about and investigate deceptive and fraudulent business practices. Breyault says it's unclear how many employees FTC lost to DOGE's request for voluntary resignations in late January.\nThe Federal Trade Commission just asked for a delay in its upcoming trial against Amazon for alleged deceptive practices, citing limited resources and staff following DOGE-related cuts and \"Fork in the Road\" resignations. The FTC then reversed course and said it faced no \"resource constraints.\"\nJoe Simonson, FTC's director of public affairs, told Mashable that cuts amounted to a .3% reduction of staff. He added that cracking down on fraud would be a \"priority\" under the FTC.\nPrior to this story's publication, Trump terminated two Democratic FTC commissioners in a move that the National Consumers League described as \"unlawful.\"\n\"The firing of dedicated public servants because they belong to the wrong political party will make the FTC\u2019s work even harder,\" Breayault said in a statement about their removal.\nWhat crytpo and AI have to do with growing scam risk\nBreyault worries that government-slashing efforts may embolden criminals if they suspect that agencies won't be responsive to consumer complaints.\nBut he's also seen an uptick in scammers trying to take advantage of federal workers who've been fired as a result of DOGE's efforts. Some have reported being targeted by fake job offers, which are often a scheme to steal money from victims.\nBreyault says that the Trump administration's deregulatory approach toward both cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence could give scammers further advantage if accountability and guardrails for those industries disappear.\nMany financial fraudsters rely on crypto to steal from victims without a trace. Scam victims said they lost more money in 2024 to fraud that involved bank transfers or crypto than to all other payment methods, according to the latest FTC data.\nScammers also increasingly rely on AI to generate believable \u2014 and widely shareable \u2014 scripts for defrauding victims. Think, for example, of a script shared online that anyone can use to execute a romance scam. AI tools also allow scammers to create visual and vocal deepfakes that deceive victims into believing that they're communicating with a real person or legitimate government, bank, or law enforcement official.\nBreyault urges consumers to contact their members of Congress if they have concerns about DOGE-related cuts. He also recommends remaining vigilant against fraud attempts, which typically involve a sense of urgency, an unusual payment method, and efforts to isolate the potential victim from people they trust.\n\"We are not in an environment where we should be depriving our consumer protection agencies of the resources they need to fight the threat that exists,\" Breyault says.\nUPDATE: Mar. 21, 2025, 4:43 p.m. PDT Zelle was originally included in this story as a payment service that might have been supervised by the CFPB. After publication, the company told Mashable that it believes it's been under the agency's supervision since its inception in 2017.\nTopics Social Good Elon Musk Money\nRebecca Ruiz is a Senior Reporter at Mashable.

Earlier this summer Congress passed a spending bill that gives ICE money to hire 10,000 more staff.\nCurrently, ICE applicants must be 21 years old and no older than 37 or 40, depending on what position they are applying for.\nIn an interview with Fox & Friends, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said applicants could be as young as 18.\n\u201cWe no longer have a cap on how old you can be or you can continue at age 18, sign up for ICE and join us and be a part of it. We\u2019ll get you trained and ready to be equipped to go out on the streets and help protect families,\u201d Noem said.\nThe department said all recruits would have to go through medical and drug screening and complete a physical fitness test.\nThe agency promoted the age-limit changes on social media with enthusiastic tones, casting the immigration-enforcement efforts as not only patriotic but also epic and even cinematic.\nOne post was accompanied by an image that looked like a recruiting poster showing images of a young man and an older man, both wearing military style tactical gear and holding weapons with the words \u201cNO AGE CAP JOIN ICE NOW\u201d emblazoned on the bottom. \u201cWe\u2019re taking father/son bonding to a whole new level,\u201d it said.\nAnother showed an advertisement for a Ford Club Wagon \u2014 a large van once popular for how many people it could carry \u2014 with the words: \u201cThink about how many criminal illegal aliens you could fit in this bad boy?\u201d\nWritten at the bottom of the image was the words \u201cWant to deport illegals with your absolute boys?\u201d Absolute boys is a slang term used to praise someone.\nICE earlier announced a recruiting campaign aimed at finding and hiring the deportation officers, investigators and lawyers it will need to meet its hiring goals.\nAs part of that campaign the agency is offering an eye-catching bonus of up to $50,000 for new recruits as well as other benefits like student loan forgiveness and abundant overtime for deportation officers."

      "text": "'South Park' creators have the most deadpan response to Trump episode controversy\nSouth Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have responded to their Season 27 premiere, which saw a less-than-impressed reaction from the White House to the show's depiction of President Donald Trump.\nThe episode, which aired on Wednesday night and is streaming on Paramount+, depicts Trump in bed with Satan, makes references to the president's urging for people to move on from the so-called \"Epstein list\", and features a deepfake PSA sequence in which Trump is portrayed as stumbling through the desert, getting naked, and revealing a talking micropenis, which states, \"I'm Donald J. Trump, and I endorse this message.\"\nThe White House's angry reaction to the South Park episode was palpable, with White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers saying in a statement published by ABC News, \"This show hasn\u2019t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.\"\nParker and Stone appeared on a panel at San Diego\u2019s Comic-Con International on Thursday, during which the pair were asked if they had anticipated the reaction to their South Park episode. \"We\u2019re terribly sorry,\" Parker responded, staring out to the audience.\nDuring the panel, Parker said South Park's producers requested the animated micropenis in the deepfake sequence be blurred.\n\"They like, 'OK, but we\u2019re gonna blur the penis,' and I'm like, \u2018No you\u2019re not gonna blur the penis,\u2019\u201d Parker said. Stone chimed in saying, \"We put eyes on the penis. If we put eyes on the penis, we won't blur it. That was a whole conversation with grown-up people for about four fucking days.\"\n\"Because then it's a character!\" said Parker.\nThe Season 27 South Park premiere, aptly titled \"Sermon on the 'Mount,\" also took jabs at Paramount, days after Parker and Stone signed a $1.5 billion deal with the company for global streaming rights to South Park and 50 new episodes over five years. In particular, the episode roasts Paramount's $16 million settlement with Trump, in which the president alleged \"deceitful\" editing of a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The settlement has been criticised by press freedom advocates and notably, The Late Show host Stephen Colbert, the latter who labelled it a \"big fat bribe,\" days before his show was unceremoniously cancelled by Paramount-owned network CBS \u2014 which claimed it was unrelated.\nIn the South Park episode, there's a 60 Minutes segment showing reporters terrified to make anti-Trump statements (\"he's probably watching\") and a storyline in which Trump sues the town, resulting in the residents being slapped with a hefty settlement fee and an order to run pro-Trump PSAs like the aforementioned NSFW deepfake nude scene.\n\"You guys saw what happened to CBS? Yeah, well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount,\" says Jesus (yes, Jesus) during a key scene in the episode. \u201cDo you really want to end up like Colbert?\"\nShannon Connellan is Mashable's UK Editor based in London, formerly Mashable's Australia Editor, but emotionally, she lives in the Creel House.

      "text": "'South Park's Trump-bashing Season 27 premiere has the White House fuming\nSouth Park goes right for President Donald Trump's jugular in the first episode of Season 27.\nThe episode sees Trump in bed with Satan, a callback to 1999's South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, which featured Satan in a relationship with Saddam Hussein.\n\"You remind me more and more of this other guy I used to date,\" Satan tells Trump. \"Like, a lot. Like, you guys are exactly alike.\"\nSouth Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone don't stop there, though. They also show Trump as having a micropenis and mention rumors of him being on the \"Epstein list.\"\nThe Season 27 premiere also skewers Paramount's $16 million settlement with Trump over a lawsuit in which Trump alleged that a 60 Minutes interview with Vice President Kamala Harris contained \"deceitful\" editing. (CBS News itself called the suit \"completely without merit.\") In the episode, the town of South Park protests against Trump. In retaliation, Trump sues the town, forcing them to pay Trump a considerable sum and produce a number of pro-Trump PSAs as part of a settlement.\nThe PSA shown at the end of the episode is extra-NSFW, showing an AI deepfake of Trump taking off his clothes in the desert. Once he's fully naked, his penis pops up and states, \"I'm Donald J. Trump, and I endorse this message.\"\nThe PSA's voiceover declares: \"His penis is teeny tiny, but his love for us is large.\"\nTrump's White House is decidedly unhappy about the episode. According to Rolling Stone, a Trump adviser who has long been a fan of the series found it \"disappointing.\"\nIn a statement sent to Variety, Rolling Stone, and The Hollywood Reporter among other outlets, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said: \"The Left\u2019s hypocrisy truly has no end \u2014 for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' (sic) content, but suddenly they are praising the show. Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows.\"\nHours before South Park Season 27 premiered, Paramount reached a five-year deal with Parker and Stone for 50 new episodes on Comedy Central and a streaming partnership with Paramount+. The deal is valued at $1.5 billion.\nSouth Park's takedown of Trump and specifically the Paramount settlement comes a little over a week after Stephen Colbert ripped into that same settlement on The Late Show. He called it a \"big, fat bribe\" meant to encourage the approval of a merger between Skydance Media and Paramount, which owns CBS. Days later, The Late Show was cancelled, although CBS claimed it was \"purely a financial decision.\"\nHowever, South Park thinks otherwise. Towards the end of the episode, Jesus Christ himself encourages South Park's citizens to settle with Trump, asking them, \"Do you really want to end up like Colbert?\"\nTopics Donald Trump\nBelen Edwards is an Entertainment Reporter at Mashable.

  "argos_summary": "In its Season 27 premiere, South Park sharply criticized President Donald Trump, depicting him in bed with Satan and featuring a hyperrealistic deepfake of him with a micropenis. The second episode, titled 'Got A Nut,' continues this trend by targeting Trump's administration, including ICE and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who is portrayed as engaging in violent acts against animals. The show's controversial content has sparked significant viewer interest, leading to its highest ratings in years, while also drawing ire from the White House, which dismissed the show's relevance.",
