      "feedback": "The piece has strong regime anchoring but is too long and unfocused for a 4–6 sentence executive brief, and the causal chain between AI productivity, governance frictions, consumer dynamics, and policy risk needs a tighter, first‑principles spine; tighten to a single house view that ties each regime to a market variable (AI uptake → tech capex/valuations; deal frictions → risk premia/exit terms; price discipline → margins/consumption; policy shocks → risk assets) and cite the four core sources for each link (5S9GJV2O3, UVEQ2SJ0W, HWGNUP2XG, ISXY49HGS) with exact matches. Reduce to 4–6 sentences or bullets that (i) present base/optimistic/pessimistic paths with explicit triggers and near-term windows (e.g., DAY/BKH thresholds, AI upgrade cadence, sustained Kirkland promos, security/shock events) and assign transparent, source-backed drivers; (ii) quantify the pricing channel using the available numbers (tariff cadence within ~4 weeks; Apple $100B capex signal in ~6–8 weeks; 50bp cut priced; dollar down roughly 2–3%; spreads compress 300–350bp; S&P/risk-on moves) rather than qualitative claims; (iii) resolve conflicts (tariff persistence vs capex-driven re-rating) by stating how the base case handles either outcome; (iv) prune non‑essential device/cycle specifics unless they drive the regime argument, and if kept, tether them tightly to the AI/regime narrative; and (v) overhaul the watch list into a single, source‑anchored set of signals with explicit invalidations. In short, deliver a crisp, source‑mapped house view with a clean four‑regime causal chain, precise triggers/invalidations with windows, quantified pricing implications, and a tightly scoped watch list, ensuring every assertion cites a source ID (e.g., 5S9GJV2O3, UVEQ2SJ0W, HWGNUP2XG, ISXY49HGS) and staying within 4–6 sentences.",
