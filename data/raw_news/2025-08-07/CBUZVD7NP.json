  "description": "Trent Sweeney isn\u2019t fazed by the jeans.",
  "content": "Sydney Sweeney\u2019s brother, Trent Sweeney, isn\u2019t fazed by the backlash to her American Eagle campaign ad.\n\nTrent, who is in the US Air Force, weighed in on the controversy involving his famous sister on his Instagram on Wednesday.\n\nThe 25-year-old posted a photo on his Instagram Stories of his official certification as he was promoted to staff sergeant, and jokingly wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s them good jeans \ud83e\udd78.\u201d\n\nTrent also posted a picture on his Instagram page of himself in uniform as he received his certificate. \u201cI\u2019m excited for this next step in my career and thank everyone that\u2019s been a part of it so far,\u201d Trent captioned the post, which Sydney, 27, \u201cliked.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cEuphoria\u201d star is close with Trent and their parents, Steven and Lisa.\n\n\u201cI love my family, and I love where I came from,\u201d she told Women\u2019s Health in 2023. \u201cAnything my family needs, I\u2019m always there for them.\u201d\n\nSydney recently participated in a jeans ad for American Eagle that sparked an intense public reaction.\n\nLeft-wing critics users claimed that the ad \u2014 which features the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans\u201d \u2014 was full-on Nazi propaganda that promotes racism, eugenics and Western beauty standards.\n\nIn one promotional clip, Sydney explains that genes are passed down from parents to offspring, \u201coften determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color,\u201d before declaring, \u201cMy jeans are blue.\u201d\n\nThe ad included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.\n\nAmerican Eagle responded to the discourse with a public statement in which the company defended its creative choices.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her narrative. We will continue to honor the unique ways everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence,\u201d the company said. \u201cGreat jeans flatter everyone.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump even weighed in on the ad, praising it as \u201cfantastic\u201d after finding out that Sydney is a registered Republican voter.\n\nVice President JD Vance also ripped Democrats for becoming unhinged over a \u201cpretty girl\u201d selling jeans to kids in America.\n\nSydney has not spoken out about the backlash.\n\nThe \u201cAnyone But You\u201d actress made her first public appearance since the ad came out on Sunday night at a screening of her upcoming film \u201cAmericana\u201d in Los Angeles.\n\nAt the viewing, Sydney was heckled by a disgruntled fan who shouted that she should \u201cStop the ad, that is being racist!,\u201d TMZ reported.\n\nSydney didn\u2019t respond and disappeared into her vehicle.",

'cause she got heckled at her latest movie premiere Sunday night.\nThe actress rolled up in a black SUV to the \"Americana\" premiere at Desert 5 Spot in Hollywood \u2014 only to be heckled by some lady as she stepped out.\nCheck out the video, obtained by TMZ ... Sydney -- dressed like a princess in a pale yellow gown -- is being led by security from the SUV to the theater's entrance.\nSydney Sweeney x American Eagle, oh my god. pic.twitter.com/tDkeGT9R7G\n\u2014 Sydney Sweeney Daily (@sweeneydailyx) July 24, 2025 @sweeneydailyx\nAs she makes her way inside, the heckler -- who's not seen in the video -- shouts, \"Stop the ad, that is being racist!\" But, Sydney plays it cool and unbothered, disappearing into the movie house.\nAs you know ... Sydney was recently targeted by a bunch of TikTokers who have criticized her American Eagle ad campaign, saying it was implicitly racist.\nAmerican Eagle has come to Sydney's defense, issuing a statement saying the ad was all about her jeans and her story ... shutting down slanderous claims of white supremacy and eugenics.\nBTW, Sydney also hit the red carpet last night with her \"Americana\" costars Halsey and Simon Rex, as well as director Tony Tost. While posing for the paparazzi, Sydney did not get any more flak for her AE ad ... which must have been a relief.\nAll's well that ends well."

The Who to me is very perplexing.\u201d\nHowever, the \u201cPinball Wizard\u201d crooner also acknowledged that his \u201cvoice is still as good as ever,\u201d even after performing for over six decades.\n\u201cI\u2019m still singing in the same keys, and it\u2019s still bloody loud, but I can\u2019t tell you if it will still be there in October,\u201d he shared. \u201cThere\u2019s a big part of me that\u2019s going: I just hope I make it through.\u201d\nDaltrey, who formed The Who alongside guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon in 1964, previously fell ill with a serious case of meningitis back in 2015.\nHe said that he still feels the after-effects, and added that the virus had done \u201ca lot of damage.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s buggered up my internal thermometer, so every time I start singing in any climate over 75 degrees, I\u2019m wringing with sweat, which drains my body salts,\u201d the \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again\u201d singer shared.\n\u201cThe potential to get really ill is there, and I have to be honest, I\u2019m nervous about making it to the end of the tour,\u201d he concluded.\nDaltrey reflected on his life during another chat with The Times published last year.\nAfter sharing that all his \u201cdreams came true,\u201d the rock legend said that he is now \u201cready to go at any time.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be realistic,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou can\u2019t live your life forever. Like I said, people my age, we\u2019re in the way. There are no guitar strings to be changed on this old instrument.\u201d\nMore recently, Daltrey joked about going deaf and blind in his old age, much like the blind, deaf and mute main character of The Who\u2019s 1969 album and rock opera \u201cTommy.\u201d\n\u201cThe joys of getting old mean you go deaf. I also now have got the joy of going blind,\u201d he told the crowd at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall during a concert in March.\n\u201cFortunately, I still have my voice,\u201d he joked, \u201cbecause then I\u2019ll have a full Tommy.\u201d\nThe Who\u2019s farewell tour is set to kick off in Florida on Aug. 16, and wrap up in Las Vegas on Sept. 28.\nDaltrey and Townshend, 80, announced their final tour back in May as Moon died in 1978 from a drug overdose, and Entwistle passed away in 2002 after suffering a heart attack triggered by cocaine.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to end the big part of my life that touring with The Who has been,\u201d Daltrey said at the time. \u201cThanks for being there for us and look forward to seeing you one last time.\u201d\n\u201cWell, all good things must come to an end,\u201d Townshend added. \u201cIt is a poignant time.\u201d\n\u201cRoger and I are in a good place, despite our age, eager to throw our weight behind this fond farewell to all our faithful fans, and hopefully to new ones who might jump in to see what they have been missing for the last 57 years,\u201d the iconic guitarist added.\n\u201cThis tour will be about fond memories, love and laughter,\u201d Townshend concluded. \u201cMake sure you join in.\u201d"

Nothing\u201d (\u201cSydney \u2018Nazi\u2019 madness,\u201d Kirsten Fleming, July 29).\nDo you know what comes between Sydney Sweeney and her American Eagle jeans (genes) ad?

Instead, the fare now goes up for the average citizen, and those who break the law will just continue their ways.\nAnd what happened to congestion pricing helping out rail commuters? That is just so last year. Gov. Hochul needs to go. She\u2019s a true upstater who has no idea what\u2019s it like for those in New York City to pay for all her bad decisions.\nSmarten up, voters \u2014 this is what it\u2019s like living in a state with a one-party system. Maybe we should just try the other party \u2014 doing the same thing over and over is the true definition of insanity.\nPhilip Vallone\nOssining\nHomeless hazard\nPresident Trump is 100% on the right track to remove the mentally ill and drug addicts from public spaces and streets (\u201cPrez edict on homeless care,\u201d July 25).\nA business owner should not have to pick up used needles or have his entrance be a homeless person\u2019s toilet.

      "text": "Sydney Sweeney\u2019s steamy new ad campaign for American Eagle turns teen retailer into latest \u2018meme stock\u2019\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters shares soared into \u201cmeme stock\u201d territory \u2014 after the teen retailer revealed Sydney Sweeney is leading a steamy new ad campaign for the fall.\nThe company\u2019s shares rose more than 10% before closing up 4.2% on Thursday after it unveiled its new marketing blitz, which features the \u201cEuphoria\u201d star sporting a denim jacket over her otherwise bare torso.\nIn a sultry video spot, Sweeney leans under the open hood of a vintage Mustang GT350 in a tight tank top, then slams the hood shut \u2014 and wipes her hands on her butt before hopping into the car and peeling off.\nThe edgy ads appeared to defy the \u201cwokism\u201d lately embraced by some major brands \u2014 sometimes with disastrous effects, according to commenters on social media.\n\u201cBased ad campaigns are back, and wokery is gasping for breath,\u201d commented X user Zia Yusuf \u2014 using the Gen Z term \u201cbased\u201d that typically signifies something which is controversial yet true.\n\u201cTake note Jaguar,\u201d Yusuf added, referring to the UK car maker\u2019s flopped ad campaign last fall featuring androgynous models.\n\u201cSydney Sweeney drops a cheeky ad, American Eagle stock soars 22%,\u201d another X user gleefully observed. \u201cWoke\u2019s dead, baby. Woke\u2019s dead.\u201d\nAmerican Eagle joins a volatile cohort of newly anointed meme stocks, including GoPro and Krispy Kreme, which saw sharp price swings in Wednesday\u2019s session.\nEarlier in the week, meme traders focused on names like Opendoor Technologies and Kohl\u2019s, creating brief rallies driven largely by social media buzz rather than earnings or company news.\nAnalysts and traders noted that the Sweeney campaign had helped reframe sentiment around the company, whose shares had fallen 35% this year ahead of Wednesday\u2019s close.\nThe retailer\u2019s strong brand recognition and more than 13% short interest, according to FactSet data, made it a natural magnet for meme stock traders seeking short squeezes and speculative gains.\nChatter about American Eagle gained momentum late Wednesday on the popular Reddit forum Wall Street Bets \u2014 best known for its role in the 2021 GameStop and AMC rallies.\n\u201cWe do not comment on trading activity or fluctuations in the stock price,\u201d an American Eagle spokesperson said. \u201cWe remain focused on executing our strategy and taking actions to position the company for long-term performance.\u201d\nLast year, Sweeney partnered with men\u2019s personal care brand Dr. Squatch for a multi-platform marketing blitz that helped propel the company to a $1.5 billion acquisition by Unilever less than a year later.\nThe campaign \u2014 dubbed the \u201cBody Wash Genie\u201d \u2014 cast Sweeney in a playful, satirical role across TV, YouTube, podcasts and social media.\nOne limited-edition product, a \u201cBathwater Bliss\u201d soap made with droplets from one of Sweeney\u2019s baths, sold out instantly and triggered a frenzy of resale listings on eBay, where individual bars fetched as much as $2,000.\nThe campaign overwhelmed Dr. Squatch\u2019s website and generated massive viral buzz.\nThe results were staggering: Dr. Squatch received over 800 media placements, 11.9 billion impressions and a spike in consumer engagement that accelerated its retail growth and brand valuation.\nThe Sweeney campaign was credited by industry observers as a key driver in Unilever\u2019s decision to acquire the company for $1.5 billion last month.\nUnilever\u2019s press release cited \u201cviral social-first marketing strategies, partnerships with celebrities and influencers, and culturally relevant collaborations\u201d as central to Dr. Squatch\u2019s rapid growth \u2014 a clear nod to Sweeney\u2019s role in elevating the brand.\nLast year, Crocs\u2019 stock jumped more than 4% after its Heydude brand announced Sweeney as global spokesperson, with analysts crediting the move for renewed investor optimism.\nA spokesperson for Sweeney declined to comment. The Post has sought comment from American Eagle."

      "text": "This is a story about Sydney Sweeney...and a lake.\n\u201cI grew up on the water,\u201d says the 26-year-old. On the surface, she\u2019s referencing where she spent childhood\u2014on a lake in a small town on the Washington-Idaho border. But Sydney is sharing something deeper. To the self-described homebody turned starlet, the lake is more than a location; it\u2019s the place that shaped her into who she is, and where she returns to feel most herself. There, she\u2019s not two-time Emmy nominee and Fifty-Fifty Films founder Sydney Sweeney; she\u2019s Lake Syd.\nShe soft-launched the idea of Lake Syd last summer after bringing her stylist and other members of her work team to her family\u2019s lake for a week. At the trip\u2019s end, she captioned an Instagram post chronicling their adventures, \u201cwish you knew lake syd.\u201d\nSo who exactly is Lake Syd? \u201cShe\u2019s truly just who I am at the core, everything stripped away,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cI wrote that caption because everyone with me was like, \u2018Wow, really wish the world could see Lake Syd,\u2019 because it\u2019s just who I am.\u201d\nLake Syd goes on hikes with her rescue dog, Tank, and spends her free time organizing her house. She drives a four-wheeler in the woods and likes to jump off a rope swing into the water. She wears matching Christmas PJs with her family (including Tank) and dreams of opening an ice cream shop. More than anything, Lake Syd loves slalom waterskiing. (Slalom is different from traditional waterskiing in that you strap both legs onto a single ski.)\n\u201cThe moment I could walk, my mom put me on what\u2019s called a U-board to learn how to ski,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cI remember that whenever we would go by the docks of my grandma\u2019s or my cousin\u2019s house, I\u2019d wave. I felt so cool because I could take off one hand. That\u2019s my earliest memory of skiing, but I\u2019ve been doing it as long as I can remember. It\u2019s my favorite.\u201d\nBut Sydney doesn\u2019t love slalom waterskiing solely because it\u2019s a respite from the Hollywood hustle and bustle. She loves it because it\u2019s a challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of upper body strength, it\u2019s balance, it\u2019s core, it\u2019s legs\u2014you get tired really fast,\u201d she says. \u201cI see such a change in my body after an entire summer of [skiing]. My arms are stronger, more sculpted. My abs are rock solid. But I never look at it as a workout because it is so much fun.\u201d (Appropriately, she fuels this active pleasure with water\u2014specifically flavored water brand, Bai, for which she is a brand ambassador. Her fave flavor: Pilavo Pineapple Mango.)\nTo Sydney, the tough stuff is fun\u2014on the water and at work. \u201cWhenever a new challenge presents itself and I\u2019m not scared to push myself to try, that\u2019s when I\u2019m really proud of who I am,\u201d she says. It might be taking on a complex role or taking a turn to cut across the wake at 60 miles an hour. \u201cI know that my body can keep going\u2014it\u2019s more just that mental challenge to push myself through,\u201d she says. \u201cI take that skill into skiing, into acting, into anything I do, because it\u2019s always more mental than physical. Of course you have to train, but it\u2019s mind over matter at the end of the day.\u201d\nEven when her arms are sore and her hands burn from gripping the ski rope, Sydney doesn\u2019t let go because, ultimately, the mental rewards outweigh the physical toll. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare moment when I can actually just hear myself breathing, where everything else goes quiet,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cNo one else is back there with me\u2014just me, the ski, the lake behind the boat. All I\u2019m thinking about is skiing, and there are not many things that allow my brain to shut off that way.\u201d\nSydney struggles with anxiety, particularly social anxiety. \u201cWhenever it feels like the world\u2019s so loud, and there\u2019s so much going on, and I\u2019m trying to balance it all\u2014sometimes, it can feel overwhelming,\u201d she says. In these moments, Sydney finds solace in spending time outdoors with Tank, whether they\u2019re meandering through lakeside forests or trekking Solstice Canyon in Malibu near their new home.\nShe\u2019s open to talking about anxiety because everyone experiences it, in some way, at one point or another, but she\u2019s purposeful about what she shares about her mental health, having previously dealt with a media frenzy after an outlet mischaracterized a single panic attack experience as multiple ongoing ones. \u201cI\u2019ve only once spoken about one panic attack,\u201d she clarifies. \u201cI said, \u2018I felt like I had a panic attack,\u2019 and then the news just kind of did their own thing with that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that Sydney is uncomfortable with her (ever increasing) fame and what that means for her personal or private life. She\u2019s incredibly grateful for every opportunity, from attending the Met Gala to starring in a Rolling Stones music video. But she seems to realize, at a young age, that career accolades and the attention that comes with them are an unreliable source of happiness. She\u2019s existed in the spotlight long enough to know there is more to life than red carpet interviews. \u201cI started [acting] when I was 11, 12 years old, and it was only in the last few years that everyone was actually interested in talking to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a good eight, nine years where no one was saying yes. It was just me pushing through all the no\u2019s.\u201d\nAs Sydney strived, her family sacrificed. \u201cI watched my parents lose a lot. We filed for bankruptcy, and they lost their house back home on the lake. [Sydney has since bought back her great-grandparents\u2019 home on the same lake so she can return.] We couldn\u2019t afford life in L.A. We couldn\u2019t afford life anywhere,\u201d she recalls.\nTo help pay the bills, Sydney babysat, cleaned restaurant bathrooms, and led tours at Universal Studios. \u201cIt was hard because they were supporting my dream, and I couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything else,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fail them. No matter how long it took, I was going to be in a TV show or a movie, and I wasn\u2019t going to stop until something happened.\u201d\nThat something was arguably the HBO miniseries Sharp Objects. And once one thing happened, so did many others: The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Euphoria, The White Lotus, Reality, Anyone But You, Madame Web, and more to come. A self-described workaholic, Sydney revels in the chaos of juggling multiple scripts and a packed schedule. \u201cI love the hecticness of it all,\u201d she says. During the SAG-AFTRA strike, she \u201ctried to create that in other aspects of my life.\u201d\nDespite her family\u2019s well-intentioned requests to chill, Sydney wanted, or perhaps even needed, a challenge. In lieu of acting or working on her production company\u2019s upcoming projects, Sydney party-planned\u2014starting with her own \u201980s prom-themed birthday party. (\u201cI\u2019ve never had a prom,\u201d she confides.) She even designed her perfectly pink and poufy birthday dress, choosing everything from the shape to the fabrics. Family and friends were invited to a blowout bash. But on her actual birthday, she celebrated in modest Lake Syd style by painting a giant blue cupcake at Color Me Mine. \u201cI love to paint, and I love to read,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cThose are the activities that are just for me.\u201d\nSydney credits her mom with instilling in her a sense of independence and self-reliance\u2014something she hopes to encourage in her own children someday. When Sydney was young, she got into a wakeboarding accident (where there\u2019s a water sport, there\u2019s Syd) and had to get 17 stitches next to her eye. \u201cThe day the doctor cleared me to go in the water, my mom drove me to the lake and told me I couldn\u2019t get out of the water until I stood back up on my board,\u201d she says. \u201cI was crying, but now I\u2019m so thankful for everything she did.\u201d\nThat self-sufficiency comes in handy in Hollywood, where friendships tend to last only as long as the shoots where they form. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to build meaningful relationships, so whenever I am able to feel that connection, I try to foster it,\u201d she says. \u201cLike Maude [Apatow]\u2014I look at her as my sister.\u201d When they\u2019re not working together on Euphoria, Sydney tries to spend as much time with Apatow as possible.\nRecently, she also forged a tight bond with her Anyone But You co-star Glen Powell. \u201cGetting to work with Glen, I\u2019ll never forget this one\u2026 I hope the audience can actually feel the love and fun we all shared making this film,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I always feel from my favorite rom-coms\u2014the joy and energy shared amongst the cast and crew, and I was lucky enough to experience that on this film.\u201d [Ed note: All quotes about this specific project were obtained after the strike ended.]\nA tight-knit social circle also ensures Sydney surrounds herself only with those who align with her core values: kindness and loyalty. \u201cI truly believe that kindness is the most important attribute anybody can have, because whoever you see on your way up, you\u2019re going to see on your way down,\u201d she says. \u201cI try to be as loyal to my people as I can, and I hope they return the favor. I also love watching everyone succeed together.\u201d\nAn innate desire to treasure shared success is also why Sydney\u2019s family relationships remain some of her strongest. \u201cMy cousins are my best friends.\u2026I love my family, and I love where I came from,\u201d she says. \u201cAnything my family needs, I\u2019m always there for them.\u201d\nAnd because they loved her before millions of fans did\u2014back when Lake Syd was the only Syd\u2014she has confidence in not only who she is, but who she can be. \u201cI look up to the older version of myself. When I was 10, I looked up to the 25-year-old version of myself, and now I look up to my 50-year-old version,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope I make the decisions she would be proud of.\u201d\nHow Sydney Sweeney Owns Her Morning\nWhen she\u2019s not filming, Sydney starts her days strong with a simple a.m. routine.\nLindsay Geller is the lifestyle director at Women\u2019s Health, where she oversees the Sex & Love, Relationships, and Life sections and manages Women\u2019s Health+ content.

And let them like each other.\u201d\n\u201cBoth of them have had hardship, and they\u2019re both beautiful human beings,\u201d Curtis continued of the stars as she got choked up. \u201cIf they actually have found an intimate love with each other, we should all go to bed tonight feeling better.\u201d\nCurtis also called Anderson, 58, \u201ca beautiful person\u201d and noted that the \u201cBaywatch\u201d alum \u201cwas fantastic\u201d in their 2024 film \u201cThe Last Showgirl.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he also suffered an unimaginable loss so young, and has had a really hard go of it,\u201d Curtis added of Neeson, 73, who became a widower in 2009 after his wife Natasha Richardson died in a ski accident.\n\u201cSo if, in fact, these people have hard launched, then wish them the best and leave them alone,\u201d Curtis concluded.\nNeeson and Anderson struck up chemistry while filming \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d reboot.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a budding romance in the early stages,\u201d a source told People last week. \u201cIt\u2019s sincere, and it\u2019s clear they\u2019re smitten with each other.\u201d\nWhile Neeson and Anderson haven\u2019t outright confirmed they\u2019re dating, they have gushed over each other during the film\u2019s press tour.\n\u201cI think I have a friend forever in Liam.

      "text": "American Eagle\u2019s \u2018good jeans\u2019 ads with Sydney Sweeney spark a debate on race, beauty standards\nU.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.\nIt has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.\nTitled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d\nSome critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.\nMarcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.\n\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d\nOther commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign\u2019s message.\n\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\u201d former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.\nAmerican Eagle didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\nA snapshot of American Eagle\nThe ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.\nA day after Sweeney was announced as the company\u2019s latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle\u2019s stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.\nLike many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.\nAdamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields\u2019 age.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.\nBillboards, Instagram and Snapchat\nChief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.\nThe campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.\nAmerican Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.\nIn a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d\nJeans, genes and their many meanings\nIn one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d\nBut what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.\u201d\nThe video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign.\nWhile remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.\nCivil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right\u2019s promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.\nShalini Shankar, a cultural and linguistic anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said she had problems with American Eagle\u2019s \u201cgenes\u201d versus \u201cjeans\u201d because it exacerbates a limited concept of beauty.\n\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.\u201d\nA cultural shift in advertising\nMany critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.\nViewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.\nThe demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races.\nSome marketers say they\u2019ve observed another shift since President Donald Trump returned to office and moved to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies.\nJazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she\u2019s noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models.\n\u201cI can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\u201d Burrell said.\nAmerican Eagle\u2019s past and future\nAmerican Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.\nThe retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives.\nMarketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.\n\u201cThey were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,\u201d Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. \u201cBut this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand.\u201d\nMelissa Murphy, a marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, said she liked certain parts of the campaign but hoped it would be expanded to showcase people besides Sweeney for the \u201csake of the brand.\u201d\nOther experts say the buzz is good even if it\u2019s not uniformly positive.\n\u201cIf you try to follow all the rules, you\u2019ll make lots of people happy, but you\u2019ll fail,\u201d Adamson said. \u201cThe rocket won\u2019t take off. \u201d"
