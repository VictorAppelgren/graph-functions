  "content": "At 35% withanolide glycosides, Shoden\u00ae ashwagandha extract by Arjuna Naturals outperforms other commercial ashwagandha products in clinical study\n\nKERALA, India, Sept. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A new clinical study identified withanolide glycosides as the key drivers of superior bioavailability in ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) extracts. This marks the first direct evidence in humans that the type of withanolide\u2014not just the total content \u2014significantly influences absorption and efficacy. Shoden\u00ae ashwagandha extract, the innovation of nutraceutical pioneers Arjuna Natural Pvt., Ltd., demonstrated superior performance in uptake in the volunteer subjects.\n\nThe randomized, open-label, crossover clinical study, led by Priyank Rathi, MD, was published in the science journal Phytomedicine Plus, last July. It evaluated the bioavailability in 16 healthy human volunteers of four commercially available, standardized ashwagandha extracts with varying compositions, including: Shoden standardized to 35% Withania somnifera withanolide glycosides (WS-35), 10% (WS-10), 5% (WS-5), or 2.5% (WS-2.5). Each sample was standardized to deliver 185mg of total withanolides. Seventeen blood samples were collected over a 24-hour period after dosing. Plasma concentrations of withanolide A, withanoside IV, withaferin A, and total withanolides were quantified, and pharmacokinetic parameters\u2014how the body metabolizes a substance over time\u2014were calculated.\n\nResults of the study revealed striking differences in their pharmacokinetic profiles. Extracts rich in withanolide glycosides\u2014particularly those derived from the plant\u2014demonstrated markedly higher systemic exposure. With Shoden in the lead, these extracts showed longer half-lives, indicating prolonged circulation of active compounds in the body.\n\n\"Clinical data now confirm that withanolide glycosides stand out not just for quantity but for quality, with higher bioavailable than other withanolide types,\" reveals Benny Antony, PhD, Joint Managing Director of Arjuna Natural. \"Our findings suggest that the strength of ashwagandha is in its withanolide profile, specifically the chemical nature of the withanolides\u2014and not their total amount. This plays a critical role in determining the uptake and metabolism of ashwagandha extracts in the body for optimal effect. This study emphasized the importance of extract composition and the plant parts used.\"\n\nShoden\u00ae is a highly bioactive extract of ashwagandha, with an industry-leading 35% withanolide glycosides, the key active compounds in the plant. Derived from carefully chosen and validated ashwagandha sources, Arjuna employs a proprietary extraction process to deliver a potent holistic charge of the popular adaptogenic, even at a uniquely low dose of 60 mg.\n\nAlso known as \"Indian ginseng,\" the botanical powerhouse has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries as a \"rasayana,\" a rejuvenator, due to its scientifically validated capacity to enhance overall resilience and vitality and promote longevity and mental wellness. Ashwagandha is also noted for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Yet Withania extracts available in the market differ considerably in their active compound profiles, analytical methods, plant parts used, manufacturing processes, and recommended dosages. These variables can potentially affect the absorption and therapeutic efficacy of the extracts.\n\nThis study marks the latest milestone in Arjuna's robust collection of 12 clinical studies of Shoden. They showcase Shoden's positive role in relieving stress and anxiety and improving sleep quality. Research indicates its mechanisms of action include the ability to regulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, reducing the stress hormone cortisol and increasing relaxing GABA neurotransmitters. One clinical study highlighting its immunomodulating benefits revealed natural improvements in immune cell markers. And toxicity studies have endorsed its safety.\n\n\"These findings have major implications for both consumers and supplement manufacturers. As ashwagandha continues to gain popularity for its adaptogenic, cognitive, and stress-relieving benefits, the current research underscores the need for more detailed labeling and standardization that goes beyond total withanolide content. Future clinical studies and product formulations should consider the specific withanolide profile\u2014particularly the presence of glycosides\u2014to deliver ashwagandha extracts with maximum efficacy and consistency,\" concludes Antony.\n\nShoden has been internationally recognized for the 23 patents attributed to its unique formulation and manufacturing process. It is available in three doses and in various supplement formats, including pills, capsules, and powders. Its low-dose capabilities allow for its seamless integration into functional foods and beverages.\n\nFor more than a quarter of a century, Arjuna Natural has been India's leading manufacturer of standardized botanical extracts for food supplement industries, dedicated to ecofriendly and sustainable practices. Established in 1989, the company has grown rapidly, with customers in 70+ countries, and has an advanced research facility that works in collaboration with international universities on phytochemistry, pharmacokinetics, formulation, development, pre-clinical and toxicity studies. Arjuna Natural's facilities comply with the highest world standards, are GMP-certified, GRAS approved and have ISO, NSF, halal and Star-K kosher certification.\n\nArjuna will exhibit at Vitafoods Asia 2025, Booth #H34 and also at SupplySide West, Booth #6517.\n\nFor further information, please contact:",
