  "content": "Partnership meets growing demand for precision among Taiwan Mobile's existing automotive, robotics, and fleet customers\n\nSAN FRANCISCO and TAIPEI, Taiwan, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Swift Navigation, the leader in centimeter-accurate positioning for vehicle autonomy, robotics, and precision logistics, and Taiwan Mobile, one of Taiwan\u2019s leading telecommunications companies, today announced their partnership to bring SkylarkTM Precise Positioning Service to the Taiwanese market. This collaboration addresses the growing demand for high-accuracy positioning across industries.\n\nSkylark is a real-time GNSS correction service that delivers centimeter-level accuracy by correcting errors in signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS. It is the first and only cloud-based precise positioning service purpose-built to unlock mass market applications. Skylark is uniquely architected to ensure accuracy, reliability, and safety at global scale. Leveraging Swift\u2019s advanced atmospheric modeling, Skylark mitigates errors caused by ionospheric disturbances, clock drift, and orbital inaccuracies\u2014improving positioning precision from several meters to just a few centimeters.\n\nDeployed on a carrier-grade network of state-of-the-art ground reference stations\u2014designed and operated in partnership with Taiwan Mobile and other MNOs around the world\u2014Skylark delivers highly reliable, precise positioning to the Taiwanese market, powering next-generation applications, including:\n\u2022 Automotive: The first and only ASIL-certified, real-time cloud-based positioning service (ISO 26262:2018), Skylark enables safe and precise operation of ADAS-enabled and autonomous vehicles everywhere\u2014always.\n\u2022 Robotics: Swift\u2019s proprietary atmospheric modeling delivers centimeter-level accuracy with extended baselines and automatic failover, ensuring that robotic lawnmowers and surveying drones work as intended right out of the box.\n\u2022 Fleet Management: Skylark offers a cost-effective reliable positioning solution to optimize the last mile and final inch. Skylark is optimized for battery-powered devices and integrates seamlessly with a wide range of compatible GNSS components.\n\n\n\n\"The expansion made possible through our partnership with Taiwan Mobile marks an exciting milestone in our mission to bring high-integrity, precise positioning to the world,\u201d said Holger Ippach, Executive Vice President of Product & Marketing at Swift Navigation. \u201cTaiwan is a leader in technology and innovation, making it a perfect market for Skylark\u2019s cloud-based correction service, helping shape the future of mobility and automation in Asia and beyond.\"",
