  "title": "Made by Google 2025: We Found All the Biggest Pixel 10 Leaks and Rumors",
  "description": "Google's Pixel 10 may be getting a lot of new features thanks to a new processor, camera systems and magnets.",
  "content": "The new Pixel 10 line will debut on Aug. 20 at the Made by Google event, and it almost feels like the phones have been revealed in detail thanks to a multitude of rumors and presumed leaks.\n\nGoogle itself isn't hiding that the Pixel 10 is coming, posting multiple looks of the phone when promoting the upcoming announcement, but the company is still keeping detailed specs and features of the Pixel 10 line to itself. If we follow the series of rumors, though, several recent details suggest a lot of new life to the phone line. While we do expect the Pixel line to continue the overall lineup of the Pixel 9 -- including a base Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold -- rumors are pointing to significant changes to what's inside these phones to make them more feature-packed than ever.\n\nWe've rounded up the biggest rumors we've found so far about the Pixel 10 line here, and will continue updating as we hear more ahead of the Aug. 20 event.\n\nStarting with the three non-folding phones in the Pixel 10 line that are getting revealed on Aug. 20, we expect the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL to look similar to the Pixel 9 line on the outside. This includes the same rounded camera bar on the back. The entry-level Pixel 10 will get a brand new third rear camera. While we can see the third camera in the photos Google posted of the Pixel 10, according to a chart posted by known leaker Evan Blass, this will be a 10.8-megapixel telephoto camera that will join a 48-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 13-megapixel ultrawide. This will help the Pixel 10 compare better with the base Galaxy S25, which also has a telephoto camera.\n\nThe 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will continue to be differentiated from the standard Pixel 10 with a higher-specced camera system, which includes a 50-megapixel wide-angle, 48-megapixel ultrawide and a 48-megapixel telephoto, according to the same chart posted by Blass.\n\nThe colors for the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro phones also appear to have leaked, with Android Headlines reporting that the base Pixel 10 will come in Obsidian, Indigo, Frost and Lemonade editions. These names would roughly correspond to a black, blueish purple, light blue and yellow colors, respectively. The Pro models will also come in four colors, with Android Headlines reporting models named Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone and Jade. Those should roughly match up to black, white, gray and a light green. More photos of these phones were posted by Blass, purporting to be the Pixel 10 lineup from the front, back and side profiles\n\nDespite the concerns with tariffs, the Pixel 10 line is rumored to keep the same starting prices as the Pixel 9 line.\n\nThe Pixel 10 series could support magnetic accessories, making it one of the few Android phones that would work with many of the MagSafe accessories that were first built to work with Apple's iPhone. That's because the Pixel 10 is rumored to fully support Qi2 wireless charging, which supports magnetic alignment and has magnets built into the phone without needing a case.\n\nAn image posted by Blass appears to show a Pixel 10 with a circular wireless charger attached to the back, likely using magnets similar to how MagSafe works with the iPhone. If this is the case, it's a huge step for the Qi2 wireless standard, as the only other Android phone so far that supports magnetic accessories is the HMD Skyline.\n\nThis would allow the Pixel 10 series to natively work with magnetic phone chargers, wallets, mounts and other accessories. Google might also create its own branding for this feature, as an Android Authority report claims that official Pixel 10 accessories that magnetically attach would be called PixelSnap.\n\nIf this comes true, it would also make it easier to swap accessories between the iPhone and the Pixel. In addition to the iPhone's support for charging over USB-C, this would mean that MagSafe accessories first purchased to use with an iPhone should work just as well when swapping over to a Pixel 10 phone.\n\nFollowing last year's Tensor G4 chip in the Pixel 9 lineup, we presume that the Pixel 10 phones will be powered by a (supposedly named) Tensor G5 chip. We've heard a few Tensor G5 rumors, including that it will be made on an industry-standard 3nm process by chip fabricator TSMC, according to an Android Authority March report.\n\nOther rumors are less promising, like a July report from WCCFTech suggesting that while the Tensor G5 is a significant upgrade on last year's Tensor G4, a leaked benchmark test claims it will run slower than the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor that's used in Samsung's Galaxy S25 line and the OnePlus 13. That Qualcomm processor might also soon be surpassed by the next Qualcomm silicon coming at Snapdragon Summit in September. That's not to imply the phone itself will perform slowly, as the same report says it will run faster than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor that powers\n\nWhether the Tensor G5 lags behind other mobile chips isn't as worrying as it might seem, since the Tensor chips are built for Google's Pixel devices -- and those don't seem to be underperforming in daily use. As CNET Editor-at-Large Andy Lanxon said about the Tensor G4 powering the Pixel 9 Pro XL, \"On the one hand, it's disappointing not to see more of a tangible improvement over the predecessor. On the other hand, it doesn't feel like it's lacking in power in any major way.\"\n\nThere aren't many rumors pointing toward another Pixel Fold, but it's always possible that Google surprises us with a big reveal of another version of its foldable phone line. The most recent, last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold, not only switched up its nomenclature to fit into that year's standard Pixel lineup, but also altered its design from the wider passport-size original Pixel Fold to a taller, narrower format similar to other foldables like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\n\nOne Pixel 10 Pro Fold rumor from WCCFTech only shared details about the supposed Tensor chip powering it. But a recent rumor from Blass suggests we could expect the usual upgrades: a new Tensor G5 chip, perhaps slight spec upgrades and maybe even similar camera or battery upgrades if they are announced for the Pixel 10 lineup.\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold would presumably get Android 16 out of the box, but since that software upgrade has already been released early (mere weeks after Google I/O 2025), last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold already has that update anyway.\n\nWe'll keep updating this roundup as we get closer to Google's Aug. 20 event for the Pixel 10 series.",

      "text": "Pros\n- Genuinely fun new AI skills\n- Sleek new design\n- Seven years of software updates\n- Cameras can take great daytime shots\nCons\n- Camera hardware hasn't changed much over Pixel 8 Pro\n- Gemini AI will eventually require a paid monthly subscription\n- Launches with Android 14, not Android 15\nGoogle's latest Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL are packed with the best tech the company has to offer, sporting a shiny new design, a Tensor G4 processor, a triple rear camera and a wealth of clever AI tricks. From its conversational Gemini Live to its Pixel Studio generative AI image creator, the Pixel 9 Pro impressed me with its AI skills -- but they're not the main reasons to buy this phone.\nStrip away the AI sizzle and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, the model I've been testing, loses some of its shine, but there's more to like beyond the conversational Gemini Life and Pixel Studio image maker. The Pixel's cameras have given both the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the excellent Xiaomi 14 Ultra a good run for their money, delivering stunning images in a variety of conditions.\nThe refreshed design looks slick and polished, and I like that the Pro phone comes in two sizes: the 6.8-inch Pixel 9 Pro XL and a new smaller 6.3-inch Pixel 9 Pro. While the phones have different display and battery sizes, the processors, cameras and other features are identical. It's a smart move as it means those who want a smaller handset don't have to compromise on performance.\nThe addition of multiple sizes has allowed Google to strategically increase the price of its phones however. The base Pixel 9 Pro with its smaller screen starts at $999 (\u00a3999, AU$1,699) and sure, the Pixel 8 Pro started at $999 too, but the larger 9 Pro XL -- which is the equivalent to last year's model -- has been increased to $1,099 (1,099, AU$1,849). In my time testing the phone since its launch, I'm happy that it justifies that slight price bump.\nI should note that this review will be relevant for both the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL. If you're curious about Google's regular model you can read CNET's Pixel 9 review here.\nPixel 9 Pro: Two months of testing\nAfter pitting the phone's cameras against its main rivals, I'm genuinely impressed with what it can do. Against both the powerhouse iPhone 16 Pro and incredible Xiaomi 14 Ultra, the Pixel more than held its own, often delivering superb-looking images, with vibrant colors and great overall exposure. It even managed to produce more natural-looking colors than the iPhone in some scenarios, although I still frequently find its software processing to be too heavy handed, with some details being lost due to noise reduction and shadows being brightened to an unrealistic extent.\nWhile the Pixel launched -- and was originally reviewed -- with Android 14, it recently received an update to version 15. It doesn't change a whole lot (the interface remains identical), but it brings some additional security features including a theft protection mode to detect if your phone is snatched from your hand and Private Space which gives you a password-protected part of the phone to hide sensitive apps.\nThe biggest thing I've noticed about the phone though is how little I've used its AI features. Sure, I enjoyed playing around with Pixel Studio and Gemini Live for the review, but I've barely touched them since. It's not even that I don't like them, it's simply that I forget that they're there. For me, that simply proves that AI is yet to offer me any function so transformative that I have to make use of it in my life. Maybe I'll feel differently this time next year -- or in several years.\nIf, like me, you're on the fence about AI on your phone, then I don't think the Pixel will necessarily sway you one way or the other. But the tools certainly don't detract from what is an otherwise excellent phone.\nPixel 9 Pro: All about AI\nThe 8 Pro did have some AI skills, like object removal and Best Take, but it was just the beginning. If its predecessor was just Google dipping its toe in the AI water, the 9 Pro XL is Google doing a full triple somersault with a pike off the top diving board into the AI pool with its new skills.\nRead more: I Asked the Pixel 9 Pro's AI to Write a Review of Itself. Here's What it Said\nGoogle's Gemini Advanced is easily accessed by pressing and holding the power button while you ask it something. It's pretty good too, giving me genuinely sensible responses to my questions about putting glue in a cake (don't do it), what to do if you find a giraffe in your hallway (stay calm) or why you shouldn't make a car out of cheese. Apparently cheese lacks structural integrity. Now we know.\nUsing Gemini Advanced isn't the end of the features. You can also use Gemini Live, which allows you to talk with the AI in a much more natural way (as if you were having a conversation). The answers are essentially the same whichever mode you use, but with Live you can interrupt the flow to ask side questions or give intentionally stupid opinions on things just to see how it'll respond.\nI've spent a lot of time playing around with it and while it's certainly great fun, I've often found its information to be inaccurate. One time it recommended I listen to a song that simply doesn't exist. Another time I asked for top local drinking recommendations for me, and Gemini suggested a bar that closed years ago.\nThere are various other bugs and quirks I've found while testing, but it's a new feature. I'm keen to see how it matures and, crucially, whether I eventually find a genuine use for it in my day-to-day life.\nA Google spokesperson acknowledged to CNET that hallucinations are a known challenge with large language models. They said that Google has tools for double-checking answers. There's the \"Google it\" button, for example, which evaluates Gemini's answers using Google search when possible.\nKeep in mind, that Gemini Advanced and Live require a subscription to Google One's AI package, and while you do get a year free when you buy the Pixel 9 Pro, it'll eventually cost you $20 a month -- although you get 2TB of cloud storage thrown in too. Gemini services will also be available on other Android devices and possibly come to older Pixel phones via a feature drop, so the Pixel 9 series aren't the only phones you can use to access conversational AI.\nPixel 9 Pro: Generative AI and image editing\nThe new Add Me tool digitally adds you, the photographer, into group pictures so nobody gets left out. Here's how it works: You take a group shot of your friends and then hand the phone to one of them. Next, you move and stand in a space where nobody is while your friend takes another photo after which the phone blends the images together to put you in the picture alongside everyone else.\nIt actually works quite well and while it's definitely easier to ask a passerby to take the group shot for you, it's great for those times when nobody is around to help. Or, if you're a narcissist like me, you can simply use it to put yourself in the same image twice. It doesn't use generative AI, but instead relies on augmented reality to line the shots up and computational skills to blend the images together.\nRead more: The Weird and Wonderful Images We Got From Google's Pixel Studio\nA lot of the AI features are based on imagery. Use the Reimagine function to select parts of an image, type in a prompt and have Google's generative AI bring your idea to life. You can use it to replace backgrounds around a subject, add objects, change the sky to a sunset, add in a wolf lurking behind you (if that's what you're into) or create weird apocalyptic pirate scenes like the one below. You're only limited by your imagination -- a cliche, but one that's actually true in this case.\nThe Reframe tool uses generative AI to expand the canvas of an image or help you crop it in a more artistic way -- it'll even generate parts of the image that were cut off in the original. Samsung's Galaxy S24 line and other phones with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip can also do this.\nIf you don't want to take actual photos then you can play with Pixel Studio, which will simply generate an image in a variety of styles from your text prompts.\nHere, I asked for a fox peering into a wardrobe with ivy coming out. So far so good, but I iterated and asked for the wardrobe to be in a misty forest.\nThen I changed the style to anime, which looked adorable, and finally, I added an owl sitting on top. What scene isn't improved by adding an owl to it?\nIt took seconds to create these variations and I love the results. It can be hit and miss, with some results looking downright bizarre.\nWhen I asked it to write \"wish you were here,\" like a postcard, this is what it produced. It struggles to generate words and it can't yet produce images of people, but apparently, that feature will come later.\nWhat it can do is generate images of copyrighted and trademarked material like Pikachu and Mickey Mouse, so I'll be interested to see how Google handles the interest I suspect it will get from the likes of Disney, Nintendo and others.\nAll of these tools worked well in my review time so far. While the results aren't always perfect, I typically found I can get better results by simply asking the AI to have another go.\nThe bigger question I suppose is, do you actually need this? With the results often being somewhat weird-looking and the actual image quality and details being quite poor, the usefulness of this type of image generation right now seems limited. Perhaps for designers or other creatives wanting to simply play with ideas, it might have some long-term application but I suspect most people may find it little more than an intriguing novelty or simply an alternative to using clip art, like a poster for a church bake sale.\nPixel 9 Pro: New features and design\nThe 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a refreshed design with a new camera bar that's more of a pill-shaped island than a full strip, and the edges of the phone are now flat and polished rather than smoothly rounded. Personally, I think it looks great. I thought the Pixel 8 Pro looks a bit cartoony and childlike, but the Pixel 9 Pro looks classy all the way.\nThe base 9 Pro has a 6.3-inch display, the Pixel 9 Pro XL that I've been testing measures 6.8 inches. Want something that slides more easily into your jeans? Go for the smaller 9 Pro. Need a bit of extra screen real estate to enjoy games or movies on? Check out the 9 Pro XL.\nThe XL's display looks great, with vibrant colors and enough resolution to make tiny text and high-res videos look beautiful. It's bright enough for me to use comfortably under what passes for a sunny day in Edinburgh, although those of you in a brighter place like California might struggle a little more.\nPowering the phone and all its AI features is the latest Google-made Tensor G4 processor. On benchmarks it's nothing special, achieving similar scores to last year's base Galaxy S23 and only marginally better scores than the Pixel 8 Pro. On the one hand, it's disappointing not to see more of a tangible improvement over the predecessor. On the other hand, it doesn't feel like it's lacking in power in any major way. In everyday use, it feels quick and responsive, with games like Genshin Impact playing with smooth frame rates and AI image generation taking only a few seconds to process each time. Could it have more power? Sure. Would you really notice it? Probably not.\nWhile the phone launched with last year's Android 14 on board, it's now been updated to version 15 which brings deeper security features like Theft Protection, remote locking and Private Space for hiding certain apps from public view. The phone will get a generous seven years of software and security updates meaning that the Pixel 9 series will still be safe to use until at least 2031.\nPixel 9 Pro: Cameras\nThe cameras are one area where I had hoped to see some bigger improvements. There are all kinds of new software trickery, from the new generative AI tools to the Add Me function and an updated panorama mode, the camera hardware itself remains nearly unchanged from last year's model. The main camera's resolution, sensor size and aperture are the same, as is the resolution of both the ultrawide and telephoto cameras.\nI've spent the last few days walking miles and miles around Edinburgh, pitting the camera against the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra and against the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Overall, the Pixel put up a strong fight, delivering better low-light performance than the Xiaomi and better zoom performance than the iPhone. Many of the Pixel's images look superb, but I consistently found it suffers from very heavy-handed image processing that tries to brighten shadows to an unrealistic extent or simply adds too much digital sharpening.\nThe selfie camera is the one area that's seen a significant bump, going from 10.5 megapixels on the Pixel 8 Pro to a much more generous 42 megapixels. Unsurprisingly, selfies look good -- even if your hair doesn't. The Pixel's selfie camera gives a wide-angle view, making it easier to cram more friends into one shot, but I have found the image processing to apply a lot of sharpening to selfies, in some shots producing quite an unflattering texture on my face.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro can take great-looking images, with gorgeous exposures, perfect colors and tons of detail seen from all of its cameras. As an everyday-carry camera for quick, reliable snaps, it's superb.\nI've been impressed with many of the shots I've taken so far, with the cameras often producing more natural color tones than the iPhone 15 Pro Max and providing more detail than the iPhone when shooting at 5x zoom. The Pixel 8 Pro took great photos too and beyond some new AI tricks, the cameras haven't improved to a great extent. Night-time images can sometimes struggle, with some test shots showing overly blotchy dark areas, especially when using the ultrawide camera. I've found it generally outperforms the excellent Xiaomi 14 Ultra at night, especially when using the telephoto zoom lens.\nI've been disappointed with the Pixel's new panorama mode, which doesn't compete against the iPhone 15 Pro Max, 16 Pro or Xiaomi 14 Ultra, and the macro function delivers quite dull shots with poor details. You can shoot files in DNG raw format, the raw images look awful compared to the JPEG files and need a lot of work in Lightroom to make them passable. I found this to be the case on the Pixel 8 Pro, too, and I'm disappointed Google hasn't worked on this more since the last model.\nIt means that while the Pixel 9 Pro is great for the majority of casual photographers out there, the serious photographers among you might be better suited with some of its rivals. The Xiaomi 14 Ultra with its huge 1-inch type image sensor has absolutely astounded me with its image quality, while Apple's iPhone 16 Pro maintains its position as one of the best overall camera phones around. Both phones offer generally more natural-looking images without so much image processing, while also providing more scope for adjusting your images in post-production, making them more suited for passionate photographers.\nPixel 9 Pro: Should you buy it?\nThere's certainly a lot to like about the Pixel 9 Pro XL. I love the new design, the new AI skills are at least great fun to play around with. The cameras aren't much of a step up over the last model, but the phone can take great photos in a variety of conditions, often delivering better-looking shots than its biggest competitors. The Pixel's image generation and conversational Gemini Live are the main things setting the phones apart from the competition right now, and if those features leave you cold then you can probably look elsewhere.\nAI will only become more a part of all phones with Samsung expanding its Galaxy AI across its phone line and Apple launching Apple Intelligence for its newer iPhones. So whether you want AI on your phone or not will soon be a moot point -- you'll simply have to have it. The Pixel 9 Pro's combination of great design, slick software and solid cameras definitely make it a great handset to get your first true taste of AI on your phone.\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro specs vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel 9\n| Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | Google Pixel 8 Pro | Google Pixel 9 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.3-inch LTPO OLED; 2,856 x 1,280 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.8-inch LTPO OLED; 2,992 x 1,344 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.7-inch OLED; 3,120 x 1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424 x 1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 495 ppi | 486 ppi | 489 ppi | 422 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 6 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches | 6.4 x 3 x 0.3 inches | 6.4 x 3.0 x 0.3 inches | 6 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm | 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm | 162.6 x 76.5 x 8.8 mm | 152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 199g (7 oz.) | 221g (7.8 oz) | 213g (7.5 oz) | 198g (7 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) |\n| Front-facing camera | 42-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 10.5-megapixel | 10.5-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K |\n| Processor | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G3 | Google Tensor G4 |\n| RAM/storage | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 4,700 mAh | 5,060 mAh | 5,050 mAh | 4,700 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Under display | Under display | Under display | Under display |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | None |\n| Special features | Satellite SOS; 7 years of OS, security and Pixel feature drops; IP68 dust and water resistance; Video Boost with 8K Upscaling; Macro Focus on ultrawide; Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover glass; 3,000-nit peak brightness; 45W fast charging (charger not included); 15W wireless charging with Google Pixel Stand (second gen); 12W wireless Qi-charging; Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7; NFC; Bluetooth 5.3; dual-SIM (eSIM + nano SIM); Add Me; Best Take; Magic Eraser; Magic Editor | Satellite SOS; 7 years of OS, security and Pixel feature drops; IP68 dust and water resistance; Video Boost with 8K Upscaling; Macro Focus on ultrawide; Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover glass; 3,000-nit peak brightness; 45W fast charging (charger not included); 15W wireless charging with Google Pixel Stand (second gen); 12W wireless Qi-charging; Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7; NFC; Bluetooth 5.3; dual-SIM (eSIM + nano SIM); Add Me; Best Take; Magic Eraser; Magic Editor | 5G (Sub 6 and mmWave); VPN by Google One; 7 years of OS, security and Feature Drop updates; front-facing camera has autofocus; 13W Qi wireless charging; 30W wired charging; USB-3.2 speeds via USB-C; IP68 dust and water resistance; Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on front and back | Satellite SOS; 7 years of OS, security and Pixel feature drops; Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover glass; IP68 dust and water resistance; 2,700-nit peak brightness; 45W fast charging (charger not included); 15W wireless charging with Google Pixel Stand (second gen); 12W wireless Qi-charging; Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7; NFC; Bluetooth 5.3; dual-SIM (eSIM + nano SIM); Add Me; Best Take; Magic Eraser; Magic Editor |\n| US price starts at | $999 (128GB) | $1,099 (128GB) | $999 (128GB) | $799 (128GB) |\n| UK price starts at | Converts to \u00a3780 (128GB) | Converts to \u00a3860 (128GB) | \u00a3999 (128GB) | Converts to \u00a3640 (128GB) |\n| Australia price starts at | Converts to AU$1,510 (128GB) | Converts to AU$1,670 (128GB) | AU$1,699 (128GB) | Converts to AU$1,210 (128GB) |"

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nGoogle Pixel 10 might debut Qi 2 support and magnetic \u201cPixelsnap\u201d accessories\nJune 11, 2025\n- Google is working on an ecosystem of magnetic Qi 2.2 accessories for the Pixel 10 series under the \u201cPixelsnap\u201d name\n- Planned accessories include a magnetic charger, a charger with stand, and a \u201cRing Stand\u201d\n- The feature, combined with the Hub Mode, which might be coming to phones, could make the Pixel 10 a small smart display while charging, similar to iPhones with Standby Mode\nOne of the most requested features for smartphones right now is Qi 2 support with magnets. Even though Apple donated its MagSafe technology to the Wireless Power Consortium in early 2023, virtually no Android phones currently support it. It looks like Google\u2019s about to finally change that with the Google Pixel 10 series.\nAndroid Authority has viewed credible marketing materials intended for retailers that show that Google is working on a few magnetic Qi 2 accessories meant for the upcoming Pixel 10.\nYou\u2019re reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nIt seems like Google\u2019s planning to call its magnetic ecosystem \u201cPixelsnap\u201d. We learnt that there are at least three accessories apparently in the works:\n- Pixelsnap Charger\n- Pixelsnap Charger with Stand\n- Pixelsnap Ring Stand\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have any more details at this time, but the names already tell us something. The \u201cPixelsnap Charger\u201d is likely just a standard charger, similar to the basic MagSafe charger Apple offers. As for the two others, my guess is that the \u201cPixelsnap Ring Stand\u201d is simply an accessory to set your phone upright, and the \u201cPixelsnap Charger with Stand\u201d is a combination of the two.\nThe new stand is exciting, considering that Google is currently working to bring Hub Mode to phones. Combined with a Pixelsnap charger (or any Qi2-compatible charger, for that matter), Pixels would basically become little smart displays while charging, similar to iPhones with Apple\u2019s Standby Mode.\nI also decided to dig deeper and found evidence for the new charger in a trade database:\nSurprisingly, the entries directly mention that it\u2019s a Google wireless charger with Qi 2.2 and MPP (Magnetic Power Profile) \u2014 they are typically as vague as possible. I also learned that the charger is codenamed \u201cSTN4\u201d, and that it will come in two colors \u2014 \u201cRock Candy\u201d and \u201cMist\u201d. These likely aren\u2019t the final names \u2014 Google likes its codenames so much it even uses them for colors! \u201cRock Candy\u201d usually translates to a black color, and \u201cMist\u201d was the codename of the \u201cPorcelain\u201d Pixel 9 Pro Fold, so that gives us a hint that it will likely be off-white.\nAdditionally, I was able to confirm that the Pixelsnap project is associated with the Pixel 10 within Google. I also got confirmation that the upcoming phones will support Qi 2.2, with a \u201cConvenientPower CPS4041\u201d controller chip. In theory, that could mean support for up to 60W charging (as the chip supports it); however, it\u2019s up to Google to limit power as it wants.\nIf this turns out to be true, Pixelsnap will be one of Pixel 10\u2019s headline features. I\u2019m happy to see that \u2014 the Pixel Stand was a great concept, and I\u2019m glad Google\u2019s finally making a spiritual successor. It might also just make Pixel 10 a more universally beloved phone. Whatever the case, the Pixel 10 series is launching sometime in August.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/i-tested-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-its-slim-powerful-and-surprisingly-practical/",
      "text": "Pros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400 mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nSamsung has achieved quite a feat with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Yes, it's a spectacularly thin phone, but an even greater accomplishment is that using both the cover and main display on this book-style foldable finally feels like an almost perfect experience. Almost.\nI spent a week scrolling, snapping photos and texting on Samsung's new premium foldable, and it really was a \"feeling is believing\" experience. Because the Z Fold 7 is only 8.9mm thick when closed and 4.2mm when open, it's not clunky in either configuration. (For comparison, last year's Z Fold 6 was 12.1mm thick when closed and 5.6mm when open. That makes the new foldable phone just a bit thicker than the 7.2mm Galaxy S25 when closed.)\nThe generous 6.5-inch cover screen means I hardly feel the need to pry the phone open and use the more sprawling internal display \u2013 even though that's kind of the whole point. And snapping photos on this foldable doesn't feel like a compromise, thanks to an impressive triple camera system that includes a 200-megapixel sensor.\nBut there are still moments where the Z Fold 7 comes off as a work in progress. Formatting issues on the internal display occasionally persist, and the 4,400-mAh battery pales in comparison to what you'll find in other slim foldables, like the Oppo Find N5's 5,600-mAh capacity and the Huawei Mate X6's 5,110-mAh battery (not to mention the Z Fold 7's meager 25-watt charging). Samsung also dropped S Pen support with this device. Overall, though, the downsides are minimal.\nWhat's not so minimal is the Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag, up $100 from the starting price for last year's Z Fold 6. But Samsung's slim book-style offering strikes that sweet spot between a novel experience and a wonderfully ordinary one, at least most of the time.\nHow the Galaxy Z Fold 7 feels\nIn addition to being thin, the Z Fold 7 is also lightweight, especially for a foldable, at 215 grams. That's 3 grams lighter than the S25 Ultra, 12 grams lighter than the iPhone 16 Pro Max and 14 grams lighter than the Oppo Find N5. In my hand or pocket, the Z Fold 7 feels better than most flagship slate phones, which in itself is pretty extraordinary.\nI've tested a handful of phones that serve as great conversation starters, but the Z Fold 7 has definitely received the most attention. Pulling the phone out at a birthday party, I was met with gasps of, \"Woah, that's so thin,\" and my colleagues were in awe of how ordinary the phone looks when folded shut. I can comfortably use it while closed if I don't want to draw attention or cause a bit of commotion around me and pop it open.\nI ended up using the Z Fold 7's cover display about 70% of the time, and primarily for tasks like messaging, taking photos and scrolling through Instagram and TikTok. That 6.5-inch screen is one of the phone's most pleasing features because of how practical it is, and it is long overdue. Because the cover screen isn't awkwardly narrow, using the inside display is now less of a necessity and more of a choice. Switching from the cover display to the main one when opening the phone is seamless, and apps transfer without any hiccups.\nI opted for that wider 8-inch real estate when watching videos and multitasking, like texting while online shopping. It's neat that you can have up to three apps on screen at the same time, so I can have YouTube, my texts and my photo gallery pulled up simultaneously, because my brain isn't already overstimulated enough. The 2,600-nit peak brightness helps with viewing such a big screen outdoors, and Samsung's new tech also makes it easier to see the display while wearing polarized sunglasses. The crease is hardly visible when looking at the screen straight on, and there's not too much of a glare apart from when I'm under direct sunlight.\nThere were a handful of instances in which posts on Instagram and TikTok were weirdly cropped on that main screen, which was disappointing. But the majority of the content showed up the way it was supposed to. And while I appreciate that the inside display is 11% larger than the Z Fold 6's, typing can be a bit tricky on such a wide expanse, even with bigger hands and the split keyboard.\nA funny side effect of the Z Fold 7's sleekness is it can be a little tricky to, well, unfold. I kind of have to wedge my nail within the crevice to pry it open, and it's game over if you're wearing acrylics, as my colleague Alexandra Able confirmed (she did eventually get it open with some extra effort). But snapping the phone shut is so satisfying that it kind of makes up for it, at least in my book.\nA thin yet durable design\nThe Z Fold 7 helps to explain the existence of its skinny sibling, the Galaxy S25 Edge, which came out in May. The latter phone was a way for Samsung to show what it's capable of, even if the $1,100 device comes off as a bit frivolous. (I personally found the lighter phone to be a game changer, but it comes at a high price.) The Z Fold 7 gives that slim profile a purpose, turning a formerly bulky foldable into one that feels wonderfully ordinary where it counts.\nDespite how thin the Z Fold 7 is, it's nice and sturdy, with a Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 cover and a Victus 2 backing. That makes me feel better about refusing to slap on a case and add even a millimeter of thickness. I toted the Fold around New York City with the peace of mind that hopefully all would be well if it took a tumble (it didn't), and it made it through the chaos of JFK Airport unscathed (though I'm not sure I did). Back at home in San Francisco, I've been throwing it into my bag and carrying it while out and about without worrying too much about anything happening to it. So far, it hasn't sustained any scuffs or scratches.\nThe Fold 7's hinge has also gotten a makeover; it's thinner and lighter, according to Samsung, and the aluminum design makes it 10% stronger. I can't bend the phone, open or closed, even when applying considerable force. So you should be able to put it in your back pocket without folding it even further.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 camera\nWhat's not so thin is the Z Fold 7's camera bump. I like that it doesn't take up the expanse of the phone and is instead relegated to the left side of the device, but that definitely results in some wobbling when the phone is placed on a table, though there are some cases to help with that.\nThe triple camera system, headlined by the 200-megapixel main camera, delivers crisp, vibrant shots, defying the hardware compromises so many foldables have had to make over the years. There's also a 12-megapixel ultrawide and 10-megapixel telephoto camera, as well as a 10-megapixel selfie camera in the cover and main displays.\nPhotos on the Z Fold 7 are comparable to what you'll get shooting on the Galaxy S series, including the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nGenerative Edit isn't new, but Samsung says it's gotten better at seamlessly filling in the gaps after you remove people and objects from your photos. This is one of my favorite Galaxy features for making photobombers or anything cluttering your photo disappear. (Yes, I am ruthless with this tool.)\nAudio Eraser, which also isn't new, gets a designated button under videos in your gallery, so you can quickly tap to launch the feature. It uses AI to clean up background noises so you can focus on what you actually want to hear.\nAudio Eraser can now automatically detect what to tune out, like the crowd or the wind. I used the feature on a video of me talking to camera during Samsung's Unpacked evening event as the DJ was spinning and folks were chattering, and it did a good job reducing the sound of voices in the background, but it did warp my voice a bit. I'm sure it'll only get better with time, but it's neat to have even its current rudimentary capability.\nBattery life and performance\nI was worried Samsung would scale back the Z Fold 7's battery with a slimmer design, as it did with the S25 Edge. But the Fold 7 maintains the 4,400 mAh of last year's Z Fold 6. That's still notably less than the capacity on similar phones from Chinese companies like Huawei, Honor and Oppo, but I'm just glad the Fold's battery didn't take a hit. It also only features 25-watt wired charging (and 15-watt wireless charging), which is significantly less than its competitors.\nThe Z Fold 7 lasted me about a day and a half with my usual routine of scrolling through social media, checking emails, watching YouTube videos, texting, using Google Maps and taking photos. (You know, just your healthy daily dose of screen time.)\nIn CNET's 45-minute endurance test, which includes a combination of streaming, scrolling through social media, joining a video call and playing games on the inside screen, the Galaxy Z Fold 7's battery went from full to 93%. For comparison, in the same test, the Oppo Find N5 dropped to 95%, and Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold hit 96%.\nAnd in a 3-hour streaming test over Wi-Fi, in which I watched a YouTube video in full-screen mode at full brightness using the main screen, the Z Fold 7's battery dropped from 100% to 84%. Last year's Z Fold 6 reached 82% in the same test, so it's a welcome, if modest, improvement.\nWhen it was time to charge, the Z Fold 7 went from 0% to 42% in 30 minutes and reached full battery in about an hour and a half.\nThe Z Fold 7 comes with 12GB RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage, as well as 16GB of RAM with 1TB of storage. I tested the 256GB version.\nThe phone packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, powering the many Galaxy AI and Gemini features Samsung has been touting. It comes out of the box with Android 16 and One UI 8, and you'll get seven years of OS and security updates to help stretch your many, many dollars spent.\nBenchmark tests for the CPU in Geekbench 6 place the Z Fold 7 well above the full Galaxy S24 lineup. In a graphics test using 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme, the Z Fold 7 exceeded the performance of the iPhone 15 Pro, Galaxy S24 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nCheck out the graphs below for more specifics.\nFinal thoughts: Should you buy the Galaxy Z Fold 7?\nIt's a good sign when you become so used to a phone's design that you forget how extraordinary it really is. That's certainly been the case with the Z Fold 7.\nThis phone's thinness, paired with its wider cover screen, makes it feel wonderfully normal when closed, and the inside display has become my go-to way to watch movies and multitask. It's great that the camera and battery didn't end up being the trade-offs I was bracing myself for with that slimmer build, and the phone feels surprisingly durable. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before more companies take a page out of Samsung's book and slim down their phones, too. (Looking at you, Apple.)\nThe price of being fairly early to a trend comes at a high cost; $2,000 is tough to stomach. This continues Samsung's practice of raising prices on its Fold devices by $100 over the last few years. So it can be a difficult purchase to justify. But there are a handful of carrier deals that can help soften the blow.\nIf you're all about having a sleek device with the option of a bigger screen, and a solid camera is one of your top priorities, the Z Fold 7 could be the right fit for you. It has many of the same AI features you'll get on last year's Z Fold 6, along with some new additions and updates. And while battery life isn't as great as on some competitors' phones, it certainly gets the job done.\nBut make no mistake: the Z Fold 7's fresh, slim form factor steals the spotlight here, and makes using this book-style foldable truly feel like a novel experience.\nGalaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Z Fold 6 vs. Pixel 9 Pro Fold vs. Opp Find N5\n| Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 | Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold | Oppo Find N5 | |\n| Cover display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.5-inch AMOLED, 2,520x1,080p, 1-120Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch AMOLED; 2,376x968 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.62-inch OLED; 2,616 x 1,140 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Internal display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 8-inch AMOLED, 2,184x1,968p, 1-120Hz refresh rate | 7.6-inch AMOLED; 2,160x1,856 pixels;1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 8-inch OLED; 2,152x2,076 pixels, 1-120 Hz variable refresh rate (LTPO) | 8.12-inch OLED; 2,480 x 2,248 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | Cover: 422ppi; Internal display: 368ppi | Cover: 410 ppi; Internal: 374 ppi | Cover: 422 ppi; Internal: 373 ppi | Cover: 431 ppi; Internal: 412 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | Open: 5.63 x 6.24 x 0.17 inches; Closed: 2.87 x 6.24 x 0.35 inches | Open: 6.04x5.21 x0.22 in; Closed: 6.04x2.68x0.48 in | Open: 6.1x5.9x0.2 in; Closed: 6.1x3x0.4 in | Open: 6.3x5.77x0.16 in; Closed: 6.3x2.93x0.35 in |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | Open: 143.2 x 158.4 x 4.2mm; Closed: 72.8 x 158.4 x 8.9mm | Open: 153.5x132.5x5.6mm; Closed: 153.5x68.1x12.1mm | Open: 155.2x150.2x5.1 mm; Closed: 155.2x77.1x10.5 mm | Open: 160.87x146.58x4.21mm; Closed: 160.87x74.42x8.93mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 215g (7.58 oz.) | 239g (8.43 oz) | 257g (9.1 oz) | 229g (8.08 oz) |\n| Mobile software | Android 16 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 15 |\n| Cameras | 200-megapixel (main), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (telephoto), 10-megapixel (cover screen, selfie) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 48-megapixel (wide), 10.5-megapixel (ultrawide), 10.8-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (main), 8-megapixel (ultrawide), 50-megapixel (periscope telephoto) |\n| Internal screen camera | 10-megapixel | 4-megapixel (inner screen under-display); 10-megapixel (cover screen) | 10-megapixel (inner screen); 10-megapixel (cover screen) | 8-megapixel (inner screen); 8-megapixel (cover screen) |\n| Video capture | 8K at 30fps | 8K | 4K | 4K |\n| Processor | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Tensor G4 | Snapdragon 8 Elite |\n| RAM/storage | 12GB + 256GB, 12GB + 512GB, 16GB + 1TB | 12GB + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 256GB, 512GB | 16GB + 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | No | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 4,400 mAh | 4,400 mAh | 4,650 mAh | 5,600-mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Yes | Side | Side | Side |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | No | None | None | None |\n| Special features | One UI 8, 25W wired charging speed, Qi wireless charging, 2,600-nit peak brightness, Galaxy AI, NFC, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, IP48 water resistance | IP48 rating, 25W wired charging, wireless charging + powershare, 3x optical zoom (up to 10x digital and 30x Space Zoom with AI Super Resolution tech) | IPX8 rating, 7 years of OS, security and Pixel Drop updates, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, ultra wideband chip, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover and back glass, cover screen peek brightness 2,700 nits, internal screen peek brightness 2,700 nits, 45W wired fast charging (Charger not included), Qi-certified, free Google VPN, Super Res Zoom, Add Me, Face Unblur, Made You Look, Magic Editor, Magic Eraser, Best Take, Video Boost, | IPX9 rating, 80W fast wired charging, 50W wireless charging, nanocrystal glass cover display, anti-reflective film on inner display, cover screen peek brightness 2,450 nits, internal screen peek brightness 2,100 nits, LTPO OLED display |\n| US price starts at | $2,000 | $1,900 (256GB) | $1,799 (256GB) | $1,870 |\n| UK price starts at | \u00a31,799 | \u00a31,799 (256GB) | Converts to \u00a31,410 (256GB) | \u00a31,482 |\n| Australia price starts at | AU$2,899 | AU$2,749 (256GB) | Converts to AU$2,770 (256GB) | AU$2,930 |\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone CNET's reviews team tests is used in the real world.

We also check out the battery life by using it daily, as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances."

      "text": "There are five models in Apple's current iPhone 16 lineup, and we tested and reviewed them all. Each has a different appeal, depending on your needs and budget. The $829 iPhone 16 gets you new buttons for shortcuts, an additional camera and MagSafe. Then there's the $999 iPhone 16 Pro, which has a new camera and a bigger screen. The $599 iPhone 16E is the most affordable. It has the same chip as the iPhone 16, along with a single rear camera, but it lacks Apple's most notable features, like MagSafe charging. Please note that we expect the iPhone 17 series to be revealed in September. So it might be best to hold off on buying any new iPhone until then.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat's the best iPhone right now?\nThe best iPhone for most people is the $799 iPhone 16. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger, 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps.\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and creating summaries of messages and web pages. There's also ChatGPT integration with Siri. The phones have an Action button, too, which can be programmed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at.\nBest iPhones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings\n- Photographic Styles makes photos pop\n- Ultrawide camera is better in low light\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t out yet\n- No always on display\n- No changes to wired charging speeds\n- No upgrades to the Action button\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.\nWho it's best for\nWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don\u2019t need the Pro\u2019s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won\u2019t disappoint.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.\nPros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $1,000\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.\nThe phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.\nWhy we like it\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech.\nPros\n- Does most of the Apple stuff I want\n- Battery life is great\n- Matte finish back\n- The rear camera is good\n- A18 chip performance\nCons\n- $599 price isn't cheap\n- Odd value proposition\n- Lacks MagSafe\n- Screen is good, but wonder how it will age\nApple took a Taco Bell-like approach with the $599 iPhone 16E, mixing and matching parts and features from prior phones to create a \"new\" iPhone. Its design and screen are similar to the iPhone 14. Its A18 processor is the same as the one in the iPhone 16. In my testing, I found that this gives the iPhone 16E a weird value proposition. It's new, but it's old. It's affordable, but not cheap.\nIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters. I do recommend looking into carrier deals, discounts and trade-ins to drop that price a bit, unless you're set on doing an installment plan over a couple of years. Read our iPhone 16E review.\nWhy we like it\nAfter testing the iPhone 16E, I was most surprised by how wonderfully uneventful it was to use. Along with all the standard iOS 18 functions and goodies, like iMessage and FaceTime, I used Apple Intelligence, made calls on 5G, took a bunch of share-worthy photos and videos and played video games like Resident Evil 4. If this is all you want in an iPhone, look no further.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're rocking an iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 or older, the 16E will be a nice upgrade in every way, from the camera to the day plus battery life -- though you might miss that ultrawide camera. I also think that this is a good phone for people using Android phones who want to switch and dip the proverbial toe into Apple's waters.\nWho shouldn't get it\nChoosing between the $829 iPhone 16 and the $599 16E is a tough choice. If you have the budget, I'd go with the regular 16. You get a brighter screen, MagSafe, and an ultrawide camera that doubles as a macro lens -- great for taking close-up photos like of food since the main camera automatically switches to a cropped version of the ultrawide in order to nail focus.\nPros\n- USB-C port is more convenient charging\n- Colorful matte design\n- Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\n- Dynamic Island brings better multitasking\nCons\n- No always-on display\n- Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\n- Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\n- Galaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.\nThe iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone.\nWho it's best for\nThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.\nWho shouldn't get it\nApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy.\nThe iPhone 16 is the recipient of a CNET Editors' Choice award, and you can get one for free when you switch to T-Mobile. You just need to sign up for a qualified Experience Beyond Plan with up to four lines. There's no trade-in required, and T-Mobile will pay off your current eligible phone, up to $800, via a prepaid Mastercard. It\u2019s never been easier to switch. (New line and port-in are required, and a $10 device activation charge applies.)\nBest iPhone models compared\n| Product | Apple iPhone 16 | Apple iPhone 16 Plus | Apple iPhone 16E | Apple iPhone 16 Pro | Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max | Apple iPhone 15 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556 x 1,179 pixel resolution; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.7-inch OLED; 2,796 x 1,290 pixel resolution; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED display; 2,532x1,170 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz adapative refresh rate | 6.9-inch OLED; 2,868 x 1,320 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz adapative refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556x1,179 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 6.33 x 3.06 x 0.31 inches | 5.78 x 2.82 x 0.31 in. | 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches | 6.42 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches | 2.82x5.81x0.31 inches |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 160.9 x 77.8 x 7.8mm | 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.8 mm | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm | 163 x 77.6 x 8.25mm | 71.6x147.6x7.8 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 170 g (6 oz.) | 199 g (7.03 oz.) | 167g (5.88 oz.) | 199 g (7.03 oz.) | 227 g, (7.99 oz.) | 171g (6.02 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 17 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 5x telephoto | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 5x telephoto | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K |\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Apple A18 | Apple A18 | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A16 Bionic |\n| RAM + storage | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM unknown + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | RAM N/A + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) |\n| Battery | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

The $599 price is more than Apple's previous cheap phone, the $429 iPhone SE, but it has a similar appeal especially for those currently on an older iPhone.\nFactors to consider when buying a new iPhone\nHold the iPhone first: You may love or hate the way it looks and feels in person.\nDon't discount the last year's model: Apple has a history of keeping recent iPhone models from previous years around at a lower price. You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a new iPhone 16 can do for a fraction of the price. The iPhone 15 packs a great camera and a big battery, but comes at a more reasonable price.\nBuy an iPhone case and screen protector: You'll protect your iPhone from costly damage, and will increase the phone's resale or trade-in value for when you're ready to move on.\nKnow what you care about most: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? Phones like the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max, for example, pack incredible cameras that almost rival the quality you'd get from a DSLR. If you're a photographer, then spending money here is a good idea.\nSeek out holiday discounts: Look for deep discounts and promo deals around major holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday. And find out what your grace period is in case you need a quick return or exchange.\nHow we test iPhone models\nWe test every iPhone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new iOS updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for the iPhone, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K 120fps slow-mo video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long the iPhone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test and a 45-minute drain test starting with a full battery, which isn't always included in the initial review and added later in an update.\nPerformance measuring\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos and videos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of the iPhone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models. Some of these tests are added later in updates after the initial review is published.\nRead more: How CNET Tests Phones\nOther iPhones we tested\nWhile Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review.\nKey terms\neSIM\nAn eSIM takes all of the important information about your phone account -- including its number, wireless carrier and subscription -- and stores it in software instead of on a physical SIM card.\nWith the iPhone 14, 15 and 16 series Apple removed the physical SIM card tray and embraced embedded SIM cards in the US. This means you can't just pluck your SIM card out of your current phone and put it into a new one. But this shouldn't affect your experience since all the major US carriers and a number of smaller operators work with eSIM.\nApple has long supported eSIM, dating back to 2018's iPhone XS, XS Max and XR. When setting up a new iPhone 14, 15 or 16, tthe device will guide you through transferring your current provider over to the new phone. A list of supported wireless networks can be found on Apple's website.\niOS 18\nApple's iOS 18 is the latest iPhone software version. It's on the iPhone 16 by default and is also available as an update for the iPhone XR and later. iOS 18 includes new features such as being able to move apps anywhere on your home screen, change an app icon's color and a size, add buttons to Control Center, use emoji and live photo stickers as Tapbacks in Messages, support for RCS in messages and eventually Apple Intelligence on some models.\niPhone FAQs\nWhen is the best time of year to buy a new iPhone?\niPhone or Android?\nShould I wait for the new iPhone model (iPhone 17)?\nHow reliable is an iPhone?\nHow long does an iPhone last?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nThere's already been plenty of buzz about what we could see with the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 17 -- from a slimmer version of the upcoming device to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on baseline models. The camera module could also get a makeover, and reports suggest Apple will overhaul the look and feel of its software with the launch of iOS 19. Apple doesn't release details on future products, but to get an idea of what to expect, we rounded up rumors, leaks and analysis on the iPhone 17 Air (one of several nicknames for Apple's next iPhone). Read CNET's iPhone 17 rumor roundup for more info."

      "text": "Google is planning on releasing the Pixel 10 next month in some pretty bright colors, as we shared in the Pixel 10 renders yesterday. But as is typically the case with smartphone makers, the Pixel 10 Pro is getting a bit more boring colors. The Pixel 10 Pro will be available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade colorways this year, and here\u2019s your first official look.\nThe Obsidian is, of course, the black version, with porcelain being the white version of the Pixel 10 Pro. The Moonstone color is a sort of slate blue with a little bit of gray. It\u2019s a really nice looking color, though it does pale in comparison to the Indigo and Frost colors of the Pixel 10. Then there\u2019s the Jade color. This is a soft pistachio green color, with a warm gold trim that actually looks really good. And a bit surprising to see a bright color like this on the \u201cPro\u201d model.\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro will be unveiled on August 20\nGoogle has already sent out invites for its August 20 event in New York City, and has also pretty much confirmed the Pixel 10 is coming with a new teaser on the Google Store. That teaser did showcase the Moonstone color of the Pixel 10 Pro (or possibly Pixel 10 Pro XL).\nAs we\u2019ve reported already, the Pixel 10 series will be available for pre-order that same day, with devices shipping by August 28.\nFor the Pixel 10 Pro, we\u2019re looking at some pretty minor changes internally. The Pixel 10 Pro specs include the Tensor G5 processor, 16GB of RAM, 128GB/256/512GB of storage, and a 4,870mAh capacity battery. That is actually smaller than the Pixel 10, despite it having the same physical size. This is because the Pixel 10 does not have a vapor chamber, while the Pixel 10 Pro does.\nIt is also sticking with its 6.3-inch display, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL will stick with its 6.8-inch display. The hype is real for the Pixel 10 series, and we have just a few more weeks to go until the unveiling."

      "text": "Pros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life\n- More AI features feel practical\nCons\n- Still some stray gimmicky AI features\n- Not many changes over the S24\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance\nCons\n- Battery life is similar to the baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25, at a higher price\n- Better cameras on other phones at the same price\nSamsung's mantra when debuting the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus appears to have been, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" as this year's phones share a striking resemblance to last year's S24 and S24 Plus. But what the new phones lack in innovation, they make up for in consistency and practicality.\nWhile I found myself warming up to (most of) the AI upgrades separating the S25 and S25 Plus from their predecessors, there are other time-tested attributes that remain more important to me \u2013 namely, cameras and battery life. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I grew to like certain AI-powered features after using the phones for a week.\nFor instance, there's a new tool called AI Select that looks at your phone's screen and suggests actions like summarizing or translating text. Also, the Gallery app can find a picture you're looking for with more conversational search terms, and Audio Eraser can clean up distracting background noises in your videos.\nGoogle's Gemini has been further baked into the Galaxy's interface and can be summoned with a long press of the side power button to answer questions and carry out tasks as your assistant.\nAt a time when major phone releases are as high-stakes as ever, Samsung tries to set the $800 Galaxy S25 and $1,000 Galaxy S25 Plus apart by leaning into what's new (AI), as well as the familiar (good cameras and battery life). And I am definitely impressed.\nGalaxy S25 and S25 Plus: Look and feel\nSo what's the difference between the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus? Not much. Other than the Plus being, well, bigger than the baseline model.\nThe phones both have AMOLED displays with 120Hz adaptive refresh rates, with the S25's measuring 6.2 inches and the S25 Plus clocking in at 6.7 inches. At 162 and 190 grams respectively, the S25 and S25 Plus feel light in hand, thanks to their aluminum frames. The screens are covered in Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the matte glass backs offer an elegant touch and premium feel.\nI (hesitantly) dunked the S25 Plus into a shallow pool at Filoli Historic House & Garden near San Francisco during testing and am happy to report it survived unscathed. This shouldn't come as a surprise, since both the S25 and S25 Plus have an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning they can survive being submerged for 30 minutes under 1.5 meters of water (or about 5 feet).\nThe phones come in navy, icy blue, mint and silver shadow, as well as the online-exclusive colors blue black, coral red and pink gold. I absolutely adore the icy blue color of the S25 I've been using, and the Plus I have in navy also looks nice and rich.\nThe S25 and S25 Plus arrive with Android 15 and Samsung's One UI 7. And similar to the Pixel 9 series, you'll get seven years of OS and security updates, helping you get the most bang for your buck (and there's certainly a lot of buck involved here). The phones are powered by a custom-built Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, helping to bring those many, many AI features to life.\nThe best thing about AI is that I hardly notice it\nI'm not alone in feeling severe AI fatigue. As someone who tends to be AI-averse (do I really need it to write my emails, brainstorm ideas or summarize a PDF?), I tend to be wary of AI-heavy announcements like the one Samsung had at its Galaxy Unpacked event in January.\nOnce I got my hands on the devices, I put my skepticism aside and was surprised.\nAfter a few days, I found myself leaning on Gemini for help with everything from tweaking email settings (this was faster than Googling and reading), caring for my wood cutting board, and finding events and sending corresponding texts via a single voice command.\nUltimately, it's the AI features that operate discreetly that won me over, like Circle to Search. This is a Google-powered feature that came out last year and lets you circle anything on your screen to quickly see product information and links. Now, Circle to Search can recognize a song playing in the background of a video or even a tune you hum or sing, and I had a lot of fun testing this out. When I hummed niche Taylor Swift songs like I Hate It Here and Foolish One, it nailed both. (Step aside, Shazam.) To be fair, I'm not sure how often I'll use this particular aspect of Circle to Search, but the tool as a whole remains impressive.\nThe AI Select tool also served me well, but primarily for translating text. My Spanish vocab has (sadly) gotten rusty since high school. So when I came across an email in Spanish, I tapped the tool on the right-hand side of the screen, circled the text I wanted to translate and within a couple taps, it was quickly transformed into English (and hopefully, accurately).\nNot all AI features are a home run, though. Portrait Studio, which uses AI to create stylized portraits (kind of like caricatures an artist might sketch of you at the beach or on a boardwalk), is fun to play with but feels like a novelty. It did an admittedly great job replicating details like my hijab, eye shape and smile. But I'm not sure how useful a tool like this is in the long run. Similarly, Drawing Assist, which turns your sketches into different stylized illustrations, is impressive at transforming my crappy drawings into pleasing images. I don't have any real use for this tool, as I'm not going to be framing these random images of cats and flowers.\nThe biggest disappointment, so far, has been the Now Brief. This is designed to learn your habits \u2013 like if you usually check the weather, read the news and consult your calendar each morning \u2013 then surface any relevant suggestions to simplify those routines. In the week I used these phones, the only time I was even slightly impressed with this feature was when it showed a highlight of the images I'd taken that day. But otherwise, Now Brief simply lists the weather, my events that day and articles that are irrelevant 90% of the time. That's not to say it won't eventually learn more about me and get better, but it hasn't proven its value just yet.\nPhotos and videos are even better with AI\nThe Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus share the same camera specs as last year's series: a 50-megapixel wide camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera. They also both share a 12-megapixel front-facing camera. So you'll get the same kinds of images on both the S25 and S25 Plus.\nI've always admired the punchy colors in Galaxy S photos, and the S25 and S25 Plus were no exception. Here are a few of my favorite shots.\nThis is one of the best examples of how each shade of color, from pale pinks to vibrant reds, pop. There's so much texture in this image below, from the ripples on the water to the droplets on the petals, and the background maintains just enough detail and color without robbing the spotlight.\nPortrait mode on the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus is perhaps the most impressive I've seen, as it does the best job of knowing what to keep in sharp focus and what to blur. Even in this picture below of my (dying) tulips, each leaf and petal remains clearly in the foreground and isn't lost to background blur.\nPortrait mode isn't perfect, of course, as some of the many branches in this shot do get the undesired blur effect. But it's such a minor detail that hopefully all you'll notice is how well the flowers on the table pop.\nThe improvements over previous Galaxy S devices come in the form of \u2013 yes, AI. Generative Edit debuted on the S24 series, but is now processed on device, allowing you to quickly and easily remove photobombers or objects cluttering your image. I tried this out with both people and objects and was blown away each time. Generative Edit did a seamless job filling in backgrounds (sometimes even generating new graffiti patterns, as seen below when I removed a railing).\nOne downside, though an upside for transparency, is that there's a label on images that have benefitted from Generative Edit disclosing that this is \"AI-generated content.\" I understand the importance of this, especially as AI gets better at fooling people, but object removal features are nothing new to photography.\nSamsung introduced a Virtual Aperture tool that mimics a standalone camera's f-stops, using the separate Expert RAW app. If you're a pro photographer, I can see this being a cool feature to have. But as someone who likes things plain and simple, I'm going to stick with the camera's built-in Portrait mode so that factors like background blur and lighting are sorted out for me.\nAnother AI-related boost comes in the form of nighttime videos. I was impressed with how rich the dark sky looks in videos I recorded and with how smooth the motion appears as I panned the camera. Daytime videos also looked solid.\nPhotos at night were splendid, with rich contrast and saturation.\nNight mode also did a great job of brightening up this image to almost make it look as if it were taken in the daytime, and not at 7 p.m.\nSelfies maintain the smoothing effect I so love on Galaxy S phones, while maintaining vibrancy and crispness in the foreground and background.\nBattery life and performance\nBattery capacity is one of the few factors separating the phones, with the S25 sporting a 4,000-mAh battery and the Plus packing a 4,900-mAh battery.\nBoth phones lasted about a day and a half with regular use. In CNET's 45-minute endurance test, which involves a combination of streaming, scrolling through social media, joining a video call and playing games, the S25's battery dropped from full to 93% (the same as last year's S24), while the battery on the S25 Plus dropped to 94%.\nIn a longer, 3-hour streaming test over Wi-Fi, in which I watched a YouTube video in full-screen mode at full brightness, the S25 dropped from 100% to 85%, while the S25 Plus dropped to 86%.\nYouTube streaming battery test\n| Phone | After 1 hour | After 2 hours | After 3 hours |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Galaxy S25 | 96% | 90% | 85% |\n| Galaxy S25 Plus | 96% | 91% | 86% |\n| Galaxy S24 FE | 96% | 90% | 83% |\n| Galaxy S24 | 97% | 91% | 86% |\n| Galaxy S24 Plus | 97% | 91% | 87% |\nHigher percentages are better.\nThe S25 supports 25-watt charging, while the S25 Plus supports 45-watt charging. In a 30-minute test using a 30-watt charger, the S25 went from 0% to 47%, and reached 100% in 80 minutes. In the same test using a 45-watt charger, the S25 Plus went from 0% to 63% in 30 minutes, and reached a full charge in 70 minutes. For comparison, in last year's test, the S24 went from 0% to 51% in 30 minutes, and the S24 Plus went from 0% to 50%.\nThe Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus also support 15-watt wireless charging, which is the same as what you'll get with Qi2. You can use Samsung's own case with the Qi2 magnetic profile or a compatible third-party case to tap into those wireless capabilities.\nBenchmark tests for the CPU in Geekbench 6 place the S25 and S25 Plus well above the entire Galaxy S24 lineup. In a graphics test using 3D Mark's Wild Life Extreme, the S25 and S25 Plus exceeded the performance of the iPhone 16 Pro, Galaxy S24 and S24 Ultra.\nCheck out the graphs below for more specifics.\nFinal thoughts: Which phone to buy, the S25 or S25 Plus?\nPerhaps the highest praise I can give to a phone in 2025 is that there was just enough AI to not make me go crazy. The S25 and S25 Plus have their fair share of AI-powered features, but for the most part, there are only several that I can see myself willingly using. Others like Portrait Studio and Drawing Assist may be fun for keynote demos, but don't seem to serve a real purpose beyond that. (But it wouldn't be a Galaxy phone without a flashy feature no one uses, right??)\nThankfully, the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus continue to deliver on what, to me, makes the Galaxy S series notable: good cameras, solid battery life and a seamless interface.\nBecause there are so many similarities between the S25 and S25 Plus, and the higher battery capacity on the Plus didn't result in any startling differences (although superfast charging is great), I'd personally save some money and just go with the baseline S25. If you want a bigger phone, it might be worth going a full step up with the S25 Ultra, so you could take advantage of added perks like that 50-megapixel ultrawide lens, but that costs $500 more than the regular S25. Still, the S25 and S25 Plus share many similarities with the Ultra, including Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 12GB RAM and AI features, so you'll be getting a relatively good value from that baseline model.\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 or older, switching to the S25 or S25 Plus could be a significant upgrade. If you have an S23, you can benefit from improved battery life and dip your toes into Samsung's newer AI waters. But if you're rocking an S24, there's no reason to pay for relatively modest upgrades.\nUltimately, the S25 and S25 are much the same as what we've seen before. But that isn't such a bad thing, when \"the same\" largely still does the trick.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 specs vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24 Plus\n| Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S24 | Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus | |\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 416 ppi | 509 ppi | 416 ppi | 509 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in. | 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in. | 5.79 x 2.78 x 0.3 in. | 6.24 x 3 x 0.3 in. |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm | 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm | 147 x 71 x 7.6 mm | 158 x 76 x 7.6 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 162 g (5.71 oz.) | 190 g (6.70 oz.) | 168g (5.93 oz.) | 197g (6.95 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 14 | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 8K | 8K | 8K | 8K |\n| Processor | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 |\n| RAM + storage | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 8GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 4,000 mAh | 4,900 mAh | 4,000 mAh | 4,900 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Under display | Under display | Under display | Under display |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | None |\n| Special features | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7 | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7; ultrawideband | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 6E | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 45W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 6E |\n| US price starts at | $800 (128GB) | $1,000 (256GB) | $800 (128GB) | $1,000 (256GB) |\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances."

      "text": "Google\u2019s entire Pixel 10 lineup will be treated to the Tensor G5, and looking at the latest benchmark leak, we should witness a hefty performance improvement over the Tensor G4, in part due to the newer SoC being mass produced by TSMC instead of Samsung. The chipset was recently tested in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and according to the newest comparison, there is a 36 percent compute difference compared to Google\u2019s current flagship silicon.\nThe latest scores also show that the Tensor G5 is slightly faster than Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, meaning that it will continue to trail behind the current competition\nThe single-core and multi-core results of the Tensor G5 are impressive, but the disappointing aspect of the chipset is that despite switching foundry partners, the overall performance is an entire generation behind the Snapdragon 8 Elite, Dimensity 9400, Dimensity 9400+, A18 and A18 Pro, with the lead no doubt increasing when Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2, Dimensity 9500, A19 and A19 Pro arrive.\nComing to the scores, the Tensor G5 obtains 2,276 and 6,175 points in the single-threaded and multi-threaded tests, respectively, making it up to 36 percent faster than the Tensor G4. The CPU cluster of the Tensor G5 is \u20181 + 5 + 2,\u2019 and despite sporting just a single high-performance core, Google does deliver some impressive performance gains over a single generation. With these gains, it is evident that there is an incredible advantage over using TSMC\u2019s second-generation 3nm process, and it will be an exciting 2026 because Google will reportedly switch to the Taiwanese semiconductor giant\u2019s 2nm technology for the Tensor G6.\nOther specifications of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold include 16GB of RAM, with the flagship running Android 16. While Google has made performance strides with the Tensor G5, some part of us is still disappointed that the SoC does not present any competition for other chipsets. Then again, during the Pixel 9 announcement, Soniya Jobanputra, who is a key member of Google\u2019s Pixel product management team, spoke last year that the Tensor G4 was not designed to break any benchmark records, but was made to improve the user experience and address various pain points.\nAssuming that the Pixel 10 series, equipped with the Tensor G5, can deliver an experience similar to premium devices powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 and Dimensity 9500, then the price will be justified. Otherwise, buyers are recommended to wait a while before those attractive discounts come pouring in."

      "text": "Pros\n- Large cover screen is great\n- Thin design for a foldable\n- There's no gap when the device is shut\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Thick bezels on the inner screen\n- Some apps are not optimized for the internal display\n- Drag and drop functionality can be finicky\nOver the last four years, phone-makers like Samsung, Huawei and Oppo have tried to perfect making a tablet that folds down into a phone and fits in your pocket. Now, it's Google's turn with the Pixel Fold, which starts at $1,799 (\u00a31,749) and ships on June 27.\nWith its first foldable phone, Google manages to avoid some of the pitfalls we've seen in early models from other companies. It looks almost like a regular phone when closed, making the Pixel Fold more usable in \"phone mode\" than the taller and skinnier Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. The cameras on the Pixel Fold are also top-notch, meaning you don't have to sacrifice photo quality to get a foldable screen. That's one area where Microsoft's foldable phone, the Surface Duo, notably fell short.\nBut after using it for a few days, there's one major problem Google hasn't solved. It hasn't answered the overarching question of why foldables should exist in the first place. Having a giant screen in your pocket can be useful, but is it $1,799 useful? That's more than the average monthly mortgage payment in, for example, Ohio or Indiana, according to a study from LendingTree.\nGoogle isn't alone; Samsung's phone-tablet hybrid costs the same. But it just reiterates that foldable phones like the Pixel Fold still lack broad appeal. Until companies like Google and Samsung can get the price down, tablet-size foldables are likely to remain a niche.\nBut that doesn't mean the Pixel Fold doesn't have promise.\nIt can fold completely shut\nThe Pixel Fold has a wider shape than the Galaxy Z Fold 4, making it look more like a passport or a Moleskine notebook than Samsung's phone. It's more comparable to the Oppo Find N than Samsung's foldable in terms of its overall appearance. It also resembles Microsoft's Surface Duo, although that phone consists of two screens joined together rather than one foldable display.\nThe Pixel Fold shuts completely without a gap, unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 4, which has a space near its hinge. This gives the Pixel Fold a sleeker look when closed, although both the Z Fold 4 and Pixel Fold have the same IPX8 durability rating. That means they should be able to withstand some immersion in water even if neither are considered dust proof or waterproof.\nThe camera bar on the Pixel Fold doesn't protrude as prominently as the Galaxy Z Fold's, which enables it to rest on tables and surfaces without wobbling when closed.\nBut be warned; the Pixel Fold is still a cumbersome phone. The wide cover screen definitely works in the Pixel Fold's favor (more on that below), but it also means you may struggle to use it with one hand.\nIts giant front screen is a big deal\nOne of the biggest drawbacks with foldable phones is the learning curve. Their thickness and unusual shape can make the switch from a standard phone to a foldable device feel jarring. Luckily, the Pixel Fold's wide cover screen makes the transition a little easier.\nDon't get me wrong, there's still a lot to get used to. But having an external display that's similar in shape to the screen on a regular, nonfoldable phone goes a long way toward making apps and settings menus feel more natural. That's especially true when it comes to typing; using the keyboard on the Galaxy Z Fold 4's cover screen felt cramped by comparison.\nThe Pixel Fold's 5.8-inch external screen also makes it much more useful as a video player. Even though it's technically smaller than the Galaxy Z Fold 4's 6.2-inch cover screen, the Pixel Fold's proportions feel more suitable for video compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 4's elongated display.\nThat goes for the interior display, too. The Pixel Fold has a feature called Tabletop mode, which as the name implies adjusts the software accordingly when opening the phone like a laptop. It's similar to Samsung's Flex mode, which shifts an app to the top portion of the screen when folded halfway.\nMany apps aren't supported yet, but thankfully some streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus and Hulu work in this mode. Google Meet also works in Tabletop mode, so you can take video calls without having to hold up your device. This worked effortlessly: When calling a colleague over Google Meet, the app conformed to fit the display as soon as I bent the phone halfway. However, the internal camera's location makes it difficult to position the Pixel Fold at an angle that doesn't feel awkward for video calls in this mode.\nThe downside to Tabletop mode is that the Pixel Fold can be challenging to operate in this position. I usually find it easier to pick up the Pixel Fold and either close it or open it fully to switch apps or play another video. This makes me appreciate the touchpad mode Samsung added to its foldables last year, which lets you turn the bottom portion of the screen into a trackpad so that you can more easily manipulate apps running on the other half of the display.\nWhile I prefer the Pixel Fold's shape, Samsung's phone has the upper hand when it comes to the interior screen in other ways. Colors tend to pop more on the Galaxy Z Fold's 7.6-inch AMOLED display, and the thinner bezel gives it a sleeker look overall. The Pixel Fold does have a noticeable crease running down the middle of the screen when opened. It's visually similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 4's, but feels a bit flatter to the touch compared to Samsung's.\nIts software is all about multitasking\nGoogle is positioning the Pixel Fold as a multitasking machine, and it's easy to see why given its giant interior display. You can use apps in split-screen mode and drag and drop content between apps. Google only allows you to open two apps at once, while you can cover the Z Fold 4's internal display with up to four apps.\nSome might find that to be a drawback, but I personally don't open more than two apps at a time in everyday use. On a phone like the Pixel Fold or Galaxy Z Fold 4, I prefer dedicating that entire inner display to one app so that I can get a more immersive view.\nThere were times when split-screen mode came in handy. I had to reset a password to one of my app accounts, and I loved being able to quickly pull up Gmail for my login code without having to jump between apps. It's also nice being able to keep an eye on Slack while I'm doing something else on my phone, like listening to Spotify, browsing email or scrolling through social media.\nBut the Pixel Fold is missing an important feature that Samsung offers: the ability to pin apps together so that you can launch them in split-screen mode in one tap. The Pixel Fold will keep apps paired while they're open, but there's no way to keep it that way for future use.\nAs is the case with the Galaxy Z Fold 4, you can also drag and drop content between apps on the Pixel Fold when using split-screen mode. This worked well when I moved a picture from Google Photos to a text message in the Messages app and an email in Gmail. But there were times when it took a couple of tries to successfully drag a YouTube clip to Messages. Given that foldables already have enough of a learning curve, I hope this gets sorted out shortly.\nEven when they function at their best, I don't think split-screen apps are compelling enough to convince someone to buy a foldable phone. I'm so accustomed to switching between apps on the single-screen phones that operating a multi-app mode requires me to think about apps in a different way. Returning to the home screen or app switcher to hop between apps feels instinctual at this point. It's hard to break a decade-plus long habit, as I imagine it will be for others switching to their first foldable phone. That's not specific to the Pixel Fold, but perhaps it's telling of why foldable phones are taking so long to gain widespread popularity.\nIt's also worth noting that many apps look tiny on the Pixel Fold's inner screen. While big names like Netflix, TikTok, Calm, Slack, Discord, Outlook, WhatsApp, Roblox, Amazon and Candy Crush Soda Saga fill up the Pixel Fold's big display, some equally popular apps like Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, Uber, Candy Crush Saga and Seamless look like floating windows in the center of the screen. (These apps run in a full-screen view on the Galaxy Z Fold 4, by the way.) For the most part, apps transitioned between the front and inner screen without issue. There was one instance when Discord didn't conform when moving between the tablet-size inner display and the cover screen, but it worked properly the next time I used the app.\nWhat I'm looking forward to the most, however, is seeing how the front and interior screen work together in the future. When Google unveiled the Pixel Fold, it demonstrated a feature called dual screen interpreter mode, which enables the front and inner screens to work simultaneously during language translation. The app would show translations on both sides of the phone so that the participants could see each other's words in their preferred language on screen. Since this feature is coming in Android 14, I wasn't able to try it yet.\nIt has great cameras\nThe Pixel Fold has three cameras: one for regular, ultrawide and telephoto shots. While the Pixel 7 Pro has a similar camera setup, they aren't the same. The Fold's telephoto camera has a 10.8-megapixel sensor compared to the 48-megapixel one on the 7 Pro.\nOverall, I was really impressed with the Pixel Fold's camera. Like other Pixel phones, the Fold provides a great balance of color that's natural but still bold while capturing plenty of detail. Photos taken on the Pixel Fold's main and ultrawide cameras also looked colorful and crisp, whether I was shooting in daylight, at night or indoors.\nPixel Fold, Pixel 7 Pro and Galaxy Z Fold 4 camera specs\n| Google Pixel Fold | Google Pixel 7 Pro | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Rear cameras | 48MP main; 10.8MP ultrawide; 10.8MP telephoto | 50MP main; 12MP ultrawide; 48MP telephoto | 50MP main; 12MP ultrawide; 10MP telephoto |\n| Front camera | 9.5MP | 10.8MP | 10MP |\n| Inner camera | 8MP | N/A | 4MP |\nEven though the Pixel Fold has a lower resolution telephoto camera, zoomed-in photos looked roughly the same as those taken on the Pixel 7 Pro in my testing. Both phones can zoom optically up to 5x, which is slightly closer than the Galaxy Z Fold 4's 3x optical zoom. But the Pixel 7 Pro can zoom digitally up to 30x, while the Pixel Fold can only reach a 20x digital zoom.\nPixel Fold\nPixel 7 Pro\nCompared to the Galaxy Z Fold 4, I thought the Pixel Fold sometimes rendered skin tones in a more accurate and flattering way, as you can see in the photo below. Colors also looked too blown out in photos taken on the Galaxy Z Fold 4 compared to the Pixel Fold in some scenarios.\nPixel Fold\nGalaxy Z Fold 4\nBut in some cases, Samsung punched up the color a bit more, as shown in the images below.\nPixel Fold\nGalaxy Z Fold 4\nThe Pixel Fold also fares well in low light. All three phones were capable of capturing a flattering photo of me outside of a restaurant at night. Samsung's photo is the brightest of the three, but I prefer Google's photos since both the Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel Fold made my face look a bit softer. That said, if you're interested in brightness alone, Samsung wins this round.\nPixel Fold\nPixel 7 Pro\nGalaxy Z Fold 4\nTake a look at some other photos taken with the Pixel Fold below.\nWhat sets the Pixel Fold and other foldables like it apart from regular phones, however, is their ability to stand on their own when folded halfway. The Pixel Fold, Galaxy Z Fold 4, Motorola Razr Plus and other foldables essentially have a built-in tripod, making it easier to capture steady shots or group selfies.\nWhen using the camera app in Tabletop mode, the viewfinder shifts to the top portion of the display when camera controls are situated on the bottom. Samsung has been offering this feature for a while, so it's nothing new. The Z Fold 4 can even show photos right after they've been taken on the bottom portion of the screen alongside the camera controls. That makes it easier to see if the photo you just captured is to your liking.\nBut the advantage that Google has when taking photos comes down to the size and shape of the Pixel Fold's display. The folded portion of the screen that serves as the camera viewfinder is much taller on the Pixel Fold, giving you more space to see what your shot might look like as you're setting it up.\nIf you take a lot of selfies you'll have plenty of options on the Pixel Fold. There's a 9.5-megapixel front camera above the cover screen, and an 8-megapixel inner camera when you open up the device. That's double the resolution of the Galaxy Z Fold 4's 4-megapixel interior camera, which is under the screen. Compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 4, the selfie taken on the Pixel Fold's inner camera looks more natural and has a bit more detail. But Samsung dialed up the color of my hair, which honestly made for a more flattering photo.\nPixel Fold\nGalaxy Z Fold 4\nGiven its foldable shape, you can also use the Pixel Fold's rear cameras to snap selfies, using the cover display as a viewfinder. You definitely capture more detail in selfies by using the Pixel Fold's rear camera, but doing so can feel awkward. It requires two hands, and feels almost like taking a photo with an iPad.\nFront camera\nRear camera\nIt has solid performance and battery life\nThe Pixel Fold runs on Google's Tensor G2 processor, the same chip that powers the Pixel 7 lineup. Performance is smooth; the Pixel Fold launches apps quickly, runs games like PUBG Mobile and Shadowgun: Legends with ease, and shifts between the front and interior displays almost instantly. The back of the phone got a little warm after gaming for about 10 minutes to the point where it's noticeable but not uncomfortable.\nThe benchmarks tests that CNET usually runs to test general computing and graphics performance weren't available at the time of writing. We'll update this review with those results at a later date.\nBut the Tensor G2 is about more than just performance and speed anyhow. Google's custom chip enables it to bring specific features to its devices, such as Photo Unblur, which sharpens photos that are blurry or fuzzy. That holds true for the Pixel Fold too, which has Photo Unblur among other Tensor-powered features.\nThe Pixel Fold's battery life is probably enough to get you through a full day, but you'll want to pack a charger if you have a particularly busy schedule.\nAfter roughly six hours of use, the Pixel Fold's battery dropped to 70%. During that time, I had the always-on display and high refresh rate settings turned on, and I turned off adaptive brightness. While I left the brightness at 50% most of the time, I turned it up to around 80% when outdoors to more easily see the screen. During that half-day period, I streamed Spotify for about a half hour, took a few photos and a short video, browsed social media, read emails and sent text messages.\nBattery life will always vary depending on how you use your device, which is why I'm being specific about the device's settings and the types of apps I've been running. Whether you're using the tablet-size interior screen or the cover screen will also play a role.\nWe ran CNET's battery test, which involves streaming YouTube over the course of three hours and checking the battery percentage at each hour, on both the interior and exterior screen. The Pixel Fold was down to 83% after running the three-hour test on the front screen, while it dipped down to 69% on the inside screen.\nThe battery test results from the cover screen are on par with the Galaxy S23 series and slightly better than the Pixel 7, while the inside screen's results are lower than most phones we've tested (except for the Sony Xperia 1V, which has a 4K screen). But that's to be expected since the cover screen is smaller than the displays found on many of today's phones, while the interior screen is more comparable to a tablet than a phone.\nHowever, the Pixel Fold performed well during CNET's battery endurance test, during which I streamed video, browsed social media, took a short video call and played games over the course of 45 minutes to see how much these tasks would drain the battery. The Pixel Fold's battery dropped from 100% to 95% during that time. Compared to other phones CNET has tested this year, those results are about the same as the Galaxy S23 Plus' and Lenovo ThinkPhone's. For this test, I used a mix of the interior and exterior display depending on which screen was best-suited for the task at hand. For example, I scrolled social media and played Candy Crush on the front screen, while I used the inner screen for playing PUBG Mobile, watching YouTube and making a video call in Tabletop mode.\nThe Pixel Fold supports 21-watt fast charging, although you'll need a compatible power adapter to achieve those speeds. Google recommends using its 30-watt adapter, although you'll have to purchase it separately. The Pixel Fold went from 0% to 41% in 30 minutes, which is commendable but not as impressive as some other nonfoldable phones, such as the Lenovo ThinkPhone, which went from 0% to 92% in the same time period thanks to its 68-watt charging (and included charger in the box). There's also 7.5-watt wireless charging on the Pixel Fold, which replenished the battery from 26% to 35% in 30 minutes.\nGoogle Pixel Fold overall thoughts\nGoogle gets a lot right with its first foldable phone. The wider cover screen makes it feel immensely more useful for the tasks it's best suited for, like watching videos and taking photos hands-free without a kickstand or tripod. The exterior display also feels much more natural when using apps compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 4, which is narrower than your average phone. Like its standard Pixel phones, Google excelled with the Pixel Fold's design, especially when it comes to the gapless hinge.\nBut the Pixel Fold still feels like a first-generation product. Some major apps, like Instagram and Uber, aren't optimized to occupy the full screen. Google's drag and drop functionality, which is for transferring content between apps in split-screen mode, felt a little hit-or-miss in my testing. And above all else, the Pixel Fold is an expensive device at an eye-watering $1,799, making it difficult to recommend.\nThe Pixel Fold reminds me a lot of the Pixel Watch. It's a polished-looking execution of a product category that's existed for years, but it doesn't necessarily push the industry forward. At least not yet. Google typically updates its Pixel products with new features over time through software updates, and I suspect that will be the same for the Pixel Fold. I think the best parts of the Pixel Fold are still to come.\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using both standardized benchmark tools like Geekbench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays among others that can be useful. And we balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever its price is, actually represents good value. Please note that the Galaxy Z Fold 4 was reviewed using CNET's old scoring system, so its review number score isn't directly comparable to the one the Pixel Fold has been given in 2023.\nPixel Fold Specs vs. Samsung and Honor\n| Google Pixel Fold | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 5G | Honor Magic Vs | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate, brightness | Internal: 7.6-inch OLED, 2,208 x 1,840 pixels; external: 5.8-inch; 2,092 x 1,080 pixels, 60-120Hz | Internal: 7.6-inch AMOLED, 2,176 x 1,812 pixels; external: 6.2-inch, 2,316 x 904 pixels | Internal: 7.9-inch, 2,272 x 1,984 pixels, 90Hz; external: 6.45-inch, 2,560 x 1,080 pixels, 120Hz |\n| Pixel density | External: 408 ppi; internal: 380 ppi | External: 402 ppi; internal: 374 ppi | External: 431 ppi; internal: 381 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | Closed: 5.5 x 3.1 x 0.5 in; open: 5.5 x 6.2 x 0.2 in | Closed: 6.11 x 2.64 x 0.62 in; open: 6.11 x 5.12 x 0.25 in | Closed: 6.31 x 2.86 x 0.51 in; open: 6.31 x 5.57 x 0.24 in |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | Closed: 139.7 x 79.5 x 12.1 mm; open: 139.7 x 158.7 x 5.8 mm | Closed: 155.1 x 67.1 x 15.8 mm; open: 155.1 x 130.1 x 6.3 mm | Closed: 160.3 x 72.6 x 12.9 mm; open: 160.3 x 141.5 x 6.1 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 283g, 9.98 oz | 263g, 9.27 oz | 261g, 9.21 oz (orange); 267g, 9.42 oz (black & cyan) |\n| Mobile software | Android 13 | Android 12L | Android 13 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (main), 10.8-megapixel (ultrawide), 10.8-megapixel (telephoto) | 50-megapixel (main), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (telephoto) | 54-megapixel (main), 50-megapixel (ultrawide), 8-megapixel (telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 9.5-megapixel (cover screen), 8-megapixel (inner screen) | 10-megapixel (cover screen); 4-megapixel (inner screen, under display) | 16-megapixel (cover screen); 16-megapixel (inner screen) |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K |\n| Processor | Tensor G2 | Snapdragon 8 Gen Plus 1 | Snapdragon 8 Gen Plus 1 |\n| RAM/storage | 12GB + 256GB, 12GB + 512GB (US, UK, Germany) | 12GB + 256GB/512GB/1TB | 12GB + 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 4,821 mAh | 4,400 mAh | 5,000 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Side | Side | Side |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None |\n| Special features | 5G (mmw/Sub6), IPX8 rating, 5x optical zoom, dual sim, estimated 24-33 hours battery life | 5G, 30x space zoom camera, IPX8, 25-watt fast-charging (no in-box charger) | 3x optical zoom, 66-watt bundled fast-charger |\n| US price off-contract | $1,799 | $1,800 | Converts to $1,740 |"

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nExclusive: How Google built the Pixel 10's Tensor G5 without Samsung's help\nMarch 18, 2025\n- Google picked a mix of in-house designed and off-the-shelf IP for the upcoming Tensor G5.\n- Many parts of the chip are built by other companies, including Arm, Imagination Technologies, VeriSillicon, and Synopsys.\n- Google dropped its custom \u201cBigWave\u201d AV1 video codec in favor of an off-the-shelf solution.\nIt is no secret that the upcoming Google Tensor G5 inside the Pixel 10 series will be special \u2014 unlike all the current chips in the series, it will be built without Samsung\u2019s help. We know that the chip will be built using TSMC\u2019s 3nm-class process node and have had a good look at its core specs, but not much more than that. Building an entire SoC from scratch is a monumental task, which raises a question: how did Google, a relatively new company in the chip business, do it?\nThanks to a source inside Google, Android Authority has learned previously unknown Tensor G5 specs, giving us a unique insight into how it was created.\nYou\u2019re reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\nHow to build an SoC (fast)\nObviously, the most important parts of a modern SoC are the CPU and GPU. As we knew previously, Google has opted to license the Arm Cortex CPU cores, the same as those used in the Samsung-built Tensor chips. Unlike the previous chips, however, Google has picked a new IMG DXT GPU, replacing the Arm Mali graphics parts used in Tensor so far.\n| Samsung-built Tensor chips | Tensor G5 | |\n|---|---|---|\nCPU | Samsung-built Tensor chips Arm Cortex | Tensor G5 Arm Cortex |\nGPU | Samsung-built Tensor chips Arm Mali | Tensor G5 Imagination Technologies DXT |\nThe previous Tensor chips had some Google-designed IP blocks that have been carried over to the Tensor G5. The audio is processed on the \u201cAoC\u201d \u2014 \u201calways-on compute,\u201d a custom-built audio DSP first introduced in the original Tensor. The same goes for the \u201cEmerald Hill\u201d memory compressor.\nAnother noticeable thing that was carried over was the TPU. AI capabilities are one of the main justifications for why Tensor exists in the first place, so it isn\u2019t surprising that Google brought it (or at least an evolved version) to the Tensor G5. Similarly, the \u201cGXP\u201d DSP, Google\u2019s design built around licensed Tensillica Xtensa cores, was brought to the G5 to help with specific workloads, including image processing.\n| Samsung-built Tensor chips | Tensor G5 | |\n|---|---|---|\nAudio processor | Samsung-built Tensor chips Google AoC | Tensor G5 Google AoC |\nMemory compressor | Samsung-built Tensor chips Google Emerald Hill | Tensor G5 Google Emerald Hill |\nDSP | Samsung-built Tensor chips Google GXP | Tensor G5 Google GXP (next-generation) |\nTPU | Samsung-built Tensor chips Google EdgeTPU | Tensor G5 Google EdgeTPU (next-generation) |\nThis is where things start deviating from past generations \u2014 previous Tensor chips used a combination of two video codecs: Google\u2019s \u201cBigWave\u201d AV1 codec core and Samsung\u2019s MFC (Multi Format Codec) for the other formats. It would seem logical for Google to use something built in-house, perhaps even for all the formats, but that\u2019s not the case. Instead, Google uses third party IP to handle all the formats. Specifically, the core used is Chips&Media\u2019s WAVE677DV, spec\u2019d to handle up to 4K120 encoding and decoding in AV1, VP9, HEVC and H.264.\nTensor G5 ditches Google\u2019s custom AV1 codec in favor of an off-the-shelf solution.\nGoogle has also decided to license a 3rd party display controller and 2D GPU. The core used is VeriSilicon\u2019s DC9000. The previous Tensor chips used fully standard Exynos DPUs for this purpose.\nOf course, cameras are one of the Pixel\u2019s most important features, and Google has been working on building custom ISP hardware since the first Tensor chip. The previous chips only had a few custom Google-designed blocks to complement the regular Samsung ISPs, but that changes now. The Tensor G5 will have a fully custom ISP from the front-end to the back-end parts of the pipeline.\n| Samsung-built Tensor chips | Tensor G5 | |\n|---|---|---|\nVideo codec | Samsung-built Tensor chips Google \u201cBigWave\u201d (AV1 only) | Tensor G5 Chips&Media WAVE677DV |\nVideo codec | Samsung-built Tensor chips Samsung MFC (other formats) | Tensor G5 Chips&Media WAVE677DV |\nDisplay controller/2D GPU | Samsung-built Tensor chips Samsung DPU | Tensor G5 VeriSilicon DC9000 |\nISP | Samsung-built Tensor chips Samsung ISP with custom Google blocks | Tensor G5 Fully custom Google ISP |\nGoogle has custom-built built a few foundational parts for its chips, like a memory controller, system-level cache (GSLC), and clocking/power modules. That\u2019s where Google\u2019s involvement ends, however. The other parts of the chip, including many basic interfaces like USB, PCIe, I3C, as well as the physical layer controllers (PHYs) for interfaces like DSI (display), DisplayPort, and memory (LPDDR5x) are all licensed from various IP providers, mostly Synopsys.\n| Samsung-built Tensor chips | Tensor G5 | |\n|---|---|---|\nMIPI DSI PHY, CSI PHY, DisplayPort PHY, I3C, I2C, SPI, LPDDR5x PHY | Samsung-built Tensor chips Samsung-built | Tensor G5 Synopsys DesignWare IP cores |\nSPMI controller | Samsung-built Tensor chips Samsung-built | Tensor G5 SmartDV SPMI |\nPWM controller | Samsung-built Tensor chips Samsung-built | Tensor G5 Faraday Technologies FTPWMTMR010 |\nUFS controller | Samsung-built Tensor chips Samsung-built | Tensor G5 Most likely 3rd party, no information on the specific vendor |\nUSB3 core | Samsung-built Tensor chips Synopsys DesignWare USB3 | Tensor G5 Synopsys DesignWare USB3 |\nHowever, this isn\u2019t an uncommon practice \u2014 some of these exact cores were even used by Samsung! This is because building and verifying IP is a costly endeavor with the potential for things to go wrong. It simply doesn\u2019t usually make sense to build something that will only fulfill standard functions (like is the case with controllers for interfaces) when proven versions built by other companies can be licensed. Obviously, this limits flexibility, but in many cases, that\u2019s an acceptable trade-off.\nGoogle made the right choice partnering with Samsung\nEven though Google\u2019s Tensor G5 bids farewell to Samsung, it shows why the partnership was the right choice in the first place. Even years after first setting out with Tensor, Google still has to rely on 3rd party IP for most of its interfaces and functions. Besides the fact that it will be built on TSMC\u2019s process, the Tensor G5 won\u2019t be all that different from the previous Tensor chips. It still only has certain bits and pieces by Google, whereas the rest is generic and built by someone else, with the minor difference of who that someone is.\nThe partnership with Samsung has allowed Google to test and develop its own IP way before it was ready to use its own foundation for the chip, and now it\u2019s finally mature enough to be on its own. I can\u2019t wait to see how the future Tensor chips will evolve with the fundamentals now in place.\nThe Google Tensor G5 will arrive in the Pixel 10 series, launching later this year.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "A day after Apple announced iOS 26 at WWDC 25, Google on Tuesday launched one of its most ambitious updates yet, Android 16.\nRolling out first to Pixel 6 and later Pixel phones, Android 16 lands months earlier than recent major versions, with a focus on productivity features and enhancements. These include Live Updates for tracking deliveries and rideshare cars, streamlined notifications, the ability to use desktop-style windows when your phone's connected to a monitor, new device security features, native controls for hearing aids and more.\nShipping the OS in June, instead of the traditional August to September window, lets Google push fresh features into users' hands sooner, and gives phone makers extra runway to preload Android 16 on new phones set to debut in the fall.\nFor Pixel owners, the update began rolling out Tuesday, with support for third-party phones coming later this year. Meanwhile, developers get a new QPR beta that enables the external-monitor preview so they can start optimizing apps for bigger workspaces. Here's what you need to know.\nAndroid 16 arrives first on the Pixel\nGoogle has pushed a stable build of Android 16 to supported Pixel phones. The update layers a fresh Material 3 Expressive coat of paint on top of the OS and adds several new features, too.\nLive update and streamlined notifications\nIf you're waiting for your sushi to arrive or watching your rideshare slowly inch across town, Android 16 now offers live updates that are pinned to your lock screen, so you don't have to keep opening an app to stay in the know. Also, notifications from the same app are now automatically grouped, reducing clutter on your lock screen from notification-heavy apps like Gmail and Ring.\nOne-tap Advanced Protection for everyone\nA single toggle now bundles Google's toughest defenses and blocks dodgy websites, scam calls and USB attacks while the phone is locked. Originally built for high-risk users like journalists and politicians, Advanced Protection is free and available for everyone on Android 16.\nClearer calls for those with hearing aids\nIf you use Bluetooth LE hearing aids, Android 16 lets you flip a switch that routes your voice through the phone's superior microphones instead of the tiny mics in your hearing aids, which is perfect for when you're in a bustling coffee shop or windy beach. There's also a new on-device panel for adjusting hearing-aid volume and presets in one place.\nBetter productivity for tablet owners\nTablets running Android 16 will get a desktop windowing mode later this year, thanks to a built in partnership with Samsung. It lets you float, snap or resize multiple app windows on your device, like you would on a desktop, and Android 16 lays the groundwork for that.\nAndroid 16 supported devices\nAndroid 16 is initially rolling out to these Google Pixel devices:\n- Pixel 6\n- Pixel 6 Pro\n- Pixel 6A\n- Pixel 7\n- Pixel 7 Pro\n- Pixel 7A\n- Pixel Fold\n- Pixel Tablet\n- Pixel 8\n- Pixel 8 Pro\n- Pixel 8A\n- Pixel 9\n- Pixel 9 Pro\n- Pixel 9 Pro XL\n- Pixel 9 Pro Fold\n- Pixel 9A\nHow to download Android 16\nIf you want to download and install Android 16, grab your Pixel and go to Settings > System > Software update > Check for update, and the roughly 2GB download should appear. If you don't see the update yet, just wait -- it's still slowly rolling out to users.\nBefore you download, make sure your phone is on Wi-Fi, plug your phone in if the battery's low, and back up anything critical before you install. Once the file finishes, a quick reboot should complete the upgrade. If you own Samsung, OnePlus or another Android device, you will need to wait for manufacturers' rollout notices later this year, but the process will be the same. Head to the software-update screen and follow the on-screen prompts.\nIf you're on the Android 16 beta, you can turn your Pixel into a plug-and-play desktop\nGoogle's latest Android 16 beta (QPR1 Beta 2) lets Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 owners turn their phones into mini desktops. All you need to do is plug your phone to any external monitor with a USB-C cable, and a full task-bar-and-window interface will appear. You can juggle multiple apps side-by-side, pin favorites and even use keyboard shortcuts.\nIf you want to try out the Android 16 Beta, you can enroll your Pixel 8 or 9 at google.com/android/beta, then go to Settings > System > Software update to download the Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2 over the air.\nNon-Android 16 new features also released\nAlongside Android 16, Google is releasing half a dozen features across the wider Android ecosystem on Tuesday:\n- Custom group chats. You can pick an icon and name, see who's on RCS and set a timed mute.\n- Smarter Google Photos editor. Use one-tap AI fixes, text-prompt \"Reimagine\" edits and auto-crop.\n- Room-specific Google Home shortcuts. You can pin a camera to your TV, lights to your phone or a thermostat to your watch.\n- Extend Safety Check timers. Add extra minutes from the phone or Wear OS without restarting the countdown.\n- Fresh Emoji Kitchen mash-ups. For more expressive stickers, you can create new combos like pointing pigs and thankful carrots.\n- Faster transit taps on Wear OS. Swipe your watch and pay, even with Google Wallet closed.\nAll six features arrive via Play Services and app updates, no upgrade required."

      "text": "Pros\n- Gorgeous design\n- Larger screens inside and out\n- Seven years of software updates\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Not enough foldable features\n- Camera doesn't always produce sharp photos\nTo say the Pixel 9 Pro Fold had a glow up might be an understatement. You wouldn't even be able to tell it's the successor to last year's Pixel Fold just by looking at it.\nWhile Google's second-gen foldable phone has all the upgrades you'd expect from a new phone in 2024 -- including a new processor and fancy AI features -- it's the fresh design that makes it feel different. With its narrower yet larger cover screen, Google is straying from the Pixel Fold's passport-like shape and opting for a design that more closely resembles a regular phone when closed. That shift makes the Pixel 9 Pro Fold feel much more practical than its predecessor.\nWith the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google smartly takes cues from its generally well-received line of standard Pixel phones in terms of design and features, resulting in a device that truly feels like a competitor to those made by Samsung and more seasoned foldable phone makers.\nBut at $1,799 (\u00a31,749, AU$2,699), the Pixel 9 Pro Fold still doesn't solve the biggest problem plaguing today's foldable phones: high prices. While the hardware has come a long way, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's software still doesn't feel as tailored to foldable screens as Samsung's. And for a phone that costs nearly $2,000, the bar is set high for both the hardware and software experience.\nStill, it feels like a big step in the right direction for Google's foldable phone, although I'm still hoping to see more compelling software.\nRead more: 'A Cambrian Explosion:' AI's Radical Reshaping of Your Phone, Coming Soon\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold gets a major design upgrade\nInstead of calling it the Pixel Fold 2, Google is calling this phone the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and it's easy to see why. Compared to the Pixel Fold, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold looks and feels like an entirely different phone, almost as if Google started from scratch.\nThe cover screen measures 6.3 inches just like the regular Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro, compared to the Pixel Fold's smaller yet wider 5.8-inch display. Considering I tend to use foldable phones closed most of the time, this size boost is a welcome improvement. Even though the massive inner screen is what makes phones like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold stand out from traditional bar-shaped phones, it's the external screen that I rely on the most for everyday tasks like snapping photos and answering text messages. At 9.1 ounces (257 grams), the Pixel 9 Pro Fold also feels much lighter than the 10-ounce Pixel Fold.\nThe internal screen also got a much-needed upgrade. It's now brighter and measures 8 inches instead of 7.6, providing more space for playing games, scrolling through social media and watching movies or shows. The change I appreciate the most, however, isn't the screen itself, but the borders surrounding the display. Google significantly slimmed down the bezels, which goes a long way in making the screen feel more immersive. The crease feels less noticeable compared to the Pixel Fold, too.\nThere's no question that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a cut above the Pixel Fold when it comes to design. But how does it stack up to phones from Samsung and Xiaomi? The 8.4-ounce Galaxy Z Fold 6 is less wide and noticeably lighter than Google's phone, which can make it feel more compact. Xiaomi's Mix Fold 4 is less than 0.2 inches thick when unfolded, making it even slimmer than both Google and Samsung's devices.\nDesign isn't usually the most important element of a smartphone, but foldable phones are the exception. It's the physical traits and attributes of phones like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold that command such high prices, and I'm glad to see Google is moving in the right direction in that regard.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro's cameras are good but not the best\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold's cameras aren't quite as advanced as the Pixel 9 Pro's. But they're good enough if you're the type of person who primarily cares about taking casual photos for social media or sharing with friends and family.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a 48-megapixel main camera, a 10.5-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 10.8-megapixel telephoto camera, while the Pixel 9 Pro has a 50-megapixel main camera, a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's front selfie camera has a 10-megapixel sensor, while the Pixel 9 Pro's has 42 megapixels.\nSo far, the biggest difference I'm seeing in image quality between the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and the regular Pro is, unsurprisingly, in the ultrawide and selfie cameras. Ultrawide shots taken on the regular Pixel 9 Pro looked more vibrant and colorful than those taken on Google's foldable phone, while the selfie I took on the 9 Pro Fold came out much softer and less detailed than the Pro's. (The photos below may look similar in this article, but I noticed the differences when viewing them on a 27-inch monitor.)\nPixel 9 Pro Fold\nPixel 9 Pro\nWhen compared with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold performed better in some circumstances but worse in others. Photos of landscapes and still objects taken outdoors, both in bright sunlight and at night, looked more colorful and vibrant on Google's phone. The images below of flowers and a pumpkin-shaped purse sitting on a picnic table are good examples of this.\nPixel 9 Pro Fold\nGalaxy Z Fold 6\nPixel 9 Pro Fold\nGalaxy Z Fold 6\nAlthough Samsung can take closer zoomed-in shots (30x compared with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's 20x, though both phones rely primarily on digital zoom), photos taken at 20x zoom on Google's phone looked much crisper and cleaner than those taken with Samsung's.\nPixel 9 Pro Fold\nGalaxy Z Fold 6\nBut I noticed that photos of people, whether taken at night or during the day, sometimes looked softer in shots from Google's phone compared with Samsung's. This image of my friend Matthew taken at night is one example of this that I encountered when testing both phones. There are some elements of Google's photo that look better, such as the storefront in the background. But the subject's face is clearer in Samsung's photo.\nMobile photography can be subjective, and each phone has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to camera performance. But based on what I've seen so far, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's camera seems comparable to what you'd get from a high-end, nonfoldable phone, although I was surprised that it sometimes struggled to photograph people clearly in low-light scenarios.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold also comes with the same AI photography and image generation features as the rest of the Pixel 9 lineup. These include Add Me (which uses augmented reality to help you take a group photo with everyone, including the photographer, in the picture), the generative AI-based Reimagine (for manipulating and adding objects in photos) and the Pixel Studio, which you can learn more about in our other reviews.\nBut there is a feature that's unique to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Made You Look. This camera mode, which is designed for foldable phones, makes it easier to take photos of kids who refuse to look at the camera, by putting fun animations on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's front display. I haven't been able to test this out for its intended purpose just yet, but I look forward to seeing how it works next time I visit my toddler nephew.\nSplit screen is useful, but Google could do more with the software\nThe Pixel 9 Pro works well as a miniature tablet when opened. Videos and images look vibrant on the 8-inch screen, and you can view two apps in split screen mode alongside one another. Dragging and dropping pictures from Google Photos to the messages app also works smoothly. So does dragging files from Google Drive to Gmail.\nI prefer to dedicate the entire screen to one app, but there are some instances in which I appreciated the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's split-screen capabilities. For example, being able to view Spotify and Slack on screen at the same time definitely came in handy for squeezing in a workout on my lunch break during the work day without missing important messages.\nIf you have YouTube TV, you'll also be able to watch multiple streams of certain programs, like sporting events and some news programs, at once. But this feature isn't exclusive to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold; it's also available on other Android phones, iPhones, iPads, smart TVs and streaming media players. And when you're viewing multiple streams, they don't occupy the entire screen.\nGoogle could also be doing more with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's software in other ways, particularly when the phone is folded halfway. While some apps such as video streaming apps and the camera can shift to the top portion of the screen when the phone is folded in an L shape, most don't. Instead, the majority of apps run across the display like a waterfall, making it hard to navigate and view them when the phone is sitting halfway open. On the Galaxy Z Fold 6, apps conform to the top half of the display accordingly when the device is propped open halfway, almost resembling a miniature laptop.\nIt's a shame that Google hasn't embraced a similar approach, because one of my favorite aspects of using book-shaped foldable phones is having the option to prop them open and use them as a sort of miniature display. When I'm cleaning or putting away laundry, I like having the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 propped open on my desk or dresser while Spotify is running so that I can scroll through playlists and switch songs easily without having to physically pick up my phone. You can sort of recreate that experience by opening the Pixel 9 Pro Fold like a tent and using the cover display, but Samsung's decision to position controls on the bottom half of the screen makes navigating the device much easier.\nThat said, a handful of games are optimized for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's display, showing its potential as a gaming device. Some games, like Asphalt Legends Unite, display gameplay on the top portion of the screen, while the controls and a map are shown on the bottom half. Others, such as NBA Infinite, are capable of taking up the entire screen. While these optimizations are a good example of how foldable phones can stand out from regular phones, I don't see it as being a reason to buy a foldable like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold until the majority of Android games are capable of running in this way.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold launched with Android 14, marking a departure from Google's usual habit of releasing new Pixel phones with the version of Android that came out during that year. I imagine that's because Google launched its flagship phones earlier than usual, so it arrived before the public release of Android 15 is ready. Regardless, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will get seven years of Android and security updates, meaning it'll get new features -- and remain safe to use -- through August 2031, like the rest of Google's new Pixel devices.\nAside from foldable-specific features, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has the same new AI features as the rest of the Pixel 9 lineup, including the Pixel Studio image generator, the Screenshots app for essentially turning your screen grabs into a visual search engine, AI-generated weather summaries and more. You can learn more about those features in our full reviews of the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nBattery life and performance impressions so far\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold's 4,650-mAh battery is capable of lasting more than a day on a single charge in my experience so far. After about 14 hours of use on a day that involved visiting friends and using my phone sparingly for things like web browsing, taking photos and playing music, the battery was down to 53%.\nBut keep in mind battery life will always vary depending on how you use your device. If you're using the Pixel 9 Pro Fold for watching movies, taking lengthy video calls, recording video or audio or playing games for an extended period of time, the battery is going to drain much more quickly.\nDuring CNET's 45-minute battery test, which involves running through everyday tasks such as playing games, streaming YouTube videos, scrolling through social media and taking a 10-minute video call, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's battery dropped from 100% to 96%. That puts it on par with last year's Pixel Fold and smaller phones like the iPhone 16 and 2024 Motorola Razr.\nGoogle's Tensor chips aren't necessarily known for being powerhouses, but the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's performance is fast enough for everything I've been using the phone for, such as playing games, running multiple apps side-by side and watching videos. The interface also feels slick and smooth, likely thanks to both the processor and the display's 120Hz refresh rate.\nIn Geekbench 6, a benchmark test that evaluates a processor's performance when using one of its cores and when using multiple cores, the Pixel 9 Pro scored higher than the OnePlus Open but lower than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 in single core tests. But when it came to multicore performance, it fell just a hair below the OnePlus Open and well below the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The same was true of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's performance in 3DMark Wild Life Extreme, which assesses graphics performance.\nTake a look at the results below.\nPixel 9 Pro Fold overall thoughts\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is yet another sign that perhaps buying a first-gen product, especially from Google, isn't the wisest choice. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold, with its more polished and practical design, feels like a big leap over the original.\nFor a device like a foldable phone that's already inherently clunkier than a regular mobile device, design improvements are more than just superficial aesthetic changes. Making foldable phones thinner and lighter, while expanding the sizes of their screens, makes them feel more natural and enjoyable to use. And for a device that you're buying mostly for the screen, that's important.\nCombine that with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's capable cameras, and there's plenty to love about Google's second-gen foldable. It reminds me of how I felt about the Pixel Watch 2 last year. The first Pixel Watch showed plenty of promise but also had some key shortcomings like the Pixel Fold, which Google then improved upon with its second watch.\nWith the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Google has clearly figured out the hardware. Now, I just want more from the software.\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold specs vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, OnePlus Open, Google Pixel Fold\n| Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 | OnePlus Open | Google Pixel Fold | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Cover display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.3-inch AMOLED; 2,376x968 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.31-inch OLED; 2,484x1,116 pixels; 10-120Hz variable refresh rate | 5.8 inches AMOLED; 2,092x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Internal display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 8-inch OLED; 2,152x2,076 pixels, 1-120 Hz variable refresh rate (LTPO) | 7.6-inch AMOLED; 2,160x1,856 pixels;1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 7.82-inch OLED; 2,440x2,268 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 7.6-inch OLED; 2,208x1,840 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | Cover: 422 ppi; Internal: 373 ppi | Cover: 410 ppi; Internal: 374 ppi | Cover: 431 ppi; Internal: 426 ppi | Cover: 408 ppi; Internal: 380 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | Open: 6.1x5.9x0.2 in; Closed: 6.1x3x0.4 in | Open: 6.04x5.21 x0.22 in; Closed: 6.04x2.68x0.48 in | Open: 6.04x5.63x0.23 in; Closed: 6.04x2.89x0.47 in | Open: 5.5x6.2x0.2 in; Closed: 5.5x3.1x0.5 in |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | Open: 155x150x5.1 mm; Closed: 155x76.2x10.16 mm | Open: 153.5x132.5x5.6mm; Closed: 153.5x68.1x12.1mm | Open: 153.4x143.1x5.9 mm ; Closed 153.4x73.3x11.9 mm | Open: 139.7x158.7x5.8 mm; Closed: 139.7x79.5x12.1 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 257g (9.1 oz) | 239g (8.43 oz) | Voyager black: 239g (8.43 oz ); emerald green: 245g (8.64 oz) | 283g (9.98 oz) |\n| Mobile software | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 13 | Android 13 |\n| Cameras | 48-megapixel (wide), 10.5-megapixel (ultrawide), 10.8-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 64-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 48-megapixel (wide), 10.8-megapixel (ultrawide), 10.8-megapixel (5x telephoto) |\n| Internal screen camera | 10-megapixel (inner screen); 10-megapixel (cover screen) | 4-megapixel (inner screen under-display); 10-megapixel (cover screen) | 20-megapixel (inner screen); 32-megapixel (cover screen) | 8-megapixel (inner screen); 9.5-megapixel (cover screen) |\n| Video capture | 4K | 8K | 4K | 4K |\n| Processor | Tensor G4 | Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 | Tensor G2 |\n| RAM/storage | 16GB + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 512GB | 12GB + 256GB, 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 4,650 mAh | 4,400 mAh | 4,805 mAh | 4,821 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Side | Side | Side | Side |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | None |\n| Special features | IPX8 rating, 7 years of OS, security and Pixel Drop updates, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, ultra wideband chip, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover and back glass, cover screen peek brightness 2,700 nits, internal screen peek brightness 2,700 nits, 45W wired fast charging (Charger not included), Qi-certified, free Google VPN, Super Res Zoom, Add Me, Face Unblur, Made You Look, Magic Editor, Magic Eraser, Best Take, Video Boost, | IP48 rating, 25W wired charging, wireless charging + powershare, 3x optical zoom (up to 10x digital and 30x Space Zoom with AI Super Resolution tech) | 5G (sub-6 only), alert slider, IPX4 rating, IR blaster, 67W fast wired charging with charger included in the box | 5G (mmw/Sub6), IPX8 rating, 5x optical zoom, dual SIM, estimated 24-33 hours battery life, 7.5 wireless charging support |\n| US price starts at | $1,799 (256GB) | $1,900 (256GB) | $1,700 (512GB) | $1,799 (256GB) |\n| UK price starts at | Converts to \u00a31,410 (256GB) | \u00a31,799 (256GB) | \u00a31,599 (512GB) | \u00a31,749 (256GB) |\n| Australia price starts at | Converts to AU$2,770 (256GB) | AU$2,749 (256GB) | Converts to AU$2,690 (512GB) | Converts to AU$3,340 (256GB) |"

      "text": "Google has lifted the curtains on the Pixel 10, its flagship phone for 2025, via a short clip posted on the Google Store homepage on Monday. The Pixel 10 will likely be fully revealed at a Made by Google event in New York on Aug. 20.\nThe teaser video simply shows the back of the device with the Pixel's prominent oval-shaped camera bar, along with a flash and sensor of some sort. It follows a similar design to past Pixels, but whereas the Pixels 6, 7 and 8 all had camera bars that ran edge-to-edge, the Pixel 9 and 10's camera bar is an island. The more affordable Pixel 9A from earlier this year doesn't sport any sort of camera bump, and instead sits flush with the device.\nIt comes after a series of leaks about the device have hit the internet over the last few months, including the phone being spotted during a commercial shoot on the streets of Vancouver back in May.\nCurrent Pixel 10 rumors point to a very similar design to last year's handset, with some strong internal upgrades. Notably, the Tensor 5 chip will be made by TSMC on a 3nm process, according to an Android Authority report from March. Previous Tensor chips were made by Samsung.\nThe screen on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will see a boost from 2,700 nits to 3,000 nits, according to another Android Authority report. It'll also get a battery bump to 5,015 mAh, a 7% increase from last year's foldable.\nAs for cameras, the Pixel 10 will reportedly get the 50-megapixel Samsung GN8 wide-angle lens, an 11MP 3J1 telephoto lens (the 3J1 will also be used for the selfie camera) and Sony's 13-megapixel IMX712 ultrawide lens. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold likely won't have the same high-end camera array, as foldable phones have less room to work with.\nThe Pixel 10 will almost certainly be powered by Android 16 and will have a slew of AI features.\nGoogle didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment.\nWhile Google's hardware business is a small part of the company's overall revenue, the Pixel line does serve an important role in signaling to other hardware partners where the company sees the future of its Android mobile operating system. Pixel phones, which seldom focus on raw power, deliver clean user interfaces with strong computational photography.\nThe well-reviewed Pixel portfolio does put Google in a somewhat awkward position with hardware partners that decided to make Android devices rather than go off and make their own operating systems. With Google's own phones, the tech giant is directly competing with Samsung, OnePlus, Motorola and others.\nWhile Samsung is the second largest handset maker worldwide (behind Apple), according to Statcounter, Google has been eating away at market share in certain markets. With the release of the Pixel 9 last year, Google made strong inroads in North American markets."

      "text": "We test dozens of phones each year, but we only consider a few to be truly great. The best phones in 2025 have a battery life that lasts a day or more, cameras that take stunning photos and vibrant displays, perfect for TikTok or watching The Gilded Age. 2025 has been an incredible year for smartphones. From Google's Pixel 9 series and Apple's iPhone 16 family to Samsung's Galaxy S25 series and foldable phones including the Motorola Razr Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 7, these are the best phones you can buy. While tariffs and economic uncertainty have caused people to consider upgrading their phones sooner rather than later, companies like Apple, Samsung and Google have not raised their prices.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat is the best phone for most people?\nThe best phone for most people is the $799 iPhone 16. It comes in two sizes: a 6.1-inch regular iPhone 16 model or a larger 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus model that starts at $899. The phones have a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera that performs better in low light and can now take macro photos, meaning you'll be able to focus close to take amazing food snaps. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus have a handful of Apple Intelligence tools for writing, removing distractions from photos and doing summaries of messages and webpages. There's also adds a ChatGPT integration to Siri.\nThe phones also have an Action button that can be programed for different functions like turning on the flashlight, recording a voice memo, changing the focus mode and more. There's also a new Camera Control button that not only lets you take photos and quickly change things like zoom, Portrait mode aperture and Photographic Styles, but can also trigger a new feature called Visual Intelligence, which will add context to whatever the camera is pointed at, a bit like Google Lens. We think the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are ideal for most people looking for a great phone that will last for years.\nBest phones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera Control is useful for switching camera settings\n- Photographic Styles makes photos pop\n- Ultrawide camera is better in low light\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t out yet\n- No always on display\n- No changes to wired charging speeds\n- No upgrades to the Action button\nWhen I tested the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus I was definitely impressed by the new photography features, the convenient Action button and the elegant build. I consider these phones to be top-notch choices for Apple fans. Parts of the iPhone 16\u2019s key feature, Apple Intelligence, are now out, and the fact that these phones will support it means they\u2019ll likely feel future-proofed for years to come. Aside from screen size (6.1 inches on the regular, 6.7 inches on the Plus), battery size and price, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical in every way.\nThe iPhone 16 isn\u2019t perfect -- it\u2019s missing an always-on display, and it feels like it\u2019s been ages since Apple improved its wired charging speeds. But it checks all the important boxes and then some.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus rank so high in our testing because the phones appeal to both novice users and power players a like. They offer about 90% of the experience of Apple's Pro models but cost hundreds of dollars less. Not only is the iPhone 16 a wonderful phone out of the box, Apple has a long track record of updating its software and security patches for years.\nWho it's best for\nWhen you think about how the Camera Control key, the Action button and the Dynamic Island come together, along with the camera and battery improvements Apple has made over the last several years, the iPhone 16 is a compelling upgrade for someone coming from an older iPhone, especially if that person is on an iPhone 13 or older. For those who don\u2019t need the Pro\u2019s extra photography prowess and battery life, the iPhone 16 won\u2019t disappoint.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nI wouldn't recommend buying the iPhone 16 just for the Camera Control button or the better ultrawide camera.\nPros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life\n- More AI features feel practical\nCons\n- Several gimmicky AI features\n- Not many changes over the S24\nThe Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\nAnd while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.\nWhy we like it\nHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.\nPros\n- Robust design\n- Bright high resolution inner screen\n- Battery life should last you a day or more\n- It's so damn fun to use\nCons\n- Cameras take decent photos but suffer from motion blur\n- Only three years of major OS updates\n- Gets warm playing games and using the camera frequently\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra is a beefed-up version of last year's Razr Plus, which won a CNET Editor's Choice Award. It's as if the Razr Plus hired a trainer and nutritionist and then got absolutely ripped -- warranting its name: Ultra. After testing, I've come to adore the Razr Ultra. It does all the \"normal\" non-folding phone things I want, and offers me a truly unique experience thanks to its cover screen. I feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed.\nBut in taking nearly every aspect of the phone to the extreme, Motorola lost one of the most important parts of recent Razrs: the amazing value. The catch for all this ultra-ness: the Motorola Razr Ultra costs $1,300.\nWhy we like it\nThis is the best built foldable flip phone I've ever used. Motorola took the best parts of the Razr Plus and improved nearly everything else. The battery life is outstanding and easily lasts a day on a single charge and can get you mostly through a second day even. The displays are brighter. The main 7-inch foldable display is larger and has more resolution than the Razr Plus and the cameras are improved. The fabric backing is delightful.\nWho's it best for\nSomeone who wants a fun, unique an robust foldable phone. You're willing to pay top-dollar to get the best processor, battery, design and cameras Motorola has ever made.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you're unsure of foldables, this might not be the best fit. If you find yourself in places with sand, dirt and other fine particles, the Razr Ultra (like all foldable phones) isn't worth the risk. The Razr Ultra has the same class-leading IP-rating for dust and water resistance, but the dust resistance is only for particles 1-mm or larger.\nPros\n- Larger screens/thinner bezels\n- 4K slo-mo OMG\n- Audio Mix is brilliant\n- iOS 18\nCons\n- No Apple Intelligence out of the box\n- Camera Control placement not optimal for one-handed shooting\n- Elegant finishes aren't very colorful\n- Only 128GB of storage for $1,000\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything I've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including one of the best batteries on any phone I've tested as well as. In our testing it will easily last a day on a single charge.\nThe phones also have larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button, iOS 18 goodies and a handful of Apple Intelligence tools. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for $1,000; there are only drab color options, and a the new camera button is easy to tap accidentally. Read our full iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max review.\nWhy we like it\nThis year the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have the exact same cameras -- unlike the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, which had different telephoto options. Screen size, battery life and price should be the deciding factors when you're choosing between the two. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones worthy of a spot in your pocket (and mine) if you can afford them.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. Also, I should note that the entry-level $999 iPhone 16 Pro only has 128GB of storage.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you are looking for a budget phone or don't need a phone with the latest features or tech.\nPros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\nWhy we like it\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll rarely need to open the phone -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the Galaxy S25 Ultra might be a better fit.\nPros\n- Best screen on any phone\n- Versatile cameras\n- Most powerful phone I've tested\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- $1,300 price\n- Design is almost too minimal\n- AI features are hit-or-miss\n- S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.\nIf you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nWhy we like it\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\nWho's it best for\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\nPros\n- The screen is delightfully bright\n- Cameras are good for $499\n- Gemini Live Video AI has potential to be useful\n- Solid build\n- The under-$500 price\nCons\n- Battery life is just OK, will get through a day\n- Processor is serviceable (curious about longevity)\n- Lacks emergency SOS satellite texting\nFor $499, Google's Pixel 9A truly feels like you're getting more bang for your buck. It comes with several significant upgrades from last year's Pixel 8A: a fresh design, new display, larger battery, slightly more powerful chip, increased durability and upgraded software features.\nBut don't get me wrong -- it's not a perfect phone. There are places where Google had to compromise to keep the price under $500, like the lack of satellite connectivity for emergencies available on the $799 Pixel 9. Overall, though, I think the compromises Google made were smart and that the Pixel 9A is worth every penny. Read our Google Pixel 9A review.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9A is proof that you don't need to spend more than $500 to get a great phone. It can handle all you daily tasks from scrolling social media and news feeds and swiping through TikTok videos to taking a beautiful photo and lasting a day on a single charge.\nWho's it best for?\nIn theory: anybody. The Pixel 9A is for anyone who wants 95% of what a $1,000 phone can do at half the price.\nWho shouldn't get it\nAnyone who wants the absolute fastest processor or the most cutting edge cameras.\nPros\n- USB-C port is more convenient charging\n- Colorful matte design\n- Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\n- Dynamic Island brings better multitasking\nCons\n- No always-on display\n- Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\n- Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\n- Galaxy S24 offers a longer optical zoom\nWith the launch of the iPhone 16, the regular iPhone 15 is being sold at a discount -- $100 off. That means that the iPhone 15 now starts at $699. And you might be able to find steeper discounts throughout the coming weeks and months. With the Dynamic Island, a USB-C port for more convenient charging and a high resolution camera and a sharper digital zoom, I found the iPhone 15 to be a significant upgrade for those with older iPhones.\nThe iPhone 15 is available in two size options: the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus. They run on the same chip as iPhone 14 Pro, the A16 Bionic, which should bring notable performance upgrades to those with an iPhone that's several years old. These phones also have Apple's second-generation ultra wideband chip, enabling a new feature that makes it easier to find friends or family members in a crowd which I found handy. Read our full iPhone 15 review.\nWhy we like it\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are heavily influenced by the iPhone 14 Pro. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. Overall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone.\nWho it's best for\nThe iPhone 15 is for someone coming from an iPhone 12 or older. In 2025, Apple sells it for $699. But I recommend looking for one that's discounted. If you're contemplating the iPhone 16E but really want an ultrawide camera (remember the 16E only has a single rear camera) and MagSafe charging, then grab an iPhone 15.\nWho shouldn't get it\nApple sells the $599 iPhone 16E which makes the iPhone 15 a curious value. If you can score a discounted iPhone 15 I'd go that way. But otherwise, the iPhone 16E might be a better buy.\nPros\n- Genuinely fun new AI skills\n- Sleek new design\n- Seven years of software updates\n- Cameras can take great daytime shots\nCons\n- Camera hardware hasn't improved much over Pixel 8 Pro\n- Gemini AI will eventually require a paid subscription\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. But it's the AI skills that really stand out, from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live, to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts.\nThe phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low-light and in night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (though you get the first year for free) But if you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. Read our Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL review.\nWhy we like it\nGoogle's Pixel line of phones has gone from strength to strength and its latest model is unquestionably the best phone the company has ever made. It's not just the slick-looking design; the Pixel 9 Pro offers a superb camera system, a generous support period and a host of new AI skills making it one of the most accomplished Android phones around. The 9 Pro XL takes that further by accommodating a bright and vibrant 6.8-inch display.\nWho it's best for\nIt's a great phone for those of you looking for an elegant everyday Android phone. The interface is easy to navigate and the camera takes great photos with almost no effort on your part. If you feel overwhelmed by the plethora of settings and menus on other Android flagships, Google's Pixel 9 Pro is the way to go. If playing mobile games or watching videos on the go is a priority, opt for the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you don't need the best cameras Google makes, consider the regular Pixel 9. I do like the fit and finish better on the 9 Pro, but it starts at $999.\nPros\n- The 6.9-inch screen is immersive, with lovely colors and contrast\n- The 4.1-inch screen looks incredible\n- It's durable and survived a drop onto concrete\n- One UI 8 (Android 16) runs wonderfully\n- $1,100 is still a lot, but Samsung gives the phone more value than the Flip 6\nCons\n- Gets warm when recording videos and playing games\n- Battery life is the same as the Flip 6 despite a bigger battery\n- Cover screen software has room to grow\nWhen I first got my hands on Samsung's new Galaxy Z Flip 7, I was delighted to discover that it has a smaller crease, larger cover screen, thinner design and bigger battery compared to last year's Galaxy Z Flip 6. But as I tested the new clamshell phone, I became enthralled by its inner screen. At 6.9 inches, this is the biggest screen on any Samsung phone aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has an 8-inch foldable display.\nThe Z Flip 7's large screen size makes content feel more immersive and colors look lovely and vivid. This led to epic TikTok and Instagram sessions, watching widescreen films such as A Working Man and Back to the Future, as well as jumping back and forth between two apps stacked vertically on the screen thanks to One UI 8's 90:10 split tool.\nEvery time I open the Flip 7, I'm consistently dumbfounded by how such a large display can unfurl from something about the size of a makeup compact. And when it's closed, there's a 4.1-inch cover screen that's fantastic in its own ways, with new clever animations for when you're recording a video, charging the phone or taking a selfie, all efficiently using the extra display real estate. In terms of functionality, though, the cover screen's software is about the same as the 3.4-inch one on the Flip 6.\nThe Flip 7 impressed me in nearly every way but one: its battery life. It has a larger battery than the Flip 6, but it doesn't last any longer in daily use. It did consistently get me through a day on a single charge, often having 15 to 20% left, but there were also a few days where it needed an early evening top-off.\nWhy we like it\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the most fully realized version of Samsung's ideal of a flip phone since the launch of the original Galaxy Z Flip in 2020. The Flip 7's appeal is simple: It's a thin phone with a big, bold screen that folds in half into a coaster-sized square. The larger cover screen and inner screen make content more immersive. It's design is thin (for a clamshell foldable) and comfortable to hold. Plus you get twice the storage this year compared to last.\nWho is it best for\nIf you've been tempted by a clamshell-style foldable, you should definitely consider the Flip 7. If you have a Galaxy Z Flip 4 or older, the Flip 7 will be an upgrade in every way. It's harder to make that same recommendation for Flip 5 owners unless your phone is showing its age. And if you have a Galaxy Z Flip 6, you can sit this one out unless you really want those larger screens.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance with games, movies and animations\nCons\n- Battery life is a day, similar to baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25 at a higher price\n- Rival phones at the same price have better cameras\nIf the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity \u2013 without upgrading all the way to the Ultra \u2013 the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.\nThat said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.\nWhy we like it\nWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.\nWho it's best for\nIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses\nPros\n- Beautiful design that feels durable\n- Fun and somewhat useful AI features\n- New ultrawide camera takes good photos\n- 7 years of software updates for longevity\nCons\n- More expensive that previous Pixels and competitors\n- Doesn't feel that different from Pixel 8\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the Pixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. But Google\u2019s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops.\nThe Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren\u2019t must-haves, and they\u2019re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. Read our full review for the Google Pixel 9.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9 and Google's Gemini assistant still feel like a first step toward what the company is hoping to achieve: Making phone software more intelligent so that we can spend less time swiping, tapping, scrolling and digging. In the meantime, the Pixel 9 shines for its great camera, elegant design and clean software, just like the less AI-centric Pixels of years past.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're a Pixel fan upgrading from an older phone, like the Pixel 6 or earlier, you'll find a lot to love about the Pixel 9. But keep in mind that for the same price, Samsung's Galaxy S25 has a brighter screen and a dedicated telephoto lens for taking zoomed photos.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you want the absolute best cameras that Google makes, including having a dedicated telephoto lens, I'd recommend the Pixel 9 Pro.\nBest phones compared\n| Product | Apple iPhone 16 | Apple iPhone 16 Pro | Apple iPhone 15 | Google Pixel 9 | Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | Moto G Power 5G (2024) | Motorola Razr Plus (2024) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556 x 1,179 pixel resolution; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz adapative refresh rate | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556x1,179 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.3-inch LTPO OLED; 2,856x1,280 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.8-inch LTPO OLED; 2,992x1,344 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.8-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch LCD; 2,400 x 1,080 pixels, 60-120Hz refresh rate | 4-inch pOLED; 1,272 x 1,080 pixels; 1-165Hz variable refresh rate; 6.9-inch pOLED; 2,640 x 1,080 pixels, 1-165Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 422 ppi | 495 ppi | 486 ppi | 416 ppi | 509 ppi | 501 ppi | 391 ppi | Cover: 417 ppi; Internal: 413 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.81 x 2.82 x 0.31 inches | 5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches | 2.82x5.81x0.31 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches | 6x2.8x0.3 inches | 6.4x3x0.3 inches | 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in. | 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in. | 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in. | 6.6 x 3 x 0.3 in. | Open: 6.75 x 2.91 x 0.28 in Closed: 3.47 x 2.91 x 0.6 in |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm | 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm | 71.6x147.6x7.8 mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm | 152.8x72x8.5 mm | 162.8x76.6x8.5 mm | 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm | 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm | 167.2 x 76.4 x 8.5mm | Open: 171.42 x 74 x 7.09mm Closed: 88.09 x 74 x 15.32mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 170 g (6 oz.) | 199 g (7.03 oz.) | 171g (6.02 oz.) | 198g (7 oz.) | 199g (7 oz.) | 221g (7.8 oz) | 162g (5.71 oz.) | 190g (6.70 oz.) | 218g (7.69 oz.) | 201g (7.09 oz.) | 189g (6.67 oz) |\n| Mobile software | iOS 18 | iOS 18 | iOS 17 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 14 | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 14 | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 5x telephoto | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 200-megapixel (wide), 50-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto), 50-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 8-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide) 50-megapixel (2x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 10.5-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 42-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 16-megapixel | 32-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K | 8K | 8K | 8K | 1,080p | 4K |\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A16 Bionic | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Mediatek Dimensity 7020 | Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 |\n| RAM + storage | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | RAM N/A + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 8GB RAM + 128GB | 12GB + 256GB |\n| Expandable storage | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None | None | None | None | None | None | Up to 1TB | None |\n| Battery | Up to 22 hours video playback; up to 18 hours video playback (streamed). 20W wired charging.

The Fold 7 replaces last year's Fold 6 and comes with a completely new design that makes it thinner, lighter and feel more like a \"regular phone.\" The Flip 7 is the best-built foldable flip phone we tested from Samsung. The thinner design and bigger displays are the headline features.\nFactors to consider when buying a new phone\nPick the most important feature: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? This will help narrow down your choices. Phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max or Galaxy S25 Ultra cost well over $1,000, for example, but pack large batteries that will last most people a day and a half to two days on a single charge.\nDon't dismiss $500 to $800 phones: You can get a great phone that does almost everything that a more expensive flagship model can do for a fraction of the price. Google's Pixel 9 (which starts at $799) packs a great camera, a bright screen and unique AI features, but the $499 Pixel 8A has most of the same key specs and comes at a lower price.\nShop Cyber Monday: Look for sales and deals close to holidays, especially Amazon's Prime Day and Cyber Monday.\nConsider last year's models: When a new phone gets launched, stores and carriers discount their older phones to sell off existing stock.\nSee the phone in person: It's worth going to a store and trying out a potential phone. You may love or hate the way it looks and feels.\nDecide on Android or iPhone: Do you have a lot of iPhone apps and Apple subscriptions? Stick with an iPhone. If you've invested in loads of Android apps, you may want to stay on that side of the fence. Otherwise, it's simple enough to switch platforms.\nBudget for a case and screen protector: Phones sold today are more durable than phones from even a few years ago, but it still might be a good idea to protect your phone with a case to keep it in tip-top shape.\nHow we test phones\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios, focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates, or to compare it against new phones from competitors such as Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes, such as 4K slow motion video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, or the new Magic Editor photo tools that launched with the Google Pixel 9 series.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, as a simple, replicable measure of pure battery life, which isn't always included in the initial review but sometimes added later in an update.\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure each phone's performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Most noteworthy is how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations, and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.\nPerformance measuring\nRead more: How We Test Phones\nOther phones we tested\nWhile Apple doesn't sell the iPhone 15 Pro, you can still find it at carriers and third-party retailers. The 15 Pro has a 6.1-inch adaptive-refresh rate screen that adjusts between 1-120Hz depending on what's on the screen. It has excellent cameras, a fast processor, an always-on display, supports iOS 18 and safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite. Driving all these upgrades is Apple's A17 Pro chip which in use feels peppy. The iPhone 15 Pro is still an excellent phone in 2025. Check out our iPhone 15 Pro review.\nPhone FAQs\nWhat is the best time to buy a phone?\nHow long should a phone battery last?\nHow much storage should I get on a phone?\nWhat are the best phone brands currently?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nGoogle is expected to launch the Pixel 10 series in August. There's also buzz for the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 17 -- from a slimmer version of the upcoming device to a new screen with a higher refresh rate on baseline models.

      "text": "This is your first look at the official renders for the Google Pixel 10, which Google has confirmed will be announced on August 20.\nThe Google Pixel 10 colors will include Obsidian, Indigo, Frost, and Limoncello. The Obsidian is obviously Google\u2019s black color, which they\u2019ve offered for many years now. While the Indigo is a real royal blue, a bit lighter than the blue shadow on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Frost is a much lighter blue, almost like the iPhone 15 from a couple of years ago, and finally, the Limoncello is a yellow-green color.\nThese are all pretty bright colors, and an interesting color palette for Google, even on its base model. Especially since the Porcelain color is missing from the base Pixel 10, now.\nThe biggest change, is the camera bar\nThis year, the biggest change on the Google Pixel 10 is actually going to be in the camera bar. It\u2019s not actually a larger camera bar; however, the glass on the camera bar is now larger. This is due to Google adding a third camera to the Pixel 10 \u2013 finally adding that telephoto camera.\nAs we\u2019ve already reported on, all Google Pixel 10 camera sensors are going to be smaller this year. This is likely to help differentiate the Pixel 10 from the Pixel 10 Pro models, since there\u2019s no reason why the Pixel 10 can\u2019t have the exact same sensors as the \u201cPro\u201d models.\nThe primary sensor will be a 48-megapixel sensor, with a 12-megapixel ultrawide and a 10.8-megapixel telephoto sensor. These sensors come from the Pixel 9a, and the telephoto comes from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nObviously, the Google Pixel 10 specs look like a pretty huge downgrade. But an important thing to remember is Google\u2019s computational photography. It works better on these smaller sensors, versus the larger ones we have on the \u201cPro\u201d models. This is a big reason why the Pixel a-series typically wins the blind smartphone camera tests every single year.\nThe Google Pixel 10 release date is set for August 20, with pre-orders opening that same day. Devices are set to start shipping on August 28."

      "text": "The next Made by Google event is coming on Aug. 20, where it's highly likely that the company will reveal its Pixel 10 series of phones. The announcement arrived from Google Wednesday, with a press release and invites for an event in New York.\nThe event, like previous Made By Google briefings that have taken place in the late summer or fall, is likely to focus on Google's Pixel phones, watches, earbuds and potentially more. It's uncertain what other devices Google might show off during the event, but we may see the company's Android XR Smart Glasses. Like with Google I/O earlier this year, we can expect plenty of focus on AI features that further show off the recently released Android 16.\nAt the moment, rumors suggest that the Pixel 10 series will be powered by the Google's custom Tensor G5 chip. Unlike past Tensor chips, this one wouldn't be made by Samsung fabrication and instead will be manufactured by TSMC. The move to TSMC means Google can use the fabricator's 3nm process, meaning more transistors can be packed on a single chip for greater power and efficiency.\nOn the camera side, rumors suggest the base Pixel 10 might get a telephoto senor and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold may have a 50-megapixel Samsung GN8 main camera. At least, in a period of inflationary pressure and tariff fears, insiders have suggested that pricing for Google's Pixel devices will remain the same as last year.\nThe Made by Google event announcement comes a week after Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 in New York. Samsung typically unveils its folding phones separately from the Galaxy S line, but Google is expected to unveil the Pixel 10 Pro Fold alongside a standard Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nWhile Google is primarily known as an online search and software company, it's been making hardware for over a decade. In the past, Google would partner with other phone manufacturers, such as HTC and LG, to release its Nexus phones running cleaner versions of its Android operating system. With the launch of the Pixel series of devices starting in 2016, Google brought production in-house, giving the company greater control. It allowed Google to create its vision of a mobile phone and signal which features its hardware partners should focus on.\nThe Pixel line hasn't been known for having the highest-end specs, but made up for it with industry-leading cameras and photo processing. While Samsung and Apple control much of the global smartphone market, Pixel has been gaining larger chunks of market share, especially in the North American market."

      "text": "The best Android phones have years of software and security updates, great cameras, a powerful processor and a battery life that lasts a day or more. Samsung's new Galaxy Z Fold 7 makes the cut, as does Google's Pixel 9 and the 9 Pro XL. We've tested dozens of Android phones and have found the best smartphones you can buy. You should have no trouble getting one that suits your needs. Whilethere's a general uncertainty around the economy that has caused people to consider upgrading their phone, companies like Samsung and Google have not raised the prices on their current offerings, specifically because of tariffs.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat's the best Android phone?\nThe $800 Samsung Galaxy S25's battery life is amazing. That's not the only reason it's our pick for best Android phone. It gets seven years of major Android updates, and the cameras are good (there's even a 3x telephoto lens for zooming). Then there are all the AI features: Most are just OK, but Circle to Search is outstanding. Samsung tries to set the Galaxy S25 apart by leaning into what's new (AI), as well as embracing the familiar (good cameras and battery life). And we're definitely impressed. There are plenty of other excellent choices, with the Pixel 8A being another current favorite.\nBest Android phones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life that last a day or more\n- More AI features that actually feel practical\nCons\n- Several gimmicky AI tools\n- Not many changes over the S24\nThe Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\nAnd while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.\nWhy we like it\nHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.\nPros\n- The screen is delightfully bright\n- Cameras are good for $499\n- Gemini Live Video AI has potential to be useful\n- Solid build\n- The under-$500 price\nCons\n- Battery life is just OK, will get through a day\n- Processor is serviceable (curious about longevity)\n- Lacks emergency SOS satellite texting\nFor $499, Google's Pixel 9A truly feels like you're getting more bang for your buck. It comes with several significant upgrades from last year's Pixel 8A: a fresh design, new display, larger battery, slightly more powerful chip, increased durability and upgraded software features.\nBut don't get me wrong -- it's not a perfect phone. There are places where Google had to compromise to keep the price under $500, like the lack of satellite connectivity for emergencies available on the $799 Pixel 9. Overall, though, I think the compromises Google made were smart and that the Pixel 9A is worth every penny. Read our Google Pixel 9A review.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9A is proof that you don't need to spend more than $500 to get a great phone. It can handle all you daily tasks from scrolling social media and news feeds and swiping through TikTok videos to taking a beautiful photo and lasting a day on a single charge.\nWho's it best for?\nIn theory: anybody. The Pixel 9A is for anyone who wants 95% of what a $1,000 phone can do at half the price.\nWho shouldn't get it\nAnyone who wants the absolute fastest processor or the most cutting edge cameras.\nPros\n- Beautiful design that feels durable\n- Fun and somewhat useful AI features\n- New ultrawide camera takes good photos\n- 7 years of software updates for longevity\nCons\n- More expensive that previous Pixels and competitors\n- Doesn't feel that different from Pixel 8\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the Pixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. But Google\u2019s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops.\nThe Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren\u2019t must-haves, and they\u2019re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. Read our full review for the Google Pixel 9.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9 and Google's Gemini assistant still feel like a first step toward what the company is hoping to achieve: Making phone software more intelligent so that we can spend less time swiping, tapping, scrolling and digging. In the meantime, the Pixel 9 shines for its great camera, elegant design and clean software, just like the less AI-centric Pixels of years past.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're a Pixel fan upgrading from an older phone, like the Pixel 6 or earlier, you'll find a lot to love about the Pixel 9. But keep in mind that for the same price, Samsung's Galaxy S25 has a brighter screen and a dedicated telephoto lens for taking zoomed photos.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you want the absolute best cameras that Google makes, including having a dedicated telephoto lens, I'd recommend the Pixel 9 Pro.\nPros\n- Best screen on any phone\n- Versatile cameras\n- Most powerful phone I've tested\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- $1,300 price\n- Design is almost too minimal\n- AI features are hit-or-miss\n- S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.\nIf you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nWhy we like it\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\nPros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\nWhy we like it\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll rarely need to open the phone -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the Galaxy S25 Ultra might be a better fit.\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance with games, movies and animations\nCons\n- Battery life is a day, similar to baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25 at a higher price\n- Rival phones at the same price have better cameras\nIf the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity \u2013 without upgrading all the way to the Ultra \u2013 the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.\nThat said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.\nWhy we like it\nWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.\nWho it's best for\nIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses\nPros\n- Genuinely fun new AI skills\n- Sleek new design\n- Seven years of software updates\n- Cameras can take great daytime shots\nCons\n- Camera hardware hasn't improved much over Pixel 8 Pro\n- Gemini AI will eventually require a paid subscription\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. But it's the AI skills that really stand out, from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live, to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts.\nThe phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low-light and in night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (though you get the first year for free) But if you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. Read our Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL review.\nWhy we like it\nGoogle's Pixel line of phones has gone from strength to strength and its latest model is unquestionably the best phone the company has ever made. It's not just the slick-looking design; the Pixel 9 Pro offers a superb camera system, a generous support period and a host of new AI skills making it one of the most accomplished Android phones around. The 9 Pro XL takes that further by accommodating a bright and vibrant 6.8-inch display.\nWho it's best for\nIt's a great phone for those of you looking for an elegant everyday Android phone. The interface is easy to navigate and the camera takes great photos with almost no effort on your part. If you feel overwhelmed by the plethora of settings and menus on other Android flagships, Google's Pixel 9 Pro is the way to go. If playing mobile games or watching videos on the go is a priority, opt for the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you don't need the best cameras Google makes, consider the regular Pixel 9. I do like the fit and finish better on the 9 Pro, but it starts at $999.\nPros\n- Robust design\n- Bright high resolution inner screen\n- Battery life should last you a day or more\n- It's so damn fun to use\nCons\n- Cameras take decent photos but suffer from motion blur\n- Only three years of major OS updates\n- Gets warm playing games and using the camera frequently\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra is a beefed-up version of last year's Razr Plus, which won a CNET Editor's Choice Award. It's as if the Razr Plus hired a trainer and nutritionist and then got absolutely ripped -- warranting its name: Ultra. After testing, I've come to adore the Razr Ultra. It does all the \"normal\" non-folding phone things I want, and offers me a truly unique experience thanks to its cover screen. I feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed. Read our Motorola Razr Ultra review.\nBut in taking nearly every aspect of the phone to the extreme, Motorola lost one of the most important parts of recent Razrs: the amazing value. The catch for all this ultra-ness: the Motorola Razr Ultra costs $1,300.\nWhy we like it\nThis is the best built foldable flip phone I've ever used. Motorola took the best parts of the Razr Plus and improved nearly everything else. The battery life is outstanding and easily lasts a day on a single charge and can get you mostly through a second day even. The displays are brighter. The main 7-inch foldable display is larger and has more resolution than the Razr Plus and the cameras are improved. The fabric backing is delightful.\nWho's it best for\nSomeone who wants a fun, unique an robust foldable phone. You're willing to pay top-dollar to get the best processor, battery, design and cameras Motorola has ever made.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you're unsure of foldables, this might not be the best fit. If you find yourself in places with sand, dirt and other fine particles, the Razr Ultra (like all foldable phones) isn't worth the risk. The Razr Ultra has the same class-leading IP-rating for dust and water resistance, but the dust resistance is only for particles 1-mm or larger.\nPros\n- The 6.9-inch screen is immersive, with lovely colors and contrast\n- The 4.1-inch screen looks incredible\n- It's durable and survived a drop onto concrete\n- One UI 8 (Android 16) runs wonderfully\n- $1,100 is still a lot, but Samsung gives the phone more value than the Flip 6\nCons\n- Gets warm when recording videos and playing games\n- Battery life is the same as the Flip 6 despite a bigger battery\n- Cover screen software has room to grow\nWhen I first got my hands on Samsung's new Galaxy Z Flip 7, I was delighted to discover that it has a smaller crease, larger cover screen, thinner design and bigger battery compared to last year's Galaxy Z Flip 6. But as I tested the new clamshell phone, I became enthralled by its inner screen. At 6.9 inches, this is the biggest screen on any Samsung phone aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has an 8-inch foldable display.\nThe Z Flip 7's large screen size makes content feel more immersive and colors look lovely and vivid. This led to epic TikTok and Instagram sessions, watching widescreen films such as A Working Man and Back to the Future, as well as jumping back and forth between two apps stacked vertically on the screen thanks to One UI 8's 90:10 split tool.\nEvery time I open the Flip 7, I'm consistently dumbfounded by how such a large display can unfurl from something about the size of a makeup compact. And when it's closed, there's a 4.1-inch cover screen that's fantastic in its own ways, with new clever animations for when you're recording a video, charging the phone or taking a selfie, all efficiently using the extra display real estate. In terms of functionality, though, the cover screen's software is about the same as the 3.4-inch one on the Flip 6.\nThe Flip 7 impressed me in nearly every way but one: its battery life. It has a larger battery than the Flip 6, but it doesn't last any longer in daily use. It did consistently get me through a day on a single charge, often having 15 to 20% left, but there were also a few days where it needed an early evening top-off.\nWhy we like it\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the most fully realized version of Samsung's ideal of a flip phone since the launch of the original Galaxy Z Flip in 2020. The Flip 7's appeal is simple: It's a thin phone with a big, bold screen that folds in half into a coaster-sized square. The larger cover screen and inner screen make content more immersive. It's design is thin (for a clamshell foldable) and comfortable to hold. Plus you get twice the storage this year compared to last.\nWho is it best for\nIf you've been tempted by a clamshell-style foldable, you should definitely consider the Flip 7. If you have a Galaxy Z Flip 4 or older, the Flip 7 will be an upgrade in every way. It's harder to make that same recommendation for Flip 5 owners unless your phone is showing its age. And if you have a Galaxy Z Flip 6, you can sit this one out unless you really want those larger screens.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.\nBest Android phones compared\n| Product | Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | Google Pixel 9 | Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | Moto G Power 5G (2024) | Motorola Razr Plus (2024) | Samsung Galaxy Flip 6 | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED;

The Fold 7 replaces last year's Fold 6 and comes with a completely new design that makes it thinner, lighter and feel more like a \"regular phone.\" The Flip 7 is the best-built foldable flip phone we tested from Samsung. The thinner design and bigger displays are the headline features.\nFactors to consider when buying an Android phone\nLook at last year's phones: Companies typically keep previous models around at a discounted price. For example, while you can buy the $699 Pixel 8 or $999 Pixel 8 Pro for less than the current Pixel 9 equivalents.\nGet more for less with cheap phones: For a fraction of the cost, you can get a solid phone that does almost everything a pricier flagship phone can do. The Google Pixel 8A packs a good camera and is frequently discounted to under $400.\nCheck your Android type: Some phones, like Google's Pixel series, run a stock version of Android. Others, like Samsung's Galaxy phones, have their own software (OneUI) on top of Android. Each type has its own appeal and drawbacks. If you've been rocking a Samsung phone for years, you'll likely still be more at home on a new Galaxy phone.\nBe ready for Cyber Monday sales: The holidays usually bring big discounts and sales, even on phones.\nTest your phone: It's definitely worth going to a store and trying out a phone before you shell out hundreds of dollars for it.\nFind peace of mind with a case: You spent all this time choosing a phone, now protect it from damage with a case.\nHow we test phones\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates or to compare against new phones from phones from competitors like Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes such as the 4K 120fps slow motion mode that debuted on the iPhone 16 Pro or the Add Me photo tool that launched with the Google Pixel 9 series.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, which isn't always included in the initial review and is added later in an update.\nPerformance\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.\nRead more: How We Test Phones\nOther phones we tested\nSamsung's $650 Galaxy S24 FE is such a comfort to use that at moments our reviewer, Mike Sorrentino, felt like he was testing a scaled-back version of the $1,000 Galaxy S24 Plus. The S24 FE's large 6.7-inch 120Hz refresh-rate display made it easy for me to enjoy streaming shows, playing games and taking video calls throughout the day. And it includes nearly every software perk from the more expensive Galaxy S24 line. Read our full review of the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE.\nThe OnePlus 13 is the first true flagship phone of 2025 and there's plenty to like. From its powerful performance to its fast charging and vibrant display, it has much of what we expect from a top-end phone right now. It looks good too, has great waterproofing, a scattering of new AI skills and a reasonable six years of security support. But while accomplished in some respects, the OnePlus 13 feels more like a \"pretty good\" 2024 phone, rather than kicking off a new year of tech with any kind of fanfare. Read our OnePlus 13 review.\nAndroid phone FAQ\nWhich Android phone has the best camera?\nWhat are the best brands for Android phones?\nHow reliable is an Android phone?\nHow long does an Android phone last?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nSamsung teased the Galaxy S25 Edge at its January Galaxy Unpacked event. Not much is known about the phone aside from it being more slim than the regular Galaxy S25. Here's everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Google is expected to release the Pixel 10 series later this year."

      "text": "This year, the Google Pixel 10 series is not getting a price increase. We have pricing for the US for the entire lineup, and the only form of a price increase we will see this year is Google ditching the 128GB Pixel 10 Pro XL, which will bring up the starting price. But it\u2019s going to be the same price as the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nStarting off with the Pixel 10, it will be priced at $799 here in the US and $1,099 in Canada for the 128GB. The 256GB will jump up to $899 in the US and $1,229 in Canada. With the Pixel 10, Google is offering up six months of its Google AI Pro plan, six months of Fitbit Premium, and 3 months of YouTube Premium.\n| Google Pixel 10 | US Price | Canada Price |\n|---|---|---|\n| 128GB | $799 | $1,099 |\n| 256GB | $899 | $1,229 |\nWhile the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup will get a year of Google AI Pro (that\u2019s the Gemini Advanced + 2TB of Google One Storage plan), with three months of YouTube Premium and six months of Fitbit Premium. Basically the same offers that Google had for the Pixel 9 series last year.\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro will remain at $999\nMoving onto the Google Pixel 10 Pro, that one will remain at $999 for its starting price with 128GB of storage here. And in Canada, that starting price will be $1,349.\nThe 256GB model will cost $1,099 in the US and $1,479 in Canada. Moving onto the 512GB model, that will jump to $1,219 in the US and $1,649 in Canada, with the 1TB model topping out at $1,449 in the US and $1,949 in Canada.\n| Google Pixel 10 Pro | US Price | Canada Price |\n|---|---|---|\n| 128GB | $999 | $1,349 |\n| 256GB | $1,099 | $1,479 |\n| 512GB | $1,219 | $1,649 |\n| 1TB | $1,449 | $1,949 |\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro XL does have a new starting price of $1,199 however, keep in mind that is not really a price increase, as the Pixel 9 Pro XL at 256GB is the same price. And the same goes for Canada, which is starting at $1,629 for the 256GB model.\nThe 512GB Pixel 10 Pro XL will be priced at $1,319 in the US and $1,799 in Canada, with the 1TB model topping out at $1,549 in the uS and $2,099 in Canada.\n| Google Pixel 10 Pro XL | US Price | Canada Price |\n|---|---|---|\n| 256GB | $1,199 | $1,629 |\n| 512GB | $1,319 | $1,799 |\n| 1TB | $1,549 | $2,099 |\nFinally, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Despite earlier rumors, pricing is remaining the exact same this year. That\u2019s a starting price of $1,799 in the US, and $2,399 in Canada for the 256GB model.\nThe 512GB model will cost $1,919 and $2,569 in the US and Canada respectively. And the new 1TB model will cost $2,149 in the US and $2,869 in Canada.\n| Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold | US Price | Canada Price |\n|---|---|---|\n| 256GB | $1,799 | $2,399 |\n| 512GB | $1,919 | $2,569 |\n| 1TB | $2,149 | $2,869 |"

      "text": "Phone manufacturer HMD, known for making Nokia devices, on Thursday unveiled the HMD Skyline, a $500 handset designed to be easy to fix -- and easy to put down, thanks to a new Detox Mode. The phone will be available in the US in August.\nRepairability is a key focus for the upcoming handset. During a virtual briefing, a company representative demonstrated how quickly and easily someone could swap out parts; it took about 10 minutes to remove a dozen screws around the device and pop off the screen.\nThat DIY spirit echoes HMD's approach to three other phones it unveiled earlier this year: the HMD Pulse, Pulse Pro and Pulse Plus. Those budget-friendly devices are also designed to be easy to fix in just a few minutes.\nThis repairability focus comes amid mounting support for the right-to-repair movement, and a push for consumers to be able to fix their own devices at home. Parts retailer iFixit has partnered with companies, including HMD, to make it easier for consumers to access affordable repair kits. Such measures can also help to reduce e-waste, since users won't have to throw out their entire device if one component stops working or is too expensive to replace.\nThe Skyline's design lets users (or repair centers) fix and swap out screens, charging ports, back covers and batteries.\n\"Human Mobile Devices (HMD) has set a new bar for repairable design,\" iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens said in a statement. \"This is what happens when a design team considers repair from the start.\"\nRead more: Best Cheap Phone of 2024: Most Value for the Money\nDetox Mode will help you put down your phone\nAnother feature HMD is touting with its new Skyline phone is Detox Mode, which can block access to certain apps during a specified period. It can also prevent select contacts from reaching you. The function is comparable to features like Focus modes on iPhone and other Android phones.\nSee also: Why You Endlessly Scroll Through Your Phone, and How to Stop\nThere are two options to choose from: a soft detox that will hide apps and contacts until you enable full use again, and a hard detox mode that won't let you manually turn it off; instead, you'll have to wait until the scheduled time you've set elapses (though a built-in safety feature will give you the option to deactivate Detox Mode if you reboot your phone). The feature will also be available in August.\nTriple rear camera system and other specs\nThe Skyline features a 108-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel telephoto camera with 4x zoom and a 13-megapixel ultrawide camera. The front sports a 50-megapixel selfie camera.\nA Custom Button on the phone's side carries out whatever two functions you set when pressing and double-pressing it, like opening up a game with one push and navigating home with two pushes. This is similar to the iPhone's customizable Action Button, which lets you choose from a set of tasks like turning on the flashlight or launching the camera -- though with the Skyline, you can pack double the action(s).\nHMD's Skyline is powered by a Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor, and has a 4,600-mAh battery, which the company says can last for up to two days before running out. It supports 35-watt USB-C charging and 15-watt magnetic wireless charging, as well as 5-watt reverse wireless charging. It's Qi2 certified.\nRead more: Best $500 Phone for 2024\nThe Full HD Plus display measures 6.5 inches, and is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It has a 144Hz refresh rate, with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits.\nThe phone's frame is made of 100% recycled aluminum. Storage options include 8GB of RAM with 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, or 12GB of RAM with 256GB of internal storage. It also supports up to 1GB of external storage. The Skyline runs Android 14 out of the box. It comes in Neon Pink and Twisted Black.\nOne of the phone's biggest downsides may be its lack of long-term support for updates. The Skyline offers just two years of OS updates and three years of security updates, which pales in comparison to the seven years of OS and security updates you'll get on a similarly priced budget phone, the Google Pixel 8A. The $400 Samsung Galaxy A35 also offers more years of support than the Skyline, with four years of OS updates and five years of security updates. So even if you're able to swap out parts on the Skyline more easily, your timeline for a phone upgrade may still be quicker than you'd like.\nFor more HMD Skyline specs, check out the chart below.\nHMD Skyline specs\n| HMD Skyline | |\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.5-inch FHD+; 1,080 x 2400 pixels; 144Hz refresh rate |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 6.3 x 3 x 0.35 in. |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 159.8 x 75.7 x 8.9mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 209.5g (7.4 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 108-megapixel, 13-megapixel (ultrawide), 50-megapixel (telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 50-megapixel |\n| Processor | Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 |\n| RAM/storage | 8GB RAM + 128GB |\n| Expandable storage | 1GB |\n| Battery | 4,600 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Side |\n| Connector | USB-C |\n| Special features | Gen 2 repairability with display, back cover, battery and charging port repairs through iFixit; 15W magnetic wireless charging; 5W reverse wireless charging; Qi2 certified; programmable Custom Button and Power Button |\n| US price starts at | $500 (128GB) |"
