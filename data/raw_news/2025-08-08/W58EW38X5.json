      "text": "After years of planning, Netflix recently broke ground on its massive production studio planned for a 289-acre former Army base in Monmouth County.\nGov. Phil Murphy and Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos joined state and local officials last month to kick off the project, as a wrecking ball took its first swing to start demolition at the historic site.\nThe media giant has secured the local and state approvals it needs to move forward with phase one of its $903 million plan to transform the shuttered Army base into one of its largest film and television production hubs.\nHere\u2019s the latest on where the project stands and what\u2019s still to come:\nWhere will the new Netflix studio be located?\nNetflix won a $55 million bid in 2021 to acquire the 289-acre \u201cmega-parcel\u201d at Fort Monmouth, a former U.S. Army base spanning the boroughs of Oceanport and Eatontown near Route 35.\nThe base, originally established in 1917 as Camp Little Silver, played a key role in military communications and technology development.\nIt was home to several major innovations, including the development of FM radio. It was also the site of Project Diana \u2014 a 1940s experiment that successfully bounced radar signals off the Moon.\n\u201cNearly 80 years ago, the U.S. Army worked within the halls of Fort Monmouth to send radar signals to the stars for the first time as part of Project Diana,\u201d Gov. Phil Murphy said at the Netflix studio groundbreaking in May. \u201cSoon, Netflix will work within these same walls to capture and send stars of a different variety into the homes and screens of millions of viewers around the world.\u201d\nFort Monmouth officially closed in 2011. More than 5,000 civilian and military jobs relocated to an Army base in Maryland.\nThe property includes several historic, protected sites like the parade grounds, World War II Memorial and Cowan Park, all of which must be preserved during development, according to officials.\nWhat is Netflix building at Fort Monmouth?\nNetflix wants to transform Fort Monmouth into a state-of-the-art film and television production campus.\nThe $903 million project includes 12 soundstages totaling nearly 500,000 square feet, along with production and office buildings.\nA hotel, cafeteria, helipad, theater, retail shops, studio trailer parks, water tanks for aquatic filming and visitor attractions are also planned.\nAccording to recent site plans, the infrastructure will include new roads, sidewalks, landscaping and stormwater systems. And the entire campus will be enclosed by a precast concrete wall monitored by security.\nThe studio is expected to be one of Netflix\u2019s largest, similar to the company\u2019s 300-acre facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Netflix officials previously told NJ Advance Media.\nWhen will it be finished?\nDemolition at Fort Monmouth began May 2025 following the ceremonial groundbreaking, marking the start of a 13-month teardown of the aging Army buildings.\nOnce demolition is complete, construction will move forward in two phases over the next few years.\nPhase one will focus on the 29-acre McAfee Zone, which spans Oceanport and about three acres of Eatontown. The area includes the 90,000-square-foot McAfee Center and a 1965 bowling alley, both slated for demolition. In total, 15 buildings will be cleared to make way for new facilities.\nThe first phase of construction includes building four soundstages, converting the McAfee Center into studio offices and production support space, and constructing a warehouse and mill building.\nThe buildings will not be open to the public and are intended for cast, crew and studio operations, according to planning documents.\nPhase two will include building the remaining eight soundstages, more production and office buildings, and visitor attractions.\nUnder terms set by the Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority, the agency overseeing the site\u2019s redevelopment, both phases must be completed within eight years of the land deal\u2019s closing.\nNetflix expects the entire production campus to be finished by 2028, officials said.\nWho has approved the plan so far?\nSince announcing its proposal to build a production campus at Fort Monmouth, Netflix has received several key approvals at the state and local level.\nThe first major approval came from the Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority in February 2024.\nFollowing a 45-day public comment period, the authority unanimously approved an amendment establishing zoning for the project, allowing the base to be reused as a studio under Netflix\u2019s plans.\nThe initial reuse plans were also signed off by Gov. Phil Murphy.\nBy the end of 2024, both Jersey Shore towns where the studio will be located, Oceanport and Eatontown, approved Netflix\u2019s phase one site plans.\nA second application, covering the remainder of the campus, will go before the Eatontown Planning Board in August.\nAre there any concerns about Netflix\u2019s plans?\nMurphy and other state officials have been vocal supporters of Netflix\u2019s planned production hub, calling it a catalyst for making New Jersey \u201cthe future of entertainment.\u201d\nStill, there have been some local-level concerns throughout the approval process.\nPublic meetings leading up to state and municipal sign-offs revealed a range of community worries, including traffic congestion, construction noise, building aesthetics and the potential impact on nearby wetlands.\nSome residents questioned whether the development would strain local emergency services. Others criticized Netflix\u2019s plan for a concrete perimeter wall, with one Oceanport planning board member saying it clashed with Fort Monmouth\u2019s historic character and should be built with brick instead.\nDespite the concerns, the project continues to advance, with Netflix and state officials highlighting its potential to create thousands of jobs and generate billions for New Jersey\u2019s economy.\nIs the Netflix studio getting any tax breaks?\nNetflix is set to receive hundreds of millions in tax breaks as part of its plan to build a production studio on Fort Monmouth.\nThe company will have access to a $150 million pool of incentives and a potential 40% tax credit through New Jersey\u2019s Film and Digital Media Tax Credit program, according to the state Economic Development Authority.\nIt has also been approved for up to $387 million in tax credits under the authority\u2019s Aspire program, which supports large-scale development projects with long-term economic benefits. In exchange, Netflix has committed to operating the studio in New Jersey for at least 10 years.\nAccording to state officials, the production campus will create more than 3,500 construction jobs and employ about 1,400 people once operational.\nOver 20 years, the studio is projected to contribute between $3.8 billion and $4.6 billion to New Jersey\u2019s economy, state officials said.\nAt the groundbreaking last month, Murphy said \u201cgood-paying jobs are soon to follow\u201d as construction begins.\n\u201cAs we begin building the 12 state-of-the-art soundstages that will anchor this facility, we\u2019ll rely on New Jersey\u2019s construction workers to get the job done,\u201d Murphy said.\nStories by Nyah Marshall\nOur journalism needs your support.

      "text": "Happy Gilmore has an anger problem.\nIt\u2019s what makes the famously quick-tempered hockey enthusiast-turned-golfer the star he is.\nAdam Sandler\u2019s \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d released in 1996, is one of his celebrated movies about how red-hot rage, when channeled productively, can lead to greatness \u2014 and great comedy. (Another example is \u201cThe Waterboy\u201d from 1998.)\n\u201cI always power my drives the old-fashioned way \u2014 with rage,\" Gilmore says in the sequel \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d arriving on Netflix Friday (July 25).\nBut with the explosive Gilmore safely ensconced in middle age, content with his marriage, his big family and his career as a pro golfer, it makes sense for him to ask his wife, Virginia Venit, if he should retire from the sport.\nBecause while life can supply an endless stream of irritations, Gilmore is generally at ease at the start of \u201cHappy Gilmore 2.\u201d\nHowever, the sequel, arriving almost 30 years after the first movie, doesn\u2019t let Happy enjoy that peace for much longer.\nA great tragedy, which will remain nameless here (no spoiler!), blows up his world. Golf is banished from his life. All he wants to do is numb the pain with alcohol. Household objects, golf equipment and produce \u2014 remote control, golf ball, cucumber \u2014 are all just flasks in disguise that feed his habit.\nAs Gilmore approaches rock bottom, desperation and depression cloud his usual rage.\nWhere will Happy work it all out?\nNew Jersey, of course.\nSandler, who has become a Jersey regular while filming various Netflix movies on local streets, spent last fall making \u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u2033 here with director Kyle Newacheck.\n\u201cMy goodness, you have some beautiful golf courses out there in New Jersey,\u201d Newacheck tells NJ Advance Media.\nThe movie filmed extensively in Jersey \u2014 nine counties total \u2014 with golf action happening at nine Garden State greens and driving ranges in Bergen, Essex, Monmouth, Morris, Somerset and Warren counties (see county-by-county list of film locations below).\nGilmore also practices his swing in places like Ideal Beach in Middletown.\nAnother kind of Jersey landmark impressed Newacheck.\n\u201cYour airport: fan-tastic,\u201d he says.\nNewark Liberty International Airport is home to what the director describes as \u201ca big airplane joke\u201d in the film.\n\u201cEverybody was really cool and it looked great,\u201d he says.\nThe state Economic Development Authority tells NJ Advance Media that the production spent $152 million in New Jersey, receiving a $62.5 million tax credit.\nNewacheck, 41, started scouting locations for the film last summer.\n\u201cI really liked some old buildings we shot in,\u201d he says. \u201cMy only complaint is how humid it was when I was walking around scouting. I mean, it\u2019s not even really a complaint. I just remember that my entire being was covered in sweat, and I wasn\u2019t used to that feeling.\u201d\nNewacheck, who hails from California, is one of the creators and stars of the Comedy Central series \u201cWorkaholics.\u201d He previously directed Sandler in the 2019 Netflix movie \u201cMurder Mystery,\u201d co-starring Jennifer Aniston. He was also a director and producer on the FX comedy series \u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows.\u201d\nSandler, now 58, filmed the first \u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d when he was in his late 20s and still at the beginning of his movie career. Arriving not long after the 1995 box office success of \u201cBilly Madison,\u201c the film strengthened his presence as a lead in film comedies. The irascible Gilmore charmed Sandler\u2019s growing fanbase.\n\u201cI think he hit a main vein,\u201d Newacheck says of the film\u2019s enduring popularity. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s these projects that speak to people on a level that is almost unexplainable. But I believe that this one is because people love the character of Happy Gilmore. People love the bad boy that entered golf 30 years ago. That fish-out-of-water story was truly hilarious.\n\u201cThe scene when he comes in to the country club wearing his, like, sleeveless Aerosmith shirt and then juxtaposed against all of the gold jackets and the hoity-toity, the nose-up snobbery of golf, I think that made Adam Sandler the people\u2019s champ,\u201d he says. \u201cSomehow that just started him on his way to being the most relatable main character that\u2019s out there.\u201d\nAdam Sandler: Everyman\nSandler gives Gilmore a lovable, rough-around-the-edges quality.\n\u201cI think there is a real element of Adam himself who remains an everyman somehow,\u201d Newacheck says of the comedy giant, who has a reported $250 million deal with Netflix, having first linked up with the streamer in 2014.\nThe filmmaker says Gilmore\u2019s \u201che feels just like me\u201d vibe remains at the heart of Happy, even when he\u2019s made it to the pinnacle of his sport.\n\u201cI think when it comes to Happy Gilmore, the character, it\u2019s really interesting because simultaneously, you have a golf superhero who essentially can hit the ball longer than anybody and he\u2019s just naturally talented,\u201d Newacheck says. \u201cYou have a golf superhero and an underdog ... who people love rooting for to make it ... So you\u2019re getting the best of both worlds with this character.\u201d\nWhen \u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u2033 put out casting calls for local background actors and extras, people jumped at the chance to be in the sequel. And when Sandler posted a photo of Gilmore\u2019s Boston Bruins jersey on a hanger in September, fans ate it up.\nYears of rewatches and new generations discovering Gilmore have given the sequel a potent nostalgia push.\nAnticipation for Happy\u2019s comeback \u201cmakes the stakes high,\u201d Newacheck says.\nWorking with an established character like Gilmore \u201cprovides its own challenge, knowing that OK, we need to make something that is comparable to (the first movie), and this has 30 years of love cooked into it,\u201d the director says. \u201cBut there\u2019s also the other side of that, which is \u2018hey, this has 30 years of love cooked into it. They love this guy.\u2019 So we\u2019re starting with a little bit of a leg up, I guess.\"\nAs with the first \u201cHappy Gilmore,\u201d which was directed by Dennis Dugan, Sandler co-wrote the sequel with fellow \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Tim Herlihy, his collaborator since they were roommates at New York University.\n\u201cI think he felt pressure,\u201d Newacheck says of Sandler\u2019s return to Gilmore.\n\u201cHow many pieces of art are out there that are 30 years in the making at this level of cultural relevance? ... It\u2019s up on pedestal. You know, there\u2019s a \u2018we gotta do this right.\u2019 There\u2019s a pressure. But I believe that Sandler works great under pressure ... He didn\u2019t have to make this movie. He wouldn\u2019t have made it unless it was the right time to make this movie and the right story to support the character.\u201d\nCallbacks to 1996, returning cast and real family\nIn this latest chapter, Happy Gilmore can\u2019t wallow in his own self-destruction for too long.\nAs with the first movie, he finds his motivation in trying to get money to help a loved one (in the original film, it is his grandmother, who is about to lose her home).\nHe starts the sequel riding high from his long and successful golf career, but after a series of unfortunate incidents, he loses almost all of his money.\nHis daughter, Vienna, played by Sandler\u2019s real teen daughter Sunny Sandler, is excelling in ballet and has a chance at attending a prestigious ballet school in Paris. But Gilmore will have to come up with the money to send her there.\nHe rallies to make a return to golf, which comes with a comically rich readjustment period.\nWith Gilmore, it always seems to be one step forward, three steps back \u2014 especially when he mixes alcohol with his volatility on the golf course and that tendency to fly off the handle.\n\u201cIn this movie, he\u2019s got a whole bunch of new flaws that he has to fight through,\u201d Newacheck says.\nFor every one of those flaws, there are seemingly tenfold familiar faces that show up in the movie.\nEmmy winner Julie Bowen (\u201cModern Family\u201d) returns as Happy\u2019s love Virginia Venit, Christopher McDonald is back as Happy\u2019s original nemesis, golf pro Shooter McGavin, and Ben Stiller returns as the dastardly, mustachioed Hal L., who cooks up yet another self-serving scheme.\nREAD MORE: Hole-in-one? \u2018Happy Gilmore 2,\u2019 filmed in N.J., breaks Netflix and Adam Sandler records.\nThere are flashbacks to the first film and callbacks to famous lines (\u201cI eat pieces of sh-- like you for breakfast,\u201d \u201cYou eat pieces of sh-- for breakfast?\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re in my world now, Grandma\u201d). Gilmore tries to call upon the original movie\u2019s lessons to guide him back to the game that brought him glory.\nThe sequel takes time to remember \u201cGilmore\u201d stars who are no longer with us, including Bob Barker (\u201cThe price is wrong, b----!\u201d) and Carl Weathers, who played Happy\u2019s mentor Chubbs Peterson (\u201cIt\u2019s all in the hips\u201d).\nThis time, Sandler spotlights his family, who has appeared in many of his films since the Gilmore days. His daughters have taken on major roles in movies he\u2019s produced in recent years (\u201cYou Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah,\u201d plus two films currently in production in New Jersey via his Happy Madison Productions).\nIn addition to Sunny Sandler, 16, who plays Gilmore\u2019s daughter Vienna, his other daughter Sadie Sandler, 19, plays a character who encourages Happy on his comeback journey. Sandler\u2019s wife, Jackie Sandler, is Vienna\u2019s ballet teacher.\n\u201cThe truth in what they\u2019re saying to each other comes out a little bit more naturally because they\u2019ve already spent so much time with each other,\u201d Newacheck says of the Sandlers. \u201cThey know each other inside and out. That chemistry is something that is very hard to find, chemistry that works on screen with strangers. With Sunny and Adam, the chemistry is there.\u201d\nGilmore also has four grown sons \u2014 Terry (Conor Sherry), Wayne (Ethan Cutkosky of \u201cShameless\u201d), Gordie (professional wrestler Maxwell Jacob Friedman) and Bobby (Philip Schneider) \u2014 a raucous bunch who definitely inherited his propensity for explosive rage and brawling.\nNew to Gilmore\u2019s nemesis roster is actor-director Benny Safdie (\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d \u201cUncut Gems\u201d).\nHe plays Frank Manatee, president of Maxi Golf, a new, rival league with a secret weapon that grants players Gilmore-like power. Manatee tries to court Gilmore to join him and turn against his fellow golden-jacketed golf champions.\nAmong Manatee\u2019s recruits: a golfer played by Haley Joel Osment.\nAn ensuing golf tournament, choreographed with flashy obstacles, turns the sport into an event that might have more in common with \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d and \u201cWipeout.\u201d Gilmore finds himself on a quest to save the soul of golf.\nMore Jersey locations in the movie include the former Essex County Isolation Hospital/Soho Hospital in Belleville (Arkham State Hospital in \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\u201d), as well as Stop & Shop in Clifton Commons.\nGilmore, who takes a job at the supermarket, hurls the appropriately named Manatee into the seafood department\u2019s lobster tank.\nWhen the production was not shooting on location, scenes were filmed at Sustainable Studios in Moonachie.\nThe exterior of Gilmore\u2019s house was filmed in Irvington. A Belleville house played the interior. There, professional golfer John Daly seems especially at home in Sandler\u2019s world, having shacked up with Gilmore and his family in the movie.\n\u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u2033 brings plentiful cameos from other pro golfers past and present, like Jack Nicklaus, Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka, Nelly Korda, Paige Spiranac and Collin Morikawa.\nLest anyone should accuse the film of not being golf-centered, there\u2019s even more: Tony Finau, Will Zalatoris, Nancy Lopez, Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas, Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau.\nThe Sandlerverse and celebrity casting\nWho else is in \u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u2033?\nA more useful question might be \u201cwho isn\u2019t in \u2018Happy Gilmore 2\u2032?\u201c\nThe huge cast sees actors from the Happyverse and wider Sandlerverse \u2014 Steve Buscemi, Jon Lovitz, Lavell Crawford, Kevin Nealon, Blake Clark, Kym Whitley, Rob Schneider, Nick Swardson, Oliver Hudson and John Farley (brother of Chris) \u2014 meet pop-ins from music superstars like Eminem (in a wig for a standout role as a new heckler), Kid Cudi, aka Scott Mescudi, and Post Malone, aka Austin Post.\nGlobal megastar Bad Bunny, aka Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, has the most screen time of that group as Oscar Mejias, a waiter who Gilmore recruits to be his caddie.\nMejias has his own nemesis in the form of a fellow waiter played by Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, plus memorable support onscreen from \u201cSNL\u201d star Marcello Hernandez.\nBasketball player Boban Marjanovi\u0107, who stands at 7-foot-4, plays the son of Mr. Larson, who was played by the late Richard Kiel (7-foot-1) in the original film.\nRetired sportscaster Verne Lundquist returns from the first movie to play himself, and is joined by others from sports media including Stephen A.

She trained as a ballet dancer at the School of American Ballet and performed with the New York City Ballet.\n\u201cShe actually just celebrated her 20-year anniversary with us,\u201d says Diaz, who directed the \u201cShrek\u201d musical.\nIt was the first time her famous uncle attended a BergenPAC production.\n\u201cShe invited him to the show,\u201d Diaz says. \u201cWe were fortunate enough and lucky enough that he was free and he wanted to come see the show.\u201d\n\u201cKirsten\u2019s father, who\u2019s Nathan\u2019s brother, on Thursday (July 31) came to the show and he was blown away by it. And we chatted in the lobby in intermission and he says \u2018I\u2019m gonna tell my brother, he has to come. He has to come.\u2019\u201d\nThe morning of the show that Sunday, Diaz learned from Kirsten Lane that her uncle would be attending.\nThat\u2019s how the BergenPAC director introduced the actor to the cast at the end of \u201cShrek the Musical\u201d \u2014 \u201cKirsten\u2019s uncle.\u201d\n\u201cThe show was great, it was phenomenal,\u201d Diaz says. \u201cThe experience for the students was amazing. So this was the icing on the cake on the final performance to have him in the audience and not just sit there as an uncle, but as Broadway royalty. It was a standing ovation at the end, and he was up there clapping and smiling. And his husband actually had his phone out and he was filming the finale and the standing ovation with a big smile on his face.
