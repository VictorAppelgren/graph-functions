      "feedback": "The draft has a solid real‑rate framing and credible ETH/BTC anchor points, ETF/institutional demand, and regulatory tailwinds, but its value would rise sharply with a tighter, 4–6 sentence house view and a crystal‑clear, testable regime map; the current version heavily granularizes sources and risk signals without delivering a crisp decision‑useful line of sight. Actionable edits: (1) compress into a 4–6 sentence/bullet format that states a single house view, then a three‑regime map (Base, Upside, Downside) with explicit probabilities and concrete invalidation rules; (2) make the first‑principles chain explicit and quantifiable: policy stance changes → real rates → discount rates → ETH staking/treasury demand/ETF inflows → price discovery; attach sensitivity notes (e.g., how a 25–50bp shift in real rates or a 20–30% drop in ETF inflows would shift ETH/BTC); (3) tighten and align quantitative anchors exactly to sources: ETH near 4,900–4,955; BTC 110k–120k; ETF inflows ~9.6b July–early Aug (plus ~5b in July); staking ~1/3 supply; Bitmine Immersion’s $45m; tariff pass‑through ~70%; unemployment claims ~1.97m with 4‑week avg ~226k; let those anchors drive the narrative rather than repeating multiple price cells; (4) remove or relegate tangential non‑crypto items (e.g., Walmart/Goodyear consumer signals) to a concise cross‑asset backdrop only if you explicitly tie them to policy/inflation channels; (5) explicitly name and reconcile critical sources (OGK8WLL69, Scraped Source 6, 4, 3, GZ9VV1RV0, U6HXAJR4J, STBVARD8F, SGB2PAZGK, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ, Y6SQOEK69, NL5YYTLF2, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, 22PL3Q360) and ensure every forward‑looking claim has a matching cited anchor; (6) add a concrete watch-list with thresholds (e.g., ETF inflows hold above/below July pace; Jackson Hole tone shifts; Nvidia momentum; tariff pass‑through changes) tied to regime re‑pricing, plus a single invalidation rule: if core CPI/moM accelerates beyond ~0.40% or if ETF/institutional demand deteriorates meaningfully, pivot to Regime B/C; (7) ensure internal consistency across horizons (0–3 weeks vs. multi‑year) and avoid contradictory price paths by presenting one core base path anchored in the policy/real‑rate channel and a parallel but clearly labeled macro cross‑asset backdrop.",
