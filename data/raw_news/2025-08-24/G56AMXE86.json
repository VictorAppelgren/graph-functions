  "title": "Man Utd's next transfer 'advanced' after major Senne Lammens decision made",
  "description": "Manchester United have wanted another goalkeeper since the start of this year, and the club could finally sign a new one before the summer transfer window ends",
  "content": "Manchester United are said to be advancing towards signing Senne Lammens. The Belgium international did not play for Royal Antwerp in their 2-1 win over KV Mechelen on Sunday. United have not dismissed the idea of bringing in a goalkeeper before the summer transfer window slams shut, but they're not in the market for a new number one. Earlier this year, the Manchester Evening News revealed that the club wanted a new shot-stopper.\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest Man Utd news Join us on WhatsApp Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

The Old Trafford outfit had explored the possibility of loaning Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa, but they quickly dismissed suggestions of signing Gianluigi Donnarumma. Lammens is the latest option they are showing interest in, and Antwerp leaving their goalkeeper out of the squad for this weekend's game is the surest sign that his future lies away from the club. Michel-Ange Balikwisha was also missing as he is close to sealing a move to Celtic.\n\nLammens had started the first four matches of the Jupiler Pro League season, letting in a goal in each game while helping his team to an unbeaten start. Galatasaray, Inter Milan and Lille have all shown interest in the 23-year-old, but United appear to be the frontrunners. The journalist Fabrizio Romano claims negotiations are advancing with the clubs close to agreeing on a fee. Personal terms are said to be already approved by the player.\n\nLammens made 60 appearances for Antwerp across the last two seasons after signing from Club Brugge. The goalkeeper kept 12 clean sheets across those matches. He then earned a first senior national team call-up in March, with a second following during June. That came after nine appearances for the under-21s over recent years, who he is now no longer able to represent after turning 23 in July.",

Bayindir was beaten directly from a corner for Son Heung-min's winner.\nBayindir, 26, would have to leave this month if United were to sign an immediate replacement. Third-choice 'keeper Tom Heaton, who turns 39 in April, is out of contract in the summer and Amorim believes he will have the leverage to strengthen the United goalkeeping department in the summer.\nOnana has conceded 26 goals in 19 Premier League games this term and had a particularly dire December, committing errors against Nottingham Forest, Viktoria Plzen and Wolves. His hesitancy at corners was exploited by Arsenal, who scored both goals from corner kicks in their 2-0 victory over United, before Wolves playmaker Matheus Cunha scored directly from a corner against Onana in United's 2-0 loss at Molineux.\nUnited paid Inter Milan \u00a347.2m for Onana a year after he left Ajax on a free transfer. The Cameroon international has kept 20 clean sheets in 70 appearances."
