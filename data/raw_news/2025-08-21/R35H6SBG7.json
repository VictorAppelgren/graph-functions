  "title": "Lucha VaVoom de La Liz bids farewell to beloved DTLA venue the Mayan",
  "description": "Lucha VaVoom de La Liz will have its final show at DTLA stronghold the Mayan on Friday. Members of the wrestling-meets-burlesque extravaganza share memories of the venue.",
  "content": "These are the shared ingredients that make up the seemingly incongruous pairing of lucha libre and burlesque that local company Lucha VaVoom de La Liz has offered the public for over two decades at Downtown L.A.\u2019s the Mayan theater.\n\nThat run will come to an end at 8 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 22, with VaVoom\u2019s \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Fabulous\u201d showcase. While the cadre of talent at VaVoom is here to stay, the Mayan is permanently closing its doors at the end of September after 35 years under its current management.\n\nThe 98-year-old venue\u2019s shuttering was announced in a social media post in July. Its president, Sammy Chao, shared a statement with The Times about its closing.\n\n\u201c[T]he past five years have delivered an unrelenting barrage of adversity,\u201d wrote Chao. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything possible to stay afloat, adapt and serve, but the path forward has been eroded beyond recognition. We have given this business everything we have \u2014 and more \u2014 and come this far, so the decision to close is not so much one of defeat, but of necessity and truth.\u201d\n\nBut worry not, lucha lovers: Lucha VaVoom is determined to send the DTLA staple out with a bang.\n\n\u201cPhysically, I\u2019m preparing more because I got pressure since I\u2019m the one on the poster. I gotta look like the [cartoonishly muscular] guy that\u2019s on there,\u201d said longtime VaVoom luchador Magno (real name Oscar Vasquez), who is one of the main performers at Friday\u2019s extravaganza.\n\n\u201cMentally, it\u2019s hard though, because I\u2019ve been [with VaVoom] for like 21 years now... I started with them when I was 19 and now I\u2019m 41,\u201d Magno said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a tough one, especially because all the feelings, all the times that I\u2019ve been there. To me it\u2019s very special.\u201d\n\nHaving initially worked with WWE, Magno left the televised spectacle and was immediately contacted by VaVoom owner Liz Fairbairn, who got him back in the ring as soon as she could.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet. We\u2019ve had such a close relationship with the Mayan and the owner Sammy and everybody has become family,\u201d Fairbairn said of her organization\u2019s partnership with the downtown theater. \u201cPeople change and come and go over 23 years, but Sammy has been a constant. I honestly couldn\u2019t see us still being here if it wasn\u2019t for Sammy. He\u2019s been very nurturing and supportive of us.\u201d\n\nFairbairn noted that there is a special video in the works for Friday\u2019s performance and that the roster of performers is larger than usual for this last go. She\u2019s also built in time for everyone to \u201cshed a tear and share a hug\u201d by keeping the event running until 1:30 a.m.\n\nThe show\u2019s \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Fabulous\u201d theme was inspired by Beyonce\u2019s y\u2019all-ed up album, \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d It includes the western-themed tagline, \u201cSaddle up! Get your hat and boots ready to experience the best show ever.\u201d Serendipitously, the Friday event works as a fitting last rodeo for VaVoom at the Mayan.\n\nThe performance\u2019s bonus burlesque component adds a unique touch to the average wrestling event and provides for a different crowd experience for all involved. (Attendees must be over the age of 21.)\n\nRuby Champagne (real name Laura Avina) first caught wind of the Mayan in the late \u201890s and early 2000s, as she enjoyed salsa dancing at the venue almost every week. It wasn\u2019t until 2010 that she joined VaVoom as a ring girl before ultimately stepping into the role of burlesque dancer \u2014 an art form that she\u2019s studied for 19 years.\n\n\u201cI like to think that I\u2019m presenting not just classic burlesque, but also a little bit of a Latin flair,\u201d says Champagne. \u201cI usually tend to include [that] in most of my performances, but more so for Lucha VaVoom since it\u2019s with Mexican wrestling, and my tagline is \u2018Mexican spitfire of burlesque,\u2019 so I like to portray that every chance.\u201d\n\nAside from her first burlesque performance with VaVoom, one of Champagne\u2019s most memorable moments at the Mayan came last year.\n\n\u201cIn 2024, I got to be a go-go dancer for DJ Irene\u2019s birthday party at the Mayan,\u201d Champagne recalled. \u201cI felt like that was full circle for me because I had gone to the Mayan for house music as well. I had been a fan of DJ Irene since the \u201890s. [I] was like, \u2018Oh my gosh!\u2019\u201d\n\nReflecting on the gravity of one final sold-out show at the Mayan, Magno acknowledged there will be \u201chard feelings there in a good way,\u201d while Fairbairn said that VaVoom will never truly leave the Mayan.\n\n\u201cWe will always have a part of the Mayan in us,\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly, the Mayan is so integrated with Lucha VaVoom, there\u2019s no way we won\u2019t carry it around with us. So many memories. Twenty-three years of amazing memories.\u201d",

      "text": "- Share via\nThe Mayan, a popular music venue and nightclub in downtown L.A., announced Monday morning that it will be closing under its current management after a 35-year run.\n\u201cIt is with heavy yet grateful hearts that we announce The Mayan will be closing its doors at the end of September, after 35 unforgettable years,\u201d read a statement from the venue\u2019s Instagram page. \u201cTo our loyal patrons, community and friends: thank you for your unwavering support, your trust and the countless memories we\u2019ve created together. You made every night truly special.\u201d\nThe announcement also called on longtime and potentially new patrons to celebrate the club\u2019s final months in fashion, with weekly Saturday dance nights through Sept. 13.\nKnown for embracing camp, silliness and an element of awe, the indie lucha libre company Lucha VaVoom rings in two-plus decades of high-flying fun with a pair of Valentine\u2019s Day shows.\nIt is currently unknown what, if anything, the historic venue will be used for after the Mayan shutters.\nIn a statement to The Times, the Mayan\u2019s president, Sammy Chao, expressed gratitude to the community for a successful 35-year run, but noted that the years since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had been particularly difficult for the business.\n\u201c[T]he past five years have delivered an unrelenting barrage of adversity: the ongoing fallout of the pandemic, rising operational costs and staggering inflation, industry-wide strikes, dramatically shifting consumer habits, catastrophic fires, political unrest, and public policies at the city, state, and federal levels that have increasingly burdened small businesses and the workers who keep this city alive,\u201d Chao\u2019s message read. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything possible to stay afloat, adapt and serve, but the path forward has been eroded beyond recognition. We have given this business everything we have \u2014 and more \u2014 and come this far, so the decision to close is not so much one of defeat, but of necessity and truth.\u201d\nThe Mayan Theater \u2014 located at 1038 S. Hill St., next door to the Belasco \u2014 first opened Aug. 15, 1927, with a performance of George Gershwin\u2019s Broadway musical \u201cOh Kay.\u201d As its name alludes to, the theater is one of the best known examples of the Mayan Revival architectural movement that took place in the U.S. during the 1920s and 1930s, which drew inspiration from pre-Columbian Mesoamerican structures.\nAs The Times reported in 1989, the giant bas-relief figures on the venue\u2019s exterior are of the Maya god Huitzilopochtli seated on a symbolic earth monster. The three-tiered chandelier in the theater \u2014 rigged for red, blue and amber lights \u2014 is a replica of the Aztec calendar stone found near Mexico City. The design of tapered pillars was inspired by the Palace of the Governors at Uxmal, a Maya ruin on Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula dating from AD 800.\nOn Aug. 15, 1927, the Mayan Theatre--with scowling Pre-Columbian gods staring down at first nighters--opened with the Broadway production of George Gershwin\u2019s \u201cOh Kay.\u201d\nMexican anthropologist and sculptor Francisco Cornejo assisted the architects to craft a building that was based on authentic designs of pre-Columbian American societies.\nDuring the Great Depression, the theater was rented out to the Works Projects Administration, which operated it as an Actors Workshop theater. In 1944, Black producer, director and entrepreneur Leon Norman Hefflin Sr., staged a production of the popular and well-reviewed musical \u201cSweet \u2018N Hot,\u201d which starred Black film and stage icon Dorothy Dandridge.\nThe Fouce family gained ownership of the theater in 1947 and shifted the venue\u2019s programming toward Spanish-language film screenings and performers. By the early 1970s, Peruvian-born filmmaker and actor Carlos Tobalina gained ownership of the theater and changed the programming to focus on pornographic and X-rated films.\nThe Exotikon Super Shock Show on Thursday will feature a performance by world-class magician Rob Zabrecky, spooky-themed live music by Ghouly Gal and Jimmy Psycho and the Infernal Order of the Black Flame, burlesque dancers and more.\nIn 1990, the Mayan was brought under new management and inhabited its current form as a nightclub and music venue. The city has since declared the building as an official L.A. Historic-Cultural Monument.\nThe Mayan has been used as a shooting location for many film productions, including the 1992 box-office smash \u201cThe Bodyguard,\u201d starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston; the 1998 skit-to-feature film \u201cA Night at the Roxbury;\u201d the 1979 Ramones-led musical comedy \u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 Roll High School;\u201d and, most recently, the Netflix wrestling-themed series \u201cGLOW.\u201d\nIn recent years, the Mayan has played host to the cheeky lucha libre and burlesque show called Lucha VaVoom de La Liz and has held concerts by acts such as Jack White, M.I.A. and Prophets of Rage."

      "text": "The biggest takeaways from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019\n- Share via\nBeyonc\u00e9 told us 10 days before she dropped \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d: It\u2019s not a country album. It\u2019s a Beyonc\u00e9 album.\nThe singles from the album, \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em\u201d and \u201c16 Carriages,\u201d and its rodeo-chic aesthetic certainly gave the impression that the album would be pure country, but the final product, which the star released at the stroke of midnight on Friday, is a genre-defying wonder.\nFeaturing collaborations with country legends including Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, Beyonc\u00e9 uses the album to both honor classic country music and redefine what the genre sounds and looks like.\nHere are the biggest takeaways from \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d:\n\u2018Cowboy Carter,\u2019 Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s anticipated follow-up to \u2018Renaissance,\u2019 drops this week. Here\u2019s what we know so far, including the album\u2019s track list.\nThe significance of the \u2018Blackbird\u2019 cover\nThe second song on the album is a stirring rendition of the Beatles classic \u201cBlackbird,\u201d featuring four up-and-coming Black female country artists: Brittney Spencer, Reyna Roberts, Tanner Adell and Tiera Kennedy.\nWhile the song is one the Beatles\u2019 most well-known tunes, its meaning and inspiration is lesser known. Paul McCartney has said that he was inspired by the civil rights movement of the \u201860s, and specifically, by the Little Rock Nine \u2014 the first Black students to enter a previously all-white high school in Arkansas in 1957.\nThe powerful meaning behind the song, coupled with the spotlight on rising Black women in country, make the cover a poignant addition to \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d\n\u2018Jolene\u2019 is reinvented with Dolly Parton\u2019s blessing\nIn the most-anticipated and teased collaboration on the album, Beyonc\u00e9 breathes new life into Parton\u2019s hit \u201cJolene.\u201d In the interlude \u201cDolly P,\u201d Parton references the infamous \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d mentioned in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s song \u201cSorry\u201d from \u201cLemonade.\u201d\n\u201cHey, miss Honey Bey. It\u2019s Dolly P. You know that hussy with the good hair you sang about?\u201d she says on the track. \u201cReminded me of someone I knew back when. Except she has flaming locks of auburn hair. Bless her heart. Just a hair of a different color, but it hurts just the same.\u201d\nHalf a century after release, the country star\u2019s song based loosely on a flirtation between her husband and a bank teller is Parton\u2019s most covered creation.\nThe interlude leads into \u201cJolene,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s cover of Parton\u2019s prominent 1973 track about a woman flirting with her then-husband. Beyonc\u00e9 rewrites the lyrics to make the song less of a plea for Jolene to leave her man alone, and more of a warning of what\u2019s to come if she doesn\u2019t do so.\n\u201cI\u2019m warnin\u2019 you, woman, find you your own man,\u201d she sings. \u201cJolene, I know I\u2019m a queen, Jolene, I\u2019m still a Creole banjee b\u2014 from Louisianne (Don\u2019t try me).\u201d\nParton had previously given Beyonc\u00e9 her consequential stamp of approval, saying she couldn\u2019t wait to hear the full album, and also hinted at a \u201cJolene\u201d cover ahead of the tracklist\u2019s release. She\u2019s since praised the cover.\nMiley Cyrus returns to her country roots\nOne of the biggest surprises to come out of \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is Beyonc\u00e9 and Miley Cyrus\u2019 duet, \u201cII Most Wanted.\u201d Cyrus, who won her first Grammy in February, is the daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus and has dabbled in country-inspired work throughout her career, including her own noteworthy cover of her godmother\u2019s hit \u201cJolene.\u201d\nThe song shows off the two artists\u2019 impressive vocal chops, and they sing that they will be each other\u2019s \u201cshotgun rider\u201d forever.\nBeyonc\u00e9 became the first Black woman to top Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs chart this week amid questions about the genre embracing her latest reinvention.\nCyrus took to Instagram to share her gratitude for Beyonc\u00e9, writing that she loved the star long before she worked with her. She shared videos to her Instagram Story of her talking about Beyonc\u00e9 in red carpet interviews over the years.\n\u201cMy admiration runs so much deeper now that I\u2019ve created along side of her,\u201d the post continued. \u201cThank you Beyonc\u00e9. You\u2019re everything & more. Love you.\u201d\nBlack country legend Linda Martell joins Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 and gets her due\nLinda Martell is known as the first commercially successful Black female country artist. A pioneer in the industry, Martell paved the way for Beyonc\u00e9 to create \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d nearly six decades after Martell started her career.\nMartell is featured on two songs: in the interlude of \u201cSpaghettii\u201d and, of course, \u201cThe Linda Martell Show.\u201d In each song, Martell talks about how the traditional rules of genre are restrictive.\nMartell thanked Beyonc\u00e9 for including her in the project in a statement Friday on Instagram, writing that she is \u201cproud\u201d of the artist for \u201cexploring her country roots.\u201d\n\u201cWhat she is doing is beautiful and I\u2019m honored to be a part of it,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cIt\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9, after all!\u201d\nBeyonc\u00e9 responds to country critics\nMany of the lyrics throughout the album discuss the genre directly, and seem to respond to criticism Beyonc\u00e9 has received any time she\u2018s ventured into country music territory throughout her storied career.\nIn \u201cAmeriican Requiem,\u201d the artist overtly addresses her critics, singing: \u201cUsed to say I spoke, \u2018Too country\u2019 / And the rejection came, said \u2018I wasn\u2019t country \u2018nough\u2019 / Said I wouldn\u2019t saddle up, but / If that ain\u2019t country, tell me what is?\u201d\nIn both of Martell\u2019s interludes, she calls out genre purists, seemingly addressing Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s detractors who criticized her move into country. She calls genres a \u201cfunny little concept\u201d and says, \u201cIn theory, they have a simple definition that\u2019s easy to understand / But in practice, well, some may feel confined.\u201d She also introduces \u201cYa Ya\u201d in her second interlude, saying that the song straddles multiple genres, which makes it a \u201cunique listening experience.\u201d\nIn what is probably Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most apparent address of her critics, like country radio stations that initially declined to play her singles from the album, she enlists the help of Nelson. The country legend introduces the next song on the album and tells listeners what to take away from his \u201cset.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t know what you like until someone you trust turns you on to some real good s\u2014,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I\u2019m here.\u201d\nRacism, sexism, fuddy-duddyism: They\u2019re all reasons why the winningest artist in Grammy history lost album of the year yet again, this time to Harry Styles.\nBeyonc\u00e9 isn\u2019t fazed by album of the year snubs\nIn \u201cSweet Honey Buckiin\u2019,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 addresses her previous albums never taking home the coveted Grammy Award for album of the year. Although she holds the crown for most Grammy wins of any artist, her work has never nabbed \u201cAOTY\u201d and she makes it clear in \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d that she doesn\u2019t let that fact bog her down.\n\u201cA-O-T-Y, I ain\u2019t win / I ain\u2019t stuntin\u2019 \u2018bout them / Take that s\u2014 on the chin / Come back and f\u2014 up the pen,\u201d she sings."

      "text": "- Share via\nWatching the mesmerizing, in-ring action at a Lucha VaVoom show is a veritable experience. But the wrestling itself is only one flavor of performance on display. From its very first show at the Mayan theater in 2002, the Los Angeles institution has fused lucha libre with burlesque \u2014 two forms that require intense athletic discipline and often go under-recognized as legitimate art \u2014 and over the last 20-plus years has grown to include stand-up comedy, visual art, low-riders, and a host of other artists under the same psychedelic circus tent.\nThe lineup for LVV\u2019s recent Halloween blow-out, \u201cBienvenido a la Twilight Zone,\u201d featured a motley vaudeville troupe. Alongside dancers and burlesque artists were wrestlers who, true to the event\u2019s name, were conjured from another universe: colorful divas and gifted athletes, of course, but also postapocalyptic cyborg bruisers and human-size chickens. And on Wednesday and Thursday nights, Lucha VaVoom\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day spectacular, \u201cPasi\u00f3n en Fuego,\u201d promises to \u201cdeliver incendiary burlesque goddesses, twisty contortionists, and death-defying aerialists\u201d in addition to a cadre of luchadores, including Magno and former Lucha VaVoom champion Dama Fina, flexing and strutting their stuff in front of audiences.\nCo-founder Liz Fairbairn came to wrestling largely by coincidence, but her background in costume design and stage performance \u2014 specifically as the longtime manager of the gleefully camp shock rock outfit Gwar \u2014 made the self-described punk rocker uniquely suited to a second life as a lucha promoter.\n\u201cI do special effects costuming as well, and I was working on location in Mexico, babysitting some baboon costumes,\u201d she recalls with a laugh. \u201cLuchadores frequently moonlight as stuntmen, and I actually started a relationship with one of them. I wasn\u2019t really familiar with the local wrestling scene at all, but I became fascinated and I started going to shows in Baja and Tijuana with him, and then convincing my, like, quasi-hipster gringo friends from Silver Lake to go down there with us. Eventually, it became easier to just start bringing the wrestlers up here.\u201d Lucha VaVoom began to run recurring shows around specific holidays, including Halloween and Valentine\u2019s Day.\nMagno, a lifelong luchador from El Paso, was an early performer for Lucha VaVoom and has since become a staple. \u201cI started wrestling when I was 15 or 16, and when I did my first Lucha VaVoom show, I technically wasn\u2019t old enough to get into the Mayan theater,\u201d he says. Because of that 21+ policy, Lucha VaVoom cheerfully embraces camp and raunch and cultivates a crowd that\u2019s both more adult and more varied than your average wrestling show.\n\u201cAdults expect a lot more, so you have to hit harder and the matches are even more powerful and explosive,\u201d Magno explains. \u201cI always say doing one Lucha VaVoom match is like doing three matches on another show. But when you step in the ring, you keep on going because you feel the people and want to do the greatest job for them. It\u2019s a one-of-a-kind spectacle because you don\u2019t just get an audience from the wrestlers, you get an audience from the burlesque dancers and other performers. So many people have never seen lucha libre live, but they enjoy it and they start following it.\u201d\nFor years, lucha libre was stigmatized in the United States. Because the American style so often emphasizes hulking muscles and powerful body-slams, the aerodynamics and acrobatics of lucha were derided as unbelievable and unrealistic \u2014 xenophobia and racism certainly didn\u2019t help elevate the Mexican-born art form, either. But in the 20 years Lucha VaVoom has been running shows, lucha libre has developed a huge, ever-growing fan base within the U.S. Many wrestling fans \u2014 and wrestlers themselves \u2014 grew up idolizing luchadores on American television.\nIn the late 1990s, companies like WCW and ECW introduced a worldwide audience to the awe-inspiring athletic ability of luchadores like Juventud Guerrera, Psicosis and Super Crazy \u2014 and especially San Diego native Rey Mysterio Jr. With entrances and iconic masks inspired by cartoon characters like Spider-Man and the Silver Surfer, Mysterio framed the wrestler as a literal superhero: He became a Peter Parker-like underdog to fans around the world, presenting lucha libre as something much more imaginative and dazzling than its American cousin.\nNow some of the most beloved wrestlers worldwide are luchadores, like former AEW tag team champions the Lucha Brothers, Rey F\u00e9nix and Pentag\u00f3n Jr., who recently opened the lucha libre museum Republic of Lucha in Pasadena. Luchadores like Bandido, Laredo Kid and Black Taurus regularly appear on American television wrestling shows like \u201cAEW Dynamite\u201d and \u201cIMPACT!,\u201d and Mysterio is still at it over in WWE.\nIt isn\u2019t just the masks that made the wrestlers. As Magno, explains, it\u2019s that sense of awe that makes lucha libre so appealing to both hardcore wrestling fans and unfamiliar eyes. \u201cWhat really draws people to lucha is seeing someone do something unexpected, like jumping off the top rope and doing a flip and twisting in the middle of the air and then landing on your feet.\u201d\nWhen Lucha VaVoom began 20 years ago, the indie wrestling scene in Los Angeles was largely separate from the lucha libre scene, a more family-friendly environment almost exclusively in Spanish. Sacramento native and Lucha VaVoom regular Jack Cartwheel, whose jaw-dropping gymnastics have earned him instant love from fans in both the United States and Mexico, has experienced the growing exchange between pro wrestling and lucha libre firsthand. \u201cNow you have a lot of high-flying American wrestlers at lucha shows, and you\u2019ll find a lot of luchadores at American wrestling shows.\u201d\nMagno agrees. \u201cAmerican wrestling is evolving,\u201d he notes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the usual style of punching and kicking, it\u2019s a combination of power moves and flying around the ring.\u201d\nBut as any wrestler who\u2019s worked internationally can attest, no two audiences are the same, and you have to quite literally be on your toes to adapt to the energy and response of the crowd. \u201cAmerican wrestling fans are looking for certain things about your style and psychology and character work,\u201d Cartwheel says. \u201cI feel like lucha crowds just want to come and have a really fun time and support the wrestlers. It\u2019s a much more giving audience.\u201d\nFor so many wrestlers, lucha libre and Lucha VaVoom specifically offer a laboratory for experimentation and a sense of creative freedom that\u2019s liberating compared to the frequent self-seriousness of American pro wrestling. \u201cIn lucha libre, you regularly find people spanking each other or falling on their nuts on the rope, where sometimes American wrestlers are too prideful for things like that,\u201d says Cartwheel. \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re doing a pretty silly thing to begin with, so it\u2019s fun that Lucha VaVoom is able to embrace the silliness.\u201d\nTaya Valkyrie, one of the most decorated champions in women\u2019s wrestling today, has become a face of Lucha VaVoom \u2014 at the Valentine\u2019s shows, she\u2019ll square off in a tag match against her husband, former WWE superstar John Morrison. \u201cLucha has influenced so much of the style happening in the States,\u201d she says. \u201cYou even watch TV shows and Marvel movies and they\u2019re doing lucha moves and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, my God, did they just do a Canadian destroyer\u2019?\u201d\nBefore she cut her teeth working for AAA, one of the two largest lucha libre promotions in Mexico, Taya Valkyrie trained as a ballerina in her native Canada, and she continues to bring the mindset of a dancer both to her hard-hitting physicality in the ring and her flamboyant costumes. \u201cI\u2019ve always taken the road less traveled when it comes to fashion, so I\u2019m influenced by a lot of artists and pop culture icons outside of pro wrestling,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll look to the Met Gala for inspiration, or iconic looks from people like Lady Gaga, Gwen Stefani, Rihanna, Cher, even Elton John, and how they present themselves onstage. I want to create a visual moment for our fans because wrestling is about creating emotions and telling stories, so you have to have a visual representation to complete that experience.\u201d\nAs a Canadian outsider who spent years in Mexico and now calls Los Angeles home, Valkyrie took to lucha libre because of the creative versatility and expressive potential it offered her as a multitalented performer. But for her, lucha libre is as much about the people watching as herself, a performance determined more by the spirit and emotion of the crowd more than any single style or set of moves.\n\u201cLucha libre is much more theatrical and over the top than professional wrestling, but people try to put lucha libre in a box,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey think it\u2019s just wearing a mask and doing a bunch of flips, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the way that the fans react. It\u2019s the way that lucha libre is part of Mexican culture. So people have such a respect and passion and love for it. The second you walk through the curtain at a lucha libre show, everything means something.\u201d\n'Lucha VaVoom: Pasi\u00f3n en Fuego'\nWhere: The Mayan theater, 1038 S. Hill St., downtown Los Angeles\nWhen: 8 p.m. Feb. 8-9 (doors open at 7 p.m.)\nTickets: $45-$65\nInfo: www.ticketweb.com/events/org/19940?pl=lucha"
