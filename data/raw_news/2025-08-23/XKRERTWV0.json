  "description": "The Malibu home that West famously gutted is now back on the market after a deal to buy the property fell through.",
  "content": "The purchase and subsequent sale of Kanye West's former Malibu beach house by developers Steven \"Bo\" Belmont and Andrew Mazzella has taken a contentious turn, leading to a breakdown in their deal. Belmont initially bought the property from West for $21 million and later agreed to sell it to Mazzella for between $30 million and $34 million, but the transaction fell through. The situation has escalated with each party claiming the other misled them on various aspects of the sale. The property was put back on the market for $34.9 million due to financing issues and disagreements over restoration costs.",
