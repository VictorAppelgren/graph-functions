  "content": "NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Open descended into chaos on Sunday when a photographer came onto the court as Daniil Medvedev faced match point, bringing the first-round match to a standstill and sparking a spectacular meltdown from the Russian.\n\nFormer champion Medvedev was eventually knocked out 6-3 7-5 6-7(5) 0-6 6-4 by Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi, who threatened to walk off the court at one point and called for the Russian to be disqualified.\n\nServing for the match at 6-3 7-5 5-4, Bonzi was preparing to play his second serve when the photographer stepped onto the court surface.\n\nThe disruption led chair umpire Greg Allensworth to put Bonzi back onto his first serve, sparking an astonishing outburst from Medvedev.\n\n\"Are you a man? Are you a man? Why are you shaking?\" the Russian shouted as he stormed towards the chair.\n\n\"He wants to go home, guys, he doesn't like it here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour.\"\n\nMedvedev also repeatedly shouted, \"What did Reilly Opelka say?\" at the official in reference to the U.S. player's call for Allensworth to be suspended after receiving a code violation at the Dallas Open for confronting a spectator.\n\nThe match was halted for about six minutes as jeers, whistles and boos rang out around Louis Armstrong Stadium, with fans refusing to stay quiet so Bonzi could serve.\n\nThe USTA said the photographer was escorted from the court by U.S. Open security and that his credentials had been revoked.\n\nThe chaos almost proved Medvedev's salvation.\n\nAfter fending off the match point he broke to level the set at 5-5 before edging the tiebreak to force a fourth set.\n\nThe 2021 champion looked a completely different player in the fourth set as he dished out a bagel to level the match as his rattled opponent took a medical timeout for what appeared to be a knee issue.\n\nBoos from the crowd continued for the remainder of the match, with some fans targeting Bonzi during his service motion.\n\nThe final set was much more of a contest, with the duo exchanging multiple breaks of serve as the match wound down to a nail-biting finish.\n\nSpurred on my shouts of \"Courage!\" and \"Allez!\" from his box, Bonzi sealed the win with a glorious backhand, with Medvedev returning to his seat and smashing his racket.\n\n\"It was crazy. I may have got some new fans, but also some new non-fans,\" said world number 51 Bonzi, who has now beaten Medvedev in all three of their Grand Slam encounters, each time in the first round.\n\n\"The energy was crazy. Thanks to all who were booing. Thanks for the energy.\n\n\"I've never experienced something like that. We waited maybe five minutes before the match point and it was crazy. There was so much noise.\"\n\nMedvedev becomes the first former champion to exit this year's tournament, leaving Flushing Meadows after a horrible year at the majors where he managed to get to the second round just once.",

The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations.

The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18.
