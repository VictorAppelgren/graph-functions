  "content": "The teenage hacking group that brought down Marks & Spencer has claimed responsibility for the cyber attack that has forced Jaguar Land Rover to shut down assembly lines.\n\nThe cyber groups Scattered Spider and Shiny Hunters said they had been able to exploit a flaw in the carmaker\u2019s IT systems. The groups said they had gained access to customer data.\n\nThis could leave JLR vulnerable to ransom demands as it scrambles to get its systems back online.\n\nIt is unclear if the company has been issued with a ransom demand or what data have been taken.\n\nScattered Spider, a loose collective of hackers, has been blamed for a series of major cyber disruptions in recent months \u2013 including the attacks on M&S, Co-op and Harrods. M&S has taken months to recover from the hack.\n\nScattered Spider is closely linked to a group known as Shiny Hunters, which said it was involved in targeting JLR.\n\nThe two groups now describe themselves as \u201cone and the same\u201d alongside the Lapsus group and now style themselves as \u201cScattered Lapsus Hunters\u201d.\n\nThey are believed to be largely made up of teenagers and young men in English-speaking countries.\n\nIn July, three teenage males and a 20-year-old woman were arrested in association with the retail attacks.\n\nA user on a Telegram messenger group linked to Scattered Spider and Shiny Hunters posted a screenshot appearing to show access to JLR\u2019s internal systems.\n\nA member of the group, identifying themself only as Shiny, told The Telegraph they had exploited a widely-known flaw in a third-party software provider to access customers\u2019 data.\n\nThey did not say what type of data was taken or if they had issued a ransom demand.\n\nThe flaw \u2013 in software known as SAP Netweaver that is used to link different computer programs \u2013 allows hackers to remotely run code on a target\u2019s computer systems.\n\nThe US cyber agency, CISA, warned about the flaw earlier this year amid reports that Chinese hackers were exploiting it. JLR uses the Netweaver software according to an online portal for accessing the company\u2019s systems.\n\nA software update to fix the flaw has been released but it is unclear whether JLR had applied it.\n\nJLR said on Tuesday it had proactively shut down systems, a potential reference to the software the hackers claimed to have compromised.\n\nThe company said it had seen \u201cno evidence\u201d that data have been stolen, although this is rarely definitive in the early stages of an attack. Co-op, for example, initially said it had no evidence of data being taken before admitting that 6.5 million members had information stolen.\n\nThe Telegraph could not verify the hackers\u2019 claims and JLR declined to comment on the identity of the attackers.",
