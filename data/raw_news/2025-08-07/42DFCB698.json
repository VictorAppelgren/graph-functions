  "title": "Ex-Rival Speaks Highly of Philadelphia Eagles",
  "description": "Former Washington Commanders player Will Compton spoke highly of the Philadelphia Eagles after attending one of their practices on Tuesday afternoon.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Philadelphia Eagles hosted former NFL players Will Compton and Taylor Lewan as their practice facility for another day of training camp.\n\nAs the 'Bussin' With the Boys' hosts are making their way across the league, Compton got a chance to check out how the reigning Super Bowl Champions are doing just months after their big victory.\n\nBased on the former division rival's social media post, the Eagles are still thriving.\n\nWill Compton's Thoughts on the Birds\n\u2022 Hospitality was A+\n\u2022 Howie Roseman interview dropping next week is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\u2022 Big Dom is everything I hoped he would be (\"you are my guys\" was said)\n\u2022 AJ Brown is him\n\u2022 The campaign starts now to keep the Exciting Whites together beyond this season (Reed Blankenship is in the final year of his deal)\n\u2022 Eagles fans are still tight about us taking the division in 2015\n\u2022 Overall an incredible day\n\u2022 Backup QB #16 can sling the rock\n\nBeyond the field, Howie Roseman and Dom \"Big Dom\" DiSandro have become some of the most notable figures within the Eagles' organization.\n\nAs Howie Roseman has been inside the Eagles' front office since 2000, he's worked his way up the ladder and is in the midst of his second General Manager stint. Roseman is credited with building both of the Eagles' Super Bowl-winning squads.\n\nBig Dom has been with the organization since 1999. His main job is Chief Security Officer, but he earned the title of Director of Gameday Coaching Operations in 2024, as the Eagles needed to ensure DiSandro could be on the sidelines with the team on game day.\n\nThen, there's AJ Brown on the offensive side of the ball, who still seems to be playing a high level heading into the new year. Lately, Brown has been dealing with a minor hamstring issue. Outside of that, he's been praised for dominating in practice throughout the summer.\n\nCompton's unexpected takeaway is the praise for the backup quarterback, Tanner McKee. The former Stanford passer was drafted in 2023. The Eagles selected him in the sixth round with the 188th pick. McKee didn't get any playing time in 2023, but he made two appearances last season.\n\nMcKee threw 45 passes last season, completing 67 percent of his attempts. He totaled 323 yards, tossing four touchdowns and zero interceptions.\n\nWhen the Eagles traded away Kenny Pickett, it was clear that McKee had a strong enough impact to make the team feel confident in the former Stanford standout to become Jalen Hurts' primary backup. So far, it seems like McKee is impressing spectators as the summer rolls on.\n\nFor more Philadelphia Eagles and NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.",
