  "title": "REPO devs blown away by world record level 10 speedrun ponder adding \"official speedrun seeds\" \u2013 \"I know that Lethal Company did\"",
  "description": "\"This is a 'would be cool' list, to be clear\"",
  "content": "Few genres of gaming videos offer more sheer enjoyment than watching devs react to speedruns of their games, and REPO's offering some very good material in that space right now. The devs at semiwork are so impressed by what the speedrun community is doing that they're even considering adding official speedrun seeds.\n\nIn a recent video hosted by REPO marketing head Pontus Sundstr\u00f6m and, in the tradition of the game's slapstick YouTube presence, a semibot with the \"mind of one of the developers,\" the pair watch a (now-former) world record level 10 speedrun from LLMarkerz. There are some fun techniques here, including self-destructs to get through the shop faster, but much of the run seems to be about reacting to the content of the procedurally generated levels.\n\n\"Watching this really makes me want to add official speedrun seeds so that everyone gets the same playing field,\" the semibot dev suggests.\n\n\"Yeah, we should do that. I know that Lethal Company did,\" Sundstr\u00f6m says teasingly as he evokes the rival co-op horror game. That brings out a stern \"Hey! Hey!\" from the semibot.\n\nA speedrun seed would essentially set a single non-randomized set of levels for runners to challenge, allowing them to practice the same tricks against the same set of obstacles every time. It'd dramatically change the skillset needed to do a successful run, but it would almost certainly help runners massively shave down their times.\n\nThe idea of the speedrun seed keeps coming up over the course of the video, with the devs throwing out thoughts like keeping a consistent shop in every run. But, even as Sundstr\u00f6m says \"I'm really hyped for a speedrun seed now,\" he adds that \"this is a 'would be cool' list, to be clear. We're just talking now.\"\n\nBut hey, getting devs talking about potential new features is how things eventually get added to an early access game, so who knows what the future holds. \"That was amazing,\" semibot dev says at the conclusion of the video. \"Really impressive. Makes me want to add speedrun seeds. Makes me want to think about speedrunners more. Makes me happy to see.\"\n\nIf you're looking for more games to play with friends, check out our guide to the best co-op games of all time.",

      "text": "The 25 best co-op games of all time\nWith the best co-op games, two heads are better than one\nThe best co-op games offer up all manner of memorable experiences you can tuck into with friends and family. Whether you're after adventures that test your teamwork, or you want to take on challenges with pals that will deliver something more competitive, we've brought together a list of options to choose from across all genres and platforms, so you can find something to suit you.\nSome of the best FPS games we've seen in recent years can be played co-operatively, and thanks to co-op support in RPGs and all sorts of adventures, you can even share in the magic of bonding over some of the best game stories.\nSome of the best games of 2025 so far have brought us some more standout co-op games to consider trying out, and with lots of new games for 2025 and beyond headed our way, we have the likes of Borderlands 4, Subnautica 2, Witchbrook, and Elden Ring: Neightreign to look forward to. Not to mention that with the arrival of the Switch 2 later this year, we'll start to see some upcoming Switch 2 games you can stuck into together. But while we wait for some fresh releases, read on below to find our pick of the 25 best co-op games you can play right now.\nThis list of the best co-op games was updated on April 28, 2025. Remember, this list is subject to shift from time to time, but we'll be back with more co-op goodness as the year unfolds.\nThe best co-op games to play in 2025, starting with...\n25. Forza Horizon 5\nCo-op style: Online\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5\nForza Horizon 5 is the latest and most polished entry in Playground Games open-world series, and happily, you can happily experience what is one of the best racing games around right now with pals. First releasing on Xbox Series X and PC before landing on PS5 in 2025, Forza Horizon 5 cross-play support means you can also explore Mexico and race with friends and family across platforms. If you're decided whether you should hit road, be sure to check out our Forza Horizon 5 review.\n24. Escape Academy\nCo-op style: Online and Local\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch\nIf you love the inherent chaos, cleverness, and silliness of real-life escape rooms, then Escape Academy needs to be on your radar. It's a series of digital escape rooms, which are best experienced in co-op, as you'll usually want one of you on the puzzle itself and the other walking around the space looking for clues. It's brilliantly interactive and does well to incorporate the obscure puzzling you might expect from an escape room into this digital experience.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\n23. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes\nCo-op type: Local\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS VR, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X\nUnless you've invested in a VR headset, you probably haven't heard of this one. However, it's a uniquely brilliant take on the co-op experience and demands your attention. One person wears the VR headset while a number of other people sit\u2014in the real world\u2014and look at a booklet of bomb-defusal documents.\nThe person inside the VR headset sees a briefcase with a bomb in it and various devices to disarm, which he/she describes to people in the real world. The idea is to use the bomb disposal docs to defuse the device by... actually talking to each other and cooperating. It's all set to a time limit to add tension, and bombs get increasingly tricky to dismantle as you play. It's brilliant fun and one of the best party games to play right now.\n22. Don't Starve Together\nCo-op type: Local and online\nPlatform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series X, PS5\nThe threat of permadeath is somehow softened when it\u2019s shared. I mean, you\u2019ll all still die, but at least there\u2019s comfort and blame when you\u2019re playing co-op. Don\u2019t Starve\u2019s resource gathering, base-building challenge was already great fun, but it\u2019s even more so with a friend. Especially as you can split the workload and responsibilities as you tend to your home or farm and explore the world to find more of whatever you need to make it through another day. Check out our Don't Starve review if you need more details!\n21. Deep Rock Galactic\nCo-op style: Online\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S\nThink Left 4 Dead with space dwarves, and you won\u2019t be far off. Deep Rock Galactic is a team-based shooter where you and up to three stout friends rocket into a procedurally generated planet in search of minerals. To find what you want, you\u2019ll each have to use your class-specific abilities, slinging grappling hooks, creating platforms, lighting up dark caves and blowing holes in the scenery to create new paths. Every so often, a swarm of alien spiders will jump on you, and you\u2019ll be forced back to back, pulling your trigger for dear life. Its varied, colourful environs never seem to repeat, and when the lights dim and smoke rises, it\u2019s properly atmospheric.\n20. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2\nCo-op type: Online\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5\nAh, nothing helps you bond quite like fighting against Tyranids. Yes, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a great option if you're looking to get stuck into some action with pals. With 3 player co-op support, you can take on the whole campaign together, work as a team to take on Operation missions, or go up against Heretics in a PVP mode. If you're looking to play with friends we have a helpful guide that'll run you through how to unlock multiplayer in Space Marine 2.\nAnd if you're still undecided, you can learn more in our Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 review.\n19. Borderlands 3\nCo-op style: Online\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, Nintendo Switch\nBorderlands has always been better with friends. What good is a shotgun that chains electric damage between enemies or a rifle that spits out bouncing saw blades if you haven\u2019t got a buddy at your side to watch it in action? The main attraction of the series has always been finding ever-wackier guns to shoot at ever-wackier enemies, and Borderlands 3 is the wackiest in the series so far. Many weapons have absurd alternate fire modes, and the world is bigger and far more varied.\nIn previous Borderlands, loot was shared between players, which meant you had to fight over the best guns. You can play Borderlands 3 that way (it's called Coopetition), but in Cooperation mode, you\u2019ll get your own discrete pile of weapons showering out of enemies, so you never have to share. For more check out our Borderlands 3 review, or read our list of the best Borderlands games to play right now.\n18. Baldur's Gate 3\nCo-op type: Online and local\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, Xbox Series X\nBaldur's Gate 3 takes you on a sweeping adventure across the Sword Coast as you set out to try and rid yourself of a tadpole that's been lodged in your head. With so many choices to make, stories to explore, and characters to get to know (and woo if you're so inclined), it's one of the best RPGs we've seen in recent times, and better yet, you can experience it with pals.\nWith co-op support both online and locally for up to 4 players, you can assemble a party of your very own and get stuck into Larian's D&D fueled dice-rolling journey in good company. Read our glowing Baldur's Gate 3 review for more.\n17. The Outlast Trials\nCo-op type: Online\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S\nThe Outlast Trials is a horror fan's dream and is the perfect choice for any friends who love chaotic and challenging puzzles. The third game in the Outlast series, The Outlast Trials, puts you in your own slasher movie as you are forced to take part in a series of horrifying tests after being kidnapped by the Murkoff Corporation.\nWhile you can play the game solo, it's during the multiplayer mode that this title comes to life. Racing through the gorey map, laughing in terror as Mother Gooseberry hunts you down and strategically completing objectives together is hours upon hours of fun. For more information, check out our The Outlast Trials review.\n16. GTA Online\nCo-op type: Online\nPlatform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PC, PS5, Xbox Series X and Series S\nThere was a time when GTA 5\u2019s style of murderous online meant you needed a friend, preferably several if you want to just survive for more than a few seconds. Now, however, there\u2019s a vast array of activities and things to do, even without simple player-created goals like \u2018breaking into the army base\u2019 or \u2018shooting everyone you can see\u2019.\nAfter years of updates and additions, GTA Online has become an expansive digital playground of things to do with friends. Everything from team games to bank heists, races, stunt courses, and more, and it's evolving all the time.\n15. Destiny 2\nCo-op type: Online\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and Series S\nBungie's sci-fi epic is built on the ability to join up with other players as much as possible. Part FPS, part MMO, Destiny 2's outstanding shooting mechanics and tempting loot grinds will keep you and your friends in for the long run, or at least until Destiny 3 inevitably comes out and everyone jumps ship. Not only are there a ton of Adventures, Strikes, Nightfalls, and six-person raids to participate in, but you'll also find yourself working with random players you encounter in the world.\nPublic Events literally fall out of the sky, tasking you and anyone nearby to fight off hordes of enemies for that extra piece of loot. If you've somehow never jumped on the Destiny train, you still have time to find and friend and become a Guardian of the galaxy today. For more action from one of the best shooters in history, check out our Destiny 2 review.\n14. PHOGS\nCo-op style: Online and local\nPlatform(s): PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One (also on Game Pass)\nCompleting Phogs definitely requires plenty of cooperation as you and your pal will take control of a two-headed sausage dog - each of you taking one of its heads, connected together by a long, stretchy body. Together, you'll have to bite, bounce, and bark your way through a series of puzzles set across three unique worlds.\nEach one is utterly adorable and is themed around a phog's favourite things - Food, Sleep, and Play. As you work your way through them, it's easy to appreciate the fact each world - and the levels within it - offers a unique way to utilize your good phog abilities and your co-op power. It's a delight that also feels like going on a walk in a cheese dream with a friend. Just wait until you see the hat shops, too.\n13. Stardew Valley\nCo-op style: Online and local\nPlatform(s): PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series X\nStardew Valley hands you the keys to a run-down farm in a small, lazy town and asks you to turn its fortunes around. But it\u2019s not pushy: you and your friends can do as many or as few chores as you want. You can chop up wood and plant crops, fish and trade, craft and scavenge, or you can wander around town chatting to the pleasant townsfolk. This game became famous for its relaxing single-player mode, but the online co-op is, in our opinion, the best way to play.\nIf you\u2019ve already got a save going, you need to build some cabins to add your friends, or you can all start a new game with a shared farm (progress only saves for the host). With up to three co-op partners, you can come up with freeform projects, dividing up tasks to hasten production. Or sit around, watching the sun go up and down \u2013 it\u2019s your farm, your rules. If you're after more relaxing co-op games, read our list of the best games like Stardew Valley to play today.\n12. Knights and Bikes\nCo-op type: Local and Online\nPlatform(s): PS4, PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, Xbox Series X (Also on Game Pass)\nTaking on the roles of tough girls Nessa and Demelza, Knight and Bikes sees you exploring Penfurzy Island in a Goonies-inspired tale where bikes are king and mischief is paramount. It's made by Moo Yu and Rex Crowle, who are both ex-Media Molecule, so, as you can imagine, it's infused with quirk, cuteness, and the kind of spirit you can only find in a Famous Five book.\nYes, the gameplay is about puzzle solving, mini-games of crazy golf, and riding your bike as fast as you can humanly pedal, but it's also a heartfelt adventure about two kids that offer the kind of gameplay experience that you can rarely have. And it's even better with a real-world friend by your side.\n11. Sea of Thieves\nCo-op type: Online\nPlatform(s): Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series X and Series S, PS5\nAlthough you can play Sea of Thieves solo, this is very much a game that encourages you to tell stories and, more importantly, create those tales with other people. Galleons can be sailed by crews of up to four, with adventures spinning out from the various voyages you undertake. That might be finding buried treasure, collecting goods to trade with the merchants, or hunting down undead pirate captains. Or, you know, fighting a Kraken or taking on a huge Skeleton Fort.\nWhatever you do in Sea of Thieves, you'll need a crew. Then, just let the hilarity commence. Check out our Sea of Thieves review for more details!\n10. Diablo 4\nCo-op style: Online and Local\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox One\nAt their heart, the best Diablo games have always been about the pursuit of ever-shinier loot. Having someone to share your latest, shiniest ring with makes those rare finds all the more thrilling. Diablo 4 is the latest to challenge all of those sensations, with an excellent campaign and evolving seasons to provide you and your pals with new challenges continually. It's also a great experience for fantasy-loving couples to play, and if you need more convincing, head over to our five-star Diablo 4 review for more information.\n9. Lethal Company\nCo-op style: Online\nPlatform(s): PC\nIf you're looking for one of the best survival horror games with a generous helping of hilarity, then Lethal Company is a newer addition to this best co-op games list you might have seen all over TikTok of late. In it, you have to salvage items on abandoned moons and sell enough to hit a certain quota over three days. If you don't, bad things happen - worse than the beating you'll get from the native creatures that roam the moons themselves.\n8. Snipperclips\nCo-op type: Local\nPlatform(s): Nintendo Switch\nThis two-person puzzler\u2019s main gimmick is such a clever idea that you and a friend will easily waste half an hour just playing around with that alone before even trying to solve anything. You each control a flat 2D character with the ability to cut pieces out of each other according to where you overlap.\nBy using this ability you have to get through levels and solve puzzlers. It\u2019s a simple but incredibly rich concept and something that works perfectly on Switch, with each of you taking one Joy-Con to direct your little paper person about. Snipperclips is tons of fun and easily one of the best Switch games to play right now.\n7. Portal 2\nCo-op style: Online and Local\nPlatform(s): PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X (via backwards compatibility)\nPortal 2 is a classic, and if you haven't played it yet, well, you\u2019re in for one of the best co-op experiences of your life. The co-op campaign is a noticeable jump in difficulty from the already fiendish original. Not only will you and a friend, who each control a loveable robot, have to put your heads together to figure out how to finish a test chamber, but you\u2019ll often have to time your movements and actions just right. If one player jumps a split second early or activates a button too late, the whole plan falls apart.\nIt makes communication vital and each puzzle all the more rewarding to solve. On top of those puzzles is a layer of Valve\u2019s unmistakable humour, and GLaDOS (remember her?) is once again the star. You can high-five your friend, play rock paper scissors, or, if you\u2019re feeling evil, dunk them into deadly goo by pulling a bridge up from under their feet.\n6. Overcooked 2\nCo-op type: Local and online\nPlatform(s): Xbox One, PS4, PC, Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X and Series S\nOvercooked 2 sounds simple - prepare a bunch of meals as chefs within a certain time limit. Easy. Well, not so much. While there are up to four of you playing, it starts to get tricky to keep track of the game's various commands and stipulations, as well as avoiding various hazards in the kitchen itself. This can lead to some frantic play, and only the most cohesive of teams will get those dishes out on time.\nThe levels are insane, the menus increasingly complex, and overall, this is a mad, mad existence of a game. But, hilarious fun, too. Warning: as we mention in our Overcooked 2 review, it may cause bickering among even the closest friends, partners and family members.\n5. Fortnite\nCo-op type: Online and Local (split-screen available in limited modes)\nPlatform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X and Series X\nFortnite is a shining example of a game that gets more fun the more friends you have playing with you, and what's even better is that its popular Battle Royale mode is totally free. Weekly challenges keep things fresh, so you have something new to do every week. Epic's charming Save The World base-defense/shooter/survival game hybrid is a better platform for cooperative play than many full releases. Not only does playing with a handful of friends give you a better chance to fend off waves of husks or construct the ultimate base, but those friends can also provide you valuable XP boosts and a better chance to nab some of Fortnite's massive catalogue of rare loot. If you're after more, we have a list of the best games like Fortnite, for you as well.\n4. Minecraft\nCo-op type: Local (on console and PC) and online\nPlatform(s): PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, iOS, Android, Xbox Series X, PS5\nYes, Minecraft gets everywhere, but for good reason: its digital building block world has endless imagination-filled potential. You can team up with friends to build pointless structures or grand engineering feats of construction. Or you can bounce about the place, creating chaos and generally hanging out. Its lack of rigid structure means you and your friends can get up to anything - whether that\u2019s an evening of messing about or a longer-term project you can take your time over. Seriously, it's one of the best multiplayer games for a reason, and you can read more about it in our Minecraft review.\n3. A Way Out\nCo-op type: Local and online\nPlatform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series X and Series S, PS5\nIt's rare that a game is only playable in co-op, but that's exactly what A Way Out does. Whether you're splashing the water to usher fish to each other, going back to back to shimmy up a wall gap, passing a chisel between cells to find an exit route, or even just playing Connect Four or a game of basketball, the co-op never feels like an added extra. You're two criminals trying to find a way out of prison and a step closer to redemption, but more importantly, this is one story that you must experience together. For more, read our A Way Out review.\n2. Split Fiction\nCo-op type: Local and online\nPlatform(s): PC Xbox Series X/S, PS5,\nHazelight Studios' latest co-op adventure is an absolute must for anyone looking for an experience to get stuck into with a pal or loved one. Also featuring the Friend Pass that lets you play with a pal online with just one copy of the game, Split Fiction mashes together sci-fi and fantasy worlds as you take on the role of either Mio or Zoe, two writers who get thrown into their own fictional worlds. With two play split screen, you have a blast trying out the many different mechanics and inventive level designs on offer. For more, read our Split Fiction review.\n1. It Takes Two\nCo-op type: Local and online\nPlatform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PC, Xbox Series X and Series S, PS5, Nintendo Switch\nIt Takes Two is the latest game from the team that brought you A Way Out, and it's another game specifically built to be played co-operatively. This time around, you're playing as a husband and wife duo who have been turned into a pair of dolls by their daughter, unhappy about the news that they're divorcing.\nCue gameplay that's part Pixar, part Honey I Shrunk the Kids, add in a sprinkle of marriage counseling courtesy of an anthropomorphic self-help book, and you've got a glimpse into what to expect with It Takes Two. But it's also much more than that: a little slice of magic and literally the best co-op game around. Just read our It Takes Two review if you need more convincing.\nAnd, only one of you has to own it if you want to play online with a friend, thanks to the game's Friend Pass system.

      "text": "\"I want him to be my dad but I also want him to go away\": REPO devs are losing it a little bit, but have cool new features for Update 1 and \"are very excited to see how you might break the game\"\nRepo's first big update is out in open beta, letting you try out new stuff like the \"handheld portable cart laser\"\nThe runaway success of co-op horror sensation Repo seems to have been a little too much for the good folks at semiwork, as a frankly bizarre new video starts with an unhinged rant from the game's semibots but thankfully settles into a more traditional update previewing some neat new features coming in Update 1.\nActually, Update 1 is already available in Repo's open beta, so everything we're about to talk about is playable right now ahead of the update's full launch.\nSemiwork posted the below video to its official YouTube channel on Friday, beginning with an apology \"for all the waiting\" players have had to do for Update 1, which is \"still in the home stretch\" to its full release. Nothing wrong with that, right?\nWell, then the camera zooms out to a shot of some semibots angrily watching the update video, commenting on how semiwork's Pontus Sundstrom can't possibly be a game dev because \"that beard is too beautiful.\"\nIt gets weirder. At one point, one of the semibots remarks: \"I want him to be my dad but I also want him to go away.\" From there, things really just unravel to a point of incoherence that I'm still struggling to fully decipher.\nJust, uh, just watch it:\nAnywho, we're gonna go ahead and talk about what's been newly revealed for Update 1, because there are a few things that sound genuinely exciting.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThe first that really piqued my interest is an update to the game's physics, which primarily fixes what I've been calling the \"death wobble\" that sometimes happens when you have a lot of strength upgrades and the items shake around violently. That has apparently been resolved for items as well as melee and ranged weapons.\nSpeaking of which, there's a new weapon, the \"handheld portable cart laser,\" otherwise known as a photon blaster, otherwise known as a particle thrower for my real ones. \"The name tells you what it does,\" Sundstrom says, and he's right. It blasts photon beams in your chosen direction.\nThe Phase Bridge is another cool new addition coming to Update 1, and it looks a little like the Hard Light Bridges from Portal 2. The holographic bridge can be used as a bridge or a ladder, and Sundstrom says \"however you want to use it, we are very excited to see how you might break the game using it.\"\nThere's also a brand new upgrade, Tumblewings, which, again, pretty much does what it says on the tin. It gives you little fairy wings that aren't quite strong enough for full flight capabilities, but are enough to let you glide/tumble your way down from high ledges. And yes, I'll admit, it's pretty stinkin' cute seeing semibots flutter around with them.\nHonest to goodness, the thing I'm most excited about that was revealed today is the new stamina regen feature, letting you crouch to regenerate stamina much quicker than usual. It seems like such a small thing, but running out of stamina is pretty much the worst thing that can happen in a frantic co-op horror game like Repo, so this should be a huge quality of life upgrade. There's even an upgrade to boost the regen further.\nAs mentioned before, you can try all of this stuff out on Repo's beta branch right now before the final release date, which has yet to be disclosed. The devs say the delay on this update was extended by all the red tape stirred up by the game's whirlwind success, and they expect future updates to be completed more quickly.\nIn case you're just getting started, here's a handy beginner's guide on how to play Repo.\nAfter earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side. I got my big break here in 2019 with a freelance news gig, and I was hired on as GamesRadar's west coast Staff Writer in 2021. That means I'm responsible for managing the site's western regional executive branch, AKA my home office, and writing about whatever horror game I'm too afraid to finish.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "REPO devs say \"we've heard your feedback\" and you can chill a bit: the Museum is \"not finished,\" and the difficulty's going up with \"Moon Phases\" because \"the game needs to keep up with you\"\n\"Things will get spicier and spicier as you get spicier and spicier\"\nFear not REPO fans, the devs are aware you're not feeling the Museum level just yet, and they want to reiterate that it's still very much a work in progress. They're also figuring out how to ensure it stays challenging as you climb through the levels.\nIn a new dev log, which is just as hilarious as the 'making of' documentary, Semiwork marketer Pontus Sundstr\u00f6m says: \"We've also heard your feedback on the museum, the Museum of Human Art. Some of you think it looks a bit bland, and I sort of agree with you. But the thing is, it's not finished.\"\nHe stresses that the open beta \u2013 which you can opt into on Steam if you want to test out new, experimental features before they're fully developed \u2013 is full of works in progress. \"It's not a finished level,\" he says. \"We're currently adding cool graffiti and we're adding some nice paintings, and it's gonna be so wonderful when it's done.\"\nWork is also being done on upping the game's difficulty. Now, every five levels, the phase of the moon will change. Sundstr\u00f6m says \"things will get spicier and spicier as you get spicier and spicier with upgrades and other things that make you stronger.\"\nHe continues: \"Below level five, the enemies will be quite easy to stun with small objects. Then at level five there will be a moon phase causing the enemies to become stronger.\" He then switches to Swedish as apparently saying \"fifth\" is tricky, and explains that on level 10, 15, and so on, enemies will get stronger still due to another moon phase.\nThe aim is to keep the game balanced, so that those of you who want to climb the levels can enjoy a challenge, while those of you who are happy to stick to level three don't get obliterated by tough foes.\nWhile you wait for that update to be finalized, check out the best co-op games you can play today.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nI'm Issy, a freelancer who you'll now occasionally see over here covering news on GamesRadar.

There's a bunch of new weapons with some amazing names too, like the Prodzap, the Boltzap, and the Duck Bucket. On top of all that, the update includes plenty of balancing changes and bug fixes. A full list of what's been added is available to read via the patch notes on Steam.\nCoinciding with the major update, REPO is now 20% off in the Steam Summer Sale, matching its lowest price ever, and Sundstr\u00f6m calls it \"the perfect time to dive in.\"\nKeeping with Semiwork's sense of humor, the video ends with Sundstr\u00f6m announcing the team is taking some time off after working \"long nights and weekends\" to get the update out, before a semibot turns off the lights and demands to know when the next update will be out.
