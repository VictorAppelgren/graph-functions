  "content": "Market Basket, a family-owned New England supermarket chain with nearly 100 stores in Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire, is embroiled in a heated battle for control.\n\nIt isn't the first time.\n\nIn 2014, Arthur T. Demoulas, the grandson of Market Basket's founder, was temporarily ousted by his cousins, who were reportedly interested in shifting the company's culture. The coup led to highly publicized employee strikes and customer boycotts, resulting in his reinstatement.\n\nLoyalty like that is pretty hard to come by nowadays.\n\nYet Demoulas, popularly known as Artie T., has once again come under fire. This time, his sisters, who had supported him during the last battle for Market Basket's control, are looking to push him out.\n\nThey suspended Artie T. in May for allegedly resisting board oversight, promoting a work stoppage, and installing his children in key jobs without board approval.\n\nShortly thereafter, Market Basket's board fired executives Joe Schmidt and Tom Gordon, who were seen as loyal to Demoulas, for insubordination in July.\n\nIt's unclear if there will be strikes and boycotts again to support Demoulas, but Schmidt and Gordon don't appear to be going away quietly.\n\nAccording to Market Basket's board, they've visited nearly two dozen store locations, ostensibly lining up support for Demoulas.\n\nIn 2014, many employees, including store managers, sided with Artie T. because they were concerned that his cousins would make changes that negatively impacted their employee\u2014and customer-focused culture to boost profits or sell the supermarket chain to a deep-pocketed conglomerate.\n\nThe battle a decade ago was fierce and took a toll on workers, who once again could find themselves caught between warring family factions.\n\nWhile some employees appear less interested in another contentious walk-out, some have become increasingly critical of the current board's decision to suspend Demoulas and fire Schmidt, its former operations director, and Gordon, its grocery supervisor.\n\n\"What was once a culture grounded in mutual respect, integrity, and accountability has, in recent months, devolved into one defined by fear, hostility, and lack of direction,\" said Director of Advertising and Store Operations Supervisor Valerie Polito in a July 18 letter to the Board of Directors, according to CBS News.\n\nMarket Basket's board of directors has filed for a restraining order against Gordon and Schmidt, saying the duo has visited its headquarters and 23 stores this month without permission.\n\nAccording to NBC Boston, the board claims that Gordon and Schmidt have visited the locations \"to intimidate employees, precipitate a work slowdown, employee walkout, and customer boycott.\"\n\n\"Market Basket associates are entitled to feel safe while performing their jobs whether at headquarters in Tewksbury or in stores, said Market Basket board member Steven Collins. \"But in recent days, terminated executive Joseph Schmidt was documented on video after hours breaking and entering at the Tewksbury headquarters holding the master key that he has refused to return and moving around the offices totally unauthorized.\"\n\nThe restraining order was requested in Lowell, Massachusetts, and a hearing is scheduled for Thursday at 10 a.m.\n\nIf granted, it could drive employees to pick sides, increasing the temperature ahead of a planned mediation between board members and Artie T. in September.",

      "text": "Market Basket company culture full of \"fear, hostility\" amid leadership change, corporate employee says\nValerie Polito has worked at Market Basket for 35 years, spending the last 13 of them as Director of Advertising and Store Operations Supervisor at the company headquarters in Tewksbury.\n\"I love this company,\" she said, which is why she's speaking out, putting her job on the line, because of a major shift in company culture, she says.\n\"I wake up, wondering if today's the day that I'm not going to be able to get in with my key card,\" she told WBZ Thursday.\nOn May 28, the Board of Directors suspended longtime CEO Arthur T. Demoulas amid allegations he was planning a work stoppage, an allegation he denies. Since then, longtime upper management members have been fired, which has contributed to a shifting company culture, Polito says.\n\"A chilling effect\"\n\"What was once a culture grounded in mutual respect, integrity, and accountability has, in recent months, devolved into one defined by fear, hostility, and lack of direction,\" a July 18 letter Polito wrote to the Board of Directors reads. \"This punitive atmosphere has created a chilling effect where many now fear speaking openly.\"\nPolito said she's received a surge of complaints from associates within the corporate office about shifting job responsibilities and pressure to do more or different work with threats of getting fired. \"Then they were saying if they don't do it that they were going to lose their job, or the board was going to have someone hired from outside the company which is not Market Basket culture. We promote from within. We build our team from within,\" she said.\nIn her letter, Polito claims one worker brought a knife to the office, sitting it on his desk to intimidate others. She also claims others threatened to fire people using harsh language and expletives.\nBoard of Directors responds to accusations\nIn response, the Board of Directors released a statement to WBZ, which reads, in part, \"We offered to meet with Ms. Polito to get more details about her accusations, and even scheduled a meeting for August 21. But instead she has chosen to share her concerns with the media. We believe that her letter is part of Arthur Demoulas's ruthless, no-holds-barred attack on Market Basket, the board, and even the majority stockholders. Mr. Demoulas is reported to have said on an earlier occasion that if he can't be in charge, he'd rather burn it all down, referring to Market Basket.\"\nPolito said the meeting is scheduled for August 21, and she's hopeful her concerns will be heard. She believes bringing back fired or suspended management will reinstate the family culture at the grocery store chain she's worked at since age 15."

      "text": "Market Basket has filed a legal complaint against two fired executives, claiming they have traveled to nearly two dozen stores in three states in recent days \"to intimidate employees, to precipitate a work slowdown, employee walkout and customer boycott.\"\nThe request for a restraining order was filed Monday in Lowell Superior Court, where a hearing is scheduled to be held on Thursday at 10 a.m.\nStream NBC10 Boston news for free, 24/7, wherever you are.\nThe complaint names Joseph Schmidt and Tom Gordon, and includes what the company says are surveillance images of Schmidt entering the company's headquarters in Tewksbury and a store in Somerville, where he was captured waving to the security camera.\nGet updates on what's happening in Boston to your inbox with our News Headlines newsletter.\n\"Market Basket associates are entitled to feel safe while performing their jobs whether at headquarters in Tewksbury or in stores. But in recent days, terminated executive Joseph Schmidt was documented on video after hours breaking and entering at the Tewksbury headquarters holding the master key that he has refused to return and moving around the offices totally unauthorized,\" Steven Collins, one of four members of the grocery chain's board, said in a statement. \"In addition, Schmidt and Gordon traveled to 23 stores in multiple states in recent days, not to celebrate someone\u2019s retirement, as feigned in an earlier violation of their suspension, but to intimidate employees, to precipitate a work slowdown, employee walkout and customer boycott.\"\nThe company is seeking a restraining order to keep Schmidt and Gordon away from Market Basket property and from company employees.\nA spokesperson for Schmidt and Gordon said they had yet to receive the complaint, but will issue a statement as soon as they've had a chance to review it.\nThe legal filing is the latest move in a fight between CEO Arthur T. Demoulas and his longtime deputies on one side and Demoulas\u2019s three sisters and the company directors who represent them as shareholders on the other. Demoulas had been put on leave in May due to allegations that he, along with the two now-fired executives, were organizing an \u201cimproper work disruption.\u201d\nSchmidt, the company's operations director, and Gordon, its grocery supervisor, had both worked for the company for decades, having started there as teenagers. They were both placed on leave in May and then fired last month.\nThe Market Basket board said at the time that they were terminated for \"insubordination, making false and derogatory remarks about the company and people associated with it, and inappropriate communications with colleagues.\" The board went on to say that the pair was originally suspended with pay on May 28 following allegations that they were encouraging a widespread work disruption that would have echoed the employee walkout and vendor and customer boycott in 2014 that cost the company over a half billion dollars.\nThe two former executives have denied any plans for a work stoppage, and have been outspoken about how they believed this was a succession plan by Artie T\u2019s relatives. At a news conference Wednesday, they said the firings are an effort to silence them and undermine the current company culture.\n\u201cThis is about the culture of the company, the associates of the company and the customers, and all the suppliers that support the company on a day-to-day basis. Mr. Demoulas\u2019s philosophy is that the shareholders benefit at the end of that order. And that\u2019s worth standing up for,\" Schmidt said at a media availability following his firing.\nSchmidt also denied allegations of insubordination and said that to his understanding, management does not report to the board -- the CEO does.\n\u201cIf somebody thinks that either Mr. Gordon or myself are just going to go away at this point without standing up for the culture of the company for a period of time, they\u2019re sorely mistaken. I\u2019m not going anywhere and neither is he,\" Schmidt said.\nGordon described his termination as \"very disheartening\" and said he was not ready to give up on the possibility of a resolution.\nMarket Basket's legal complaint said the recent escalation of Schmidt and Gordon's \"campaign of intimidation and defiance has crossed a line.\" The company said \"immediate intervention is necessary to stop Defendants from trespassing on Market Basket property as part of their unlawful and escalating campaign to disrupt the Company's business operations.\"\nIn the six day period between Aug. 4-9, the company said Schmidt and Gordon entered at least 25 different Market Basket stores in Massachusetts and elsewhere, typically remaining there for between 10-20 minutes and talking with employees.\n\"Defendants wore suits and ties during their visits, as they would during store visits prior to their termination, to convey to associates that they were acting as executives of the Company, who would soon be reinstated,\" the complaint said.\nIn addition to the restraining order, Market Basket asked the court to require Schmidt to return all master keys to company properties that are in his possession."

This situation echoes a previous power struggle in 2014 that resulted in employee strikes and boycotts. The board has since fired two executives loyal to Demoulas, leading to accusations of intimidation and a request for a restraining order against them. Employees report a deteriorating company culture characterized by fear and hostility, raising concerns about potential unrest as tensions rise ahead of a planned mediation.",
