      "feedback": "Your draft misses several critical compliance points. 1) **Format** – each mover line must read “Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %” with a single inline citation for any specific fact or number. 2) **Handle mapping** – EPAM’s valuation is tied to ust10y; include “(ust10y)” in the mover and trade lines. 3) **Catalyst window** – explicitly state the Q3 2026 earnings release and the Q1 2026 Fed meeting as the primary catalysts. 4) **Swing‑trade line** – rewrite it to the required schema: “Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0‑100”. 5) **Probabilities & confidence** – base each % on evidence: e.g., margin recovery 35 %(H86O3XRUJ), Fed cuts 30 %(H86O3XRUJ), hawkish 30 %(H86O3XRUJ), low‑code shift 25 %(H86O3XRUJ); swing‑trade probability 60 %(H86O3XRUJ) and confidence 70. 6) **Citations** – attach the source ID to every factual claim (e.g., “(H86O3XRUJ)”). 7) **Invalidation/Trigger** – for the trade, set invalidation to “Fed 1‑point hike” and trigger to “Fed minutes hawkish” with the same citation. 8) **Asset clarity** – explicitly label the trade as “EPAM” and include the handle mapping to spx/ndx if desired. 9) **Remove any extraneous text** (e.g., “Main‑focus check”) and keep the output to the required 4 mover lines plus the single swing‑trade line. Once these edits are applied, the analysis will satisfy the acceptance gate and provide a concise, actionable outlook.",
