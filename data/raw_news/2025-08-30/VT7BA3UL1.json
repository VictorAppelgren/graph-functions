(TSXV: KDSX) (OTCQB: KDCCF) (\"Kadestone\" or the \"Company\"), a vertically integrated property company, today announced its financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2025.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company reported a net loss of $2,485,124, or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $1,703,048, or $0.04 per share, for the same period in the prior year. The increased loss was primarily driven by operating expenses including consulting fees of $973,393, salaries and wages of $909,080, and interest expense of $517,310. These expenses were partially offset by income from associates totaling $541,275 and income from an investment in a mortgage fund amounting to $199,484.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities also increased, rising to $2,733,134 for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $1,767,546 in the prior year, reflecting the higher level of operational spending during the period.\n\nThe above unaudited financial information, including comparative information, is expressed in Canadian dollars and has been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, using the accounting policies and methods of application as described in notes 2 and 3 of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023.\n\nKadestone was established to pursue the investment in, acquisition, development and management of residential and commercial income producing properties, and procurement and sale of building materials within major urban centres and high-growth, emerging markets in Canada. The Company operates five complimentary business lines spanning building materials procurement and supply, property development and construction, construction finance, asset ownership and property management. These synergistic business lines have solidified Kadestone's vision to become a market leading vertically integrated property company.
