  "description": "SEATTLE, August 07, 2025--Zonar announces launch of Zonar Ignition\u2122, a next-generation cloud-based fleet management platform.",
  "content": "SEATTLE, August 07, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Zonar, a leader in commercial vehicle fleet health and safety, today announced the launch of Zonar Ignition\u2122, a next-generation cloud-based fleet management platform designed to replace the industry\u2019s fragmented legacy systems with unified, real-time insights. Coming nine months after Zonar\u2019s merger with GPS Trackit, Ignition reflects the company\u2019s accelerated pace of innovation and focus on delivering joint value to customers. Zonar Ignition helps fleets maximize uptime, reduce costs and respond to challenges faster through three core features that define a modern fleet management platform:\n\u2022 Integration-Ready: Built on a flexible framework, the cloud-based Ignition platform seamlessly integrates Zonar data with third-party data sources. An open API combined with the ability to build sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) modules, Zonar provides its customers with a more customizable and efficient experience.\n\u2022 One Screen, Total Control: Ignition consolidates and displays all crucial fleet and third-party data on one screen. A single-pane-of-glass view allows operators to assess the status of vehicles, drivers, and assets in real time on a single high-resolution map, rather than navigating through tabs to collect insights to make data-driven decisions.\n\u2022 Actionable Insights, Real-Time Results: Through Zonar\u2019s market-leading hardware, Ignition aggregates data from its TCU hardware, compliance solutions, driver behavior monitoring systems and third-party systems into personalized reports. Interactive dashboards surface key performance indicators, including fuel usage, route efficiency and safety events, and enable drill-downs that drive continuous operational improvements. More than 30 detailed reports and personalized dashboards are available. From real-time KPIs and granular driver and vehicle data, to live alerts on speeding, idling, or off-route activity, Ignition diagnostics help improve safety and efficiency while increasing uptime with scheduled maintenance and preemptive alerts. \"Whether it\u2019s a school bus, sanitation truck or specialized utility vehicle, for too long fleet managers have had to choose between clunky workflows or unreliable data when managing drivers, vehicles and other critical business assets,\" said Charles Kriete, CEO, Zonar. \"We saw a clear need for something faster, smarter and more efficient. With Ignition, we\u2019ve brought together the best of Zonar and GPS Trackit to give fleets a single window into unified workflows and manage all aspects of vehicles, drivers and assets. This approach helps derisk operations and delivers actionable analytics through actionable intelligence. This platform is not just for our current customers, but for any fleet looking for a better, more connected way to run their operations.\"\n\nThe launch of Zonar Ignition underscores the company\u2019s role as both a trusted partner and an innovator in fleet technology. A pivotal step in Zonar\u2019s ongoing mission to help fleets operate at their highest potential, Ignition\u2019s platform is designed to meet today\u2019s operational demands and evolve with future transportation challenges. The first major milestone since Zonar\u2019s merger with GPS Trackit on December 3, 2024, Zonar Ignition signals the combined company\u2019s ability to innovate quickly and deliver value at scale. By uniting Zonar\u2019s telematics expertise with GPS Trackit\u2019s scalable platform, the company is accelerating cloud-based fleet visibility, analytics, and AI-driven insights. Ignition also integrates with Zonar\u2019s proprietary technologies, including EVIR\u00ae for electronic inspections, CARB tools for emissions compliance, Z Pass\u2122 for student rider visibility, and Zonar Coach\u2122 for driver safety coaching, giving fleets a single platform to optimize operations, improve safety, and reduce costs.
