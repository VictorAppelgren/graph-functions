  "description": "Guy Johnson, Kriti Gupta, Valerie Tytel and Mark Cudmore break down today's key themes for analysts and investors on \"Bloomberg: The Opening Trade.\"  (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Mark, does CPI matter? CPI really matters today. As you know, Guy, I quite often provide context that you shouldn't read too much into one print. But I think if CPI clearly beats today and it doesn't necessarily matter whether that comes to the headline or the core. But if the set of data is overall clearly strong, I think it can really wreak havoc in markets. I think it disrupts both stocks and bonds, and that's because it'll simultaneously disrupt two important narratives at the moment in markets. One is it'll kind of hinder the Fed dovish pivot, which is priced in aggressively so suddenly make it harder for those cuts to come. It'll kind of raise up the stagflation threat. And with that, it'll also increased scrutiny on the US fiscal outlook, which has quite died in the last couple of months and correctly so in June. We are getting really worried about the US fiscal outlook prematurely and as we talked about at the time, auctions are actually going okay, we didn't have the fiscal deal passed, we didn't have tariffs come through to inflation yet. Well, now the situation has changed. Last week auctions were poor. Now we're seeing the fiscal measures actually come through in terms of concrete mood changes in the US debt burden, in terms of their expected payments over the next year. And we might be about to see tariffs really feature to inflation as well. So the all the factors that were driving a bullish view in Treasuries two months ago have changed to be bearish. So I think that if we get a high print today, we see Treasuries sell off right across the curve. We see stocks lower and we see a knee jerk reaction for dollar strength. But Mark, put a number on this for me. What number on core CPI would really start to doubt that September Fed cut would have to be higher than 2.4. No, it doesn't have to be higher than 2.4. I think that the whisper number is that if we get a miss from the Bloomberg consensus today, it'll be a slightly higher print than a slightly lower. That is true, but still, if confirmed, it's a problem. So it's right that we're at the higher end of those expectations. But I think that if we get let's just say a number that where the prints are roughly in line, but one or two of them is just point one above expectations, that'll be enough to cause problems. Now, that might be a less strong reaction, but that will still see bonds sell off and stocks that offer me the price action in stocks was not good yesterday. And we have to know that the US Treasury yields the long and have been rising very, very slowly the last five days in very, very quiet markets because all the fundamental drivers for Treasury strength are now behind us. Mark, what does it do to the bond market I'm looking at for 28 on the ten year yield? Give us a range. Look, I think ten year yields are going to rise substantially from here into year end. I mean, year ends a bit of an arbitrary date. Maybe it goes into next year. But I think the you know, the the data, the multi-year highs in Treasury yields are going to be tested again over the coming six months coming year. I think that the narrative of the bond market facing a reckoning, which Jeffrey Gundlach said back in June and I pushed back against at the time, is now valid. It's now the time to play that theme. But for the coming six months or so, you're going to see ten year yield significantly higher over the coming months.",
