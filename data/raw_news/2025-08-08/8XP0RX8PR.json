  "content": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Read our ethics policy .\n\nThe Avia Smart Deadbolt+ paired with the SolarPro is a great Home Key solution for Apple users, without locking out folks who want physical keys or a front-door code.\n\nA front door with a smart lock is incredibly convenient. A lock that can be controlled remotely, unlock automatically when you're close to the house, or via a shareable digital key, opens up so many possibilities.\n\nThere have been quite a few cracks at the concept. Some are good, most are bad. Several are super-expensive. Beyond more glaring flaws like poor network connectivity, the bad ones overlook the power problem.\n\nA smart lock needs power in order to communicate with a network and to perform its core functionality. But, being on the edge of a swinging door, it requires some form of portable power, usually in the form of replaceable batteries.\n\nThe Avia Smart Deadbolt tries to solve this problem with its own solution, with the SolarPro add-on.\n\nWe tried the Avia Smart Deadbolt+ both with and without the solar add-on. We like both combos for different reasons.\n\nOh, and we're homeowners, not landlords. We can see the possibility of using this as a landlord, though.\n\nThe Deadbolt+ is a replacement lock for your door, with you switching out the door's existing locking mechanism in favor of its own. You have a choice of two colorways, with the lock provided in black or satin nickel, depending on your preferred styling, and it measures 2.5 inches in diameter.\n\nIn isolation, the lock is an enhanced cylindrical barrel lock mechanism, sticking out of the door. While this outer ring enclosure on just physical locks is normally more or less flush with the door, this one has a bunch of numbered buttons on the top, as part of its smart lock functionality.\n\nWe replaced a slightly older, bulkier (and less smart) model with the new unit. If you look closely at the pictures, you can see the outline of the old frame.\n\nThe Smart Deadbolt+ still conventionally works with a key in the middle section as usual. It's got a slightly newer key standard, with differing pins on either side of a frame \u2014 which we like. They're still duplicatable at hardware stores, but the locksmiths we spoke to in the course of this review say that this key form factor is harder to pick, and more sturdy, than the standard inch and a half long key you probably have on your chain right now.\n\nThe deadbolt has been independently tested to ANSI 156.40 standards for security and durability, and with some lock pick testing to boot.\n\nThe outer segment is where the important parts lie for the smart lock functionality. For a start, those buttons can be used to enter a PIN to unlock the door without the key, with the buttons lighting up when pressed.\n\nThe base of the enclosure also illuminates, giving more of a clue to how to unlock it. There are built-in sensors allowing it to be unlocked remotely, including with the app or Home Key on iPhone, or an Apple Watch, or one of two included keyfobs per lock package.\n\nThe section for the back of the door is about the same size as just about everything else we've used. It has the usual rotating knob used to unlock the door from the inside.\n\nGiven the small amount of space inside the door for the lock to exist, most of the tech lives in this rear box. This is also where you would insert the batteries for the lock. A total of four AA batteries are needed to power the lock on its own, which would periodically need replacing unless you use the SolarPro.\n\nAvia says that you get \"up to five years\" between battery replacements with the SolarPro add-on. We haven't been able to test that, of course.\n\nWhat we do like about that battery compartment is that it is easily accessible from the back of the unit. We replaced a lock that you essentially had to completely disassemble to get to the battery compartment when the AA batteries died.\n\nThe Smart SolarPro is essentially a small solar panel that you attach to the front of the Deadbolt+ during installation. The idea is \u2014 obviously \u2014 that it collects power from the sun, which in turn recharges the batteries inside.\n\nThe SolarPro extends from the edge of the bore hole that the lock fits through down by about 2.75 inches. It's also 2.25 inches wide, marginally narrower than the lock itself.\n\nIt's an extra element that adds an obvious smart element to an item that looks pedestrian from a distance. At the same time, it's not intrusive to the overall appearance of the lock.\n\nAvia claims that in strong sunlight, the solar panel will help recharge the batteries enough to handle up to 100 operations per day. Your mileage may vary depending on climate and how much sun your door will get in a day, but 100 operations may also be quite a lot for most users to get through regularly.\n\nWe got bored after about 50 cycles in indirect sunlight. There was no apparent drain on the batteries.\n\nHowever, you do have to supply your own rechargeable AA batteries, so that will be an extra cost on top. Conventional AA batteries will not work, and you don't want to try charging them in the lock.\n\nI'd really like Avia to have been clearer about this on the box, or charging a bit more and including the rechargeable batteries. Finding it in small text in the installation guide was a drag, and slowed the process after installation and before activation in the app.\n\nThe installation process for the Smart DeadBolt+ and SolarPro is straightforward, even compared to some other smart locks we have tested. In short:\n\u2022 Remove the old lock and strike plate\n\u2022 Insert the new deadbolt in the opening\n\u2022 From the front, insert the keyway through the deadbolt with the tang vertical\n\u2022 Wire up the back section before mounting the electronics in place\n\nThis took us about 15 minutes, and that's including time spent to disassemble the unit because we had the tang horizontal, and the internal knob to unlock the door didn't work right.\n\nThe SolarPro element's installation is not much more difficult. Between steps two and three, you connect the Deadbolt+'s cable to the pass-through of the SolarPro, and feed it through as before. That's about it.\n\nThis is, for the most part, easy even for a non-technical person to set up, though as we said, you do need to make sure that the lock shaft is vertical.\n\nAfter you have installed the lock, you then have to complete the setup using the company's app.\n\nA key part of the installation and overall usage of the lock itself, the companion app is used to manage the lock's settings and to connect it to the HomeKit network. This is done within the app, with pairing done with a button press and a scan of a code underneath the battery cover.\n\nThe lock connects over Bluetooth, but it also has support for HomeKit over Thread, meaning it will work with HomeKit as well as Apple's Home Key platform. Once set up, you can send digital keys to others, so their iPhone or Apple Watch can unlock the door.\n\nThe app is used to set up the codes for the PIN pad; however, you can only set up a maximum of ten codes. You can, however, set up different lighting effects for the lock's lights, again to match your preferred aesthetic.\n\nThere's also support for six key fobs, of which you have two supplied in the kit.\n\nYou can also set the lock to stay unlocked or to automatically lock up to four minutes after it was last unlocked, for added security. This is useful if you have someone who has a habit of leaving doors unlocked, or if you handed a code out to a neighbor and want to make sure everything stays secure.\n\nThere's also a log system at play, which will tell you when it was last unlocked.\n\nOur border routers are a pair of HomePod minis and an Apple TV, about 40 feet from the front door. We're testing some Wi-Fi 7 gear too. Bluetooth is fussy on these locks, but Bluetooth is always fussy.\n\nThe front door didn't want to reliably connect with Thread either, but I will admit I live in a challenging wireless environment. Ultimately I added a Eve Energy smart switch about 2/3 of the way to the lock, and that cleared up everything.\n\nThe back door has line of sight to the Apple TV that's one of my Thread routers, and is fast and flawless. Very impressive.\n\nWe've got the silver one with the solar panel on the front door, and the black one with just AA batteries powering it on the back. It makes sense to have the solar on the front, as that's the main ingress and egress for the entire family.\n\nWe suspect the batteries on the back will last about forever. So long, in fact, we'll probably take the access door off every few months to make sure the batteries aren't leaking all over the place.\n\nHaving a smart lock is a big step forward for homeowners who want to enhance their smart home. What Avia offers is a system that is quite a good option for those who want to go in that direction.\n\nOn its own, the Deadbolt+ provides a lot of different ways to unlock the door, both with and without Apple's hardware. You do, however, need an iPhone to complete the setup process at this time, and an Android app currently isn't available for those who own devices on that platform.\n\nOnce set up, though, this isn't a giant problem assuming you just want to use the keypad, key fob, or physical key.\n\nThe SolarPro is an extremely useful add-on if you don't want to have to keep replacing the batteries, and we think it's essentially a requirement. Power isn't a problem in traditional locking systems, but it is one now in the world of smart locks.\n\nThe Avia Smart Deadbolt+ and SolarPro is a combination that helps remove one more small complaint that consumers may have about smart locks. It's a good option for HomeKit users, but while it's a bit of an investment, it's not too premium to lock people out from a more connected home.\n\nWe really, really like the Avia Deadbolt+. It's notably more expensive than the Level Lock - Touch Edition, for example, which, if it's working for you, is the cheapest Home Key lock we've found yet.\n\nThe Level Lock - Touch is inconsistent, though. It works for some, it doesn't for others. The Avia Deadbolt+ is consistent, and works for everybody, it seems.\n\nIt is a premium product, with premium features, and a premium price. How much these premium features mean to you is best left for the reader to decide.\n\nWhere to buy the Avia Smart Deadbolt+ and SolarPro\n\nThe Avia Smart Deadbolt+ and SolarPro are available from Avia directly, with the Deadbolt+ priced at $269 and the SolarPro for $43.\n\nThis review has been sponsored by Avia, but all opinions are of the AppleInsider Team. The manufacturer was only able to jump to the front of the months-long review queue due to the sponsorship.",

Features\n- Apps\n- Camera\n- Display\n- Security and Privacy\n- Apple Silicon\n- Ports\n- Accessories\n- Services\n- 2. iOS 18\n- Apple Intelligence\n- Photos update\n- Messages updates\n- Game Mode\n- Locked and Hidden apps\n- Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center customization options\n- 3. Manufacturing iPhone in the United States\n- 4. Learn more about iPhone\nWhen Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, it was meant to be a crossroads between communication, technology, and design. After a few years of ramping up the supply chain and gaining popularity, the iPhone began to dominate the smartphone market.\nSince the iPhone 4, no other device line has penetrated the market in the same way. Despite concerns from analysts that Apple was becoming too reliant on the iPhone, the company pivoted to services and software sales that fed off the increasing install base.\nHaving one central device act as a magnet to other portions of a company's business has been referred to as the \"halo effect,\" and this phenomenon plays a vital role in the Apple ecosystem.\niPhone Features\nThe basic slab-of-glass-and-aluminum design hasn't changed much over the lifetime of the iPhone. Interaction paradigms have shifted, and Apple has moved from Touch ID to Face ID, but overall the concept of a piece of glass displaying relevant information has remained constant.\nApple developed specialized software specifically for the iPhone and touch interfaces called iOS. The operating system shares many elements with its macOS cousin but focuses on a touch-only interface. As of iOS 13, Apple branched the OS into two different forks, iOS and iPadOS, to address hardware-specific features more directly.\nApps\nThe App Store operates as the sole storefront for software on iOS devices. Apple does not allow users to side-load apps from the web or use other app stores on iOS.\nMany anti-trust investigations surrounding the App Store and how business is conducted have shown no evidence of a rigged system or monopoly. Even so, some companies like Microsoft or third-party developers still call for investigations into Apple's business practices.\nAll apps and subscriptions sold in the App Store are subject to a 30% service fee on Apple Platforms. Subscriptions that retain a subscriber for over a year are only charged 15%.\nApple pre-loads every iPhone sold with several default apps, and they are all first-party apps. Once users finish the onboarding process on a new iPhone, they can go to the App Store and download free and paid apps via their Apple ID.\nApp updates are free, but some features may be locked behind paywalls called in-app purchases or IAP. Some apps charge a subscription fee instead of IAP, which will unlock features once a user subscribes.\nThe App Store makes most of the profits in the mobile app market despite having a smaller user base than Google Play.\nCamera\nThe smartphone camera was a relatively new concept when the iPhone was released in 2007. Since then, Apple has used its expertise in tying hardware and software together to produce industry-leading mobile photography engines that fit in your pocket.\nApple releases new photography-focused features with each new hardware or OS release, as consumers have shown that to be a high priority for new-device purchases.\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and newer can shoot 48MP photos using the ProRAW format to capture large and detailed photos. It is also capable of recording ProRES video in 4K.\nComputational photography has only improved in recent generations. For iPhone 16, Apple now offers reversible Photographic Styles that basically enable the user to apply styles and reprocess a photo as if it were freshly captured.\nLive Photos\nThe iPhone will capture 1.5 seconds of video before and after the camera shutter is pressed. This produces a playable video with sound to show off the events surrounding the image capture. When editing Live photos, users can select which frame is shown as the still, and all edits made to the still photo are applied to the entire Live Photo.\nSwiping up on a live photo within the Photos app will let users change the still image into a looping GIF or a long exposure. These changes show up as live tiles within the day-view of the Photos app.\nPortrait Mode\nWhen using Portrait mode, the iPhone will utilize multiple cameras to determine the depth map of what is being photographed, then produce a simulated bokeh effect live on the screen. The iPhone SE has only one camera but still takes portrait mode photos using algorithms to determine the borders of objects, which can detect even fine hair for use in the image.\nQuick Take\nA feature introduced in iOS 13 called Quick Take lets users quickly start recording a video when using the Camera app. While in the camera section of the Camera app, holding down the shutter button will begin recording in 1080p video. This is much faster than switching to the video mode if you're already snapping photos.\nNight Mode\nApple's Neural Engine can capture multiple exposures of a single scene and stitch it together into a fully exposed image. This is called Night Mode, and it occurs exclusively from every other camera operation. Bright scenes use HDR, medium scenes use standard exposure, and darker scenes default to Night Mode.\nWhen Night Mode is active, users can adjust the exposure time to multiple seconds, and the available time extends if the iPhone is used on a tripod. Capturing nearly pitch-black scenes or night skies is now easily done without technical skill. The resulting image will be exposed, so it still appears to be a nighttime or dark photo, an alternate approach to Apple's competitors.\nThe iPhone 12 Pro series added Night Mode portraits, and the entire iPhone 12 series supported Night Mode selfies, which carries over into newer models.\nDeep Fusion\nThis enigmatic feature was announced as a part of the iPhone 11 release in 2019. The user couldn't control or select it, and there is no setting anywhere in the OS for enabling it. The feature does not work with \"capture outside the frame\" enabled.\nWhen the shutter is clicked, the Neural Engine observes a still subject in medium lighting and automatically switches to multiple exposures. The iPhone will capture nine different images when this happens, with the one on the shutter press acting as the anchor image.\nThe Neural Engine and machine learning algorithms break all nine images down pixel by pixel and \"decide\" which pixel will remain in the final composite image. This results in a photo created by machine learning rather than based on what was captured by the sensor.\nA Deep Fusion photo will contain a higher amount of detail, color and shadow accuracy, and exposure when compared to images captured without the process. The feature is designed to be completely invisible, and users will not know if it has occurred or not without specialized software that searches metadata within the photo.\nApple upgraded its Deep Fusion system on iPhone 14 by moving it to earlier in the process, so images could retain more color and texture.\nDisplay\nSuper Retina XDR with ProMotion\n- Used on the iPhone Pro models\n- All-Screen OLED\n- HDR-ready\n- 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio\n- 120Hz variable refresh\n- True Tone\n- P3 Color\n- 1000 nits of brightness\nSuper Retina XDR\n- Used on the standard iPhone models\n- All-Screen OLED\n- HDR-ready\n- 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio\n- True Tone\n- P3 Color\n- 800 nits of brightness\nThe iPhone 11 and iPhone XR use a Liquid Retina HD display that is a LED with lower pixel density (326 PPI) and contrast ratio (1,400:1). The iPhone SE and older Touch ID-based iPhones use a screen called the Retina HD display, and it has the same specs as the Liquid Retina HD display but is a wide-screen display.\nSecurity and Privacy\nAny iOS device you buy comes fully encrypted by default. When setting up the device for the first time, Apple prompts users to secure their iPhone with a passcode or passphrase, then locks it with biometrics.\nBiometric data is end-to-end encrypted and stored within the Secure Enclave on the device. The actual biometric information is discarded. Instead, a mathematical representation of the data is stored in the Secure Enclave for comparison at each prompt.\nApple says privacy is a fundamental human right, and it designs its products with that in mind.\nFace ID\nAt the top of the iPhone, the sensor array contains infrared scanning technology that will collect depth and image data of the face being scanned every time Face ID is used. Machine learning algorithms also look for a \"live\" subject with eyes open and looking at the camera to prevent 3D models from fooling the technology.\nThe infrared scanner sprays the target with 30,000 dots to gather the face data. The eyes, nose, and mouth must be visible for the system to recognize the face when using traditional Face ID.\nHowever, Apple has added a new version of Face ID that uses the unique features found around a person's eyes to identify them. This allows for Face ID use while wearing a mask but isn't as secure as the traditional version.\nApple stated that Face ID is much more secure than Touch ID, and there is a 1 million to 1 chance of a random stranger unlocking your phone. Identical twins are the only exception, and Apple is looking to eliminate this anomaly through more advanced scanning technology.\nTouch ID\nThe Home Button on the iPhone acted as an iconic part of the device for its first ten years of existence until the iPhone X removed it in favor of a full-screen display. The iPhone 5S introduced Touch ID to the Home Button, which would scan for a fingerprint by taking a high-resolution image of the finger presented to compare to what is stored on the Secure Enclave.\nThe steel ring surrounding the Touch ID button would complete an electrical circuit with the user's finger\u2014 a fake finger or deceased person could not unlock the phone. The introduction of Touch ID brought secure encryption to the masses and still exists on some iPads and MacBooks.\nThe iPhone SE was the last iPhone with Touch ID. It was discontinued in February, 2025.\nApple Silicon\nApple builds its custom processors for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and the Mac. By developing its chipsets, Apple can customize its software to work directly with the hardware in a way that competitors cannot imitate.\nThese chipsets are the brains behind Apple's software platforms, machine learning algorithms, graphics processing, and Apple Intelligence. The built-in Neural Engine makes many operations much more efficient, from taking photos to editing video.\nThe A16 was introduced with the iPhone 14 lineup but was only used in the Pro and Pro Max models. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus got the A15 instead, likely as a differentiator and cost-cutting decision.\nApple's A17 Pro is used in the iPhone 15 Pro models and is the first chipset built on the 3nm process. It has hardware-accelerated ray tracing to push video games even further.\nA18 is used in the iPhone 16 lineup including the entry iPhone 16e. It enables powerful graphics processing and Apple Intelligence.\nPorts\nThe iPhone has used the Lightning port and cable since it debuted in the iPhone 5. Apple had always shipped its iPhones with a single Lightning cable and 5W adapter until the iPhone 11 Pro, which shipped with an 18W adapter.\nThe iPhone 12 did not ship with any power adapter or headphones, a move beneficial to the environment and Apple due to lower costs. This means the box is much smaller, so plastic and rare metal use are reduced, and shipping weight and size are also reduced. This is the equivalent of removing 400,000 vehicles from the road.\nWhile the iPhone 13 was rumored to be \"portless,\" the actual release used a Lightning port as usual. Apple continued to ship the iPhone 13 without earphones or a charger.\nThe iPhone 14 was the last new product with a Lightning port as EU regulations helped spur Apple to USB-C. The first iPhone with USB-C was the iPhone 15 released in 2023, and the last with Lightning was the iPhone SE discontinued in 2025.\nGoing forward, all iPhones will use USB-C. Apple differentiates the port between standard and pro models by offering USB 2.0 on the former and USB 3.2 gen 2 on the latter.\nAccessories\nEntire industries exist to provide accessories to the iPhone user base of over 1.5 billion users. Apple offers a few first-party accessories built to offer unique experiences, but third-party manufacturers provide most of the accessories made.\nMade For iPhone Program (MFi)\nApple lets companies license proprietary hardware for their products to produce accessories that work directly with iPhone and Apple technologies. The program still exists despite the move from Lightning, but involves different products and chips for licensing.\nMFi Software:\n- AirPlay\n- CarPlay\n- HomeKit\n- GymKit\n- iPod Accessory Protocol (iAP)\n- MFi Lightning Game Controller\n- MFi Hearing Aid\n- Wi-Fi Accessory Configuration (WAC)\nMFi Hardware:\n- Authentication coprocessors\n- Headset Remote and Mic\n- Audio Module\n- Lightning Analog Headset Module\n- Lightning to Headset Jack Adapter Module\n- Lightning connectors and receptacles\n- Magnetic Charging Module\n- Smart Connector\n- MagSafe\nCases\nApple makes premium and silicone cases for the iPhone and changes out the options and colors available on a seasonal basis. Third-party companies exist by the dozen that build custom cases to personalize users' iPhones.\nApple eliminated leather from its lineup in 2023, shifting to a material called FineWoven.\nWhile cases usually exist to provide protection and add personality to a device, many features and technology that otherwise do not exist within the iPhone. For example, Lifeproof makes a case that can be fully submerged for underwater video or photography.\nThere are many specialized cases available that include infrared scanners, microphones, game controllers, and modular camera lens mounts. There was even a first-party Apple Smart Battery Case that added additional battery life with a unique design that was ultimately replaced by the MagSafe Battery Pack.\nThe iPhone 12 and later, including the phones themselves and official cases, have built-in magnets. Apple calls its magnet system MagSafe, recycling an old branding name from defunct MacBook chargers. The magnets will work with an ecosystem of accessories, including wireless-charging pads and docks, car mounts, wallets, and sleeves. Both Apple and hardware partners like Belkin are making official MagSafe accessories.\nAudio\nApple purchased Beats by Dre to absorb their music-streaming service and talent, but along with that came an entire hardware branch. The company still exists as a branch within Apple, and it sells Beats branded headphones with custom chipsets made by Apple.\nBeats By Dre with Apple Silicon:\n- Beats Studio\n- Beats Solo\n- Powerbeats\n- Powerbeats Pro 2\n- Beats X\nApple has its brand of earbuds as well. The AirPods came about as Apple removed the headphone jack from their devices and ushered in a new era of totally wireless audio. Since their release, third-party manufacturers have raced to mimic the all-wireless design, but very few have come close to capturing the same form factor, and battery life found within AirPods.\nApple first-party audio:\nMagSafe and charging\nThe iPhone can use wireless charging, fast charging over USB-C PD, and standard charging over USB. To take advantage of wireless charging or fast charging, users must purchase those accessories separately.\nApple announced but never released a proprietary wireless charging system called AirPower. The charging mat was meant to simplify charging devices wirelessly by enabling users to place their iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch anywhere on the mat. The charging mat was ultimately canceled when Apple allegedly could not solve overheating issues.\nApple has since released a new charging and accessory system called MagSafe, which charges the iPhone at 15W and connects via a circular magnet. It is assumed that MagSafe will ultimately replace the Lightning port and handle data and charging on future iPhones.\nWith the iPhone 13, Apple introduced a new MagSafe feature, adding Find My support to the MagSafe wallet. Rather than checking for a ping from a tracker, the system instead tells users when and where the wallet was detached from the back of the iPhone.\nThe MagSafe Battery Pack with a Lightning port is no longer for sale as of 2023. Apple could revive the product with a USB-C port, but there hasn't been any signs of it being announced.\nPhotography and Videography\nThe mobile phone camera is probably one of the most important things customers consider before purchasing. Since the iPhone became such a popular pocket camera, manufacturers have developed accessories and tools specifically to aid video and photo production.\nGimbles, mounts, flash sync systems, camera lenses, and iPhone-connected smart cameras have created a large market centered around the iPhone camera. When browsing the iPhone homepage on Apple's website, most of the page is dedicated to discussing photo and video capabilities.\nWhen paired with the right talent and equipment, the iPhone can produce competitive high-quality content. A few movies have been made with the iPhone, like \"Unsane.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple TV shows recorded episodes using the iPhone to observe proper quarantine and distancing.\nApple introduced ProRes support in its iPhone 13 Pro range to play into home movie making. Pro users can record 4K 60Hz ProRes directly to an external USB-C SSD with iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro.\nServices\nThe iPhone wouldn't be what it is today without the help of software and services. Apple has slowly built an entire software ecosystem surrounding its ever-popular pocket computer. Through each of these services, paid or not, Apple adds to the base value of every iPhone sold.\nAfter years of being told that Apple was too reliant on the iPhone as a single majority source of income, the company uses its services branch to build out and diversify its revenue. Services have become the size of a Fortune 500 company itself and continue to grow with each new effort from Apple.\nUsers can bundle Apple's paid services under a tiered subscription service called Apple One.\nSiri\nWhen the iPhone 4S was released with a virtual assistant, no one took it seriously. Initially, Siri could only act as a voice-controlled assistant that handled the most simple task or query.\nNow, Siri is a powerhouse piece of machine learning that exists on every Apple device sold. On the iPhone, Siri not only acts as a user-facing assistant with deep app connections and controls, and it also serves as the background intelligence that powers everyday operations.\nContacts, Calendar, Photos, and even the system keyboard rely on Siri Intelligence to manage information and surface what is most relevant to the user. Siri also acts as the brains behind Shortcuts, which can be activated via the assistant, through widgets, or in-app.\nApple does not directly monetize Siri, but it does use the assistant as a primary selling point for iPhone and accessories like HomePod mini and AirPods.\niMessage\nApple has often stated that the Messages app is the most used app on the iPhone. An iMessage is an Apple proprietary technology using end-to-end encryption to send messages via the web. Sending and receiving iMessages is exclusive to Apple products and has been cited as a significant source of consumer lock-in.\nWhen communicating via iMessage, a user sees \"blue-bubble\" messages, can share complex multi-media files, and use sticker packs and message effects. Apple also enhances iMessage group chats with unique features like message threads and custom group chat images.\nApple Music\nThe music streaming service that birthed Apple's push into services debuted in 2015. Apple Music is $10.99 a month and offers student and family plans. The service lives within the Music app on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and on the web.\nUsers can purchase music from iTunes when it is not available on the service, and it will be populated into their Apple Music library. If a user adds a physical CD to their Music app on macOS, the music will be synced across their account as well.\nApple Arcade\nApple Arcade is a monthly subscription service to games across all Apple platforms. A $6.99 per month subscription gains customers access to the entire game catalog and any new releases or updates.\nThe service has games from multiple genres and can be played with touch, though most titles support third-party controllers. Apple's push into gaming has made them embrace controllers like the Playstation Dualshock 4 and the Xbox Elite controller.\nApple TV+\nApple Studios is a new media branch within Apple that purchases and manages content for the video streaming service Apple TV+. The subscription costs $9.99 a month and exists on every Apple platform and several competitor devices.\nThe Apple TV app is needed for viewing Apple TV+ and is available in the following places:\n- Apple TV (Set-top-box)\n- iPhone\n- iPad\n- Mac\n- Roku\n- FireTV\n- Samsung Smart TV\n- LG Smart TV\n- PC\nApple News+\nApple News is a news aggregation app, and the company offers a premium content tier called Apple News+. The subscription is $12.99 per month and gives customers access to premium articles from newspapers and magazines.\nApple News Audio stories are exclusive to the iPhone application. Users can listen to articles read out loud and manage an independent queue of audio stories.\nApple Fitness+\nApple Fitness+ is a streaming fitness service with several workout types. Designed for Apple Watch users, it combines regularly updated workout videos with Apple Watch live health stats. It costs $9.99/month.\nApple revealed a SharePlay feature update to the service in 2021, enabling group workouts to be conducted remotely on multiple devices. In 2022, Apple removed the requirement for users to have an Apple Watch to participate in the service.\niCloud Storage\nThe term \"iCloud\" is a catch-all for Apple's syncing and storage service across devices and apps. The service portion of iCloud is specifically iCloud Storage.\nApple charges a monthly fee for the following storage tiers:\n- 5GB is free\n- 50GB is $0.99\n- 200GB is $2.99\n- 2TB is $9.99\n- 6TB is $29.99\n- 12TB is $59.99\nApple Card\nThe Apple Card doesn't seem to be a big earner for Apple but does add to the halo effect of capturing more customers who buy more Apple products. The card works best when used to buy more Apple products from Apple Stores and even allows customers to make interest-free purchases of nearly all Apple devices.\nDepending on the customer's credit score and other variables, the interest rate can vary from 13.24% to 24.24%. Purchases made with the physical card get 1% cashback, the card in Apple Wallet will net 2% cashback, and when used with specific partners and Apple itself, customers will get 3% cashback. Cashback rewards are automatically deposited into the customer's Apple Pay Cash balance.\nApple Card holders can open an Apple Savings account that can earn at 4.50% APY.\niOS 18\nAnnounced at WWDC 2024, iOS 18 is set to arrive in the fall alongside the iPhone 16. Here are some of the features users can expect to see.\nApple Intelligence\nThe most notable upgrade to Apple's upcoming operating systems is the integration of what Apple calls \"Apple Intelligence.\" Apple Intelligence is a personal-context based artificial intelligence. It is designed to work primarily on-device and help streamline tasks in a personal way.\nSome new features coming to the iPhone include on-device image generation, AI-powered writing and editing tools, and improved notification management.\nIt's worth noting that Apple Intelligence is only supported on the iPhone 15 Pro, M-series iPads, and M-series Macs.\nPhotos update\nA new Collections feature in iOS 18 automatically organizes the library by topics like Recent Days, Trips, and People & Pets. If you have a few favorite collections, you can pin them for quick access to the collections or albums most important to you.\nMessages updates\nApple has expanded Tapback options, now allowing users to respond to messages with any emoji, rather than the initial six it provided.\nThe new Send Later feature allows users to schedule when to send a message, which is perfect for ensuring you don't send someone a message when they're sleeping or when you want to schedule a birthday message.\nApple has confirmed that RCS support will arrive in iOS 18. RCS will improve messaging with Android devices by supporting read receipts, typing indicators, sending over Wi-Fi, and higher-quality media.\nThose who have an iPhone 14 or later will be able to use Messages via satellite. This new feature will allow users to send messages over iMessage and SMS, even without cellular or Wi-Fi service.\nWhen using iMessage, users can still use key features like sending emoji and Tapbacks, and anything sent via iMessage is end-to-end encrypted.\nGame Mode\nIn 2023, Apple introduced Game Mode to Mac \u2014 and a year later Game Mode is coming to the iPhone.\nGame Mode minimizes background activity while gaming. This allows the iPhone to sustain high frame rates for long gaming sessions.\nLocked and Hidden apps\nUsers can lock apps and require Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode to unlock them, lessening the fear of handing off your iPhone to someone else. Locked apps will not appear in search and notifications, either.\nApps can also be hidden by dragging them to a hidden apps folder, requiring users to unlock the folder via biometrics or passcode before viewing the contents.\nHome Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center customization options\nNow, on the Lock Screen, you can replace the controls at the bottom with something else, such as taking a note or quickly capturing a moment for your social media. If you have an iPhone 15 Pro, you can access these controls using the Action button.\nAs part of the expanded customization features, app icons, and widgets can now be scaled up to appear larger.\nUsers are no longer restricted to the standard app icon layout anymore. The new iOS 18 adds the ability to arrange apps along the bottom for quicker access or along the side to frame a favorite wallpaper.\nEach page of the Home Screen can feature a unique layout.\nManufacturing iPhone in the United States\nThere has been a lot of talk around the possibility of building an iPhone in the United States. Simply put, it isn't possible \u2014 at least not without incredible changes to the workforce, material availability, factories, and more.\nEven if Apple could perform final assembly in the United States by maximizing automation, most of the parts and materials would be sourced from abroad. The iPhone is a global product and the United States simply doesn't have the resources to make iPhone farm to table.\nThe discussions around manufacturing iPhone in the United States peaked in 2025 when the Trump administration levied extreme tariffs on countries around the globe. Tariffs were particularly high on China, which affects Apple the most.\nLearn more about iPhone\nLatest iPhone models:\n- iPhone 16e\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\nPrevious iPhone models:\n- iPhone 15\n- iPhone 15 Plus\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 14\n- iPhone 14 Plus\n- iPhone 14 Pro\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n- iPhone SE\n- iPhone 12\n- iPhone 12 mini\n- iPhone 11\nRumored iPhones:"

Apple Watch History\n- Force Touch Display\nThe Apple Watch was released in 2015 with three distinct models, several bands, and software that emphasized communication. Rather than become a fashion icon or social revolution, the Apple Watch ultimately evolved into the health and fitness wearable of today.\nThere are three types of Apple Watch available for purchase \u2014 the premium Apple Watch Ultra 2, the standard Apple Watch Series 10, and the budget Apple Watch SE.\nRumors have begun about the next generation of Apple Watch due in 2025. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Apple Watch Series 11 are both expected.\nBanning the Apple Watch\nMasimo is a company that builds medical equipment and has been entangled in a patent lawsuit over blood oxygen detection with Apple since 2020. It culminated in the United States International Trade Commission siding with Masimo and banning the import of affected Apple Watch models.\nThe only models for sale with the feature are the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. After an initial ban and appeal in December left the situation in question, the ITC doubled down and said the ban remains in effect for the duration of appeals.\nApple had a solution ready in case the ban remained in effect. Customs agreed that Apple removing blood oxygen detection from the affected models via software was sufficient to get around the import ban.\nAs of January 18, any Apple Watch purchased in the United States has the blood oxygen detection feature disabled. Existing models sold before that date are unaffected.\nThe Apple Watch SE is also unaffected.\nApple will be able to reenable the feature once the ban has been lifted. It isn't clear which will happen first \u2014 Apple winning its appeals or Masimo's patents expiring in 2028.\nApple Watch Features\nThe Apple Watch has seen a few design changes over the years, but all have shared similar characteristics. The Apple Watch runs watchOS, an operating system built specifically for the tiny watch screen. The Digital Crown, changeable watch bands, and an OLED screen have persisted throughout each generation of Apple Watch.\nwatchOS\nThere have been a few redesigns of watchOS over the years as Apple refined what the Apple Watch was for. While fitness and health were obvious uses, it wasn't always the priority. The first iteration of watchOS focused on communication with favorite friends, heartbeat sharing, and shareable doodles.\nBy 2018, Apple had found its balance for Apple Watch \u2014 fewer weird social features and more health, notification, and fitness focus. Each Apple Watch hardware revision and software update has refined these features into a mature operating system.\n- watchOS 8 made it so users can access the Share Sheet from more locations and better control text entry. Apple also introduced a new photo portrait watch face and the Find My app in this update.\n- watchOS 9 introduced customizable workouts and a Medication tracking app. Older watch faces were also adjusted to take advantage of larger displays.\n- watchOS 10 provided a full redesign of the operating system, making widgets available with a Digital Crown turn and Control Center with a Side Button press.\n- watchOS 11 includes the new Vitals app, Training Load, and a new Photos watch face.\nwatchOS 11\nAnnounced at WWDC 2024, watchOS 11 was released in September. While it didn't get much screen time during the keynote, Apple did mention several new features that benefit users.\nHealth and fitness features\nLike most major watchOS updates, Apple introduced plenty of new health and fitness-related features with watchOS 11.\nNew pregnancy-tracking features have been added to the Cycle tracker of Apple Health. It now shows the gestational age and tracks the pregnancy across health charts. It provides recommendations and notifications for health during pregnancy, such as reviewing the high heart rate threshold and receiving alerts for increased fall risk in the third trimester.\nVitals is a new feature that uses data collected while a wearer sleeps to establish a typical range for health metrics like heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature, blood oxygen, and sleep duration.\nIf any of these metrics are outside the typical range, the Apple Watch will send a notification with contextual information about possible factors, such as medications, elevation, alcohol, or illness. This can help users understand that paying closer attention to their bodies is a good idea.\nThe new Training Load feature helps users understand how workouts impact their bodies over time. It compares the intensity and duration of workouts over the last seven days to the previous 28 days, classifying the current training load to help users gauge the strain on their body and make informed decisions about their exercise regimen.\nSimilar to Training Load, a new effort rating has been added to the Workout app. The metric will gauge a user's exercise intensity, pace, elevation, heart rate, and personal data factor into each rating.\nUsers can now pause their Activity Rings for a day, week, month, or more and maintain their award streak.\nUser interface and user experience upgrades\nNew interactive widgets are displayed based on time, location, and more. New widgets include severe weather alerts, Training Load, Photos, Distance, and Shazam.\nThe Smart Stack feature has also been upgraded to automatically display relevant Widgets based on time, location, and other factors. Live activities are also included in the Smart Stack, providing important information such as the arrival time of an Uber or the likelihood of rain.\nA redesigned Photos face uses machine learning to search a user's photo library, select the best images, and create watch faces featuring their favorite people, pets, and places.\nOther watchOS 11 features\nThe Apple Watch Maps app will feature topographic maps with detailed trail networks and hikes, including all 63 U.S. national parks. Users can save maps to their Apple Watch to access them offline with turn-by-turn voice guidance.\nThe Translate app supports 20 languages, allowing users to see translations by typing or dictating a phrase. Users can also play the translation aloud and slow it down if needed. Languages can easily be downloaded to the Apple Watch, too.\nWatch Faces\nDespite user demand, Apple has never allowed third-party Apple Watch faces to be made for users. Instead, Apple provides custom watch faces with the occasional new face or update each year.\nEven though users are restricted to a specific set of Apple Watch faces, many are still available with different color choices for each. Add in custom complications and photo watch faces, and there are a near-endless number of faces a user can create.\nThe control over the Apple Watch face gallery gives Apple the ability to keep copyright or infringing material out of the user's hands. Also, it means a better overall experience for the look and feel of the device.\nSome inventive developers have found ways to add customization to watch faces previously unheard of by using unique widgets. While this is a limited workaround, it can still provide unique combinations for a more-personal watch face.\nBands\nBands use a simple hook and sliding mechanism to attach and secure the band in place. Apple offers a range of bands, but third-party manufacturers also make custom bands using Apple's template.\nSimilar to the era of iPod cases, then iPhone cases, watch bands have exploded into their own micro-business.\nEvery generation has used the same Apple Watch band lugs. This continued even when the device moved to a larger display in the fourth and seventh generations because the watch's physical size did not change. Pressing one of the buttons on either side of the casing releases the band.\nApple often introduces new colors and designs for existing watch bands but rarely uses new designs or materials. In 2020, Apple announced a line of \"Solo\" Apple Watch bands without a fastener. Apple designed these bands to stretch over the hand. Users must therefore order them to size.\nNew Apple Watch bands based on country flags were released in June 2021. There are 22 bands to choose from, and users can download the corresponding watch face from Apple's website.\nApple's next move in watch bands occurred in 2023 when it abandoned leather across its accessory lineup. It offered an alternative called FineWoven, but it's not an ideal replacement given its cloth-like material is prone to damage and stains.\nInterchangeable Apple Watch bands have remained a primary selling point since the original model was released in 2015. However, with each passing update, it is clear that Apple may have to change the connector eventually \u2014 rendering existing watch band collections useless without an adapter.\nDigital Crown\nThe Digital Crown is based on conventional time-setting crowns from analog watches. Apple set out to re-create this type of analog control for the digital era, leading to the Digital Crown. It rests on conductive liquid metal, allowing the crown to turn without the need for more complex wiring for signals.\nThe Digital Crown acts as a home button and a scroll wheel for navigation. A long press will invoke Siri, and a double press will switch back to the last app.\nEmbedded in the flat side of the crown is a conductive plate. It serves as part of the circuit from wrist to finger during an ECG on Apple Watch Series 4 and later. You can perform the measurement using the ECG app that is pre-installed on the device.\nAn update in watchOS 7.2 made it possible for ECG to detect atrial fibrillation at higher heart rates of up to 150BPM. Previously, the ECG app would not work if the user's heart rate was too high.\nApple repurposed the Digital Crown in the AirPods Max as a volume control knob and Siri interface. Apple Vision Pro also got a Digital Crown to control volume and immersion level.\nActivity Monitoring\nEach generation of Apple Watch includes various technologies targeting activity monitoring. The heart-rate sensor and accelerometer both track movement and activity throughout the day. Apple Health's Activity Rings display daily progress for three goals: a target exercise goal, calories burned, and hours where a user has gotten up to move.\nApple Watch allows users to share their activity rings inside the Activity app. This app gives users medals based on steady habits and the closing of rings. It also includes a social aspect, allowing users to challenge each other. One initiative called \"Apple Watch Connected\" will enable gyms to reward their members based on Activity app performance.\nFamily Setup\nFamily Setup lets a Family Group organizer set up a cellular Apple Watch for a family member without a dedicated iPhone. Children in the household get their own phone number for each Apple Watch, allowing them to keep in touch even if they don't have phones.\nFamily Setup lets parents specify with which contacts children can communicate. It can give parents automatic location notifications to keep tabs on where their family is. Kids can also use their wearables to track activity.\nSchooltime Mode is a feature that helps kids stay focused, limiting available features and activating Do Not Disturb during the school day while giving them a unique Apple Watch face.\nFamily Setup requires a fourth-generation device with cellular capabilities.\nApple Fitness+\nAs a part of Apple's push for services, the company released a new subscription called Apple Fitness+. It launched in December 2020 and is available on the Apple TV, iPad, and iPhone as an app.\nUsers can launch a workout from the device app or the Apple Watch. There are several workouts available, and thanks to the connectivity of Apple's devices, workout metrics from the Watch will appear on the screen.\nThe Fitness+ service is constantly updated with new workout videos from many instructors. The workouts range from simple cooldowns to challenging core exercises.\nCrash Detection\nThe iPhone 14 lineup, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Ultra have purpose-built sensors and algorithms for Crash Detection. If the user is in a severe car crash, the iPhone or Apple Watch will contact emergency services.\nIf both devices are present, they will work in tandem to determine if a crash has occurred. The technology isn't foolproof, however, and can be triggered by non-crash events like some roller coasters.\nCrash Detection utilizes an upgraded high dynamic range gyroscope, high g-force accelerometer, barometer, GPS, microphone, and advanced motion algorithms to determine if a severe crash occurred. Apple designed the algorithm to detect front impacts, side impacts, rear-end collisions, and rollovers.\nIf the user doesn't dismiss the alert in ten seconds, another ten-second timer starts. After that, emergency services are contacted.\nAn automated message with an estimated location and search radius will be played to the emergency services on a loop. Each replay will play back quieter to give the user a chance to speak to emergency services, and a button can be pressed to stop the recorded playback.\nAfter hanging up with emergency services, a call will be placed to emergency contacts. A ten-second timer will appear that can be dismissed before the call goes out.\nMinor collisions should not trigger Crash Detection. The accelerometer can detect up to 256G of force, and it uses the data collected from other sensors to determine if a crash occurred.\nSome users have reported false crashes have been detected on roller coasters, but the results are varied. Apple says that there isn't a \"silver bullet\" description that nails down exactly when Crash Detection activates since the algorithm has so many factors.\nEmergency services have reported concerns about wasted resources directed towards false positives. Skiiers have had some trouble from the feature on iPhone and Apple Watch, and don't always dismiss the false alarm.\nApple Watch Price Guide\nRetail prices start at $199 (USD) across the product line, but retailers regularly offer Apple Watch deals that offer double-digit and triple-digit savings on current and closeout models.\nApple Watch History\nBefore Apple Watch was released, it required the disparate skills of countless Apple staff and outside experts. Designer Marc Newson was brought in to help, as was Angela Ahrendts, who would become Apple's senior vice president of Retail and Online Stores.\nUnusually, though, it appears that this product began with one person's idea. Jony Ive, then Apple's chief designer, reportedly started working on the Apple Watch in 2011. Apple CEO Tim Cook has separately noted that Apple Watch development began after the death of Steve Jobs.\nHowever, the idea's origin could have begun as early as 2005. That was when Ive and his design team say they became serious about precision machining on the scale of the Apple Watch. And to explore how to do this, they visited watch manufacturers.\n\"We started researching watch companies just to understand machining metals, finishing metals, product assembly,\" design team creative lead Doug Satzger said in Leander Kahney's book, \"Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products.\"\nThen two months after Jobs died in 2011, the New York Times reported that Apple was researching a wearable computer.\n\"A person with knowledge of the company's plans told me that a 'very small group of Apple employees' had been conceptualizing and even prototyping some wearable devices,\" wrote journalist Nick Bilton. \"One idea being discussed is a curved-glass iPod that would wrap around the wrist; people could communicate with the device using Siri, the company's artificial intelligence software.\"\n\"The brain that brings all these things together is the smartphone, which, after all, is really the first wearable computer,\" he continued. \"Researchers note that the smartphone is almost never more than three feet away from its user.\"\nStill, if Ive says it started in 2011, that also means that the Apple Watch was officially Apple's first entirely new product since its co-founder's death. With the industry speculating how Apple could fare without Jobs, it was both a product and a way to demonstrate Tim Cook's direction.\nIf the aim was to show that Apple could still innovate the way it had, Ive says that he found the process \"humbling.\" This is a man who worked on the iPhone, literally the most successful product ever made, and yet the Watch was harder.\n\"Even though Apple Watch does so many things, there are cultural, historical implications and expectations,\" Ive said in 2014. \"That's why it's been such a difficult and humbling program.\"\nHe meant how reinventing the phone had been a lot less complicated than reinventing the watch. Technology has its fans, especially Apple, but the watches and watch collection is an entire other world with its history, rules, and obsessives.\nIve may have been one of them. When the Apple Watch came out, it was seen by some horologists as an affront. As phone manufacturers said, technology firms couldn't just walk in and make a phone, so some saw Apple as arrogant for launching the Apple Watch when it knew nothing about classical watch-wearers.\nWhen interviewed by leading watch publication Hodinkee, Jony Ive was asked about watches and reportedly recounted an anecdote about buying an Omega Speedmaster Professional in the 90s.\nThat would be like telling how you bought a Mac SE/30, or perhaps a Mac IIfx \u2013\u2013 machines that were expensive, classic, and are still beloved. If that didn't tell horologists that Ive was serious, then his background is why the Apple Watch leverages watch ideas like complications and a crown.\nUltra\nApple Watch Ultra is a new type of wearable from Apple separate from the standard lineup. It features a rugged titanium enclosure, an extra button, and specialized sensors.\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 improved on the original with a new SiP and brighter display. Apple added a space black color option in 2024.\nThe sapphire display is flat surrounded by a raised lip of titanium. The Digital Crown is protected by a crown guard, and the buttons are designed for use when wearing gloves.\nApple promoted the watch alongside three extreme activities \u2014 triathlons, diving, and hiking. There are three bands purpose-built for these activities too \u2014 Alpine, Trail, and Ocean.\nThe Action Button on the side of the Apple Watch Ultra can be programmed to perform different actions based on Focus. It adds a new range of quick-action functionality that can even launch a Shortcut.\nThis model is $799 and is available in natural titanium and space black.\nTenth Generation\nApple Watch Series 10 was released with a slight redesign in 2024. It got a thinner case with a wider display that has smaller bezels.\nThe resulting sizes increased by 1mm to 46mm and 42mm. The display on the 46mm option is larger than the display on the 49mm Apple Watch Ultra.\nNo new health sensors were added, but Apple did introduce a sleep apnea detection feature that works on the tenth and ninth generation models.\nThe wide angle display is 80% brighter and the always on mode refreshes every second. So, select watch faces now have a ticking second hand.\nApple Watch Series 10 is available in aluminum and titanium. The titanium option takes over in the previous price reserved for stainless steel.\nNinth Generation\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 iterated yet again, but this time with a faster S9 SiP. The new chipset enables features like on-device Siri and Double Tap.\nThere's not a lot to say about the 2023 model. It has the same sensors as the previous generation, the same external design, and runs watchOS 10.\nApple added a brighter display that enables the device to reach 2,000 nits in bright settings like in direct sunlight.\nThis model of Apple Watch starts at $399 for the 41mm size or $429 for the 42mm size. Adding Cellular to the aluminum model is a $100 premium, but stainless steel models get cellular by default.\nSE\nThe second-generation Apple Watch SE introduced Crash Detection, upgraded to the S8 SiP, and got a new plastic composite back case. It offers basic health and fitness tracking features without all the bells and whistles of more-premium models.\nUsers get access to heart rate tracking, workout tracking, and fall detection at a lower entry price with SE. It has the Series 4 design and lacks the always-on display.\nThe purpose of this model is to serve as an entry model for budget-conscious consumers. If people don't need temperature tracking, the ECG function, or blood oxygen tracking, then this is the model to get.\nThe 41mm model is $249 and the 42mm model is $299. Cellular options for Family Setup are also available at a slight premium.\nEighth Generation\nThe Apple Watch Series 8 is an iterative update with Crash Detection and temperature sensing as the two headlining features. While the everyday use of the Watch may not change much, these features could be critically important to some users.\nTemperature detection is tied directly to the cycle tracking feature in Apple Watch. It gathers temperature over about a week to establish the user's baseline sleeping temperature.\nThen, using that data and other metrics, it can determine if a person may have ovulated in the recent days prior. This retroactive notification of ovulation can be key in planning a pregnancy or determining reproductive health.\nCrash Detection has been a controversial feature for the 2022 Apple Watches. Users and emergency responders are complaining of false positives, which leads to wasted resources.\nApple no longer offers this model as a new purchase.\nSeventh Generation\nAnnounced in September 2021, the Apple Watch Series 7 was more a slight design refinement than a major new release. The biggest change was the display, which uses a larger 41mm or 45mm display, depending on the model, and increasing the amount of viewable screen by 20%.\nThe increased screen reduces the borders by 40% compared to the 2020 model. While the chassis has been redesigned with more rounded corners, the overall appearance hasn't massively changed in this iteration.\nCharging's faster by up to 33%, with an eight-minute charge providing enough power for 8 hours of sleep tracking.\nThey are offered in aluminum in five colors, the Apple Watch Series 7 starts from $399. A stainless steel version is also available in silver, graphite, gold, and a space black titanium model.\nRead the review here: Apple Watch Series 7 review: Bigger than you think\nSixth Generation\nIn September 2020, Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 6 and the more family-friendly Apple Watch SE. The latter was aimed at families, particularly children, from its lower price of $279 and its Family Setup features.\nThose let a parent set up a Watch for a child without buying them an iPhone, too. And it lets those parents stay in touch with their kids by including location notifications.\nIf you instead had from $399 to spend on an Apple Watch Series 6 at the time, you could have had the same features \u2013\u2013 but also much more. It features a significantly brighter always-on display, a faster processor, and blood oxygen tracking.\nAgain, Apple pushed the health features, with the latest watchOS 7.2 improving the ECG functions.\nRead our review here: Review: Apple Watch Series 6 is still the best smartwatch to buy\nYou can also check out the Apple Watch SE review here: Review: Apple Watch SE is the smartwatch for first-time buyers and upgrade-holdouts\nForce Touch Display\nBefore 2020, every generation of the smartwatch had included a Force Touch Display. This allowed users to press \"into\" the content to open up contextual menus. If this sounds familiar, it's because it was the fore-bearer to the now-deprecated 3D Touch.\nBecause of its small screen and limited interactions, Force Touch on this device stuck around one year longer than on iPhones. However, watchOS 7 and the 2020 hardware updates removed it.\nFifth Generation\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 was announced on September 20, 2019. It was the first model with an always-on display.\nThe always-on feature was a surprise. It had been predicted to come eventually, and it had been wanted from the start, but it was a surprise that Apple had managed it quite so soon.\nApple revealed other new hardware elements, such as an emergency call function and a compass that improved walking directions in Apple Maps. And there were new software options too \u2013\u2013 as for the first time, Apple Watch owners could now download apps directly from the App Store.\nApple Watch Series 5 started at $399 for the aluminum GPS-only one. For LTE, it was from $499. And there was again an Apple Watch Edition, this time with a ceramic chassis.\nRead the review here: The Apple Watch Series 5 leaves the competition in the dust\nFourth Generation\nThe overt red dot from the previous generation, signifying LTE, was dropped in favor of a more subtle red circle on the Apple Watch Series 4. That was the least of the changes made for this generation.\nThis model was as close to a reinvention of the Watch as Apple had made up to then. It featured an ECG monitoring sensor and a faster processor on the inside.\nAnd on the outside, it was bigger. Gone were the original 38mm and 42mm sizes. In were 40mm and 44mm.\nFor these \"small\" and \"large\" sizes, the difference of an extra 2mm plus reduced bezels meant that the screen should show a lot more information. Alongside all of the familiar Watch elements like the round face, new corner complications came.\nApple Watch Series 4 was launched on September 12, 2018, and prompted many people to sell on their old Watches to get one. They needed $399 for the non-cellular version and $499 for LTE.\nRead the review here: Review: Apple Watch Series 4 is the full realization of what a wearable can and should do\nThird Generation\nReleased in September 2017, the Apple Watch Series 3 was the first to include cellular capabilities, meaning users could make phone calls from it without their iPhone. LTE Watches had a distinctive red dot in their digital crown, otherwise, there were no visible hardware differences.\nThere was an audible one, though. For the first time, Siri on Apple Watch could answer you verbally.\nIf the second-generation models were released to fix issues with the original version, chiefly speed, then the Series 3 felt like something new. Significantly, the Series 3 is still on sale as of 2021, whereas neither the Series 4 nor Series 5 are.\nThat said, the only versions of the Series 3 you can buy now are with Sport Bands with limited colors. You could get silver, space gray, or gold finishes in aluminum at launch. Or silver and space black in stainless steel.\nWhat you couldn't get was either ceramic or the original gold. There was no Edition model for two Watch generations.\nBy this stage, Apple had gone all-in on the idea that Apple Watch was for health and fitness. It always had features for these, but arguably Apple initially positioned it as a fashion accessory.\nThat may not be true. Apple targeted the fashion market with its gold Apple Watch Edition, then dropped that model. But Apple was entering a brand new market with the Watch, and even Apple needs to make a splash sometimes.\nWhether the Watch was a fashion statement or Apple making a statement to the world that it was now in the timepiece game, Series 3 concentrated on health and fitness.\nRead the review here: Apple Watch Series 3 with cellular further establishes an emerging computing platform\nSecond Generation\nThe \"Series 0\" name began to appear in 2016 when Apple launched Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2. The Series 1 was mostly the same as the original but had a faster processor.\nThe original Watch had an Apple S1 processor, while the Series 1 had an Apple S1P and the Series 2 an S2P.\nBoth S1P and S2P were around 50% faster than the original Apple Watch. The Series 2 included GPS, a brighter display, and a degree of waterproofing.\nThere seemed to be little significant difference in the 2016 Apple Watch releases. They came with watchOS 3, and the latest operating system they can run is watchOS 6.\nThere were, though, very noticeable changes in pricing. For instance, there was no gold Apple Watch Edition for Series 1 or 2, though there was an Edition in ceramic.\nPlus, there was now an Apple Watch Nike version. This included a Nike sport band, which could be bought separately.\nWith its various bands and different materials, Apple Watch Series 1 started at $269. The Series 2 sold from $369 in aluminum and $549 in stainless steel.\nRead the review here: Apple Watch Series 2 is a great improvement, but watchOS 3 steals the show\nFirst Generation\nAs early as 2012, the word was out about a forthcoming Apple Watch \u2013\u2013 or, as it was always called then, the iWatch. At one point, Apple was said to be working with Intel to build its smartwatch.\nApple wouldn't say yes, and it wouldn't say no. There was as much speculation then about a watch as there is now about an Apple Car, but infinitely less published information. Few leaks happened, and while there were patents as early as 2007, none were recognized as being for the watch until much later.\nNext, in 2013, Apple hired Kevin Lynch as what they described as vice president of technology but was actually the head of the Apple Watch project. If he were the head, though, Jony Ive remained the heart.\nAnd he showed so on September 4, 2014, when, before the Watch was even launched, he privately predicted extreme success. Without directly quoting him or his reported profanity about it, the New York Times said that Ive believed Switzerland's watch industry was going to be in trouble.\nFive days later, Tim Cook introduced... the iPhone 6. And Apple Pay. Then at 55 minutes into the presentation, he said that could've been enough.\n\"We've really gone through enough to call it a day,\" he said to laughter from the audience. \"But we're not quite finished yet. We have one more thing.\"\nTim Cook spent 46 minutes detailing the new Apple Watch, which included a slightly vague promise to release it early the following year. It would ultimately go on sale with pre-orders on April 10, 2015.\nThose pre-orders consisted of three models, which Apple called \"collections.\" There were three available: the 18-carat gold \"Edition,\" the stainless steel standard model, and the aluminum sport model.\nEach came in either 38mm or 42mm sizes, with correspondingly different screens, but were otherwise functionally identical. For instance, all included the Digital Crown, and all of them would only light up their screen when you turned your wrist to see the time.\nOtherwise, the Apple Watches only differed in their materials \u2013\u2013 and price. While the sport model started at $349, the Edition was made from 18-carat gold and cost north of $10,000."
