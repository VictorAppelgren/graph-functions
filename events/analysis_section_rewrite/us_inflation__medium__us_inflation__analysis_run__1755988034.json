      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first pass but still feels like a collection of bullet‑style observations rather than a coherent, data‑driven scenario. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking each macro driver to the equity outcome: e.g., show how BOJ’s wage‑tight stance feeds into higher inflation expectations, which in turn supports higher nominal rates that lift dividend‑heavy pharma (Abbott, AbbVie, Pfizer) and small‑cap valuations via higher discount rates. Quantify the “10–15 % upside” with a simple price‑target calculation (e.g., current Russell 2000 level ≈ 1,200 → 1,320–1,380) and cite the exact source (Q7VVGNSQE). Replace vague “5–7 % CAGR” for UAS with the 97 % job growth figure and extrapolate a 5 % annualized salary increase, citing FOM34PUWA. Add a clear timeline: e.g., “if BOJ keeps rates ≥ 0.5 % through Q3 2025, small‑caps could hit 1,350 by Q2 2026.” Use a structured format: Base case, 1–2 alts (e.g., BOJ easing → small‑cap lag, or UAS slowdown → modest growth), risks, watch‑list signals. Ensure every claim is sourced: Sharpe ratio (M2PF568NP), UAS job data (FOM34PUWA), IPO numbers (Q7VVGNSQE), dividend yields (WISLWAJ15). Remove generic phrases like “could support” and replace with “likely to lift” when backed by data. Finally, present the scenario map in a concise paragraph, not a list, and end with a confidence rating (e.g., “moderate‑high”) justified by the convergence of macro, valuation, and sector fundamentals.",
