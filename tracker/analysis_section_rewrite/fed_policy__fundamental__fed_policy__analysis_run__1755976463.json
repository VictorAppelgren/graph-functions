      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (≤ 120 words)**  \n1. **Anchor the analysis in first‑principles**: explicitly state the real‑rate differential (Fed rate – inflation expectations), BoP balance, and terms‑of‑trade as the invariant drivers of the U.S. equity risk premium.  \n2. **Quantify the policy reaction**: cite the 10‑yr yield at 4.23 % (GX057ADL7) and the 50‑bp cut expectation, and show how a 4.0 % yield would lower the real rate from ~2.5 % to ~1.5 % (real‑rate differential).  \n3. **Causal chain**: link the Fed’s dovish pivot → lower real rates → higher discounted cash flows for tech/AI → equity valuation lift; add the dollar‑weakening effect on commodity prices and export terms.  \n4. **Political risk**: quantify the Trump‑Powell lawsuit as a “risk‑premium shock” (e.g., +0.5 % volatility spike) and note its potential to delay the policy shift.  \n5. **Catalysts**: list September CPI (expected 3.0 % vs 3.7 % prior) and jobs data (non‑farm payrolls +200 k) as the trigger points.  \n6. **Sources**: add inline citations (IDs) for every numeric claim and for the political risk narrative.  \n7. **Risk matrix**: present a concise table of upside/downside scenarios (e.g., “Fed cuts + equity +5 %” vs “Inflation rebound + equity –3 %”).  \n8. **Tone**: tighten prose, remove repetition, and keep the paragraph focused on the structural transition and its market transmission.",
