  "description": "Conjoined twins Abby and Brittany Hensel ran errands with their precious pups in Minnesota after their outing with a baby",
  "content": "Abby and Brittany Hensel were in full-on family mode this weekend, embracing the simple joys of hometown life in Minnesota while keeping busy with their furry sidekicks.\n\nThe conjoined twins, 35, stepped out to handle their to-do list over the weekend, reportedly making a stop at the pet groomer to get their labradoodle spruced up while Abby\u2019s husband, Josh Bowling, picked up some groceries at the local market.\n\nAbby and Brittany kept it low-key as they went about their day, sporting a teal tank top paired with gray shorts and sandals in the latest photos published by TMZ on Wednesday, August 27, showing the twins with their two pups.\n\nWhile they were at the groomer, Bowling was spotted loading items from his shopping cart into the trunk of his car, wearing a gray T-shirt, tan cargo shorts, flip-flops and a baseball cap.\n\nEarlier this month, Abby and Brittany were seen loading a newborn strapped in a car seat into a Tesla in Arden Hills on August 14. They safely secured the baby in the back before closing the door. The twins have yet to address reports about their relation to the child.\n\nAbby tied the knot with Bowling, a military veteran and nurse, in November 2021, and through that union she also became the stepmom to his 8-year-old daughter, Isabella.\n\nFans got to know the twins through several documentaries and when they appeared in a short-lived reality series, Abby & Brittany, on TLC in 2012.\n\nAbby and Brittany are dicephalic conjoined twins, a rare form of partial twinning with two heads side by side on one torso. They share the same bloodstream and all organs below the waist. The girls\u2019 parents, Mike and Patty Hensel, opted against separating them after birth in 1990.\n\n\u201cWe never wish we were separated,\u201d Abby and Brittany said in the 2007 documentary Extraordinary People: The Twins Who Share a Body. \u201cBecause then we wouldn\u2019t get to do the things we can do \u2014 play softball, meet new people, run.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the twins noted they are quite candid about some aspects of their lives, but don\u2019t like to share everything with the public.\n\n\u201cThe whole world doesn\u2019t need to know who we\u2019re dating or what we\u2019re gonna do,\u201d they said in a 2006 documentary, Joined For Life: Abby & Brittany Turn 16.\n\nIn the same doc, Brittany spoke about their hopes to one day expand their family. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to be moms,\u201d she added. \u201cWe haven\u2019t thought about how being moms is going to work yet.\u201d",

Social media trolls then flooded the internet with speculative questions about the nature of Abby\u2019s marriage considering that she and her sister share organs.\nAbby and Brittany\u2019s story has been featured on TV since 1996. Nearly 10 years later in 2006, they shared their journey in the documentary Joined for Life and later chronicled their 16th birthday milestone in 2008. TLC also greenlit an Abby & Brittany docuseries in 2012.\nThe sisters are dicephalous conjoined twins, which is a rare form of partial twinning with two heads connected to one torso. Abby and Brittany share a bloodstream and all organs below the waist. Each twin also controls one arm and leg. (Abby is the left-side conjoined twin, while Brittany is the right.)\nAfter the twins were born in 1990, their parents opted against a separation surgery after doctors had explained it was unlikely that both sisters would survive the procedure.\nAs Abby and Brittany grew up side-by-side, they pursued a career teaching elementary school students.\n\u201cI remember one wanted to be a pilot and one wanted to be a dentist and that was short-lived,\u201d their mom, Patti Hensel, said during an episode of the family\u2019s reality show when the girls landed their jobs. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to go well for them because they\u2019ve just always had a knack with kids and kids have always kind of been drawn to them.\u201d\nPatti added at the time, \u201cMaybe it started by curiosity but once their simple questions are answered, they\u2019re still just drawn to Ab and Britt for some reason.\u201d\nAbby and Brittany live and work in Minnesota, which is where Abby met military veteran Bowling. They privately wed in November 2021 and footage resurfaced earlier this month."

Bowling\u2019s Facebook page also features happy images of him with the twins enjoying ice cream and traveling together.\nAbby and Brittany have long since been candid about their desire to find love and expand their family.\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to be moms,\u201d Abby said in Joined for Life: Abby & Brittany Turn 16 in 2006. \u201cWe haven\u2019t thought about how being moms is going to work yet.\u201d\nKeep scrolling for what you need to know about Abby Hensel:\nWho Is Abby Hensel?\nAbby is the left-side conjoined twin to Brittany.

      "text": "Conjoined twins Abby Hensel and Brittany Hensel have faced a lot of backlash since going public about Abby\u2019s wedding \u2014 and now, her husband, Josh Bowling, is making headlines of his own.\nUs Weekly confirmed on Monday, April 1, that Josh\u2019s ex-wife, Annica Bowling, filed a paternity suit in October 2023.\nAnnica, 33, and Josh, 34, share daughter Isabella, 8, whom they welcomed during their nine-year marriage. After the pair split in April 2019, the exes shared joint custody of Isabella. Annica later welcomed a second daughter in late 2020, which appears to be the child in question. However, the paternity suit doesn\u2019t reveal the identity of the child, as she\u2019s a minor.\nUs confirmed that Annica filed documents in Washington County, Minnesota, requesting that Josh and another man named Gavin Vatnsdal submit their DNA to determine paternity. The lawsuit was submitted two years after military veteran Josh married Abby, 34, in a November 2021 wedding.\nLast month, a \u201cgenetic test report\u201d was filed with the court, according to documents obtained by Us. There was also a \u201cconfidential information form\u201d submitted on March 7, per the report, but the results were not publicly released.\nThe paternity suit\u2019s latest development came just weeks before news broke that Abby had quietly married Josh in fall 2021.\nWhile Abby, who is the left-side conjoined twin to sister Brittany, did share photos of her special day at the time, her and Josh\u2019s nuptials flew under the radar.\nOn Wednesday, March 27, the wedding made headlines after Today obtained the public court records confirming the legal ceremony. Abby and Brittany \u2014 who are dicephalus conjoined twins that share a bloodstream and their organs below the waist \u2014 were subsequently ridiculed for Abby\u2019s marriage and their current lifestyle with Josh.\n\u201cThis is a message to all the haters out here,\u201d a voice said in a Friday, March 29, TikTok video, featuring photos of Abby and Brittany with Josh. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like what I do but watch everything I\u2019m doing, you\u2019re still a fan.\u201d\nThe Hansel twins are used to public attention after first appearing on TV in 1996 when they were just 6 years old.

      "text": "Bruce Willis is living in a second home amid his battle with frontotemporal dementia, wife Emma Heming Willis revealed during Emma and Bruce Willis: The Unexpected Journey \u2013 A Diane Sawyer Special.\n\u201cIt was one of the hardest decisions that I\u2019ve had to make so far,\u201d Heming Willis, 47, said in the ABC special that aired on Tuesday, August 26. \u201cBut I knew, first and foremost, Bruce would want that for our daughters. You know, he would want them to be in a home that was more tailored to their needs, not his needs.\u201d\nTheir second home is a one story house where Bruce lives full-time with his care team, which is not far from the family\u2019s first home. Heming Willis, who wed Willis in 2009, said she and their daughters \u2014 Mabel, 13, and Evelyn, 11 \u2014 spend \u201ca lot\u201d of time at the second home with Willis, including visits for breakfast and dinner. (Willis also shares daughters Rumer, 37, Scout, 34, and Tallulah, 31, with ex-wife Demi Moore.)\nThe Die Hard actor\u2019s family revealed in March 2022 he was retiring from acting after he was diagnosed with aphasia. According to Mayo Clinic, aphasia is a language disorder that affects how a person communicates. It can impact their speech, the way they write and the way they understand both spoken and written language.\nNearly one year later, Willis\u2019 family confirmed his condition had progressed to frontotemporal dementia, also known as FTD. It\u2019s an umbrella term for a group of brain diseases that affect the brain\u2019s frontal and temporal lobes, which are areas that are associated with personality, behavior and language.\nWillis\u2019 family has continued to share updates of his health journey with fans, but they gave the most intimate look inside Willis\u2019 life now on the ABC special. Heming Willis opened up about when she started noticing the first signs of her husband\u2019s cognitive health decline.\n\u201cFor someone who is very talkative and very engaged, he was just a little more quiet. And when the family would get together, he would kind of just melt a little bit,\u201d Heming Willis said during a sit-down interview with ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer. \u201cIt felt a little removed, very cold, not like Bruce, who was very warm and affectionate,\u201d Heming Willis continued. \u201cTo go in the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary.\u201d\nSawyer, 79, interviewed Dr. Bruce Miller for the special. While Dr. Miller does not treat Willis, he is an expert in FTD, which Sawyer said tends to strike early, as the mean age of when patients are diagnosed is 56 years old.\n\u201cThis is really the unknown disease. People weren\u2019t aware of it really until the 1990s. The research on this really has just begun,\u201d Dr. Miller explained.\nHeming Willis told Sawyer that many patients suffering from FTD often go misdiagnosed as bipolar or suffering from a midlife crisis and depression. It wasn\u2019t until a brain scan that the Pulp Fiction actor was officially diagnosed with what Sawyer referred to as \u201cthe black belt\u201d of dementias.\nThe Make Time Wellness founder was told that there was nothing to be done about Willis\u2019s FTD diagnosis, that there was no cure and no hope.\n\u201cTo leave there with no \u2026 with nothing, just nothing, with a diagnosis I couldn\u2019t pronounce. I didn\u2019t understand what it was,\u201d Heming Willis said. \u201cI was so panicked. And I just remember hearing it and just not hearing anything else. It was like I was free-falling.\u201d\nHer experience is what inspired to share her family\u2019s journey in a new book, The Unexpected Journey: Finding Strength, Hope, and Yourself on the Caregiving Path, as a way to throw out a lifeline to loved ones and caregivers who are navigating similar journeys with FTD diagnoses."

      "text": "Travis Kelce knelt to the ground and pulled out a (massive) ring for Taylor Swift \u2014 and Us Weekly has all the details.\nThe couple took to Instagram on Tuesday, August 26, to share photos of their engagement. In one pic, Kelce, 35, held hands with Swift, also 35, while showing off her new rock. The ring featured an old mine brilliant cut diamond set on a gold band with more small stones. Designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry, the design was complete with a thin bezel. (An old mine brilliant cut dimaond is a pre-modern stone that is characterized by its imperfect symmetry, cushion shape and chunky facets.)\nAs for the cost, jewelry expert Nilesh Rakholia estimated the ring to be worth $950,000 to $1,270,000. The Abelini founder told Us, \u201cThe stone itself looks to be easily in the 7\u201310 carat range, which immediately places it among the most iconic celebrity engagement rings.\u201d\nAnother jeweler Laura Taylor, who specializes in engagement and wedding rings, told Us that the ring could be up to 12 carats. Taylor agreed that it was \u201ceasily worth\u201d $1 million.\nSwift teamed the massive diamond with a Cartier watch complete with a matching gold wristlet and diamond face.\nIn the sweet photos, Kelce got on one knee while wearing a Ralph Lauren navy blue shirt and white pants. Swift, for her part, stunned in a white top which was embellished with veritable stripes, thin straps and a flared hem. She teamed the look with an A-line flowy midi skirt. Swift put a hand on Kelce\u2019s cheek while they were surrounded by a garden of flowers.\nIn another shot, the duo closed their eyes and pressed their foreheads together while donning soft smiles. They also cuddled up together while relaxing on a bench under more florals.\n\u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married \ud83e\udde8,\u201d Swift captioned the post with \u201cSo High School,\u201d her hit song about Kelce playing in the background.\nOn Tuesday, an insider exclusively revealed to Us how Travis picked out the perfect engagement ring for Taylor. \u201cTravis is incredibly thoughtful. He had a clear vision of what he wanted,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe did it almost entirely on his own. He knows her so well and what she likes \u2014 a timeless, classic, vintage touch.\u201d\nThe insider added, Travis is \u201cvery observant and in tune with\u201d Swift\u2019s preferred style. \u201cThat drove his decision,\u201d the insider told Us. \u201cHe considered everything about what she\u2019d like and want, and he paid attention to the jewelry she wears often for inspiration.\u201d\nSwift and Kelce started dating in the summer of 2023 after he attended her Eras Tour and wanted to meet her. While they did not meet at her concert because Swift was not offering meet and greets, they later got in contact after Kelce said he wanted to give her his number during an episode of his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast.\nIn December 2023, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the lovebirds \u201chad plenty of really deep conversations about their future together\u201d and always tried to make \u201cas much time for each other as possible.\nIn April 2024, another insider revealed that Swift was happy not feeling like she had to \u201chide\u201d while dating Kelce. \u201c[He] makes her feel safe and protected like she has the freedom to be and act however she wants.\u201d"

      "text": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are engaged after two years together.\n\u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,\u201d Swift, 35, captioned an Instagram post on Tuesday, August 26, alongside photos of Kelce, also 35, down on one knee.\nThe couple got engaged in a garden full of flowers and looked happier than ever in a series of images. In addition to the photo of Kelce proposing, the two looked lovingly into each other\u2019s eyes in a second image. Swift also held on to the back of Kelce\u2019s head in one photo, and a fourth had her ring \u2014 an old mine brilliant cut designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry \u2014 on full display. The last picture showed Swift sitting with her legs thrown across Kelce\u2019s lap.\nThe NFL star\u2019s interest in the singer first made headlines in July 2023 after he attempted to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number during her Kansas City, Missouri, Eras Tour concert. Later that month, he recounted on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast how he had failed to meet Swift at the show. She soon reached out to him after hearing the story.\nAmid romance rumors, Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship in September 2023 when she attended one of his Kansas City Chiefs home games. She became a fixture in the stands as she cheered him on throughout the season, and he returned the favor when he traveled around the world to watch her perform, with his first visit taking place in Argentina in November 2023.\nThat same month, Kelce opened up about how he and Swift got together. \u201cThere were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said]: \u2018Yo! Did you know he was coming?\u2019 I had somebody playing Cupid,\u201d he told WSJ. Magazine in November 2023. \u201cShe told me exactly what was going on and how I got lucky enough to get her to reach out.\u201d\nKelce then addressed how he adjusted to the attention surrounding Swift.\n\u201cObviously I\u2019ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them. \u2026 I\u2019ve never dealt with it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m not running away from any of it. \u2026 The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she\u2019s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that, I better not be the one acting all strange.\u201d\nIn December 2023, Swift broke her silence on her relationship with Kelce, telling Time that it \u201cstarted when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell.\u201d The two \u201cstarted hanging out right after that,\u201d according to Swift.\n\u201cWe actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I\u2019m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cBy the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.\u201d\nWhile Swift kept some of her past relationships under the radar, she took a different approach with Kelce.\n\u201cWhen you say a relationship is public, that means I\u2019m going to see him do what he loves, we\u2019re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don\u2019t care,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you\u2019re seeing someone. And we\u2019re just proud of each other.\u201d\nAs Swift and Kelce\u2019s romance flourished, a source exclusively told Us Weekly in December 2023 that they\u2019d \u201chad plenty of really deep conversations about their future together\u201d and tried to make \u201cas much time for each other as possible\u201d amid their \u201cincredibly busy schedules.\u201d\nMore recently, an insider revealed in April that it has \u201cbeen so refreshing for Taylor not to feel the need to hide with Travis,\u201d adding that he \u201cmakes her feel safe and protected like she has the freedom to be and act however she wants.\u201d\nPrior to their engagement, Swift had a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn, while Kelce previously dated Kayla Nicole."

      "text": "Travis Kelce planned out his proposal to now-fianc\u00e9e Taylor Swift in advance \u2014 including asking her parents for her hand in marriage.\n\u201cTravis asked Taylor\u2019s parents for their blessing,\u201d a source exclusively tells Us Weekly, referring to the pop star\u2019s mom and dad, Andrea and Scott Swift.\nKelce and Taylor, both 35, announced their engagement on Tuesday, August 25, with a handful of dreamy proposal photos shared via Instagram.\n\u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married \ud83e\udde8 ,\u201d the joint caption read.\nIn the snaps, Kelce got down on bended knee in the middle of a rose-filled garden and gave Taylor a diamond ring designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry. The bauble featured an old mine brilliant cut diamond, set on a gold band with smaller stones. It also had a thin bezel.\n\u201cTravis is incredibly thoughtful. He had a clear vision of what he wanted,\u201d a second source exclusively told Us. \u201cHe did it almost entirely on his own. He knows her so well and what she likes \u2014 a timeless, classic, vintage touch.\u201d\nAccording to the second insider, Kelce was \u201cvery observant and in tune with\u201d Taylor\u2019s preferred style and wanted to pick out a ring that he knew she\u2019d like.\nTaylor and Kelce have been together since summer 2023, making their public debut at one of his Kansas City Chiefs football games the following September. As the pair\u2019s romance blossomed, they started incorporating one another\u2019s families into the fold.\nSince becoming a noted fan of the Chiefs, Taylor has attended many of the games and often alongside her parents and her brother, Austin. Travis even gave Scott, a lifelong Philadelphia Eagles fan, a Chiefs-branded lanyard. Scott wore the red-and-gold gear to Swift\u2019s November 2023 Eras Tour concert in Argentina.\n\u201cGot him over to the good side, baby,\u201d Travis told his brother Jason Kelce, who used to play for the Eagles, on their \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast at the time. \u201cI might have persuaded him the night before at dinner when I met him. \u2026 Maybe, who knows?\u201d\nTravis\u2019 bond with the Swifts grew even closer in the offseason. Travis and Taylor both spent a handful of the summer with Scott as he recovered from quintuple bypass surgery.\n\u201cTravis was hanging with him the other day,\u201d Taylor said on an episode of Travis\u2019 podcast earlier this month. \u201cHe was like, \u2018So, uh, sweetie, he says he\u2019s at 75 percent and if this is 75 percent, I\u2019m truly terrified to give you the update.\u2019 My dad\u2019s like, \u2018New arteries, new me.\u2019\u201d"

      "text": "Conjoined twins Abby and Brittany Hensel were seen out and about during an errand run this week, with a precious companion along for the ride.\nAbby and Brittany, 35, loaded a newborn secured in a car seat into a Tesla in Arden Hills, Minnesota, on Thursday, August 14, in photos obtained by TMZ. The twins, who were dressed in casual attire, safely secured the baby in the back before closing the door.\nIn the newly released photos, a folded-in stroller appeared to be placed in the trunk of the car. Their relationship to the child is unclear, the report noted.\nBrittany and Abby previously revealed how they get around town in a scene from their TLC show, Abby & Brittany, in 2012.\n\u201cWe have two licenses and when we got our driver\u2019s license we each had to take the test and we both passed,\u201d they shared at the time. \u201cWhen we drive, Abby is control of the gas and the brakes, and we both steer, and I\u2019m in charge of the blinker,\u201d Brittany added.\nThe show documented their unique journey as dicephalus conjoined twins, having two heads but one torso. Although they share blood circulation, Abby and Brittany each have their own distinct upper body systems, and their brains and spinal cords \u201cfunction independently.\u201d\nAbby and Brittany were born in their native Minnesota in 1990, and their parents, Patty and Mike Hensel, decided against surgery to separate the twins due to the risks associated with the procedure.\nEpisodes showed their close bond, day-to-day life, job hunt, travels to Europe and more. Fans also learned more about the Hensels on the 2006 documentary Joined for Life, which aired on TLC.\nThese days, Abby and Brittany are known to keep a low profile and work as fifth grade teachers.\nIt appears that Abby and her husband \u2014 registered nurse and United States Army veteran Josh Bowling \u2014 are still going strong as the twins shared an AI-generated clip of them all going skydiving via TikTok in June.\nBowling married Abby in November 2021, but the news didn\u2019t surface until March 2024 when a video of the couple\u2019s first dance went viral. Today was the first to report on their nuptials after obtaining public records of their wedding.\nPrior to ringing in the new year, Abby and Brittany posted a \u201c2024 Replay\u201d video via TikTok to reflect on some of their favorite memories. Among them was a photo of the twins eating ice cream with Bowling and his daughter, Isabella, and a beaming throwback selfie with Bowling."

      "text": "Conjoined twins Abby and Brittany Hensel appeared radiant in a rare photo with Abby\u2019s husband, Joshua Bowling.\nIn a selfie shared via Facebook last month by Bowling, the sisters, both 34, are seen smiling alongside Bowling, who married Abby in a secret ceremony in 2021.\nThe happy snap is currently Bowling\u2019s profile photo on the social media platform. The sisters\u2019 own Facebook profile photo also currently features Bowling.\nIn Bowling\u2019s photo, he is sporting a winter jacket over a purple shirt while the sisters are wearing a black shirt.\nBowling, a military veteran, has kept his Facebook followers up to date with the family\u2019s activities, sharing a video of pumpkin-shaped sourdough bread on October 2. \u201c#SourdoughSistersBread,\u201d he captioned the clip.\nThe social media updates come after Abby and Brittany, who have attracted the spotlight since 1996, slammed criticism over their lives by posting a video via social media earlier this year. \u201cThis is a message to all the haters out here,\u201d a deep voice was heard saying over a March 29 TikTok video that featured photos of Abby and Brittany with Bowling. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like what I do but watch everything I\u2019m doing, you\u2019re still a fan.\u201d\nThe siblings captioned the post, \u201c#Forever.\u201d\nAbby and Bowling\u2019s marriage was confirmed in March, which sparked social media trolls to take to various platforms with speculative questions about the nature of Abby\u2019s marriage.\nThe siblings, who live in Minnesota, shed significant light on their extraordinary journey in the documentary Joined for Life, released in December 2006. The pair chronicled their 16th birthday in 2008, and TLC greenlit the Abby & Brittany docuseries in 2012 when they were 22 years old.\nAbby and Brittany are dicephalic parapagus twins, which describes a rare form of partial twinning where two heads are connected to one torso. Abby and Brittany share a bloodstream and all organs below the waist. Each twin also controls one arm and leg. (Abby is the left-side conjoined twin, while Brittany is the right.)\nAfter the twins were born in 1990, their parents opted against a separation surgery after they learned through doctors that it was unlikely that both sisters would survive the procedure.\nThey pursued a career as elementary school teachers, with their mother, Patti Hensel, telling the camera during an episode of Abby & Brittany, \u201cI remember one wanted to be a pilot and one wanted to be a dentist and that was short-lived. I think it\u2019s going to go well for them [working as teachers] because they\u2019ve just always had a knack with kids and kids have always kind of been drawn to them.\u201d"
