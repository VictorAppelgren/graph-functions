  "content": "The singer and songwriter proved she\u2019s operating at the peak of her powers during a two-and-a-half-hour set that drew sharp connections between her past and present.\n\nThe singer and songwriter proved she\u2019s operating at the peak of her powers during a two-and-a-half-hour set that drew sharp connections between her past and present.\n\nCan a pop concert be eligible for a Tony nomination for best musical? It was a question repeatedly prompted on Friday night at Madison Square Garden, where Lady Gaga brought the New York debut of her theatrical, spectacular Mayhem Ball, a hit-filled, deliciously campy extravaganza she\u2019ll perform five more times there over the next few weeks. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can tell if you listen to the music that I\u2019m from here,\u201d the New York native, 39, told the sold-out crowd, becoming visibly emotional. \u201cEverything about my artistry, I think, was born in this town.\u201d\n\nIt is now almost de rigueur for an arena pop show to be broken into acts \u2014 don\u2019t call them eras \u2014 and structured as a kind of epic heroine\u2019s journey. Throughout the Mayhem Ball, Gaga both indulged in such grandiosity and impishly poked fun at it. Before she arrived onstage, a prerecorded image of the pop star hovered above the set in a red Elizabethan collar, writing by hand with an enormous red feather pen. The show\u2019s subtitle soon flashed on the screen in gothic script: \u201cThe Art of Personal Chaos.\u201d\n\nBut she sold the show\u2019s overall narrative \u2014 incorporating multiple, conflicting aspects of oneself into a gloriously messy whole \u2014 with a flair for drama and comedy. Before a punchy rendition of \u201cPoker Face,\u201d one of the 2008 electro-pop anthems that first made her a star, Gaga was confronted onstage by a doppelg\u00e4nger dressed as she once did in those days: head-to-toe in face-obscuring lace and a pointy, imperial crown. \u201cUgh,\u201d sighed present-day Gaga with an exaggerated verbal eye roll. \u201cWhat is she doing here?\u201d\n\nSuch scenery-chewing was a reminder of Gaga\u2019s increasingly busy life outside of music. Since earning an Oscar nomination for her film debut in Bradley Cooper\u2019s 2018 version of \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d Gaga has proved herself a compelling onscreen presence and continued to pursue a career as an actress. This pivot might have provided an opportunity to pump the brakes on pop stardom. But the Mayhem Ball shows how Gaga has learned to incorporate all of her disparate strengths as an entertainer into a single stage experience, combining impressive live singing with kinetic choreography, bona fide acting chops and well-honed comic timing. Call it the Art of Professional Chaos. The first act was the most impressive: a relentless sensory overload of fiery colors and visual surprises that drew stylistic connections between some of the best tracks on \u201cMayhem\u201d with the harder-edged material on the 2011 album \u201cBorn This Way.\u201d Opening with \u201cBloody Mary\u201d \u2014 a deep cut that got a boost in 2022 after the Netflix horror-comedy \u201cWednesday\u201d turned it into a TikTok sensation \u2014 Gaga emerged from the center of the stage trilling operatic high notes and looking like Klaus Nomi sitting atop a dress fashioned as a two-story crimson birthday cake. Her massive skirt then parted to reveal a cage housing seven dancers ready to launch into the frenetic choreography of her wickedly infectious recent hit, \u201cAbracadabra.\u201d\n\nA transformation of Gaga\u2019s 2009 bop \u201cPaparazzi\u201d into a gorgeously sung piano ballad was a highlight of the second act, tightening the focus just to Gaga; as she lurched down the catwalk that split the arena on metallic crutches, the seemingly endless train of her white gown billowed behind her. When she reached the edge of the stage, the fabric was lit up like a rainbow \u2014 the first of several nods to her devoted queer fan base. \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d her ally\u2019s anthem, felt extra jubilant, and hit hard during this moment of rollbacks in L.G.B.T.Q. rights.\n\nBut for a show stuffed with such unrelenting excess, it\u2019s impressive what a high percentage of it works: The \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d drag that accompanied the \u201cMayhem\u201d banger \u201cZombieboy\u201d; the telenovela-like staging of \u201cAlejandro\u201d; even the Andrew Lloyd Webber-esque moments when several ballads, including the \u201cStar Is Born\u201d blockbuster \u201cShallow,\u201d become impressionistic duets with Gaga\u2019s shadow self. Still, as ever, Gaga knew when to dial back the maximalism and forge a more direct connection with her fans (many of whom had embraced the album\u2019s macabre, black-and-red dress code). Toward the end of the show, she settled in at a piano perched on the edge of the catwalk and performed a solo rendition of her 2024 Bruno Mars duet \u201cDie With a Smile,\u201d along with a special number she\u2019d chosen for the hometown crowd: \u201cHair,\u201d a heartfelt and decidedly Broadway-ready song of self-acceptance from \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d an album she said was particularly indebted to the city.\n\nFor all its outrageous artifice, one of the most memorable moments of the Mayhem Ball was its most stripped down. During what was less an encore than a post-credits sequence \u2014 after innumerable names flashed onscreen, crediting the village it took to put on this show that Lady Gaga directed herself \u2014 a camera showed the star backstage in a wig cap and black leotard, wiping off her makeup. As she sang the bubbly \u201cMayhem\u201d track \u201cHow Bad Do U Want Me,\u201d she began to maneuver through the labyrinthine halls beneath the stage, gathering dancers as she went. Still belting the song, and in an oversize jean jacket emblazoned on the back \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d she and her troupe came to the surface for one last triumphant curtain call as \u201cHeavy Metal Lover\u201d from \u201cBorn This Way\u201d played over the speakers. She was from here, all right \u2014 not just New York, but the stage. And she didn\u2019t want to leave.",
