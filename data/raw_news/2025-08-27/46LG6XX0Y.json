It may quietly redraw the lines of who is, and who is not, subject to the CFPB\u2019s oversight.\n\nThe Issues on the Table\n\nThe proposed rule would bind the CFPB to a consistent standard for designating nonbanks as subject to bureau supervision. The agency has long had the authority to supervise nonbank firms if their conduct posed \u201crisks to consumers.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, the CFPB has decided that question case by case. It now proposes to define that phrase as conduct that both \u201cpresents a high likelihood of significant harm to consumers\u201d and is \u201cdirectly connected to the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or service.\u201d\n\nBeyond the commentary period, which lasts until Sept. 25, this shift matters because it could limit the bureau\u2019s reach. Instead of applying its authority broadly \u2014 for instance, to cover small but potentially risky harms \u2014 the CFPB said it intends to focus only on \u201cserious conduct.\u201d That means, at least potentially, that fewer firms may find themselves pulled into the bureau\u2019s supervisory orbit.\n\u2022 A Population of 154,430 Potentially Covered Firms\n\n According to Census data analyzed by the bureau, roughly 154,430 firms are operating in industries that fall under its potential supervisory umbrella, ranging from nondepository lending to consumer reporting and debt collection. Yet to date, the CFPB has exercised this supervisory authority over fewer than 20 nonbank entities. That gap suggests the new rule may not just clarify the standard, but also signal that the agency intends to use it sparingly.\n\u2022 Lower Likelihood of Supervision Going Forward\n\n The bureau explicitly stated it \u201cexpects that under the proposed rule it will be less likely to designate any particular entity for supervision, all other factors being equal.\u201d That expectation matters for platforms, FinTechs and other nonbanks. Fewer designation orders mean lower compliance costs as a pathway toward innovation or to expand into financial services without the shadow of CFPB examinations.\n\u2022 The Cost of Supervision Is $27,000 Per Exam\n\n The CFPB estimates that a typical supervisory exam carries about $27,000 in labor costs for a firm, based on average staffing and preparation requirements. While that sum may seem modest relative to overall compliance budgets, the bureau said the burden can vary by firm size and structure. By narrowing the circumstances under which exams occur, the CFPB could be lowering the tangible cost of entry into financial services for platforms that straddle commerce, data and payments.\n\nPlatforms and other companies may feel freer to embed themselves deeper into financial services, from offering wallets and payments to extending credit and managing consumer data. The rule\u2019s narrow focus effectively leaves more room for private litigation, state regulators and existing compliance practices to shape the market.\n\nWhy KYC and AML Still Matter\n\nWhether the CFPB is supervising them, platforms cannot afford to relax on know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) obligations. The PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cGlobal Money Movement: U.S. Edition\u201d found that 36% of U.S. consumers not using digital wallets would adopt them if they were perceived as more secure. Among small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), 31% of non-users cited security as a key concern preventing adoption.\n\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency has long been a haven for fraudsters. While custody in traditional finance is the boring backbone of asset safety, in crypto, it\u2019s a technological and regulatory minefield.\n\n\u201cAs the crypto industry matures, the lines between custody, banking and compliance are blurring,\u201d PYMNTS reported in July. \u201cCustodians are no longer just service providers; they are gatekeepers of financial integrity. And in this new era, the simple-sounding disciplines of KYC and AML are just as much of a must-have for crypto as they are in traditional finance.\u201d",

  "summary": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed a rule limiting supervisory supervision to nonbank firms that pose \"risks to consumers\" in supervisory designation proceedings. The rule could potentially limit the bureau's reach and potentially result in fewer firms being brought into the bureau\u2019s supervisory orbit. The proposed rule would establish a consistent standard for designating nonbanks as subject to bureau supervision. It also allows for the agency to focus only on \u201cserious conduct\u201d rather than broadly applying its authority. The cost of supervisory exams could potentially lower entry into financial services for platforms that straddle commerce, data and payments. The CFPB estimates that a typical supervisory exam costs about $27,000 per exam, which can vary by firm size and structure.",

      "text": "Providing a safe haven for crypto could ultimately result in bad actors finding their own safe haven within the American financial system. While custody in traditional finance is the boring backbone of asset safety, in crypto, it\u2019s a technological and regulatory minefield.\nBut with the news Tuesday (July 1) that Deutsche Bank is planning to debut its cryptocurrency custody service in 2026, while on Monday (June 30) news broke that stablecoin issuer Circle is seeking a charter for its own national trust bank, it\u2019s clear that, thorny or not, digital asset custody has started to capture the attention of both traditional institutional players and FinTech platforms alike.\nCustodians, by design, are chokepoints in the financial system. They hold assets on behalf of multiple institutions, acting as both gatekeepers and facilitators. With decades of institutional custody experience, Deutsche Bank\u2019s entrance suggests that the lines between crypto assets and traditional ones could be blurring fast, while Circle\u2019s bank application underscores that crypto firms feel ready for the type of direct supervision and regulatory compliance standards as federally chartered institutions.\nAs the crypto industry matures, the lines between custody, banking and compliance are blurring. Custodians are no longer just service providers; they are gatekeepers of financial integrity. And in this new era, the simple-sounding disciplines of KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) are just as much of a must-have for crypto as they are in traditional finance.\nRead more: New US Stablecoin Reserve Rules Could Upend Crypto\u2019s Biggest Players\nCustody Is Front Line Against Crime\nAs the custody layer of crypto matures, regulatory expectations around identity verification, transaction monitoring, and risk controls are intensifying.\nIn traditional finance, custody is a specialized but invisible operation, one that is safe, regulated, and mostly taken for granted. Custodians like BNY Mellon or State Street manage trillions of dollars in securities with little public attention. In crypto, however, custody is far more consequential.\nCrypto assets are bearer instruments, meaning if someone controls the private keys, they control the asset. That makes custody both a technical and legal question, and a risk vector for institutions.\nAt the heart of this transformation lies the global effort to align crypto firms with anti-money laundering standards. In traditional banking, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the USA PATRIOT Act, and FATF recommendations provide a framework for ensuring that financial institutions know their customers and report suspicious activity. Crypto, born of pseudonymity and decentralization, has long resisted these mandates.\nIndeed, the very architecture of crypto makes it attractive to criminals. Much of the illicit activity flows through noncompliant custodians, loosely regulated exchanges, or decentralized protocols where KYC is nonexistent. For institutional players and regulators alike, this is an unacceptable risk.\nIf you want to stop North Korean hackers or Russian operatives from laundering money through the U.S. banking system, you need to know who controls the wallets, who authorized the transaction, and who is responsible for reporting it. That means custodian-level controls.\nRead more: From Bitcoin Maxis to Yield Farmers: A Crypto Archetype Glossary\nCrypto\u2019s Bankification Moment\nBut an existential challenge remains: Can crypto build the same foundations of trust that underpin traditional finance? Or will traditional finance step in and usurp the crypto opportunity with their superior compliance tools and AML programs?\n\u201cBanks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,\u201d Chainalysis Co-Founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS in April.\nThere is still no global consensus on how to regulate custodians, particularly in cross-border contexts. And with the rapid rise of tokenized assets \u2014 from real estate to Treasurys \u2014 the custodial footprint is expanding into uncharted territory.\nYet, at least in the U.S., regulatory momentum appears to be positive and growing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,\u201d Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner told PYMNTS in an interview posted April 23. \u201cThis is not a confrontational posture.\n\u201cThe obvious growth in stablecoins and the fact that you have a lot of issuers ready to be fully compliant, it\u2019s a hard argument for Congress to ignore,\u201d Boyle added."
