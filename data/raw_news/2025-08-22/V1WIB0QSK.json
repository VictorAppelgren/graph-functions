  "content": "Ariel Investments, an investment management company, released its \u201cAriel Small Cap Value Strategy\u201d second-quarter 2025 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The second quarter witnessed extreme volatility. Stocks declined sharply after the \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcement and staged a remarkable recovery as the administration initiated a 90-day pause. In the quarter, Ariel Small Cap Value Tax-Exempt Composite appreciated +7.72% gross of fees (+7.58% net of fees) against this backdrop, compared to +4.97% and +8.50% returns of the Russell 2000 Value Index and the Russell 2000 Index, respectively. In addition, you can check the fund\u2019s top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2025.\n\nIn its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, the Ariel Small Cap Value Strategy highlighted stocks such as Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA). Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) offers enterprise asset intelligence solutions in the automatic identification and data capture solutions industry. The one-month return of Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) was -7.47%, and its shares lost 9.83% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On August 21, 2025, Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) stock closed at $308.51 per share, with a market capitalization of $15.686 billion.\n\nAriel Small Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\nAlso in the quarter, we bought shares of bar-code manufacturer, Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA), which is held in other Ariel portfolios. ZBRA\u2019s brand strength, distribution network and commitment to innovation enable it to take share, earn industry-leading profitability and penetrate new markets. A recent pullback in the stock price provided an attractive entry point. Shares have come under pressure due to investor concerns around supply chain disruptions and tariffs. At current the valuation, we think the market is underappreciating ZBRA\u2019s alignment with the global effort to improve supply chain efficiency. At the same time, the company is leveraging the wide moat in its core business to expand into faster growing markets including warehouse robotics and machine vision. Meanwhile ZBRA continues to deliver prodigious free cash flow which we believe will continue to be deployed towards both growth and share repurchases.\n\nZebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 53 hedge fund portfolios held Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) at the end of the second quarter, which was 48 in the previous quarter. For the second quarter, Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) reported sales of $1.3 billion, a 6% increase compared to the prior year. While we acknowledge the potential of Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.",

In July 2019, Hobson assumed the role of Co-CEO alongside Rogers. The company, comprised of 107 employees, boasts an ownership structure where both the workforce and the board collectively own 95% of the firm. As of January 31, 2021, Ariel manages $15 billion in assets. Positioning itself as a minority-owned investment company, Ariel proudly asserts its status as the largest minority-owned investment firm in the industry.\nJohn W. Rogers Jr. holds the positions of chairman, chief executive officer, and chief investment officer at Ariel Investments, a firm he established in 1983 in Chicago. The company provides no-load mutual funds for individual investors and manages separately managed accounts for institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Central to the firm's approach is a disciplined strategy rooted in patience, a principle that continues to guide its operations. John's fascination with investing began at the age of 12 when his father opted for stocks instead of traditional toys for birthdays and Christmas. This interest deepened during his time at Princeton, where, in addition to tracking stocks, he played basketball under the mentorship of Hall of Fame coach Pete Carril. Serving as captain of Princeton's varsity basketball team during his senior year, John absorbed valuable lessons in teamwork that significantly influenced his perspectives on entrepreneurship and investment. On the other hand, in her role as Co-CEO, Mellody Hobson oversees management, strategic planning, and growth across all facets of Ariel Investments, excluding research and portfolio management. Additionally, she assumes the position of Chairman of the Board for Ariel's publicly traded mutual funds. Before stepping into the Co-CEO role, Mellody dedicated nearly two decades to serving as Ariel's President, having been with the firm since earning her AB from Princeton University\u2019s School of International Relations and Public Policy. Mellody holds the position of Chairman of the Board at Starbucks Corporation and serves as a director of JPMorgan Chase. She previously held the Chairman role at DreamWorks Animation, contributing to the company\u2019s successful sale. Mellody has been a longstanding board member of the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies and actively engages in various philanthropic initiatives.\nHighlighting a selection of its managed funds, Ariel showcases impressive returns since inception. The Small Cap Value Fund boasts an 11.19% return, while the Small Cap Value Concentrated Fund demonstrates a remarkable 15.24% return. Additionally, the Ariel Small/Mid Cap Value Fund yields an 8.22% return, the Ariel Mid Cap Value Fund secures a solid 10.07% return, and the Ariel Focused Value Fund delivers a commendable 6.13% return over the same period."

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.

But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nAI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it\u2019s about to get worse.\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:\n\u201cThe future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nTrump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.\nAnd our company sits in the toll booth\u2014collecting fees on every drop exported.\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2026\nAs Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.\nAI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.\nWhile the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.\nAI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.\nAnd infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.\nThis company has its finger in every pie\u2014and Wall Street is just starting to notice.\nWall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds\u2014without the sky-high valuation.\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nDisruption is the New Name of the Game: Let\u2019s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.\nAI is the ultimate disruptor, and it\u2019s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.\nThe companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.\nAs an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.\nThe Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world\u2019s brightest minds are flocking to AI.\nFrom computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.\nThis influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.\nBy investing in AI, you\u2019re essentially backing the future.\nThe future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.\nDon\u2019t be a spectator in this technological revolution.\nDive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.\nThis isn\u2019t just about making money \u2013 it\u2019s about being part of the future.\nSo, buckle up and get ready for the ride of your investment life!\nAct Now and Unlock a Potential 100+% Return within 12 to 24 months.\nWe\u2019re now offering month-to-month subscriptions with no commitments.\nFor a ridiculously low price of just $9.99 per month, you can unlock our in-depth investment research and exclusive insights \u2013 that\u2019s less than a single fast food meal!\nHere\u2019s why this is a deal you can\u2019t afford to pass up:\n- Access to our Detailed Report on our AI, Tariffs, and Nuclear Energy Stock with 100+% potential upside within 12 to 24 months\n- BONUS REPORT on our #1 AI-Robotics Stock with 10000% upside potential: Our in-depth report dives deep into our #1 AI/robotics stock\u2019s groundbreaking technology and massive growth potential.\n- One New Issue of Our Premium Readership Newsletter: You will also receive one new issue per month and at least one new stock pick per month from our monthly newsletter\u2019s portfolio over the next 12 months.

      "text": "Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript August 5, 2025\nZebra Technologies Corporation misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $ EPS, expectations were $3.31.\nOperator: Good day, and welcome to the Zebra Second Quarter 2025 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael A. Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today\u2019s earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-on-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for 12 months.\nThis presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with a discussion of our second quarter results. Nathan will then provide additional detail and discuss our revised outlook. Bill will continue with progress on advancing our strategic priorities, including the pending acquisition of Elo Touch Solution we announced this morning. Following the prepared remarks, Bill and Nathan will take your questions. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 4, as I hand it over to Bill.\nWilliam J. Burns: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. In addition to our second quarter highlights and financial results, we will discuss this morning\u2019s announcement of the exciting milestone in our journey to enhance the connected frontline experience to our acquisition of Elo. We will also review our increase full year outlook. Before we get into the details of the quarter, let me spend a moment on the acquisition that drives profitable growth and elevates our market leadership. Elo Solutions engage consumers, enhance self-service and deliver automation across a wide range of end markets. This combination strengthens Zebra\u2019s portfolio of solutions, enables us to advance our strategic priorities. Now turning to our Q2 results.\nOur team executed well in the second quarter, delivering results exceeding our outlook, with solid demand across the business and lower-than-expected U.S. import tariffs. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.3 billion, a greater than 6% increase compared to the prior year, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.6%, a 10 basis point improvement and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to $3.61 which was 14% higher than the prior year. We realized strong growth in our North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific regions and had relative outperformance in mobile computing, scanning, and RFID. Transportation & Logistics, along with Retail & E-commerce were our highest growth vertical end markets, with health care cycling a strong compare and manufacturing continuing to lag.\nAs we enter the third quarter, demand has been resilient. However, we remain cautious as our customers navigate through uncertain trade policy. Additionally, we expect the recently passed tax legislation to be constructive for some of our U.S. customers, although it is too early to assess the impact on demand. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results, tariff considerations and outlook.\nNathan Andrew Winters: Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, total company sales grew by more than 6%, reflecting recovery in demand across our major product categories. Our services and software recurring revenue business grew slightly in the quarter. We had similar growth rates in both of our financial segments. We realized strong sales growth across most of our regions. In North America, sales grew 8% with double-digit growth in mobile computing and RFID. Asia Pacific sales increased 20%, led by Australia, New Zealand and India. Sales grew 11% in Latin America, with growth across the region. In EMEA, we cycled strong comparisons, particularly in mobile computing with a sales decline of 1%. Adjusted gross margin declined 70 basis points to 47.9%, primarily due to higher U.S. import tariffs than last year.\nAdjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales improved by 80 basis points. This resulted in second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.6%, a 10 basis point increase versus the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.61, a 14% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our outlook. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. Year-to-date, we generated $288 million of free cash flow. We have been deploying capital consistent with our allocation priorities. We repurchased $250 million of stock year-to-date, and our recent $62 million acquisition of Photoneo as well as this morning\u2019s acquisition announcement, support our continued efforts to scale in adjacent markets. Our balance sheet is in excellent shape, with $872 million of cash at the end of Q2, a modest 1.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and $1.5 billion of credit capacity, providing ample flexibility to fund the $1.3 billion pending acquisition of Elo later this year.\nDue to the global nature of our supply chain, like many other electronic manufacturing companies, we are subject to U.S. import tariffs. On Slide 8, we provide an update on the anticipated impact from tariffs on our products imported to the United States and our efforts to mitigate them. For the full year 2025, we are now assuming approximately $30 million of gross profit impact after mitigation, with a $10 million net impact in the third quarter, following a $12 million impact in the first half of the year. Our forecast assumes the current effective rates remain in place, including the electronics and USMCA exemptions. This implies a $40 million annualized gross profit impact which is less than half of our previous expectation, primarily due to a lower rate on China imports.\nOur mitigating actions to date have included shifting additional production out of China and approximately $40 million of annualized pricing adjustments. North America imports from China are now expected to represent 20% of the mix by year-end. We will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to mitigate U.S. import tariffs as we monitor global trade policy development. These potential actions include additional shifting of global production, product portfolio optimization and price adjustments. Let\u2019s now turn to our outlook. We entered the third quarter with a backlog and pipeline to support our sales guide of between 2% and 6% growth, with a 30 basis point favorable impact from the acquisition of Photoneo and a neutral impact from FX.\nOur third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 21%, which assumes a $10 million net impact from U.S. import tariffs and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.80. We are raising our full year sales growth guidance range by a full point which is now expected to be between 5% and 7%, including approximately 50 basis points of combined favorability from FX and the Photoneo acquisition. We are now expecting a $30 million gross profit impact from tariffs, net of mitigations for the full year, which is $40 million favorable to our prior guidance. We are also raising our full year adjusted EBITDA margin by a full point to between 21% and 22% and increasing our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to a range of $15.25 to $15.75.\nAdditionally, we are raising our free cash flow guide for the year to at least $800 million, which reflects the anticipated benefit of recently enacted U.S. tax legislation and implies free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%. We continue to work on further optimizing our working capital levels, balanced with our supply chain resiliency initiatives. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill.\nWilliam J. Burns: Thank you, Nathan. Zebra remains well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows with our portfolio of innovative solutions, including purpose-built hardware, software and services. Our solutions intelligently connect people, assets and data to help our customers make business critical decision. As you will seen on Slide 11. Zebra Solution enable our customers across the broad range of end markets to drive revenue, boost productivity and efficiency and optimize the front line, delivering improved service to their customers, shoppers and patients. The challenges of an on-demand economy. E-commerce growth, evolving regulations and labor constraints require increased adoption of automation.\nHere are some of the recent examples of customers transforming their workflows at various stages of their automation journey. An athletic retailer in the United Kingdom recently launched the initial phase of their RFID journey to improve inventory accuracy by equipping their store associates with Zebra mobile RFID solution. This strategic investment enables better supply chain visibility given that the majority of their vendors now RFID tag at the point of manufacturer. We continue to see strong interest from customers in leveraging RFID across the supply chain. A North American logistics company is focused on moving freight more effectively by equipping their drivers and crossed-out workers with Zebra mobile computing solutions to collaborate seamlessly across their operations.\nAdditionally, a large North American food distributor recently began a technology upgrade of their Zebra mobile computers, tablets and mobile printers to improve the efficiency and productivity of their distribution centers. Our market-leading portfolio solution enhances their receiving, restocking and cold chain operation. These are a few of the many examples that demonstrate how customers rely on us to navigate their technology journey leveraging our commitment to innovation and workflow expertise. Innovation remains central to our industry leadership, and we have consistently reinvested approximately 10% of our sales in the research and development to advance our portfolio of solutions. We augment our organic efforts with strategic acquisitions that advance our vision as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Photoneo, which expanded our 3D machine vision solution as well as the pending acquisition of Elo.\nTurning to Slide 12. The acquisition of Elo will enable us to expand our portfolio of solutions to help customers transform their frontline operations by digitizing and automating workflows. Elo is a leading provider of point-of-sale solution, kiosks, interactive displays and touchscreen solutions with a 50-year track record of innovation in more than 400 patents operating in an $8 billion market. The company generates approximately $400 million of annual revenues with a similar sales growth and EBITDA margin profile to Zebra. Elo also has a similar go-to-market approach to Zebra, offering a wide range of industry tailored solutions that modernize point of sale, streamline self-service and payment experiences, automated kitchen industrial workflows and optimize production and process management.\nOur leadership in hardware, software and services for the frontline worker will be augmented by Elo\u2019s consumer-facing offerings to deliver a unified connected frontline experience. Together, we will pursue attractive market and geographic expansion opportunities while delivering a comprehensive software differentiated portfolio that enables customers to better address emerging use cases. The continued growth of retail media networks and the deployment of AI-based agents on the front line are examples of new opportunities that Zebra and Elo can pursue together. The Elo acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings once the transaction closes and we expect to generate an incremental $25 million of annual EBITDA synergies by year 3.\nIn closing, our confidence in sustainable long-term growth is underpinned by several key themes that drive demand for our solutions, including labor and resource constraints, track and trace requirements, increased consumer expectations, advancements in artificial intelligence and the need for real-time supply chain visibility. As we move forward, we remain focused on advancing our industry leadership where innovative solutions that digitize and automate our customers\u2019 workflows, serving our customers well and driving profitable growth. We are well positioned to expand our addressable market as we add complementary solutions to our portfolio that elevate our capabilities to serve our customers. I will now hand the call back to the Mike.\nMichael A. Steele: Thanks, Bill. We\u2019ll now open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions].\nQ&A Session\nFollow Zebra Technologies Corp (NASDAQ:ZBRA)\nFollow Zebra Technologies Corp (NASDAQ:ZBRA)\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.\nJoseph Craig Giordano: Maybe I\u2019ll start on the acquisition. Can you kind of tell me how do these \u2014 how does that technology kind of tie in with yours? Like where are they doing things that you couldn\u2019t do on your own? What\u2019s the customer overlap kind of look like in terms of leveraging that?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes, sure, Joe. I got it. I would say, overall, first of all, we\u2019re really excited about the acquisition. It really represents the next step, and we see as our journey to have a leading portfolio of solutions that digitize and automate the front line of business where we\u2019ve been focused for certainly some time. And I think that what Elo brings us is a market-leading portfolio of self-service and customer-facing solutions that really expands our addressable market by about $8 billion. So think of more customer-facing use cases. Overall, their focus is that on areas like point-of-sale, self-serve kiosks, interactive touchscreen displays, automation in the industrial place, and I think overall, what we bring them is that we bring our complementary solutions to what they do in things like point of sale and others.\nOur global reach allows us to expand their offerings beyond their strength in North America and what they have in EMEA today and smaller in Asia Pacific, but really take them to a global scale and reach across our go-to-market. And then overall, our extensive service capabilities, our deep customer relationships, there are customer overlaps, especially in places like retail, but there\u2019s strengths that they have in things like quick-serve restaurants where we\u2019re not as strong, but are putting in emerging solutions like RFID into quick serve today, but it gives us more of an offering there. So quick-serve restaurants is an example. We believe our strength in health care would help them. So there\u2019s vertical markets and geographical expansion that would bring to their portfolio overall that would allow them to expand.\nSo think of it as more customer-facing, more self-service, more automation and more fixed than mobile, and that adds significantly to our broad-based portfolio today.\nJoseph Craig Giordano: That\u2019s great. Maybe you guys have done a nice job of kind of withholding judgment on the second half in terms of volumes until you see what\u2019s going on with your typical seasonal flows. You don\u2019t want to commit to them until you have them in firm backlog. Now as we sit here in August, we see the guide, but like how are you feeling about the ability of your customers to kind of release budgets and kind of move forward with things? Like what do you think is kind of inherent in your guide now in the second half?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. Joe, I\u2019d say that demand has remained resilient through the first half despite the uncertainty around global trade policy and that customers have generally maintained their capital spending levels and moved ahead with the projects that they had planned for the year. So we\u2019re seeing that, and we\u2019re happy with where things are out from a customer perspective. Some have spread some of the spending out over multiple quarters, really a combination of managing their CapEx, but probably a bit of uncertainty as well. We\u2019ve seen that from a increased \u2014 we\u2019ve increased our outlook for the full year really based on the strong second quarter results and then the backlog and pipeline that we see going into the second half that supports second half growth overall.\nAnd I\u2019d say that \u2014 all that said, our customers still remain a bit cautious. They\u2019re still \u2014 while there\u2019s been more clarity, they\u2019re still navigating the uncertain trade policies, but clarity has been certainly helping. And there\u2019s certainly some uncertainty around macro and geopolitical. So I would say that overall, the \u2014 there are some positives, too. Things like the U.S. tax legislation could be a benefit to us, but it\u2019s too early to tell. So we think overall that our guide for the full year, while we\u2019re increasing it, makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s pretty balanced to what we\u2019re seeing from a positive certainly from customers continue to move ahead, but also a little \u2014 a bit of uncertainty still out there overall. So we think our guide is pretty balanced for second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS.\nDamian Mark Karas: Congrats on the deal.\nWilliam J. Burns: Thanks Damian, appreciate it.\nDamian Mark Karas: Just a follow-up question on Elo. Could you talk about how their business cyclicality has compared with Zebra historically? And I think you\u2019re moving into a little bit more of a competitive space compared to your core mobility solutions. So could you just maybe talk a little bit about Elo\u2019s market share and how that has progressed over time?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. I\u2019d say overall that the Elo portfolio would be a bit different in the demand cycle than us, where we typically see a fair amount of year-end spending by our customers. They don\u2019t see quite that much. It\u2019s more balanced throughout the year. So I think that you\u2019ll see us that kind of spread some of our year out ultimately and not put as much in the fourth quarter from a cyclicality perspective, I think that\u2019s positive. I would say, yes, there\u2019s different competitors in the space as they have a broad portfolio of solutions across point-of-sale and kiosks, interactive displays, there are different competitors than we face today in the market. It\u2019s a fairly fragmented market and their strength is really strong in North America overall, I would say, as one of the market leaders, both in North America.\nEMEA and Asia Pac, I would say that there\u2019s additional opportunities where they\u2019ve got good share, we think ultimately, there\u2019s an opportunity to gain more share there by leveraging Zebra\u2019s relationship and our global reach. As the size company they are, you ultimately make decisions on where you\u2019re going to go next geography-wise. And us having a presence around the world will help us expand their product lines around the world. So different competitors, yes, \u2014 some of the same channel partners. So some of the same distributors and value-added resellers that we leverage around the globe are the same. Some of the customers are the same, but many are different as well, and we\u2019re excited to enter markets as well that they\u2019ve got strength in that we don\u2019t today.\nSo we see revenue synergies as well as cost synergies as we talked about in the release, and we\u2019re excited about working together as they really give us more of a consumer-facing offering to add to our portfolio.\nDamian Mark Karas: That\u2019s helpful. And Bill, I think you mentioned the one big beautiful bill legislation, and that should have a positive impact on North America. Just curious, is that kind of Zebra\u2019s internal assessment? Or are you maybe hearing that in your dialogue with customers, they\u2019re becoming increasingly positive and maybe even you\u2019re seeing that reflected in your funnel activity in North America?\nNathan Andrew Winters: Damian, I can jump in and address that. I think we\u2019re not hearing it directly from our customers. I think like many, including ourselves, you\u2019re digesting it and understanding what is the impact from a cash perspective, particularly around the R&D deductibility in year 1 as well as the ability to deduct the first year or 100% of the capital expenditure in year 1. So my guess is like us assessing what that means for your business and that ultimately then turns into how do you want to allocate that capital that could lead to more capital purchases in the back half of the year, but we\u2019re not hearing it directly from customers, just more noting that, that is an opportunity as we go through the back half, but I think it\u2019s going to take some time for folks to understand it, make sure they then allocate where they want to put the capital and understand when you receive the cash back in terms of less future payments here in the back half of the year or what it might mean even as you go into \u201926 in terms of capital that might be available to spend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens.\nThomas Allen Moll: Bill, I think I heard you use the term balanced for the approach to your second half outlook. And I wanted to follow on that and ask what you\u2019re assuming on large deal conversion. Maybe just related to what you saw in the second quarter as well would be helpful?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. I\u2019d say that from a second half year kind of fourth quarter perspective as it relates to kind of year-end spending, I would say that the year overall is playing out better than we expected and that we saw strong growth in the first half and strong results, as you saw in second quarter, which allows us to increase our outlook. And we had easier compares in the first half, a bit tougher compares in second half. So you\u2019re kind of playing out as we expected. I would say that as we look to fourth quarter that overall that we factored in some year-end spending about the same levels as we had last year because while we don\u2019t have visibility yet to it, it\u2019s too early for that. We know there will be some. As we just talked about, things like the U.S. legislation around the big beautiful bill could help with CapEx spending year-end.\nAnd certainly, as customers have remained cautious through the year, we could see additional year-end spending, but we factored some in, which is we think is prudent even though we don\u2019t have quite the visibility today. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying it\u2019s our outlook, I would use the word balanced, as you said, really with the opportunities we see, a bit of uncertainty out there, but clarity coming through on tariffs. And then we haven\u2019t talked about it yet, but we\u2019re seeing some softness in Europe, certainly a mixed result across Europe. And I would say that\u2019s kind of weighing in as well. So we\u2019re trying to find the right balance of second half and the guide for Q3, we feel good about and less certainty around Q4, but we feel good that customers will spend some year-end money.\nIf they\u2019re being conservative, maybe there\u2019s some upside to that. There are some things out there like the U.S. legislation. We see \u2014 like to see Europe be a bit stronger as we\u2019re seeing softness there, but it\u2019s been a mixed across the region. That\u2019s why I used the word balance.\nThomas Allen Moll: And then on Elo, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times that there\u2019s a big market you can go after now that\u2019s more consumer-facing. And I\u2019m interested to get a little more of the strategy there. It\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an entirely new direction for Zebra, but it\u2019s a slightly different emphasis than what you\u2019ve discussed historically. So are there some things changing in that market that draw you to it? Or what\u2019s some of the thinking behind the scenes here?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. So maybe the easiest example is when we\u2019ve talked about kind of the modern store from a Zebra perspective, really powered by AI and the idea that we think of engaged associates in a retail store and then we think of inventory accuracy. And the last is kind of customer consumer-facing for the retailer. This adds to that element of solutions. And today, our mobile devices, for instance, are used for payment. Our mobile devices are used in Europe extensively. We\u2019re the market leader in things like self-scan. But ultimately, the buying experience also includes self-serve checkout, kiosks and quick-serve restaurants. There\u2019s a move to serve customers not just through mobility, tablets and mobile devices with payment on them, but also in fixed touchscreens and in payment and point of sale that includes in the Elo case, things like compute and your touchscreen displays and payment, all driven or focused on customer and self-service.\nSo there\u2019s also an element within the \u2014 in retail, and I\u2019ll stick with retail for a minute, but it applies to multiple other verticals is this idea of media networks within the store. So screens and touchscreens and displays ultimately that are driven by Android today as well. So both a combination of Windows and Android, but Android is becoming more prevalent to drive those technologies and the platform we used around mobile computing, customers have said to us, you\u2019d like to see that same Android platform used across our fixed screen technology and touchscreens in the store that we use in your mobile devices. And they\u2019ve actually represented some of this to us saying it\u2019d be interesting if you could pull those two together. So think of places where we work together would be point of sale.\nTheir offerings would include self-service kiosks, which would marry with things like mobile device checkout or self-scanning. And then we think of new areas. So as we go to \u2014 at the HIMSS show for health care, while we\u2019re talking about mobility and health care, there clearly is an element around kiosk and self-serve within health care. When we\u2019re talking about quick-serve restaurants, our relationships most recently have been advanced technologies around RFID and tracking food into quick-serve restaurants. They\u2019re controlling both the customer interface, but also the production of food and others inside the kitchen. So think of process management inside quick-serve restaurants. So it\u2019s closely adjacent to what we do in manufacturing. We talk about tablets on the production floor, but there\u2019s also fixed screen elements to that and touch screens associated with the manufacturing process and process management, so automation.\nSo we see it as another step to not only addressing the consumer, but addressing automation in a different way beyond mobility. And the two are coming together with operating systems such as Android. So that\u2019s why we see overlapping customers, overlapping markets and places where we can take their solutions globally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas.\nAndrew Edouard Buscaglia: I wanted to ask on just to gauge how you\u2019re viewing tariffs from here. Obviously, saw some de-escalation intra-quarter in China. But there are still \u2014 there is still uncertainty with how this plays out. So I\u2019m wondering, maybe number one, are you concerned or have you contemplated or what are you seeing in terms of the potential exemptions picking and/or going away? And then any other, I don\u2019t know, further tariff escalations you\u2019re aware of that you\u2019re monitoring? And what can you do to offset those?\nNathan Andrew Winters: Yes, Andrew, I\u2019d say \u2014 and Bill mentioned this earlier, obviously, progress has been made since our last update. But as you noted, it remains a dynamic environment. And I think we\u2019re looking at it is it\u2019s probably going to remain a dynamic environment for a period of time. So it\u2019s just one of those where we continuously work with our trade and industry partners to understand what they\u2019re hearing, what they\u2019re seeing, how are others reacting so that we can get as much intelligence as possible. And we have a dedicated team that wakes up every day keeping a pulse on where things are at and as news breaks, making sure we have a position to react. But also, as we said, to some extent, we want to play our game in terms of continuing to have a diversified supply base that is both \u2014 can react to tariffs, but also just have broader sustainable supply chain, right?\nSo that and resilient supply chain. So we\u2019re managing \u2014 we have a playbook that the team is executing to that has a bunch of different options available to us that we can execute here, particularly as we get more clarity as we go through the balance of the year. So I\u2019d say as it relates to exemptions or other changes in rates, we don\u2019t know anything else that you don\u2019t see in the news or that\u2019s not breaking. So we \u2014 again, we\u2019re \u2014 I think we just \u2014 we look at that as what are the options available from pricing to other geographical moves, but ultimately, making sure we have a resilient and sustainable supply chain for years to come, and that\u2019s where we stay focused.\nAndrew Edouard Buscaglia: Okay. Fair enough. And then I want to get your take on competition and your potential for market share gains. You\u2019re seeing one of your biggest competitor across many different business lines somewhat get deemphasized by its parent company. So I\u2019m wondering, do you see a pathway for more share gains going forward? And what\u2019s your take on what\u2019s going on competitively?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. I would say that not much different overall, quite honestly, except for the announcement that you mentioned with our competitor. I think that our strong customer relationships, the vertical market expertise we have, the breadth and depth of our portfolio, our commitment to our customers and continuing to invest in innovation along with them, expanding the portfolio, I think from the acquisition perspective, clearly, it elevates our strategic position with our customer to be doing more business with them in areas that they\u2019re focused like self-serve and others. So we saw this with the Enterprise acquisition. The more business we do together and the more vision we paint with our customers about what the future of retail looks like, what the future of P&L looks like, what the future of manufacturing looks like and have a breadth and depth of the portfolio that expands our relationships, and that\u2019s one of the reasons we like this acquisition, allows us to continue to remain relevant, important and add to the future direction of our customers in a voice that ultimately they rely on as a trusted partner.\nSo we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at competitively. The portfolio is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. We continue to add to the portfolio, new areas such as wearables, right, will play a role not only today, but they\u2019ll play a role in AI in the future. If you look what\u2019s being set out there around what the future AI device looks like. It\u2019s likely a mobile device augmented with something that\u2019s wearable. So we\u2019ve got new wearable offerings for both retail and health care. We continue to expand the portfolio with next- generation devices across T&L as we see the refreshes coming up over the next couple of years. We\u2019re really focused on that. We recently won a postal opportunity, large postal opportunity in Australia, which again speaks to our strength in postal and having the right device in T&L as these refreshes come up.\nSo we feel good competitively ultimately, and what happens with our competitor happens. So that\u2019s going to take some time to play out, and we\u2019ll continue to play our game, and we feel good about where we\u2019re at.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.\nJames Andrew Ricchiuti: You noted some softness in Europe. I\u2019m wondering what changes have you seen in the various subsectors of the market more broadly, whether any changes in the overall retail, retail automation, e-commerce, logistics areas versus, say, 3 months ago?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. I would say that when we look at Q2, certainly strong growth across North America, Asia Pac and Latin America. So geography- wise, strong growth with EMEA certainly being more challenged or softness. The strength globally on a global basis, I would say T&L and retail and e-commerce continue to be strengths for us. Health care in North America cycling some strong compares in mobile computing. And I would say, while growing mid-single digits, manufacturing is slower than the other and certainly transportation, logistics and retail. When I look at the regions, I would say, as you asked specifically about EMEA, I would say that cycling strong prior year compares in mobile computing. So that\u2019s clearly a factor.\nBut I think overall, we\u2019re seeing kind of mixed performance across EMEA. So strength in places like Northern Europe and particularly in T&L, but we\u2019re seeing softness in auto manufacturing. Some of the retail sectors in France is a good example where we\u2019re seeing a bit of bit challenging. Some of the run rate, we think, really driven by some of the concerns around kind of geopolitical and tariff and others. So some run rate challenge in EMEA. So overall, I would say we\u2019d like to see EMEA, the softness in EMEA kind of abate and get a bit stronger. That\u2019s happened throughout the year. So we started okay, but we\u2019ve seen more of that kind of EMEA degrade through second quarter. North America, strong really around mobile computing, data capture, RFID, so broad portfolio set.\nAsia Pacific strengthened. We talked about Australia and New Zealand, India, some new applications around RFID and places like India around transportation, such as rail. So we\u2019re excited about that as RFID continues to play an important role in the portfolio. So I\u2019d say the one softness point is EMEA, and it\u2019s evolved probably in second quarter, we\u2019re starting to see and we began to see it. And we\u2019re paying close attention to it. We\u2019re a lot \u2014 staying a lot close to our customers and making sure that as they begin to spend, we\u2019re there with them.\nJames Andrew Ricchiuti: Got it. Just congratulations, by the way, on the Elo announcement is, curious, the way they go to market, are they working with similar channel partners that you work with? Or is this a different channel versus some of your products?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes, very similar from a channel perspective and go-to-market, meaning that they work closely with the end customer as we do and then fulfill through value-added distributors and in distribution, 2-tier distribution in the marketplace that they ultimately serve. They sell direct as well. So really very much on top of what we do today. Their largest distributor in North America is our largest distributor in North America. So in that case, right on top of each other. So I think that very similar go-to-market approaches that they have today. Now in places, they\u2019ve got different relationships, meaning things like strength in quick-serve restaurants or different places with the fragmentation of health care, they may be in different customers than we are and have strong strength in those areas, but we\u2019re looking forward to leveraging the customer base on both sides.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research.\nBradley Thomas Hewitt: So it looks like your net leverage will be around 2 turns pro forma for the Elo deal. So as we think about capital allocation going forward, should we assume the focus is more on bolt-on deals and perhaps modest buybacks in the near term until pro forma leverage comes down a little bit?\nWilliam J. Burns: I\u2019d say that, look, I think that our capital allocation in general hasn\u2019t changed in the idea that we focus first on organic growth in the areas in which that we invest in our portfolio, and we believe there\u2019s continued opportunities across the portfolio. M&A, we view as strategic adjacencies to what we do, and we continue to be very selective in that asset, something smaller in Photoneo, we closed and now something a bit larger certainly in Elo. We\u2019re excited about both in much different sizes, but both in areas in which we see as strategic and closely adjacent to what we do. We\u2019ll continue to be inquisitive out there and continue to look for strategic M&A. But we want to get through this one first and get it integrated and brought into Zebra, and that\u2019s our near-term focus.\nAs you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve returned $250 million in capital to shareholders as well. So I think we\u2019re trying to find the right balance between M&A, the things that are strategic for us, what\u2019s available in the market, how do we add to things like machine vision and also in this case, what we see as an important extension of what we do today on the front line of business with Elo. And we\u2019ll continue to look out there, but I think that the focus in the short term is going to be really integrating the Elo team.\nBradley Thomas Hewitt: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned in the release the 5% to 7% revenue growth algorithm going forward for Elo. I guess curious what has been the historical organic growth profile of the business, particularly from 2019 through 2024. And then how would you describe the potential scope of revenue synergies? And is that incremental to the 5% to 7%? Or is that already embedded there?\nNathan Andrew Winters: Brad, I think very similar. If you look back over the last several years, very similar to our performance in terms of \u2014 if you overlap the revenue growth of consistent growth going pre-pandemic, kind of a lot of ups and downs as you went through COVID, coming out of COVID, as you saw a lot of investment around their technology, the supply chain challenges that the industry went through and then the recovery. So I\u2019d say if you bump it up to our long-term growth, it kind of overlaps pretty nicely.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Look like us.\nNathan Andrew Winters: It looks a lot like us. Maybe a few of the years are a little bit different. So yes, so I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen long term with a lot of puts and takes, particularly around COVID and the supply chain challenges coming out of that. Yes. And if you look \u2014 as part of the revenue synergies, I\u2019d say maybe just take a step back on the total $25 million, we\u2019re highly confident in achieving those. There\u2019s multiple levers, and we expect a steady ramp of those over the next few years. So maybe on the cost side, things you would expect around real estate portfolio where we have overlapping sites, consulting services and things like that as well as leveraging our supply base to drive efficiencies across our supply base will be areas of focus.\nAnd then on go-to-market, as Bill mentioned, it\u2019s really around, I\u2019d say, international developed markets where we have a strong presence, the infrastructure, the channel setup, and Elo has a limited presence in some of those markets, but we think a great opportunity to, again, leverage our presence and infrastructure to grow. And then as Bill mentioned, cross-selling opportunities are significant for both sides. So again, I think the $25 million, while we have kind of a bottoms-up more holistically on the cost side, we do think there\u2019s synergies that could get us to that \u2014 to your point on that top end of that 5% to 7% as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Piyush Avasthy with Citi.\nPiyush Avasthy: Just thinking from the perspective of your raised sales growth guidance of 5% to 7% for \u201925, is there any incremental color you can provide us on trends that you\u2019re seeing across the expansionary and adjacencies verticals? If you could break out how machine vision, mobile robots, RFID are performing, that would be helpful.\nWilliam J. Burns: I would say that the \u2014 overall, I would say, from a vertical perspective, across the different vertical markets overall, I would say retail and e-commerce, clearly a strength, as I mentioned earlier, with certainly continued strong demand, both in mobility, so mobile devices and RFID technology inside retail. I would say that T&L recovery certainly is overall kind of more normalized business across T&L. I mentioned postal win earlier that really fits in transportation logistics for us and some new opportunities in things like railway. Manufacturing, I would say, some new areas were adjacencies that we\u2019re focused on things like machine vision inside manufacturing with the idea of inspection and the other area of machine vision would fall back to T&L.\nSo we\u2019re seeing a continued focus on our team. While we\u2019re seeing still challenging in manufacturing and things like EV and others, I would say that the machine vision plays an important role there. So strength across the core portfolio in the areas in which we do business today and then RFID, machine vision and others opportunities across the different vertical markets.\nPiyush Avasthy: Helpful. And I think you touched on replacement cycle. Like have you at least started to have discussions with your customers regarding their refresh plans? And if you have that visibility in 2026, like help us understand what that could mean for your 5% to 7% organic sales growth framework?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. I think everybody is on a different journey of a refresh cycle within their environment. We\u2019ve seen the postal win is an example of a refresh of that postal carrier in Australia that, again, speaks to the fact that we continue to win in the marketplace. And over time, there\u2019ll be additional refreshes. Everybody is on a different schedule, both retail, T&L and others. And over the next several years, we clearly have seen through COVID and today, the number of mobile devices in the marketplace has increased, and that eventually will continue to be upgraded and increased along with this concept of device for all, right, putting more devices in the hands of more associates inside the frontline workers, whatever that\u2019s T&L or manufacturing or retail or health care, we\u2019re seeing that move.\nSo even the refreshes include even more devices over time. We\u2019re not guiding to \u201926 at the moment, but over the next several years, we see that there\u2019ll be an accelerated refresh cycle, whether that begins in \u201926 and moves into \u201927, \u201928, we just don\u2019t know yet. But we are tracking our customers and making sure that we\u2019re staying close to them so that when they are ready, as in this coastal example that we\u2019re there for them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.\nKeith Michael Housum: Congratulations on the quarter and the acquisition. Bill, thinking about the Elo acquisition, is the makeup of their revenue, is it primarily hardware? Or is there other sources of revenue that you guys will be acquiring?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. I mean I would say that their strength in the software is certainly around the OS and what they\u2019re doing in two areas. One would be the move, as I said before, to Android that ties into touchscreens and displays and others for control and be able to use the Android OS. So there\u2019s hardware and software associated with their control of those devices. Point of sale, they also have the compute associated with point of sale. So the point-of-sale terminals are also a combination of hardware and OS and software associated with that. So like Zebra, the predominant sales mechanism is through hardware, but tremendous value in the software side of what they do today within their environment.\nKeith Michael Housum: Great. Is there a particular like competitive mode that Elo has versus other competitors in the space that you may have looked at?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. I would say the breadth and depth of the portfolio, like us, the relationships they have with their customers to really understand the places in which they serve their customers today. I think that is probably one of the biggest strengths, the technology as well. So they clearly are the leader in touchscreen displays and others. They have been doing this for about 50 years, significant patent protection around it, and that\u2019s a strength they have as well. So customers clearly recognize them as one of the leaders within this market, and they remain focused on it. While others are moving away from this market, they remain focused. And I think that, that matters. We talked about what\u2019s happening on our competitor on the mobile device side. I think we\u2019ve seen others kind of exit this market, and it creates an opportunity for them, now us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird.\nRobert W. Mason: Maybe just one more question on Elo, Bill. As you think about \u2014 this is largely complementary. I know you\u2019ve introduced some kiosks recently. They do have some mobile computing products, I guess, as well. But as you think about this, is part of the strategy to keep the Elo brand? Or does this give you additional ability to tier your product \u2014 any of your products?\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. I would say that the overlap is relatively small. I mean, as you said, we\u2019ve recently announced the kiosk. We\u2019ve been happy with the success in the market, but it\u2019s a whole lot different to have a single kiosk offering and have a portfolio, as we know, right? And it\u2019s the same on their side, their mobile device has been focused more on payment, which, by the way, is one of their strengths that we expect to continue to leverage on the mobile device side of things. So their mobile device has been used more in the payment applications. And again, small levels of revenue compared to the portfolio that we have. So the overlap is very minimal overall, and we see that being kind of a strength of the acquisition.\nThe fact that little overlap, ultimately, strength in customers, go-to-market and others is what we saw with the Enterprise acquisition and the idea that we believe we can accelerate in the market from a revenue perspective by not having a lot of debate about which product, which area to go focus on or overlapping products or different go-to-market motions, all that helps you be successful from an acquisition perspective. We\u2019ve also worked with them for some time. So we\u2019ve \u2014 they\u2019ve been an OEM customer of ours. We know the team there well for many years. We have like cultures, right, product portfolios that ultimately are high quality, respected in the market as being high- quality hardware and software. I think that helps as well, certainly with us having conviction.\nAnd certainly, when customers are saying to us, \u201cHey, it would be great the two of you could get together, that also helps.\nRobert W. Mason: Yes. Makes a lot of sense. Nathan, real quick, just your third quarter EBITDA margin guidance is a little bit down year-over-year. But if I adjust for the tariff impact that you\u2019ve outlined, it kind of equates to about a 30% incremental margin year-over-year. As you think about tariffs, hopefully, we get to some normalized place with pricing and mitigation, et cetera. Are there any other \u2014 besides tariffs, are there any other major kind of puts and takes on the margins right now, FX or anything else that you would call out?\nNathan Andrew Winters: No. As you said, the 30% incrementals, excluding tariffs is about what you\u2019d expect and we\u2019ve historically delivered. So I think we\u2019ve largely worked through over the last year\u2019s supply chain challenges and everything else so that I think we\u2019re back to where \u2014 as we grow, we can drive great leverage on top of our supply base as well as our fixed infrastructure. So to your point, outside of FX in the short term is actually a bit of a headwind at the bottom line just because of the \u2014 from a cost standpoint, it\u2019s a pretty big impact on OpEx. And just with the hedges we have in place, you\u2019re not seeing the full kind of revenue upside that you would expect where the rates are, especially the euro is at today, but those will come through as we roll through the hedges we have in place.\nSo it\u2019s FX in the short term is a bit of a headwind in EBITDA, but that will \u2014 if rates stay where they\u2019re at, that will turn into a tailwind as we get into Q4 and the early part of next year, just again, as our forward rates mature. So no, I think those are the key dynamics. And for us, it\u2019s really again how do you drive the incremental volume and leverage our scale to drive that margin expansion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta A. Marshall: A couple of questions for me. One, in the past couple of quarters, you had mentioned that you didn\u2019t expect customers to necessarily \u2014 that they would absorb the price, but maybe adjust the volumes. I just wanted to see, as you guys have been putting in price increases for tariffs or contemplating them, does that expectation still stand where you would expect kind of volume to offset kind of price increases? And then the second question, just on Elo, any 10% customers or kind of customer concentration on their part to be mindful of?\nNathan Andrew Winters: I mean I\u2019ll take the first one. On the price increase, I\u2019d say it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re seeing two dynamics. I\u2019d say on the \u2014 where we\u2019ve raised it on some of the transactional business, we\u2019ve seen pretty good flow-through, maybe a little bit of impact on volume, but I\u2019d say volumes have held up pretty well on the run rate business where we\u2019ve increased price. You will notice that we took down the amount of price we expected from the raise in April between our last guide today, and that\u2019s primarily in mobile computing, where we\u2019re realizing a bit less than what we had anticipated, and that\u2019s primarily because of the electronics exemption. So for us and our competitors that have the electronics exemption, you\u2019re not paying the higher tariff.\nOur customers know we\u2019re not paying the higher tariffs. So you\u2019re not seeing a market price increase, and it\u2019s remained obviously a competitive market. So \u2014 but that\u2019s one where we\u2019ve maintained the higher list price. We\u2019re managing that through concessions. The teams are still driving it because obviously, we still have more to go to fully mitigate the impact of tariffs. But I think we\u2019re again, outside of mobile computing, we\u2019re seeing pretty much how we expected, which is a bit of volume trade-off, but the pricing is coming through in large part.\nWilliam J. Burns: I think from an Elo perspective, diverse customer base. So I think that similar to Zebra overall, their largest customer would be distribution, right, as you see with us. But from an end customer perspective, certainly larger customers that you\u2019d expect in retail and quick serve and others are larger customers for them, but no 10% concentration and overall pretty diverse customer mix across retail, quick-serve restaurants, hospitality, health care, industrial applications in the markets they serve overall. But some higher concentrated customers just as we see with Zebra, larger customers buy more from us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nKen Newman: Maybe first, Nathan, just going back on the $40 million of annualized price that you expect to realize this year. Is there a way to just talk about how much pricing you were able to drive in 2Q, just given that I think the headwinds you were expecting last quarter were a lot higher. I just didn\u2019t know if maybe we saw a potential opportunity for better price cost than you were expecting and if we should expect that to kind of normalize out in the back half?\nNathan Andrew Winters: Yes. So it was a little less than $10 million of price gain in the second quarter. So again, a bit less than we had anticipated, but for the same reasons I mentioned on the full year dynamic where, again, with we had raised the prices across the Board in anticipation to give ourselves the ability to react quickly. And I think we still have that optionality, particularly on things like mobile computing, where we saw a higher list price and we can manage and again, that price differentiation through concessions and approvals. So that\u2019s where we just have extra eyes and making sure we\u2019re making those right decisions on a deal-by-deal basis. So look, I think similar to what we said last time, I\u2019d like to see a bit more stability and see if the rates kind of hold here through the next month or 2 and then obviously come back with a plan with the goal is to fully mitigate as we \u2014 at some point in 2026.\nI think we\u2019re a lot closer to getting that certainty, but we\u2019d like to see maybe how the next couple of weeks play out. And if anything changes from the rates by country or the electronics exemption or what happens from a semiconductor. So still a lot at play that we\u2019re monitoring. But once we have that clarity, again, like I mentioned last time, the goal is to fully mitigate through all the levers that we have available.\nKen Newman: Got it. Okay. And for the follow-up, Bill, anything of note as we think about Elo\u2019s supply chain? Just any idea or color on how much of their manufacturing is international and then how to think about potential tariff exposure there?\nWilliam J. Burns: Nathan, do you want to take it?\nNathan Andrew Winters: Yes, I can take that. I think it\u2019s very similar to our supply chain. The one difference, they do own a manufacturing facility in China that does a lot of their primary production for touchscreens, touch panel modules as well as their monitors. And we actually think it\u2019s a great opportunity for leveraging their expertise in that market, the local knowledge they have around the supply base for areas like our tablet. So we\u2019re excited to see what opportunities are there by leveraging that facility that\u2019s really world-class. And then similar to us, they use contract manufacturers for final assembly across Southeast Asia. So they have a plan in place, very similar to ours, which is to mitigate tariffs by year-end through price increases they did in the early part of second quarter as well as production moves that they are currently executing on.\nSo we spent a lot of time with the team understanding their plans. But I\u2019d say at a macro view, very similar supply chain with the use of contract manufacturers across Southeast Asia. The one difference being an owned facility in China, which is \u2014 that holds some key technology and something we\u2019re excited to learn of how we can further leverage across our portfolio.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair.\nBrian Paul Drab: Sorry, I had to join late. Did you say if gross margin up or down sequentially in the third quarter, second half? Any specifics around trajectory for gross margin?\nNathan Andrew Winters: Yes. So gross margin for the third quarter operationally is, I\u2019d say, relatively flat, both in terms of implied as well as \u2014 so again, the tariff impact is fairly similar between Q2 and Q3. Mix isn\u2019t \u2014 volume is pretty similar, mix is pretty similar. So I\u2019d say similar expectations as we go from Q2 to Q3 on a gross margin basis.\nBrian Paul Drab: Okay. And then just on government and health care, can you comment on those end markets? I know you said health care tough comps in the second quarter, but second half, what are you seeing in those end markets? And that\u2019s it for me.\nWilliam J. Burns: Yes. Thanks. I think we feel good about health care overall. I think the cycling year-on-year compares of mobile computing, still clearly an opportunity for us. I mean some would say that the barcode literally is the unsung hero of that makes health care work, right? Think of all the track and trace, the idea of identifying patients, specimens, the information input into electronical medical records that we take for granted here in the U.S., but it still has extensive growth around the world is no one \u2014 not many countries around the world have quite the extensive use of electronic medical records that we have in the U.S. I think things like clinical mobility playing a role. The Elo acquisition plays a role in self-service and health care.\nSo we feel good about the health care market. We have some new devices out, wearable device in the idea of voice devices for health care that we\u2019re excited about that we released at the HIMSS show earlier this year. Government continues to be a focus for us around things like inventory, large RFID win earlier this year around tracking inventory within government opportunities around inventory tracking. So we feel good about that. Public safety in Europe, we see as an opportunity. We have some new devices we\u2019re releasing as public safety is moving in Europe to more 5G type networks, right, and specialized networks and moving off of specialized networks to more 5G type networks, and we\u2019ve got some new devices to meet the needs of European customers inside public safety.\nSo government, smallest vertical overall, but an opportunity for us, especially as public safety evolves in Europe and as inventory becomes more important. Health care has been our fastest-growing vertical. It just so happens that tough compares this quarter, but we feel good about that market.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Burns for any closing remarks.\nWilliam J. Burns: I\u2019d like to thank our employees and partners for their support as we delivered strong Q2 results. Certainly look forward to welcoming the Elo team as the acquisition closes. Have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."

      "text": "Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!\nAI is eating the world\u2014and the machines behind it are ravenous.\nEach ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nAI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it\u2019s about to get worse.\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:\n\u201cThe future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nTrump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.\nAnd our company sits in the toll booth\u2014collecting fees on every drop exported.\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2026\nAs Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.\nAI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.\nWhile the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.\nAI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.\nAnd infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.\nThis company has its finger in every pie\u2014and Wall Street is just starting to notice.\nWall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds\u2014without the sky-high valuation.\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nDisruption is the New Name of the Game: Let\u2019s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.\nAI is the ultimate disruptor, and it\u2019s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.\nThe companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.\nAs an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.\nThe Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world\u2019s brightest minds are flocking to AI.\nFrom computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.\nThis influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.\nBy investing in AI, you\u2019re essentially backing the future.\nThe future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.\nDon\u2019t be a spectator in this technological revolution.\nDive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.\nThis isn\u2019t just about making money \u2013 it\u2019s about being part of the future.\nSo, buckle up and get ready for the ride of your investment life!\nAct Now and Unlock a Potential 100+% Return within 12 to 24 months.\nWe\u2019re now offering month-to-month subscriptions with no commitments.\nFor a ridiculously low price of just $9.99 per month, you can unlock our in-depth investment research and exclusive insights \u2013 that\u2019s less than a single fast food meal!\nHere\u2019s why this is a deal you can\u2019t afford to pass up:\n- Access to our Detailed Report on our AI, Tariffs, and Nuclear Energy Stock with 100+% potential upside within 12 to 24 months\n- BONUS REPORT on our #1 AI-Robotics Stock with 10000% upside potential: Our in-depth report dives deep into our #1 AI/robotics stock\u2019s groundbreaking technology and massive growth potential.\n- One New Issue of Our Premium Readership Newsletter: You will also receive one new issue per month and at least one new stock pick per month from our monthly newsletter\u2019s portfolio over the next 12 months.
