Clients from around the world trust Dr. Hickman because of his dedication, high success rate, and bedside manner. Be thorough and sure in your decision.\nVasectomy reversal is a term used for surgical procedures that reconnect the male reproductive tract after interruption by a vasectomy. Two procedures are possible at the time of vasectomy reversal: vasovasostomy (vas deferens to vas deferens connection) and vasoepididymostomy (epididymis to vas deferens connection). Although vasectomy is considered a permanent form of contraception, advances in microsurgery have improved the success of vasectomy reversal procedures. The procedures remain technically demanding and expensive, and may not restore the pre-vasectomy condition. A general or regional anesthetic is most commonly used, as this offers the least interruption by patient movement for microsurgery. Local anesthesia, with or without sedation, can also be used. The procedure is generally done on a \u201ccome and go\u201d basis. The actual operating time can range from 1\u20134 hours, depending on the anatomical complexity, skill of the surgeon and the kind of procedure performed. After anesthesia and scrubbing the scrotum with soap and water, the vas deferens is exposed through a small, 1\u20132 cm incision in the upper scrotum on each side. The vas deferens is cut sharply in half, both above and below the vasectomy site. A special bipolar microcautery is used to judiciously control any bleeding. One end of the vas deferens, termed the abdominal end, is inspected and flushed with salt solution to ensure that it is not blocked as it courses from the scrotum to the prostate (a \u201csaline vasogram\u201d). In order to assess for the presence of possible obstruction above the vasectomy site the testicular end of the vas deferens can be compressed and inspected for fluid. This fluid is examined with a microscope for color, consistency and for sperm. This information is used by some surgeons to decide whether or not a secondary epididymal obstruction is present.\n1 Normal appearing sperm with motility Vasovasostomy\n2 Mostly normal appearing, nonmotile Vasovasostomy\n3 Mostly sperm heads without tails, nonmotile Vasovasostomy\n4 Only sperm heads Vasovasostomy\n5 No sperm, creamy fluid Vasoepididymostomy\n6 No fluid Vasoepididymostomy\n7 Clear fluid, no sperm It depends\nIf sperm are found at the testicular end of the vas deferens, then it is assumed that a secondary epididymal obstruction has not occurred and a vas deferens-to-vas deferens reconnection (vasovasostomy) is planned. If sperm are not found, then some surgeon consider this to be prime facie evidence that an epididymal obstruction is present and that an epididymis to vas deferens connection (vasoepididymostomy) should be considered to restore sperm flow. Other, more subtle findings that can be observed in the fluid\u2014including the presence of sperm fragments and clear, good quality fluid without any sperm\u2014require surgical decision-making to successfully treat. There are however, no large randomised prospective controlled trials comparing patency or pregnancy rates following the decision to perform either microsurgical vasovasostomy to microsurgical vasoepididymosty as determined by this paradigm. For a vasovasostomy, two microsurgical approaches are most commonly used. Neither has proven superior to the other.[1] What has been shown to be important, however, is that the surgeon use optical magnification to perform the vasectomy reversal. One approach is the modified 1-layer vasovasostomy and the other is a formal, 2-layer vasovasostomy. A vasoepididymostomy involves a connection of the vas deferens to the epididymis. This is necessary when there is no sperm present in the vas deferens. With vasectomy reversal surgery, there are two typical measures of success: patency rate, or return of some moving sperm to the ejaculate after vasectomy reversal, and pregnancy rates. In a recently published report[2] 95% of men with a vasovasostomy had motile sperm in the ejaculate within 1 year after vasectomy reversal. Almost 80% of these men achieved sperm motility within 3 months of vasectomy reversal. The case for vasoepididymostomy is different. Fewer men will eventually achieve motile sperm counts and the time to achieve motile sperm counts is longer.\nAdditional information:\nThe age of the patient at the time of vasectomy reversal does not appear to matter. Using different age cut-offs, including <35, 36-45, and > 45 years old, no differences in patency rates were detected in a recent vasectomy reversal series.[2]\nThe patency rates after vasovasostomy appear equivalent when performed in the straight or convoluted segments of the vas deferens[3]\nAnother issue to consider is the likelihood of vasoepididymostomy at the time of vasectomy reversal, as this technique is generally associated with lower patency and pregnancy rates than vasovasostomy. Web-based, computer models and calculations have been proposed and published that described the chance of needing an vasoepididymostomy at reversal surgery.The pregnancy rate is often seen as a more reliable way of measuring the success of a vasectomy reversal than the patency rates, as they measure the real-life success of whether the man succeeds in the aim of having a new child.\nIt is important to appreciate that female age is the single most powerful factor determining the pregnancy rate following any fertility treatment and vasectomy reversal is no exception. No large studies have stratified the results of vasectomy reversal by female age and hence assessing outcomes is confounded by this issue.\nPregnancy rates range widely in published series, with a large study in 1991 observing the best outcome of 76% pregnancy success rate with vasectomy reversals performed within 3 years or less of the original vasectomy, dropping to 53% for reversals 3\u20138 years out from the vasectomy, 44% for reversals 9\u201314 years out from the vasectomy, and 30% for reversals 15 or more years after the vasectomy.[5] BPAS cites the average pregnancy success rate of a vasectomy reversal is around 55% if performed within 10 years, and drops to 25% if performed over 10 years.[6] Higher success rates are found with reversal of vasovasostomy than those with a vasoepididymostomy, and factors such as antisperm antibodies and epididymal dysfunction are also implicated in success rates.Sperm are produced in the male sex gland or testicle. From there they travel through tubes (efferent tubules), exit the testes and enter a \u201cstorage site\u201d or epididymis. The epididymis is a single, 18-foot-long (5.5 m), tightly coiled, small tube, within which sperm mature to the point where they can move, swim and fertilize eggs. Testicular sperm are not able to fertilize eggs naturally (but can if they are injected directly into the egg in the laboratory), as the ability to fertilize eggs is developed slowly over several months of storage in the epididymis. From the epididymis, a 14-inch, 3 mm-thick muscular tube called the vas deferens carries the sperm to the urethra near the base of the penis. The urethra then carries the sperm through the penis during ejaculation. A vasectomy interrupts sperm flow within the vas deferens. After a vasectomy, the testes still make sperm, but because the exit is blocked, the sperm die and eventually are reabsorbed by the body.\nA problem in the delicate tubes of epididymis can develop over time after vasectomy.[5] The longer the time since the vasectomy, the greater the \u201cback-pressure\u201d behind the vasectomy. This \u201cback-pressure\u201d may cause a \u201cblowout\u201d in the delicate epididymal tubule, the weakest point in the system. The blowout may or may not cause symptoms, but will probably scar the epididymal tubule, thus blocking sperm flow at second point. To summarize, with time, a man with a vasectomy can develop a second obstruction deeper in the reproductive tract that can make the vasectomy more difficult to reverse. Having the skill to detect and fix this problem during vasectomy reversal is the essence of a skilled surgeon. If the surgeon simply reconnects the two freshened ends of the vas deferens without examining for a second, deeper obstruction, then the procedure can fail, as sperm-containing fluids are still unable to flow to the place of the connection. In this case, the vas deferens must be connected to the epididymis in front of the second blockage, to bypass both blockages and allow the sperm to reenter the urethra in the ejaculate. Since the epididymal tubule is much smaller (0.3 mm diameter) than the vas deferens (3 mm diameter, 10-fold larger), epididymal surgery is far more complicated and precise than the simple vas deferens-to-vas deferens connection. Vasectomy is a common method of contraception worldwide, with an estimated 40-60 million individuals having the procedure and 5-10% of couples choosing it as a birth control method.[17] In the USA, about 2% of men later go on to have a vasectomy reversal afterwards.[18] However the number of men inquiring about vasectomy reversals is significantly higher \u2013 from 3% to 8%[15] \u2013 with many \u201cput off\u201d by the high costs of the procedure and pregnancy success rates (as opposed to \u201cpatency rates\u201d) only being around 55%.[19] 90% of men are satisfied with having had the procedure.[20]\nWhile there are a number of reasons that men seek a vasectomy reversal, some of these include wanting a family with a new partner following a relationship breakdown / divorce, their original wife/partner dying and subsequently going on re-partner and to want children, the unexpected death of a child (or children \u2013 such as by car accident), or a long-standing couple changing their mind some time later often by situations such as improved finances or existing children approaching the age of school or leaving home.[21] Patients often comment that they never anticipated such situations as a relationship breakdown or death (of their partner or child) may affect their situation. A small number of vasectomy reversals are also performed in attempts to relieve post-vasectomy pain syndrome.\nIn the UK, 16% of all men under 70 have had a vasectomy, and with remarriages accounting for 40% of all marriages, there are a significant proportion of men finding themselves in a new relationship and regretting their decision to have a vasectomy.[21] Combined with longer life histories, the rate of divorce and remarriage is thought to be driving the increase in vasectomy reversals and inquiries for vasectomy reversals in recent times.Every patient who is considering vasectomy reversal should undergo a screening visit before the procedure to learn as much as possible about his current fertility potential. At this visit, the patient can decide whether he is a good candidate for vasectomy reversal and assess if it is right for him. Issues to be discussed at this visit include:\nFemale partner\u2019s history of past pregnancies\nMale\u2019s medical and surgical history\nComplications during or after the vasectomy\nFemale partner\u2019s age, menstrual cycle and fertility\nBrief physical examination to assess male reproductive tract anatomy\nA review of the vasectomy reversal procedure, its nature, benefits and risks, and complications\nAlternatives to vasectomy reversal\nFreezing of sperm at the time of vasectomy reversal\nQuestions about the surgery, the success rates, and recovery\nAnalysis of hormones such as testosterone or FSH in selected cases to better determine whether sperm production is normal\nImmediately before the procedure, the following information is important for patients:\nThey should eat normally the night before the vasectomy reversal, but follow the directions that anesthesia recommends for the morning of the reversal. If no specific directions are given, all food and drink should be withheld after midnight and on the morning of the surgery.\nStop taking aspirin, or any medications containing ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Aleve), at least 10 days prior to vasectomy reversal, as these medications have a side effect that can reduce platelet function and therefore lower blood clotting ability.\nBe prepared to be driven home or to a hotel after the vasectomy reversal\nAfter the procedure, patients should perform the following tasks:\nRemove dressings from inside the athletic supporter in 48 hours; continue with the scrotal support for 1 week. Shower once the dressings are removed.\nWear athletic supporter at all times for the first 4 weeks.\nApply frequent ice packs (or frozen peas, any brand) to the scrotum the evening after the vasectomy reversal and the day after that for 24 hours to reduce swelling.\nTake prescribed pain medication as directed.\nResume a normal, well-balanced diet upon returning home or to the hotel. Drinks plenty of fluids.\nNormal, non-vigorous activity can be restarted after 48 hours or when feeling better. Activities that cause discomfort should be stopped for the time being. Heavy activities such as jogging and weight lifting can be resumed in 2 to 4 weeks depending on the particular procedure.\nRefrain from sexual intercourse for 4 weeks depending on the procedure and the surgeon\u2019s recommendations.\nThe semen is checked for sperm at between 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively and then depending on the results may be requested monthly semen analyses are then obtained for about 6 months or until the semen quality stabilizes.\nYou may experience discomfort after the vasectomy reversal. Symptoms that may not require a doctor\u2019s attention are: (a) light bruising and discoloration of the scrotal skin and base of penis. This will take one week to go away. b) limited scrotal swelling (a grapefruit is too large); (c) small amounts of thin, clear, pinkish fluid may drain from the incision for a few days after reversal surgery. Keep the area clean and dry and it will stop.\nIf you received general anesthesia, a sore throat, nausea, constipation, and general \u201cbody ache\u201d may occur. These problems should resolve within 48 hours.\nConsider calling a provider for the following issues: (a) wound infection as suggested by a fever, a warm, swollen, red and painful incision area, with pus draining from the site. Antibiotics are necessary to treat this. (b) scrotal hematoma as suggested by extreme discoloration (black and blue) of the skin and continuing scrotal enlargement from bleeding underneath. This can cause throbbing pain and a bulging of the wound. If the scrotum continues to hurt more and continues to enlarge after 72 hours, then it may need to be drained. Sometimes it is not clear to couples who want children whether they should do a vasectomy reversal or pursue assisted reproduction. There are several questions for couples to ask themselves.\nHow long ago was the vasectomy performed? An older vasectomy, especially those more than 20\u201325 years, may make vasectomy reversal less likely to work.[5]\nHow many children do we want? Sperm retrieval and IVF-ICSI may be a better fit for the couple who wants only one child, as it generally results in both fresh embryos and frozen embryos that can make conceiving one child very reasonable. However, if not pregnancy does not result from IVF the necessary sperm retrieval procedures may compromise the results of subsequent vasectomy reversal.\nAre we comfortable with dealing with birth control issues again? Birth control may be required again after vasectomy reversal.\nHow long are we willing to wait for a child? The average time to pregnancy after vasectomy reversal ranges from 9\u201314 months.[5]\nWhat will each approach cost us? Most insurance companies do not cover the cost of vasectomy reversal. However, sometimes insurance companies cover the cost (partially or fully) for IVF-ICSI.\nAre we comfortable with assisted reproductive technology? How do we feel about children conceived with the help of technology?"
