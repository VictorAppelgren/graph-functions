  "title": "Dual-driver wireless earbuds and headphones with Hi-Res Audio support, both under $100? Earfun's new range is spoiling us",
  "description": "EarFun continues to offer impressive headphones and earbuds for very affordable prices",
  "content": "\u2022 Also, Wave Pro X over-ear headphones with LDAC, aptX Lossless and USB audio\n\u2022 Both models are $99.99 / \u00a389.99 (about AU$185)\n\nEarFun has announced two pairs of headphones that it claims are world firsts in the sub-$100 sector: a pair of hi-res dual-driver adaptive hybrid ANC earbuds, and a pair of lossless dual-driver ANC over-ears with Bluetooth Auracast.\n\nThe EarFun Air Pro 4+, the hybrid ANC earbuds, will go on sale in September 2025. And the over-ears, the EarFun Wave Pro X, will be available from January 2026.\n\nWe reviewed the EarFun Air Pro 4 last year and the EarFun Wave Pro too, and we found them to be both enjoyable and good value for money. So the news of a newer, better-specced version of each is definitely promising, especially since Earfun has often made appearances in our lists of the best budget headphones and best budget earbuds.\n\nThe EarFun Air Pro 4+ have a balanced armature and a 10mm composite dynamic driver in each ear with a \"nano side-fitted acoustic architecture\" to deliver what EarFun says is a natural and expansive sound.\n\nThe earbuds come with Bluetooth 6.0 and Auracast, LE Audio, Google Fast Pair, aptX Lossless and Qualcomm Snapdragon Sound, and battery life is a promised 54 hours \u2013 presumably with ANC off. There's fast charging and wireless charging, with the former delivering three hours of play time from a 10-minute charge.\n\nThe Wave Pro X have dual diaphragm (40mm + 10mm) drivers and Qualcomm's QCC3095 chipset. That means aptX Adaptive and Lossles, LDAC and Hi-Res Audio certification. There's support for Auracast, Bluetooth LE Audio and USB audio, and battery life is a promised 100 hours.\n\nThe EarFun Air Pro 4+ will be $99.99 / \u00a389.99 (about AU$185) and the Wave Pro X are promised to cost the same, though there could be a lot of tariff action between now and January 2026\u2026\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 The best noise cancelling headphones for all budgets\n\u2022 The best over-ear headphones for all budgets, tested by us\n\u2022 The best earbuds for every budget, all TechRadar tested",

      "text": "The best earbuds for every budget, all TechRadar tested and recommended\nThe best earbuds from Apple, Sony, Technics and more all rigorously tested\nSince becoming a full-time audio writer in 2019, I\u2019ve personally reviewed more than 160 audio products \u2013 but TechRadar\u2019s legacy stretches much further back. Our team has been testing earbuds since 2006, and we\u2019ve reviewed more than 300 pairs to date. Only the top performers make it onto this list, each one vetted through our detailed in-house earbuds testing process.\nAs we move through 2025, the majority of listeners are choosing the best wireless earbuds thanks to improved Bluetooth codecs, longer-lasting batteries, and sleeker, more comfortable designs. While this guide spotlights the highest-rated wireless options, we\u2019ve also included a few standout wired models for those who value affordability or hi-res audio. Every pair here has been tested thoroughly by our experts for audio performance, noise cancellation, mic clarity, and battery life, so you know you\u2019re getting quality.\nOur current top pick is the Technics EAH-AZ100, offering crystal-clear call performance, immersive sound, and rare triple-device multipoint support. For under $100/\u00a3100, the Nothing Ear (a) stands out for its unbeatable balance of quality and price, while the Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 recently entered this list as our top mid-range pick with energetic sound, great specs and solid ANC.\nIf you're shopping on a tighter budget, head to our best budget wireless earbuds guide or take a look at our full roundup of the best wired earbuds.\n\u2b63 Read more\nWhy you can trust TechRadar's choices\nWe\u2019ve tested all of the earbuds in this guide ourselves, and our audio review team is led by me, Becky Scarrott, TechRadar's Audio Editor. I work with our Managing Editor for Entertainment, Matt Bolton, to craft our buying guides, and we have decades of combined experience in the audio tech industry,\nI've reviewed over 150 audio products since becoming a tech journalist, ranging from super-budget earbuds to high-end Hi-Res Audio music players. Before joining TechRadar, I spent three years at What Hi-Fi? testing everything the world of audio had to offer; before that, I was a professional dancer. My love of music ties it all together.\nWe worked with our expert reviewers on a process that combines objective and comparative testing \u2013 including ANC performance, clarity, and battery longevity \u2013 with the all-important subjective listening experience, because you can't judge how earbuds truly sound or feel based on numbers alone.\nWe evaluate these earbuds not just on audio quality, but also on comfort, useful features and connectivity, and overall value for money. We know your priorities may be slightly different to ours, so we try to include as much useful information as we can about where each pair of buds excels or has issues, so you can make up your own mind. Of course, our individual reviews have far more information in them.\nEvery pair of earbuds here was tested in-depth by an experienced reviewer, and we regularly scrutinize this list to make sure we think it represents the best options currently available, even if prices have changed over time.\n8 August 2025\nRefreshed the introduction. Switched the original Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for the newer Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) as our 'Best for ANC' pick. Added several new entries to our 'Other earbuds we've tested' section. Checked the whole guide for older products and made sure everything is up to date.\nThe quick list\nWant to cut straight to the best earbuds around? You'll find a roundup of our top choices here. You can jump to a more in-depth write-up for each product, and see the latest deals on them.\nBest overall\nThe best earbuds overall\nDelivering detailed sound with triple-point connectivity and now an even smaller earpiece, Technics' follow up flagship earbuds somehow manage to better their superb initial effort\nBest budget\nThe best budget wireless earbuds\nFor a very affordable price, you get energetic and rich sound quality, the best active noise cancellation we've heard for now well under $100/\u00a3100, great features, and a cool design.\nBest mid-range\nThe best mid-range earbuds\nA solid pair of sleek buds that combine highly enjoyable audio, great specs and effective ANC all for a surprisingly low price \u2013 you'll find exceptional sound-per-pound value here.\nBest for ANC\nThe best earbuds for noise cancellation\nBose has always done active noise cancellation very well, and the newest version of these buds are as good as you can get. They also boast device-agnostic head-tracked immersive audio and lossless support.\nBest for Apple\nSuper-smart earbuds for iPhone owners\nWith fantastic noise cancellation, high-quality audio, an unlosable case and tons more Apple-specific features, these buds offer an unmatched experience if you're all-in on Apple.\nBest for Samsung\nThe best earbuds for Samsung owners\nA top choice for those with a new-ish Samsung Galay phone. These buds sound phenomenal, have great ANC, and deliver spatial audio. Don't expect the AI features to wow, though.\nLoad the next products\u2026\nBest for battery\nThe best for battery life\nUp to 12 hours from just the buds or up to 48 hours (yes, two whole days!) in total is some serious stamina. And also there's a smart screen on the case \u2013 hey, we don't make the rules!\nBest for supreme sound\nThe best earbuds for premium sound\nExpect a high-end experience, with delightful, detailed and dynamic sound, strong noise cancellation, and a comfortable fit for long listening sessions.\nBest open earbuds\nThe best open earbuds\nOpen buds don't have the in-ear element of our other options, and these deliver sound to match regular in-ear buds, with more awareness of what's around you. They're comfortable and very well-priced.\nBest wired buds\nThe best wired earbuds\nYears after they were first released, these 1More buds still represent excellent value and boast a rich, enjoyable listen in a premium-looking build, for a fantastic price.\nBest cheap USB-C buds\nThe best cheap USB-C wired buds\nA pair of wired buds that deliver very comfortable listening and decent sound in a sleek design \u2013 if you want to spend the minimum on wired buds, these are our pick.\nThe best earbuds of 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBelow you'll find full write-ups for each of the best earbuds in our list. We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best earbuds overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need the best sound around: Like their older siblings, there\u2019s nothing artificial about the way the Technics EAH-AZ100 sound; they offer a convincingly detailed and dynamic listen whatever music we feed them.\n\u2705 You want to switch between devices: Triple-point connectivity is a world-first in a product like this, and it\u2019s brilliantly convenient\n\u274c You need earbuds that last long into the night: Even at its best, the battery life available here is nothing special, though it's not bad.\n\u274c You need the ultimate in ANC: There are many less-capable noise-cancelling earbuds, but if silence is imperative look to the Bose buds at #4 on this list.\nThe 2025-issue Technics EAH-AZ100 buds feel premium (because they are), are packed with features, offer triple-point connectivity, a lovely small earpiece and a sound that really needs to be heard to be believed in a wireless design.\nIn pretty much every aspect we tested, the Technics EAH-AZ100 made a rock-solid case for themselves, solidifying Technics' spot at the top of the wireless earbuds tree. They look excellent, their control options work flawlessly, comfort is impressive, and they sound engaging, exciting and thoroughly musical. From their thorough specification (which covers everything from adaptive ANC to Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity with LDAC compatibility) to a design that's smaller, lighter and yet somehow no less premium in look and feel to their slightly bigger EAH-AZ80 siblings, the Technics EAH-AZ100 are ready to do battle \u2013 and for us, they win out in almost every respect.\nUnless you prefer stellar battery life or bubble-of-silence noise-cancellation over top-tier sound quality, the EAH-AZ100 are the real deal. One other thing of note while we're on the topic of noise cancelling: we'd advise keeping it switched on to get the best quality audio (and here we assure you, you won't be disappointed). Switch ANC off and the punchy, beautifully-handled low frequencies somehow lose a modicum of bite and substance somehow, which is why they didn't achieve the full five stars despite their considerable sonic talents, comfort and features.\nRead our full Technics EAH-AZ100 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Balanced, vibrant and detailed, but low frequencies do lose some substance with ANC off. | 4.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | Small, light and five ear tips ensure a perfect fit, you'll also find responsive voice and touch controls. | 5/5 |\nValue | Premium buds through and through with tactile materials, let down only with ANC turned off, which isn't a deal-breaker. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best budget earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want strong noise cancellation: At this price, this is the best noise-blocking power we've heard.\n\u2705 You're serious about sound: These are a fun and responsive set of buds, with wireless hi-res support via LDAC as a bonus.\n\u274c You really want spatial audio: It's not here, but the similarly priced Sony WF-C700N will give it to you.\n\u274c You need a big battery life: The 5.5-hours life with ANC is not very impressive \u2013 the Sony earbuds mentioned above offer 7.5 hours.\nThe Nothing Ear (a) rocketed the company from being an audio also-ran to 'these are the best value buds you can get for the price' \u2013 and that goes double following reductions in price. As an added bonus, they're available in black, white or a fun yellow color too.\nThey were our top mid-range pick here for a while, but they've fallen in price over time, which means you can now find them for around $80/\u00a380 and sometimes even less. That puts them in the budget category in our books, and they're a fantastic affordable option for anyone who wants great specs, sound and ANC.\nWe said in our review that \"for the money, Nothing has tweaked its recipe to near perfection here\" \u2013 the sound is as detailed and agile as you could want from earbuds at this price, and is great fun to listen to.\nThat goes for features, too \u2013 the noise cancellation is as good as we've tested for the price, you get smart features such as wear detection to auto-pause them when you take them out, there's multi-point pairing for instant switching between devices, there's a Find My mode, there's LDAC hi-res support\u2026 the only thing missing is spatial audio, and that's not standard on affordable buds.\nThe 5.5-hour battery life is the only element that's below average, but we can totally live with that \u2013 though if you want longer, look at the Sony WF-C710N.\nRead our full Nothing Ear (a) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | As meaty, fun, zealous and accurate as this money buys \u2013 even then they're excellent value. | 4/5 |\nFit & comfort | Extremely comfortable to wear in a small and pocketable design. They're also very fun and stylish to look at. | 5/5 |\nValue | Solid sound-per-pound value here, especially considering you can now find them much cheaper than they were at launch. | 5/5 |\nThe best mid-range earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You use a high-quality audio source: With top-tier codec support and superb sound, the A100 will make your music sound excellent.\n\u2705 You like a clean look: The slim, pocket-friendly case here won\u2019t bulk out your clothes \u2013 sleek earbuds for a sleek outfit.\n\u274c You want all the extras: If you're after heart-rate monitoring or spatial audio, other earbuds offer more bells and whistles.\n\u274c You love bold colors: If black and white don\u2019t excite you, you\u2019ll find more vibrant options elsewhere at a similar price.\nIf you want energetic and enjoyable audio without spending a fortune, the Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 earbuds are well worth your time. They offer a rare mix of premium features, long battery life and clear, detailed sound, all at a mid-range price that feels like a steal.\nThe Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 buds deliver impressive clarity and energy across the board, with support for high-end codecs, like LDAC and aptX Lossless. They\u2019re tuned with real balance, avoiding the bloated bass you often get at this level. While the low-end can occasionally feel slightly separate from the mids, the overall tuning is lively and musical, with sparkling highs and an open, expressive midrange.\nANC is surprisingly capable too \u2013 not quite Bose-level, but excellent for the price, and it doesn\u2019t interfere with the sound quality either. Battery life is another win here, offering up to 11 hours per charge with ANC off (a more-standard 6.5 hours with it on) and up to 39 hours total with the case. Fast charging via USB-C gives you over three hours of playback from a 10-minute top-up too, which is handy if you're always on the move.\nDesign-wise, the A100 buds have the stem-style shape popularized by Apple, but keep things clean and compact. They\u2019re light, comfortable and secure in the ear, with IPX5 water resistance for workouts and rain showers. The slim charging case is easy to slip into a pocket, though the buds can be slightly fiddly to remove from it. Touch controls are responsive, and Cambridge\u2019s Melomania app adds lots of personalization \u2013 including custom EQ presets and ANC levels. One standout detail is the option to have voice feedback delivered by the actor Matt Berry. It\u2019s niche, sure, but very fun if you\u2019re a fan.\nIf you want smart, great-sounding earbuds with standout value, the Melomania A100 are some of the best around at this mid-range price. They\u2019re not feature-stuffed like some fitness-focused rivals, and you won\u2019t get flashy color options, but when it comes to pure audio quality and thoughtful design, they punch well above their price tag.\nRead our full Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Expect stunning clarity for the money here \u2013 easily the best at the level by some degree, with support for high-end codecs, too. | 4.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | Solid, ergonomic, thoughtfully made with a selection of ear tips for a reliable fit and a choice of black or white designs. | 5/5 |\nValue | The best sound-per-pound wireless design on the market at this mid-range price. | 5/5 |\nThe best earbuds for noise cancellation\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want best-in-class ANC: They deliver the most impressive bubble-of-silence noise cancellation we\u2019ve heard in earbuds \u2013 even better than the previous model.\n\u2705 You enjoy head-tracked, immersive audio: Choose between fixed or moving spatial sound, paired with your preferred ANC level, for a truly tailored listening experience.\n\u274c You already own the Ultras: If wireless charging, a new color, and a slight ANC upgrade don\u2019t excite you then you can skip this refresh.\n\u274c You need long battery life: Battery performance is fine, but rivals like the Technics EAH-AZ100 at the top of this list last significantly longer.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) are our pick for the best noise-cancelling earbuds in this guide, and for good reason. They take the place of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds that came before them and although they don't add enough to justify an upgrade if you do already have the originals, for everyone else the second gen version is a much better proposition.\nSo let's start with the ANC, because these buds are great in other ways, but it's the bubble-of-silence ANC that sets them apart from the rest. It really is best-in-class and rivals might come close, but can't beat them. There are also different ANC 'modes' to choose from too. There's the same level of battery life here that there was with the originals, which is 6 hours from the buds and 24 hours from the case. However, Bose adds wireless charging this time, as well as a new deep plum colorway.\nThese buds deliver fantastic audio. In our review, we said they're particularly suited to music lovers who want zealous audio quality as it's powerful and booming. There are also excellent mics for call handling. As well as the ANC, another top selling point is the immersive, head-tracked audio. You get to choose whether you want your own personal surround-sound performance fixed or moving, and in conjunction with whatever level of ANC you want. They do miss a few features though, including LDAC support.\nDesign-wise, they're very similar-looking to the older model. One key difference is an 'embedded ear wax guard', which prevents any of the stuff produced naturally by our ears finding its way beyond the casework and into the driver housings. During testing, we didn't have an issue with fit and comfort. They were stable and a fit test ensures you get the best fit and seal so ANC performs at its best. Then again, the earpieces are still on the larger side and they are rather conspicuous when worn.\nThey're certainly not cheap, but then we'd never expect a bargain from Bose, especially with noise-nixing this good. Having said that, they might be expensive but they are excellent value if ANC is your top priority. They genuinely cannot be beaten.\nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Immersive audio is wildly fun and engaging but even with all profiles off, the sound is zealous and powerful. | 5/5 |\nFit & comfort | Maybe a little bulky for some still, but there's a good fit test and we found them to be secure and comfortable during testing. | 4.5/5 |\nValue | For ANC, they're excellent value as it's best-in-class here. But they're not exactly cheap. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best earbuds for Apple fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great sound: These sound superb and shut out the real world so well \u2013 and the spatial audio is best-in-class too.\n\u2705 You've got all manner of Apple things: If you've got an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac and so on, then you'll really get the benefit from the seamless switching.\n\u274c You want big battery life: There's nothing wrong with the battery life here, but it's very much average in the buds \u2013 though the amount from the case is good.\n\u274c You don't have an iPhone: Android users won't get anywhere near the full experience, because a lot of setup and control options are done in iOS' Settings app.\nThe Apple AirPods Pro 2 are excellent earbuds that have a strong claim to be the best option for Apple lovers. One of the top features here is the active noise cancellation, which competes with the Bose option above for effectiveness at blocking out almost all external noises (though we rate the Bose slightly higher). The Adaptive Transparency Mode is also a nice trick, adjusting its blocking of outside sounds on the fly. In terms of battery, you get six hours with ANC on and 30 hours with the case too \u2013 and that case is IPX4 water resistant and has a speaker and wireless tracking chip, so if you lose it your phone can literally point you towards it, or it can be found by the 'Find My' network.\nAudio performance is great, and it's vastly improved over the original AirPods Pro. There\u2019s rich sound across genres, and a wide and expansive soundstage, bookended by deep-yet-controlled bass and clear, elevated treble. There's lots of detail, and it's energetic too \u2013 if we were to criticize it, we might say it's a little too forward compared to the more natural and neutral sound of the Technics at the top of this list. Spatial audio is a very impressive trick of these buds too, especially with movies \u2013 it really feels like you're sitting in a home theater rather than having sound pumped directly into your years.\nThe crucial part for why you'd choose these over other options, though, is the extra features they include for those with lots of Apple gear. On top of the Find My support, they switch between your Apple devices seamlessly, they can share audio with other AirPods or Beats headphones, they offer personalized audio tweaks, and even optimized battery charging to help make sure they last longer. But to access all of this, you must use them with iPhone. With anything else, you're looking at basic 'they play music and you can switch between noise cancellation and Transparency' functionality.\nThey're excellent all-rounder buds, and during sales events are regularly available for a little less than the premium competition \u2013 who would think Apple would be the more budget option, eh?\nRead our full Apple AirPods Pro 2 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Awesome sound quality here, if a little safe. But ANC is top notch and Spatial Audio works well. | 5/5 |\nFit & comfort | A functional, easy-to-use shape. They handily come with extra ear tips, which makes them a solid choice for smaller ears. | 5/5 |\nValue | They're regularly available with huge discounts, and have so many features it's amazing \u2013 the only problem is that the features only work with Apple devices. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best earbuds for Samsung phone users\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have a newer Samsung phone: To access all of the best features, you'll need a new-ish Galaxy device.\n\u2705 You want great, immersive sound: Audio is excellent here, as is ANC and spatial audio. You can really cocoon yourself in sound.\n\u274c You want the best value: These buds aren't cheap, and many of their features are only good if you have a Samsung phone as well. The Nothing Ear (a) are most of the way there for cheaper and across platform.\n\u274c You tend to need to replace ear tips: If you like to tinker with the fit of your buds, they may not be the safest option \u2013 they're fiddly and delicate.\nThe Samsung Buds 3 Pro are our top pick if you have a Samsung phone, especially a more recent Galaxy device. The best thing about these Samsung buds is they sound stunning. Our reviewer wrote: \u201cFrankly, these earbuds sound fantastic, with some of the best sound in any earbuds I\u2019ve tested.\u201d We explained in our review that you can expect both \u201cmeaty bass\u201d and \u201cdefined treble\u201d. Which means whatever genre of music you prefer, you should get a great audio experience here. You\u2019ll notice the sound is incredibly immersive and that\u2019s because the active noise cancellation is top notch, too, we called it \u201cheavy duty and impressive\u201d in our review. Most ambient noises, even the louder ones, are nixed thanks to the ANC tech onboard.\nWith ANC on, expect six hours of battery in the buds themselves and 30 hours from the case. This is decent compared to rivals \u2013 although not at all spectacular \u2013 and it\u2019s a welcome improvement over the Samsung Buds 2 Pro. Samsung has also added a bunch of new features into these buds, including some of the brand\u2019s AI features. But there\u2019s a catch: you\u2019ll need one of Samsung\u2019s newer Galaxy devices to \u201cunlock\u201d many of these features. This includes the brand\u2019s AI features, like the language interpreter, improved codec support, the voice restorer and smart dynamic ANC. We\u2019d expect some of these features to only be available on the Galaxy, but it\u2019s a shame ANC is limited. This means these buds only really make sense for Galaxy owners.\nDesign-wise, the Samsung Buds 3 Pro look very AirPods-like. That\u2019s pretty common across all true wireless earbuds these days, but with the tip, small body and stems that point downwards, we wouldn\u2019t blame you for mistaking them for Apple\u2019s buds at first glance. Happily, they\u2019re comfortable to wear for long periods and light too, so they\u2019re unlikely to feel heavy, even after listening for hours. One design drawback is that the tips are really difficult to remove. You\u2019re likely to get there eventually, but we\u2019ve heard reports of people tearing the tips in an effort to switch them out.\nThe downside of the Samsung Buds 3 Pro is that they're premium priced in combination with having many features limited to Samsung phones. Now, considering how good the audio is, they can still be good value \u2013 but those on other platforms would be better off with Bose's buds, or saving and going for the Nothing Ear (a).\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Sound here is excellent with a high max volume and useful EQ just adding to the magic. | 4.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | A design that's very similar to Apple. Comfortable, but really tricky to replace the ear tips. | 4/5 |\nValue | Not the best value for money here. Although they do make a lot of sense if you have a newer Samsung phone and want immersive audio. | 3.5/5 |\nThe best for battery\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You take long road trips: The class-leading maximum battery life of 48 hours is akin to two whole days of playback. During testing, these claims proved genuine too (and the case doesn't drain it!)\n\u2705 You like to wear your heart on your sleeve: You can upload a photo of your beloved right there on the case \u2013 and when you open the box, it flips the other way up so everyone will still see it properly too.\n\u274c You want top-tier spatial audio: There are three immersive profiles here (movies, music and gaming), but, sadly, each one is a shade off a fully immersive, Dolby Atmos-type presentation\n\u274c You desire comprehensive on-ear functionality: Here, you have to select two out of three options for on-ear controls \u2013 volume, playback and ANC. You can't have all three.\nHere's a feature that no other option within this list offers: a color touchscreen screen on the case. It's a lot of fun \u2013 you can select a lock-screen wallpaper from any of the photos on your smartphone, and the image even flips so it stays the right way up when you snap open the case \u2013 but that isn't why the JBL Live Beam 3 are in this roundup.\nNo, the real star here, aside from the vastly improved audio quality over the older and slightly disappointing JBL Tour Pro 2, is the stamina. The battery life is nothing short of excellent at up to 12 hours from the earbuds alone, minus noise cancellation, or 10 hours with it engaged (and nearer nine with adaptive ANC on). On that note, we've recently reviewed the newer JBL Tour Pro 3, but we think the upgrades don't warrant the price hike, which is why the Live Beam 3 is still our pick for battery.\nThe case also delivers three further charges \u2013 we've tested it and the screen doesn't drain it \u2013 taking your total audio playback time up to a class-leading 48 hours. To put that into perspective, Apple's priciest Pro-suffixed AirPods offer 5.5 hours with its top-tier Spatial Audio deployed, or a maximum of 30 hours including the case. Big difference in those figures, no?\nThe JBL Live Beam 3 also boast great value when it comes to the feature set, including a few novel bits and pieces you don't find elsewhere \u2013 including \"Personi-Fi\", which is basically hearing test of each ear to better tailor the sound to your liking.\nOK, the spatial audio profiles aren't going to knock your socks off. JBL has offered a total of three immersive soundscapes for music, movies and games, but if you're imagining sonic articles darting past you in a three-dimensional space you'll be disappointed. Also the ANC is good rather than excellent and the on-ear controls work well but involve a compromise. Look past these minor snafus and you'll find the fit is great, the battery is seemingly never-ending and, honestly, the sound is refreshingly good for bass and detail. View the screen as a lovely extra for the money and you won't go far wrong.\nRead our full JBL Live Beam 3 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Expect big, exuberant sound that also boasts a lot of detail. | 4.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | They're comfortable to wear \u2013 though some may find they do fit far into your ear. | 4/5 |\nValue | The features and audio here are good for the price, but that excellent battery life makes them even more worth it. | 5/5 |\nThe best earbuds for supreme sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Audio quality is important to you: Wonderful sound with great noise cancellation; if you want one of the best listening experiences from a pair of buds, you'll find it here.\n\u2705 You want good travel buds: You can connect the case to any wired source, including in-flight movie systems, and it beams the sound to the buds. Convenient!\n\u274c You'd like to try spatial audio: The sound here is fantastic, but there's no spatial audio. If you've been keen to try it, look elsewhere.\n\u274c You want lots of on-ear controls: You'll have to decide if you want on-ear volume control or access to ANC options, not both.\nLooking for the closest you'll get to sonic excellence in a pair of true wireless earbuds with the key mod cons? Meet the exceptionally accomplished Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 buds. Let's begin with the sound, which is outstanding. In every conceivable way, including musicality, balance and dynamic nuance, you're getting best-in-class audio. As you'd expect, higher quality streams from the likes of Qobuz and Apple Music sounded exceptional, but we rate these B&W buds for making the most of every music source they can get. In our review, we wrote: \"everything was served up with a flourish\" whether that was high-res audio files or Spotify tracks.\nNoise cancellation is at the same impeccably high standard. In our review, we wrote: \"That cocooned feeling of leaving the outside world behind kicked straight in but without any sense of wind-tunnel nausea or my eardrums being unceremoniously sucked into a vacuum.\" This is thanks to B&W's accomplished audio tech, as well as an incredibly snug and comfortable fit, creating the perfect seal for the ANC to work its magic.\nAnother nice added feature is that the charging case can double as a wireless audio re-transmitter in aptX Adaptive transmission (up to 24-bit/96kHz quality). What this means is you can plug it into a non-Bluetooth source (most usefully an in-flight entertainment system) and the audio will be transmitted to the buds. This makes them an excellent choice for long flights.\nThe buds are available in several color options, all with a premium matte plastic finish that we said in our review \"seems to murmur 'I'm expensive' when you pluck them from their small, pebble-shaped case.\" As well as looking nice, they're among the most comfortable buds we've ever tested. This is likely down to B&W putting in considerable efforts to redesign the Pi7 buds that came before them and the result is buds that have very well distributed weight and require zero twisting or adjusting \u2013 this is extremely rare, even with the best buds we've trialled.\nThese buds are incredibly close to perfect. Battery life is a little average at 6.5 hours from the buds and a further 13.5 hours from the case, but it's a worthy sacrifice for everything else you get here. Which is excellent, high-quality audio in a comfortable and premium build. If audio quality is your top priority, these are the buds for you.\nRead our full Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Genuinely some of the best sound we've ever heard from wireless buds \u2013 impossible to beat. | 5/5 |\nFit & comfort | A very comfortable fit that didn't require any twisting or faffing, at least in our experience. | 5/5 |\nValue | You don't get all of the bells and whistles, like hearing tests, but if sound is your priority, which it should be, the value here is great. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best open earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don't want to be cut off from the outside world: Open earbuds don't isolate you from sounds around you, so they keep you more aware while delivering the music.\n\u2705 You want rich sound quality too: The reason we like these open earbuds in particular is how deep and energetic the sound is \u2013 you don't feel like the open design is holding them back for audio quality.\n\u274c You're on Android and aren't tech savvy: You have to sideload the app on most Android phones, which is a bit of a pain. No problem on iPhone or Huawei phones, though (and you can use them without the app).\n\u274c You listen in loud environments: With no ANC and no passive sound isolation, their flip side of the coin to their awareness is that they can't be overwhelmed by outside sounds.\nOpen earbuds have become very popular recently, especially if you want to stay aware of your surroundings while you're working out or commuting. But in a fast-growing market packed with compromises, the Huawei FreeArc do manage to stand out and they\u2019re the best-sounding open earbuds we\u2019ve tested, which is no small achievement considering how tricky it is to deliver rich, dynamic audio without the in-ear seal you\u2019ll find from most other buds in this guide.\nThe soundstage on these is surprisingly wide for open buds with depth and clarity. Music sounds crisp and full of energy, particularly in quiet settings, where you can properly appreciate the tuning and detail. It genuinely surprised us how immersive the experience was during our testing. At times, we forgot we were listening to open earbuds entirely, which is just about the highest compliment we can give.\nThese buds also get high marks for comfort and security. Open designs can be fiddly, but the FreeArc buds sit snugly just outside the ear canal and barely moved during workouts when we tested them. The buds themselves are IP57-rated, which means they\u2019ll handle rain, dust, and sweat without trouble \u2013 although the charging case doesn\u2019t share that durability. And while the 7 hours of battery life per charge is solid, the 23 hour total with the case is a little underwhelming compared to some rivals.\nThere are a few other caveats here too. If you have an Android phone then installing the companion app can be frustrating because you have to sideload it. And while these earbuds sound excellent, they don\u2019t offer ANC, which some competitors are starting to include even in open designs. That means noisy environments can drown out the audio a bit \u2013 it's a trade-off.\nEven so, these are minor complaints. Given the sound quality, comfort and price, the Huawei FreeArc easily earn their place as our top open earbud pick.\nRead our full Huawei FreeArc review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | The best-sounding open earbuds we've had the pleasure of testing so far. A great soundstage, though some rivals now do ANC. | 5/5 |\nFit & comfort | Designed to be lightweight and comfortable, whether you're just walking or working out. | 4/5 |\nValue | Great sound, especially for an open design, at a decent price point. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best wired earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a solid pair of buds: With great sound and a quality built for a low price, these are reliable and worth every penny.\n\u2705 Looks matter: We love the rose gold accents on these earbuds and their cool, angular design.\n\u274c You want to connect to a USB-C phone: These are 3.5mm jack headphones \u2013 consider the SoundMagic E80D instead.\n\u274c You like a premium experience: They look, feel and sound more premium than they should, but the remote and cable need improving.\nWe first tested the 1More Triple Driver earphones way back in 2017. However, the world of wired earbuds tends to move slowly than true wireless these days, which means they're still our top recommendation for most people looking for a reliable, great-looking wired option with an enjoyable sound at a great value, low price. That's why they're also still our #1 pick in our best wired earbuds guide.\nThe audio quality here can be beaten \u2013 you'll find better from many rivals, especially the Technics EAH-AZ100 at #1 in this list \u2013 but you have to pay a lot more for it. These 1More buds bring you bold and enjoyable sound, especially considering their low price and small size. In our 1MORE Triple Driver earphones review, we wrote: \"Music is exquisitely detailed with a good sense of space.\" Even more than seven years on, after testing many more earbuds, that rings true. It's also worth noting that, although there's no active noise cancellation, the earbuds do manage to create a decent seal, which leads to a pleasing amount of noise isolation.\nThe earbuds are made from aluminum and have some rose gold accents with an interesting, slightly angled design, which we think combine to give the buds a much more premium aesthetic than you'd guess from their price tag. They come with a selection of foam and silicone ear tips, which should help most people get a snug fit that's comfortable enough for long periods of listening. The only thing we noted during testing is they did stick out a little from our ears. Their cable is wrapped in fabric for extra durability but the small three-button remote that's attached to it felt a little more cheap and plastic than we'd have liked.\nWith a bold, balanced and detailed sound, superb build quality for the price and reliable, wired design, we think the 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Earphones represent great value \u2013 despite the fact they're much older than rivals in this list. It's worth mentioning here that we think if you have the money and want to stick with wired, the excellent FiiO FH19 are our latest recommendation \u2013 but you'll need deep pockets\nRead our full 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Earphones review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Sound quality is balanced, warm and detailed. Solid quality for the price. | 4/5 |\nFit & comfort | A fairly comfortable design that sticks out a little, but should suit most people. | 4/5 |\nValue | Already good value, but as they're getting old now you'll find them significantly reduced, so they're even easier to recommend. | 5/5 |\nThe best cheap USB C earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You crave comfort: These earbuds were easy to wear all day during our testing and stayed in our ears securely.\n\u2705 You want understated style: Expect a sleek and minimal design with a range of different color options to choose from.\n\u274c You like to have control: The controller on the buds is limited and doesn't have volume up/down buttons, not ideal for walking.\n\u274c You want excellent sound: There's decent sound for the price here, but no bassy depths or sonic details \u2013 you'd need to pay more for that.\nIf you're looking for a pair of wired USB-C earbuds, this set from Skullcandy may not offer the best high-end sonic experience compared to other options in this list, but they're a stylish and reliable choice \u2013 especially considering they're incredibly affordable at $31.99/\u00a329.99 (about AU $50). We tested even cheaper USB-C buds, and this are basically as cheap as we'd recommend going \u2013 especially if you can find them on sale.\nIn our review we made it clear that these buds \"don't whip up top-drawer sound\", especially where detail and dynamism are concerned. That being said, sound quality is decent, especially considering their price. Similarly-priced budget buds that we're reviewed sound and feel much more cheap and tinny in comparison.\nAs you'd expect, there's no active noise cancellation for this price. But thanks to good included ear tips, they have a \"noise-isolating fit\". This won't reduce all ambient noise, but it does do a decent job at keeping you focused on your music regardless of your surroundings. These ear tips come in three different sizes, which meant in our review we wrote that the buds are \"very pleasant to wear\", even for long periods of time.\nAs well as feeling good, we liked how the buds look too. In our review we said: \"They sport a sleek, curved look, and come in four snazzy colorways.\" They also have an IPX4 water-resistant rating, which means they're rain- and sweatproof. The only notable frustrating design feature is there are no volume up/down buttons on their controller, which feels limiting.\nThese aren't the best buds in our guide, far from it \u2013 but they're comfortable, they sound solid and they look good. If that's all you ask, enjoy.\nRead our full Skullcandy Set USB-C review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nSound quality | Expect solid all-round audio here, which is good for the price and design \u2013 though it does sound a little thin at times. | 3.5/5 |\nFit & comfort | A sleek design that doesn't sacrifice comfort. Expect some cable noise though, which can be frustrating. | 4/5 |\nValue | You get all the essentials here.

The almost-in-ear fit was secure during testing and we liked the design. But the open earbuds space is becoming increasingly competitive, so there just weren't enough reasons to buy them over rivals. But do take a look at our AceFast AceFit Pro review if you've been in the market for a pair of open buds.\nActivo Q1 hybrid IEM headphones: Part of the Astell & Kern high-end audio brand, these Activo buds are a fantastic option for audiophiles, but are a little specialist for this guide. If audio quality is a top priority for you, and you don\u2019t mind paying for it, read our Activo Q1 hybrid IEM headphones review.\nActivo Volcano: From Astell & Kern\u2019s lifestyle sub-brand, these wired IEMs offer punchy bass, versatile connectivity, and a premium build \u2013 all at a price that\u2019s surprisingly accessible (by A&K standards, anyway). While audiophiles might crave more refinement, the sound quality is solid for casual listening. For most people, they\u2019re well worth a look \u2013 check out our Active Volcano review for the full breakdown.\nAKG N5: You'll get great-sounding audio here, as well as top features and a USB-C dongle in the case \u2013 very handy and flexible. But it's hard to recommend strongly them because they feel a little too expensive compared to rivals and the battery life is disappointing. Read our full AKG N5 review to find out more.\nAnker Soundcore AeroClip: Another strong contender for the best open earbuds pick. These Anker buds clip around your ear rather than sitting in or over it. We were impressed by both the sound quality and the fit, and while we think the Huawei FreeArc in the list are better value overall, this are our favorite affordable clip earbuds at the time of their release. Still, they\u2019re well worth a look, check out our full Anker Soundcore AeroClip review for all the details.\nAnker Soundcore C40i: If you're looking for a decent pair of open earbuds, you'll get an impressive bass response, easy-to-use app and customizabe controls here. But, as you'll see in our Anker Soundcore C40i review, they're ultimately let down by disappointing battery life, a fit that's fine but not exactly comfortable and the fact you'll need to tweak the sound before you start listening.\nAnker SoundCore Liberty 5: These earbuds pack a punch with big bass, customizable sound, and a stacked feature set \u2013 all at a fair price. But fussy touch controls, a bland design, and average ANC hold them back. A solid option, but in a crowded field, they don\u2019t quite rise to the top. Read our full Anker SoundCore Liberty 5 review to find out more.\nApple AirPods 4: We've reviewed Apple's cheaper AirPods 4, and found them to be\u2026 fine. They have fun and full audio quality, improved comfort, and great spatial audio \u2013 but they're lacking in detail and are a bit too expensive for their quality level. We explore it in-depth in our full AirPods 4 review.\nApple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation: As we said in our AirPods 4 with ANC review these are the best open-ear buds for iPhones. The noise cancellation is impressive despite the lack of a full ear seal, and they deliver a fun, detailed sound. Spatial audio is excellent, they\u2019re ultra-light, and battery life exceeds Apple\u2019s (admittedly underwhelming) promise. But here\u2019s the catch: you can get the AirPods Pro 2 for the same price regularly, and they\u2019re better.\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds (2024): Our full Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (2024) review raves about the noise cancellation and general sound quality here. The only drawbacks being the chunky case and lack of higher-res codecs. They may be a better option to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for sheer bang-for-buck \u2013 if you want the best ANC for a mid-range price, consider these.\nBowers & Wilkins Pi6: There\u2019s little wrong with these B&W buds \u2013 they sound great and have a lovely build \u2013 but it\u2019s all about the competition, as there are similar options at the same price in this guide with more features and better connectivity. Read our Bowers & Wilkins Pi6 review.\nEarfun Air 2 NC: These Earfun earbuds deliver punchy bass and customizable, effective ANC at a low price. But take a look at our Earfun Air 2 NC review to see why we think they were a little weak on sound, which means we'd continue to recommend the Sony WF-C510 buds above as our best cheap option.\nEdifier LolliClip: If you like the idea of open earbuds but you're not sure which to choose, these clip-on buds are a fun option. You get impressive sound and even some noise-cancelling. As you'll see in our Edifier LolliClip review, they also stand out with health-tracking features, like heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring. They fall short on EQ settings and app support, but overall they\u2019re a unique alternative.\nEdifier Stax Spirit S10: These buds sound fantastic and fit well. So why didn't they make the list? Well, as you'll see in our Edifier Stax Spirit S10 review, we experienced some odd pairing problems during our testing and the battery life is disappointing, too.\nFinal Audio ZE3000 SV: We liked the design of these buds. They're compact, light and comfortable. But although we liked the sound for its balance and detail, it's overall lacklustre and just not up to the standard of rivals in this guide. Do read our full Final Audio ZE3000 SV review to find out more.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2: As you'll find in our Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review, these tiny buds deliver a solid choice of noise-cancelling and transparency modes, decent sound and an impressive battery life. But the fit wasn't up to standard, and for a similar price you can find rival buds that perform better in almost every way.\nHappy Plugs Clip: As we found in our full Happy Plugs Clip review, these open earbuds missed the mark. While the charging case is sleek and the design initially impressed us, the audio quality is underwhelming, features are lacking, and the fit proved impractical during testing. With competition heating up in the open earbud space, these just don\u2019t make the cut.\nJLab Go Pop ANC: For a very cheap pair of buds that also (surprisingly!) deliver ANC, these from JLab are a great option. Take a look at our JLab Go Pop ANC review to find out why we rate them so highly.\nLG xboom Buds: We really wanted to like these buds and granted in our LG xboom Buds review we did highlight that the LG app is nice, ANC is decent, and bass is, well, very bassy. But otherwise, there's not much going for them and you can do better for the price.\nNoble FoKus Rex5: There\u2019s a great standard of build and finish here, as well as great specs. But these bold buds don\u2019t quite nail everything in the way they need to for their high asking price. Still, do take a look at our Noble FoKus Rex5 review if you\u2019re tempted by buds with a unique look to them.\nNothing Ear: The big sibling of the Nothing Ear (a) are very good, but they cost dangerously close to the cheaper (a) version and don't stand out as being dramatically better. Read our full Nothing Ear review for more, but we think the cheaper version nailed the price-to-performance ratio.\nNothing Ear Open: Open-ear buds are a big trend, but sadly Nothing hasn't hit the mark in the same way its other earbuds do. The fit and sound just aren't right, as our Nothing Ear Open review digs into.\nOnePlus Buds 4: ANC is excellent here. Not quite Bose levels, but up there. We also rated the light design and the sound is bassy. But other than that, they're a bit of a letdown. The app isn't as slick as it should be, the controls are fiddly and they're more expensive than the previous version. Read our OnePlus Buds 4 review for the full story.\nOnePlus Buds Pro 3: Read our OnePlus Buds Pro 3 review to learn all of the ways OnePlus' latest buds improve on the Pro 2s. They're packed with features, sound superb (especially for the price) and have a great battery life. But they can't compete with some of the similarly-priced buds in this guide. Some core features, like ANC and voice commands, fell short and we're not convinced the design will have mass appeal.\nOpenRock S: If you\u2019re after open earbuds that are stable, easy to use and offer solid battery life, the OpenRock S deliver on those basics. But as we noted in our full OpenRock S review, they fall short in key areas \u2013 the maximum volume is low, and the case is bulky. They\u2019re decent for the price, but with competition ramping up fast, it\u2019s worth shopping around if your budget allows.\nShure SE215: As you\u2019ll see in our Shure SE215 review, these Shure wired earbuds are a very strong choice, with impressive bass. They might not beat the 1More buds in the list above in every respect for overall bang-for-buck, but if noise isolation is a priority, we\u2019d recommend taking a look at them as alternatives.\nSony MDR-EX15AP: We recently tested these colorful wired earbuds, which are incredibly cheap. But, as you\u2019ll see from our Sony MDR-EX15AP review, that's really the only thing they have going for them. We say: spend a little more and you\u2019ll be much more satisfied.\nSony WF-1000XM5: Unfortunately, these Sony buds didn't perform as well as we'd have liked. But, the recent WH-1000XM6 leaks lead us to believe that the WF-1000XM6s can't be far away, and we've even compiled a list of 6 upgrades we want to see in Sony's new flagship buds, whenever they do arrive\u2026\nSony WF-C510: These Sony buds were our best budget pick before they were replaced by the Nothing Ear (a). As you'll see from our Sony WF-C510 review, they\u2019re still a solid affordable option, offering clear sound support for Sony\u2019s 360 Reality Audio, and an impressive 11 hours of battery life. However, with no ANC on board, the Ear (a) just edge them out overall \u2013 but the Sony are cheaper, so if you want something even lower-priced, we love them.\nSony WF-C710N: If you're in the market for affordable buds, take a look at our Sony WF-C710N review because they're a solid choice. ANC is the star of the show here \u2013 especially considering the price \u2013 but everything else is done well too. They're not perfect, on-ear controls don't always work well and the new colorway can look a bit cheap, but they almost made this guide.\nMeet the team\nOur audio tech team put hundreds of pairs to the test in a range of environments in order to determine if they're worth recommending or not. How do we know what to look for? Because we've collectively got years (make that decades) of experience reviewing all sorts of headphones, from expensive, noise-cancelling buds that block out the world to budget earbuds that are cheap and cheerful.\nBecky Scarrott is the Audio Editor at TechRadar.

Some of the top waterproof earbuds can even be used for swimming. The best bone-conducting headphones are popular for fitness fans too, because they don't block outside sounds.\nIf you're going to be wearing your earbuds for long periods, then comfort and weight are a top priority.\nWe\u2019ve included both wired and wireless earbuds on this list, but you don't have to compromise on audio quality by going wire-free \u2013 the B&W Pi8 above are proof of that. If you do opt for wireless or true wireless earbuds, make sure the battery life is up to scratch, otherwise you may find yourself caught short without any music in the middle of your commute.\nThe best earbuds for you should sound good to your ears. Which means if you're a dedicated audiophile, look for buds that support Hi-Res Audio codecs, like LDAC and aptX HD Bluetooth for stellar connectivity.\nWe also recommend you consider your budget. If you want cheap earbuds you may have to sacrifice features, like ANC or a long battery life. It\u2019s all about weighing up what\u2019s more important to you.\nFinally, the brand you choose will depend on what you're looking for \u2013 but we're careful with our lists. That means all of the earbuds and in-ear headphones above come from brands we trust. Still, if you're not sure where to start looking, respected brands like Sony, Apple, Cambridge Audio, Jabra, and Nura are good places to start.\nAre earbuds waterproof?\nSome are, but not all of them. Always check the IP rating. Many modern earbuds are water- and sweat-resistant to a point, which means they\u2019re fine for workouts or getting caught in the rain but wouldn't survive a dip in a pool.\nLook for ratings like IPX4 (mostly splash-resistant) or IPX7 (can survive full submersion) in our best waterproof headphones guide if you need something more rugged. Just remember that even waterproof buds often have cases that aren\u2019t water-resistant.\nDo earbuds emit radiation?\nSort of. But it\u2019s very low-level and considered completely safe. Wireless earbuds use Bluetooth, which is a wireless technology that emits non-ionizing radiation (that's the same type used in Wi-Fi and mobile phones).\nThere\u2019s currently no solid evidence that Bluetooth radiation from earbuds is harmful and it's far below the safety limits set by global health organizations.\nWhat earbuds have the best bass?\nIf you love deep, punchy bass, then look for models specifically tuned for low-end performance. We commented on the solid bass from the Technics EAH-AZ100, Apple AirPods Pro 2, Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and JBL Live Beam 3 buds above, so take your pick depending on your other preferences.\nIf bass is a priority, then we'd also recommend that you look for earbuds that let you adjust EQ settings in their companion apps. That way you can dial in the exact sort of thump you want.\nDo earbuds damage hearing?\nWell, they can if you were to listen at high volumes for a very long time. Prolonged exposure to loud audio in any form is one of the leading causes of hearing loss, especially if you were to use earbuds that sit close to your ear canal.\nHowever, it's worth mentioning that using noise-cancelling earbuds can actually help protect your ears, because you won\u2019t need to crank up the volume to block out the world quite as much, and they can stop loud outside sounds from damaging your ears.\nA good rule we've heard experts recommend is to listen at around 60% volume for no more than 60 minutes at a time \u2013 though most earbuds here, you probably won't need the volume that high.\nDo earbuds have microphones?\nYes, most modern earbuds \u2013 especially most of the wireless ones we're recommending here \u2013 come with built-in microphones.\nBut don't be spooked. These microphones are essential for phone calls, controlling voice assistants and even for effective noise cancellation. Because they listen for exterior sounds, like traffic or voices, and help the earbuds create an \u201canti-noise\u201d signal to cancel it out before it reaches your ears. The more mics (and the smarter the tech to go with them), the better the noise-blocking tends to be.\nHow long should earbuds last?\nThat depends on how you use and care for them. As a general rule, most earbuds will give you two to three years of solid performance before the battery life starts to decline.\nTaking care of the battery (not letting them fully run out of power, not leaving them in extreme heat) can help them last longer. Even once the battery starts to go, it usually just means a shorter total playing time, not that they stop working suddenly.\nWired earbuds can last much longer, sometimes even a decade or more, as long as you don't break the cable.\nIn both wired and wireless cases, however, water and/or sweat can be the silent killer. If you wear earbuds to the gym that don't promise any waterproofing, sweat may get in and damage them.\nWhich earbuds have the longest battery life?\nSome of the best performers in our guide above include the JBL Live Beam 3 and Cambridge Melomania A100.\nBut you'll want to look for the amount of battery you get from the buds themselves in a single charge as well as the amount you get from the case. Because some of the buds listed here deliver a relatively short amount of time from the buds, but hours and hours from the case.\nFor example, the Nothing Ear (a) only give you 5.5 hours from the buds, but 24.5 hours from the case. If you have an opportunity to stop listening and charge them, that shorter bud battery life won't be an issue.\nBut if you want guaranteed all-day-wear, the JBL Live Beam 3 offer an impressive 12 hours from the buds and 48 hours in total, including the case.\nHow we test the best earbuds\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,400 audio reviews\n\u2611\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe've tested each of the top earbuds in this guide to make sure they tick some key boxes, which are reflected in our full review.\nFeatures: One of these is the features \u2013 whether they compare well to other earbuds in the same price for elements such as connection options, smart app controls, active noise cancellation and battery life. We test all these features in different ways. We try the active noise cancellation in different real-world environments, and we check battery life by running them down and tracking the timing.\nAudio: Most importantly, we also want to be sure the sound is excellent, with clarity and a decent level of bass. We listen to music from a range of sources, from social apps and YouTube, to lower-quality streams from the likes of Spotify, to high-quality files from streamers such as Apple Music and Tidal. We'll listen to a range of genres, and we'll use a mix of new music and tracks we've known for years and in which we can hear all the subtle differences.\nComfort: Next is comfort and wearability. You need to know you'll be able to pop the best in-ear buds in your ears for hours at a time, so they have to feel secure and comfortable. Some seem naturally designed for a snug fit, others come with different silicone tip options to help you get the fit just right. In terms of design, we also look for compact buds, those that don't stick out of your ear too much and (in the case of true wireless designs) earbuds that come with a small charging case for slipping into a backpack, handbag or even a pocket.\nValue: And when we've tested all this, we judge them on their value, which essentially means how all of the above balances against their price, and the price of other earbuds.\nComparison: At the time of writing, we're beginning a new testing procedure for earbuds to enable us to add more direct comparison between buds, to make it easier for you to choose which one will suit you best. We'll re-test our current favorite earbuds using the new system, and we'll use it for reviews in the future. You can read the full information about how we test earbuds at TechRadar at that link, but the crucial part is that we're adding certain specific and repeatable tests that all of our reviews can use, so we know we're getting a fair and even comparison between earbuds.\nSound quality testing: The major part of this is a particular playlist that will be used for sound-quality testing, from a specific source device and music service. Our reviewers will also test other songs and sound sources, but this playlist provide a baseline comparison, and you can copy the playlist to make your own comparisons, if you like.\nMicrophone quality testing: We'll also test the microphone quality for picking up speech by recording us talking, and we'll make those recordings available to hear on the site, so you can compare them yourselves, if you want. And we'll detail exactly how long the battery lasts in real-world use, and provide that information for easy comparison too, in tables. At the moment, we're still working on gathering this information, so please bear with us \u2013 an even better buying guide is coming!\nLatest updates to the best earbuds\n8 August 2025\nRefreshed the introduction. Switched the original Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for the newer Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) as our 'Best for ANC' pick.

Added new images to each entry to give readers a better look at the devices. Itemized our 'how we test' section to add more clarity about our reviewing process. Added a 'meet the team' section to give you an insight into our combined tech knowledge and expertise. Added news and suggestions to several of our entries, like the JBL Tour Pro 3 in our JBL Live Beam 3 entry. Added some extra recommendations into our 'also consider' section, like the Edifier Stax Spirit S10.\n11 October 2024\nSwapped the JLab JBuds Mini for the Sony WF-C510 as our 'best budget' pick. Switched the Samsung Buds 2 Pro for the Samsung Buds 3 Pro based on our review as our 'best for Samsung' choice. Swapped the Final Audio ZE8000 Mk2 out for the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 in our 'best for sound' category. Added several recent reviews to our 'Also consider' section, including AirPods 4 and OnePlus Buds Pro 3.\n3 September 2024\nAdded the 1More Triple Driver In-Ear Headphones as our 'Best wired' pick based on our review, and recent testing of the competition.\n30 July 2024\nAdded the JLab JBuds Mini as the best super-cheap option, and updated the 'Also Consider' section with information on the latest products that didn't make it into this list.\n1 July 2024\nAdded the JBL Lve Beam 3 as our top choice for battery life, thanks to their 48-hour total. Removed the older 1More Triple Driver wired set, since the Skullcandy Set USB-C occupy that wired space extremely well, if you're looking for something inexpensive and wired.\n7 June 2024\nWe added the Skullcandy Set USB-C wired earbuds as the best super-cheap wired buds that we'd actually recommend buying, based on testing of several big-name budget options.\n9 May 2024\nSwapped the Sony WF-C700N for the Nothing Ear (a) as the best mid-range option. They're extremely close in quality, but the Nothing's slightly better noise cancellation and hi-res support just win out.\n8 April 2024\nConsidered adding the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 to this guide, but after discussing with the team, we've decided that while these 2024-issue earbuds are very good indeed, other products narrowly edge them in each key aspect (ie. sound, ANC, battery life, feature set) \u2013 so there's no clear reason for their inclusion. Updated the intro here to reflect the WF-1000XM4 being no longer readily available, hence their departure from this list, and explained why the Technics EAH-AZ80 are now our top pick. Added new links to the buying guides to better direct readers.\n19 March 2024\nRemoved the Sony WH-1000XM4 due to stock running out at last. Technics EAH-AZ80 moved to number 1, Sony WH-C700N moved to number 2, JLab Go Air Pop moved to number 3.\n8 February 2024\nAdded the Beats Fit Pro as our best workout buds, reflecting what's in our dedicated guide.\n22 January 2024\nAdded Final ZE8000 MK2, and removed the now-discontinued Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 Plus.

      "text": "Status Audio's new 3-driver wireless earbuds have us very excited \u2013 they could be the perfected version of some nearly-genius buds\nWe're going to listen to Status Quo on the Status Pro (X)\n- The Status Pro X earbuds launch in September\n- Pre-order for $249 / \u00a3227 / AU$391; official price $299 / \u00a3272 / AU$470\n- Triple-driver setup with 12mm dynamic and Knowles balanced armatures\nWhen we reviewed the Status Between 3ANC earbuds, we said that they came very close to greatness: their noise cancellation was exceptional, the sound quality was superb and the experience was only marred by a few minor issues. So we're pretty stoked to see that Status is teasing its \"most advanced earbuds yet\", the Status Pro X.\nAccording to Status Audio, the new Pro X deliver \"a bold evolution in design, comfort, and acoustic architecture\" with a significantly smaller design, a more ergonomic fit and advanced performance. And early birds will be able to get them with a discount ahead of the full launch on September 16th \u2013 the full price is $299 / \u00a3272 / AU$470, but the pre-order deal is $249 / \u00a3227 / AU$391.\nStatus Audio Pro X earbuds: features, pricing and availability\nThe Pro X earbuds have a hybrid triple driver system that includes a 12mm dynamic driver and dual Knowles balanced armature drivers. There's Bluetooth 5.3 with Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast support, and they're Hi Res Wireless Audio Certified using the LDAC and LC3 codecs.\nThe noise cancelling is hybrid ANC with an adjustable transparency mode, and the mics are teamed up with AI-powered speech enhancement to keep you sounding clear in calls.\nThe buds have multipoint connectivity with both Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair, and they're IP55 rated for dust and water resistance, which is better than most of the best earbuds, so we're impressed there.\nBattery life is a promised eight hours from the buds, plus another 24 hours via the charging case.\nIn our review of the Status Between 3ANC, we said that with a few refinements \u2013 a little more detail in the sound, a bit of polish to the overall experience \u2013 they could be great. If the Status Pro X deliver on this, they'll be very exciting earbuds.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like\nContributor\nWriter, broadcaster, musician and kitchen gadget obsessive Carrie Marshall has been writing about tech since 1998, contributing sage advice and odd opinions to all kinds of magazines and websites as well as writing more than twenty books.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Earfun Wave Pro aren\u2019t just some of the best-sounding headphones we\u2019ve tested for their price, they tick so many more boxes too: they have an outstanding battery life, the build quality is solid and they\u2019re comfortable to wear. They also come with a sturdy carry case, they have handy touch controls and more. It\u2019s hard to think of any serious criticism that can\u2019t be justified by the low price!\nPros\n- +\nIncredible battery life\n- +\nSolid build quality\n- +\nAdmirable sound for price\nCons\n- -\nTakes a little too long to turn off\n- -\nFiddly ANC control\n- -\nOnly one color option\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nEarfun Wave Pro: Two-minute review\nThe more I test Earfun earbuds, the more the name makes sense: while these music machines won\u2019t quite impress audiophiles, they provide enough handy functionality and useful features \u2013 at lovely low prices \u2013 to make the listening experience fun. The ear part of the name probably doesn\u2019t require justification.\nYou may have noticed that the new Earfun Wave Pro are not actually, earbuds; they are, in fact, the first pair of over-ear headphones that this relatively new audio company has made. Yes, it made a \u2018Pro\u2019 product before the regular bog-standard one.\nThankfully, not only has Earfun avoided dropping the ball with this new form factor, but it\u2019s managed to make perhaps its best product yet. It carries over what made Earfun\u2019s earbuds great, and turns it up to 11.\nWe should start at the price: these are lovely and cheap compared to many other over-ear headphones, cheap enough that your grandma might pick them up from a big-box electronics store to buy as a Christmas gift for an unruly teen. They undercut several other Earfun earbuds as well as some fairly big names in the budget headphone market.\nDon\u2019t set your expectations low just because of the cost though: these sound surprisingly great for the price. Both bass and treble are pronounced, and while some mid sounds are lost between the two, the overall soundstage is a lot more audible than on many equivalent-price rivals I\u2019ve tested.\nI particularly like how Earfun has avoided the classic budget headphone bass trap (either having barely any, or way too much). If the Goldilocks tale had covered budget headphone bass power as well as beds and porridge heat, the flaxen-haired trespasser would certainly pick the Wave Pro.\nThe headphones feel great to wear too. They\u2019re not heavy and have soft cup padding, plus they\u2019re easily foldable to tote around and have a great build quality. My favorite part of the Earfun Wave Pro is the incredible battery life (80 hours, down to 55 if you have ANC on), which all but eliminates the need to charge these cans on your next road trip. Seriously, unless you\u2019re constantly listening to music, you\u2019ll probably only find yourself charging these things two or three times per month.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAny gripes I had with the Earfun are pretty minor: they take a weirdly long time to turn off, the five different ANC modes risk confusing people who only recently learned what that stands for (active noise cancellation), and there\u2019s only one color option, which might dismay fashionistas.\nI called them minor, alright! And it was hard to find even these, because the Earfun Wave Pro really knock it out of the park when you consider competitors at their price point.\nEarfun Wave Pro review: Price and release date\n- Released in January 2024\n- Priced at $79.99 / \u00a379.99 (roughly AUD$120)\nYou can pick up the Earfun Wave Pro for the very reasonable price of \u00a379.99 / $79.99 (roughly AU$120).\nBeing Earfun\u2019s first over-ear headphones, we can\u2019t compare them to any predecessors, but it\u2019s worth noting that the brand has loads of earbuds ranging from $50 to $120 (or equivalent) so these fit roughly in the middle of the brand\u2019s line-up.\nGiven that you\u2019re spending roughly $400 / \u00a3400 / AU$600 for the best headphones on the market, the Earfun Wave Pro definitely reside in the \u2018budget headphone\u2019 camp.\nRivals in that sub-$/\u00a3100 area include the Sony WH-CH520, which retail for a touch less, and the JBL Tune 670NC (which retail for a tiny bit more, as do the Sony WH-CH720) \u2013 but sales can fold minor price differences like that with ease. Both predate it on our list of the best cheap headphones.\nEarfun Wave Pro review: Specs\n| Drivers | 40mm |\n| Active noise cancellation | Yes |\n| Battery life | 80 hours (55 w/ANC) |\n| Weight | 268g |\n| Connectivity | Bluetooth 5.3 |\n| Waterproofing | NA |\nEarfun Wave Pro review: Features\n- Total battery life of up to 80 hours\n- App brings a few useful extra features\n- Multipoint connection to multiple devices\nI\u2019ve gushed about it enough in the opening of this review, so it\u2019s worth starting with one of the best bits of the Earfun Wave Pro: it has an amazing 80-hour battery life. That\u2019s over three days of non-stop music, if you\u2019re so inclined, though switching on AMC drops that to 55 hours.\nWhile you do see the odd headphone here and there with eighty-plus-hour battery lives, it\u2019s rare, and most budget rivals on the market will give you half that (or less). I was staggered to see the Earfun Wave Pro last longer between charges than my nerdy endurance workout headphones designed for long expeditions, but here we are.\nCharging is done via the USB-C port on the headphones, with Earfun stating that 10 minutes of charging gets you 10 hours of (ANC off) listening.\nYou don\u2019t need to download the Earfun Audio mobile app to use the Wave Pro, but it brings a few extra features that enhance the experience.\nYou can use the app to toggle between five different types of noise cancellation, boot up an equalizer to customize your sound experience, turn on a game mode for improved latency, and also change the on-can controls in case you want the volume up button to do something other than turn the volume up. You can also assign long press commands to the buttons which is a bit more useful. I found the default EQ of the headphones fine too, though you can tweak them to fit any preference.\nAs mentioned, the app lets you select between several ANC modes: Normal, Ambient, Wind Noise, Comfort ANC and Strong ANC. Five modes is a lot (even if one, Normal, is actually \u2018off\u2019), and I can see some users being confused by all this choice. Roughly I\u2019d call the modes a sliding scale of strength, but it\u2019s worth playing around until you find one you like and sticking with it.\nFor calling, the headphones have five microphones which pair with an algorithm that\u2019s designed to isolate your voice from background sounds when you\u2019re talking. By all accounts, I sounded clear when talking to people on the phone.\nThe Wave Pro also have multipoint connectivity, which lets you pair to two separate devices and jump between them based on what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s situationally a really useful feature so you can connect to, say, your laptop for streaming a movie and also your phone in case a call pops up.\n- Features score: 4/5\nEarfun Wave Pro review: Design\n- Comfortable and light design\n- A few on-cup controls\n- Folds up into carry case but no IP rating\nYou\u2019ve seen headphones, right? Yeah \u2013 the Earfun Wave Pro looks exactly like you'd expect: two cans connected by a headband. This band can be adjusted and the cans can be rotated and tilted a little, so it\u2019s easy to fit onto heads of different sizes.\nUnlike some budget headphones, you can fold the Earfuns up to reduce their space, and this way they\u2019ll also fit into the surprisingly premium-feeling carry case you get in the box.\nThe cups are fairly wide and are clad in soft memory foam caps. Honestly, these are some of the most comfortable headphones I\u2019ve ever worn. The weight certainly doesn\u2019t hurt either \u2013 weighing 268g in all, these aren\u2019t the lightest headphones by a fair margin, but they still feel easy-breezy to wear. You\u2019re not going to get earache from wearing these for too long.\nUnlike many other low-cost headphones I\u2019ve used, I was pleasantly surprised by the build quality of the Wave Pro. Many of its rivals have cheap plastic which results in the occasional \u2018creak\u2019 or \u2018squeak\u2019 when you move your head, but the Earfun had none of that.\nYou\u2019ve got several buttons on the right ear cup: a noise cancellation toggle (which switches between \u2018normal\u2019, \u2018ambient sound\u2019 and \u2018noise cancellation\u2019, not the full range available on the app), a volume up and down rocker, and the power button. The power button is easy to use to turn on the headphones, but you have to hold it down for a full six seconds to turn them off, which feels far too long to be convenient. Plus there\u2019s a 3.5mm headphone jack, for if you prefer wired audio, but plugging a jack into it turns off the headphones, and I couldn\u2019t find a way to turn it back on (and thus use noise cancellation) while the jack was still connected.\nThere\u2019s only one color option: bog-standard black. It\u2019s an inoffensive hue, but I\u2019m always a fan of funky color choices.\n- Design score: 4/5\nEarfun Wave Pro review: Sound quality\n- Well-balanced audio\n- Mid lost a little\n- Max volume is really, really loud\nThe usual stumbling block where low-cost headphones are concerned is sound quality, but compared to their rivals the Earfun Wave Pro are really impressive\u2026 though they obviously won\u2019t compete against super-pricey audiophile-pleasing premium options.\nThe bass is decent \u2013 yes, decent is a good word for it. It\u2019s there, it\u2019s solid and audible, but it\u2019s not exactly going to shatter your teeth, if that\u2019s what you want. I read comments from buyers who found the initial bass levels lacking \u2013 thankfully the EQ mode in the app lets you fix this, if you like your music to make your head (and boots) shake.\nAt least the bass is matched really well with the treble. By default I found both mixed well together, to the point that I didn\u2019t actually deploy any EQ tweaks \u2013 beyond my testing to conform these worked. Rarely did low-end or high-end frequencies impair or overshadow each other, though on occasion some parts felt lacking \u2013 I\u2019m listening to Toto\u2019s Hold the Line as I write this and the piano accompaniment is a little harder to hear in the mix than I'm used to.\nIf anything is missing in the soundstage, though, it\u2019s the mid sounds between bass and treble. Instruments and lines could sometimes get lost between the low- and high-frequency titans, or smushed together to create \u2018noise\u2019 instead of \u2018music\u2019.\nBut it's important to remember that these are truly budget conscious over-ears and the Wave Pro never sounded tinny across the course of my listening, a death sentence for low-cost cans. Even at high volumes, I never heard songs exhibit that horrid hiss through the treble.\nPerhaps some of my praise for the Earfun's audio is down to these headphones' long list of tech specs: there are 40mm drivers, a High-Res Audio certification (both for wireless and wired music) and a Lossless Digial Audio Codec (LDAC) for improved Bluetooth streaming.\nThe Earfun Wave Pro\u2019s max volume is wincingly loud, loud enough that I wouldn\u2019t recommend listening for very long. But it\u2019ll definitely appease people who like to get their blood pumping with deafening bangers.\nThe ANC on the headphones is good, not great, but most people will find it fit for purpose. I mainly listened on the strongest mode which still let in some sounds, but it\u2019s a lot better than nothing.\n- Sound quality: 4/5\nEarfun Wave Pro review: value\nThe Earfun Wave Pro offer you considerable value for money, when you consider the range of features and admirable sound quality for the price.\nThese are certainly budget headphones, yet you wouldn't be going amiss by opting for them over pricier alternatives and pocketing the cash, if you don't need the real premium trappings of rivals.\nI say that all without mentioning that the Earfun comes with a carry case, so you won't need to spend extra on one of those.\n- Value: 5/5\nShould I buy the Earfun Wave Pro?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Features | A hugely long-lasting battery is the highlight, with extra useful features just the cherry on top. | 4/5 |\n| Design | Lightweight, comfortable and easily foldable! | 4/5 |\n| Sound quality | The Wave Pro are great for their price, with our issues being relatively minor. | 4/5 |\n| Value | You're getting many more features than you'd expect on the Wave Pro's low price. | 5/5 |\nBuy it if\u2026\nYou don't want to splash out\nDon't want to spend a huge amount on top-end headphones? The Earfun Wave Pro are one of your best options that cost less than $/\u00a3100.\nYou don't want to charge often\nYou can go weeks without powering the Earfun Wave Pro if you want, even with active noise cancellation turned on. You don't need to worry about losing your charger if you rarely use it!\nDon\u2019t buy it if\u2026\nYou need hiking headphones\nOne conspicuous absence from the Earfun Wave Pro's specs list is an IP rating (official certification about their defense from particles and liquids).\nYou want bright headphones\nWith only one color option, these cans aren't ideal for people who like to express their personality through funky color outfits.\nEarfun Wave Pro review: Also consider\n| Earfun Wave Pro | Sony WH-CH520 | JBL Tune 670NC | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Drivers | 40mm | 30mm | 32mm |\n| Active noise cancellation | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Battery life | 80 hours | 50 hours | 70 hours |\n| Weight | 268g | 137g | 174g |\n| Connectivity | Bluetooth 5.3 | Bluetooth 5.2 | Bluetooth 5.3 |\n| Waterproofing | NA | NA | NA |\nJBL Tune 670NC\nA little more pricey, the JBL Tune 670NC have a great range of features, though their audio quality doesn't quite hit the high notes (pun intended).\nSee our full JBL Tune 670NC review\nSony WH-CH520\nIf you don't mind ditching the ANC, these Sony buds sound great, with extra EQ options to improve it even more.\nSee our full Sony WH-CH520 review\nHow I tested the Earfun Wave Pro\n- Tested for over two weeks\n- Tested at home, in the office, on public transport and on walks\nI used the Earfun Wave Pro for about two weeks for the testing of this review, plus a few days before the official testing period when I wanted to get my bearings with them a little.\nI mostly tested the phone while it was connected to my Android phone, though I also tested it on various gadgets like other phones, an iPad and my work laptop. I used it for music, podcasts, TV streaming and some games too.\nI've been reviewing gadgets for TechRadar for a little over five years as of writing this review; originally for the phones team as a writer then editor, but I currently write reviews for various sections of the site. I've tested various Earfun earbuds as well as other low-end headphones to rival the Wave Pro.\nI also tested these immediately after the same-price Edifier W820NB Plus, which was a useful counterpoint.\n- First reviewed in April 2024\nTom Bedford joined TechRadar in early 2019 as a staff writer, and left the team as deputy phones editor in late 2022 to work for entertainment site (and TR sister-site) What To Watch. He continues to contribute on a freelance basis for several sections including phones, audio and fitness."

Why? Because here, every pair of over-ear headphones recommend has been thoroughly tested by our expert team. We evaluate audio performance, noise cancellation, battery life, comfort and features against class-leaders at the price. All of our fully star-rated verdicts \u2013 which you will find attached to each entry \u2013 are based on the TechRadar team's real-world reviews and comparisons.\nHeadphones are the ultimate choice for anyone craving circumaural sound and comfort. By completely encasing your ears, an over-ear design delivers the most immersive audio experience that for many listeners outshines in-ear options (although this is personal preference; many of us love earbuds too). That's why many of the best noise cancelling headphones are over-ears; their larger ear cups also pack powerful drivers for high-definition audio, clever mic arrays for nixing noise and soft cushioning for good levels of passive isolation. For these reasons, many over-ears feature in our best travel headphones guide too.\nAnd over-ear headphones don\u2019t just sound great, they can also be better for your hearing health too. Because the drivers are positioned outside the ear canal (rather than in it), they can reduce strain on your eardrums. Whether you prefer wired or wireless, the best over-ear headphones combine style, performance and comfort. Read on for the best we've tested.\nThe quick list\nWant to cut to the chase and find out which over-ear headphones are the best? Here's a quick roundup of our choices. You can also jump to a more detailed review of every pick, along with our price comparison tool to help you find the best deals.\nBest overall\nThe best over-ear headphones overall\nThe WH-1000XM4s are a flawlessly designed pair of over-ear headphones that continue to remain at the top of our list because they're unbeatable value if you find them for under $200/\u00a3200, which is regularly the case.\nBest budget\nThe best budget over-ear headphones\nA great-sounding pair of affordable over-ear headphones. With a very impressive 100 hours of battery life, customizable audio, solid noise cancellation and a comfortable fit, they're astoundingly good value.\nBest premium\nThe best premium over-ear headphones\nEverything about these headphones feels high-end. From the excellent ANC and class-leading sound to the slick finish and impressive spec, with even more features on the way.\nBest noise cancellation\nThe best over-ear headphones for noise cancelling\nIf sheer noise-stopping power is your goal, the latest Sony over-ears deliver best-in-class performance. They\u2019re upgraded across the board, not just in ANC, but in sound quality, comfort, and features too.\nBest for Bose fans\nThe best over-ear headphones for Bose fans\nIf you love Bose headphones, we get it. They nail sound, ANC and comfort better than most. The Ultras are the standout pick right now, packing awesome ANC, exciting sound, and a lightweight design.\nBest wireless planar magnetic\nThe best over-ear headphones for wireless audiophile sound\nThey're not cheap, but these sound wonderful thanks to their advanced planar drivers, which are rare in wireless headphones. There's no ANC, but they have tons of other features.\nLoad the next products...\nBest affordable wired\nThe best affordable wired over-ear headphones\nThese offer dynamic, rich and expressive sound with plenty of attack \u2013 you would think they cost a lot more when you hear them. On top of that, they're well-made and comfortable for long periods.\nBest open-back\nThe best open-back over-ear headphones\nWhen it comes to a wide, expansive soundstage, an open-back design is unbeatable. The Meze Audio 105 AER headphones sound incredible and are built to an impeccably high standard. Give them a miss if you have a smaller head though, the design may not suit you.\nBest for design\nThe best looking over-ear headphones\nIf you like your headphones to look and feel as premium as they sound, the Dali IO-8 are for you. With perfectly circular cups and a choice of finishes they score serious style \u2013 and sound \u2013 points.\nBest for movies\nThe best over-ears for movie audio\nThe Sonos Ace are pricey and imperfect with music \u2013 but for movies, they're second to none, and support Dolby Atmos spatial audio from any Bluetooth device. The ANC is great too.\nBest for Apple fans\nThe best Apple over-ear headphones\nThese are full of special features for Apple devices that make them tempting if you're in that ecosystem, and they sound excellent, with high-end noise cancellation.\nBest high-end wired\nThe best high-end wired over-ear headphones\nIf you've got the cash and want wired, the Poet are exceptional \u2013 from their art-deco inspired ear cups to their tactile transmission of transients and textures. Every inch the thoughtful, considerate, audiophile-grade listening cans.\nI've reviewed over 150 audio products since becoming a tech journalist, ranging from super-budget earbuds to high-end Hi-Res Audio music players. Before joining TechRadar, I spent three years at What Hi-Fi? testing everything the world of audio had to offer; before that, I was a professional dancer. My love of music ties it all together.\nAugust 5, 2025\nSwapped the Shanling HW600 out for the new and recently reviewed Meze Audio Poet, as the best high-end wired set we've tested. Added more information about the Sony WH-1000XM6 to our entry on the WH-1000XM4 to help the reader understand where they sit in the pecking order. Added a new entry \u2013 the Nothing Headphones (1) \u2013 to our 'also consider' section.\nThe best over-ear headphones you can buy\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best over-ear headphones for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe WH-1000XM4s may not be Sony's flagship headphones any more \u2013 that title has since been passed onto the Sony WH-1000XM5 and subsequently the newer WH-1000XM6 (which we love too, and this is a tough-run race, so you'll find them as our 'best for noise cancellation pick, below).\nSo why do we still rate the XM4 as being the best for most people? Because their impressive sound quality and features is now available at much lower prices. You can do better in most individual areas if you're looking for the ultimate pair of headphones (usually from the newer XM6), but not as a complete package for under $200/\u00a3200 \u2013 that's a price that we regularly see these Sonys drop to, and we're basing this recommendation on the assumption that you'll find them for that price in one of the many regular sales events.\nAside from clear, well-realised and deep sound, there's also highly effective noise cancellation that is only really surpassed by a big margin by the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Heaadphones at #4 on this list. You've got useful extra features too, including multi-point pairing for switching between two devices instantly, DSEE Extreme upscaling of lower-quality audio (such as from Spotify), auto-pausing when you remove them, Sony\u2019s 360 Reality Audio format, plus LDAC higher-quality wireless tech for compatible phones.\nThey're also lightweight and comfortable, with a folding design that's convenient for travelling. Now that they've had a price drop \u2013 and especially if you get them for the extra discounted price they're regularly available for \u2013 these are just unbeatable value, which is why they're still at the top of this list years after their release. But be warned, if you can't find them reduced it's well worth considering the Cambridge Audio cans in third place. Yes, they're more expensive but they're objectively the better pair of headphones, so if you can't go with the bargain, go with the best.\nRead our full Sony WH-1000XM4 review\nThe best budget over-ear headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want great over-ear headphones without spending a fortune, the 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 are hard to beat, and are our top budget pick. They pack in a lot for the price, including solid active noise cancellation, a whopping 100 hours of battery life, and surprisingly decent sound.\nThe 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 go big on features. You get ANC and a transparency mode, LDAC support for higher-quality Bluetooth streaming, and up to 100 hours of battery life \u2013 that\u2019s if you turn off LDAC and ANC, but there\u2019s still an impressive 65 hours with ANC on. In our testing, we found that ANC performance is better than expected for the price, easily clamping down on background chatter, traffic and general noise. The passthrough mode does a good job of helping you to stay aware of your surroundings.\nSound quality is seriously respectable here. While they don\u2019t match more premium pairs of headphones we've tested, the audio is clear and pleasingly bassy. You can adjust the EQ through the companion app if you\u2019d prefer a more balanced profile, and this had good results too. In general, there's an energy and dynamism to them that's easily lost in cheaper headphones \u2013 especially if the budget has gone on supporting lots of other features too. There's no feeling of being short-changed here on sound.\nWe found them comfortable enough to wear for long sessions, thanks to soft padding and a lightweight frame. They also look pretty slick, with a matte finish and sleek forward-tilted design. The build is where you feel the price a little \u2013 the buttons and headband are more plasticky than more premium headphones \u2013 but they\u2019re still perfectly durable for everyday use.\nFor under $100/\u00a3100, you\u2019re getting a strong all-rounder here. These over-ears are comfy, capable, long-lasting, and good-looking. If you\u2019re after an affordable pair of headphones with premium features, the Sonoflow Pro HQ51 are a standout budget pick.\nRead our full 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 review\nThe best premium over-ear headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 headphones are premium through and through. And yes, the price reflects that, too \u2013 but they\u2019re worth every penny. In fact, they\u2019re one of the brand\u2019s best-value products in our books, which is not something we say lightly.\nYou\u2019re getting a seriously well-specified pair of headphones. Think Bluetooth 5.3 with aptX Lossless, multipoint connectivity, a robust 30 hours of battery life and Bowers & Wilkins\u2019 own bespoke noise-cancelling platform. It\u2019s all here.\nThe build quality is also impeccable. The materials, the finish, everything here feels refined and high-end and there are a choice of three shades to choose from. These are much sleeker and more subtle to wear out and about than previous Px7 models, too. They also come with a fairly robust carry case, which looks pretty standard but is also a little more streamlined than previous models.\nWhere the Px7 S3 really shine is in the sound. The tuning is beautifully balanced, with detail, dynamism, openness, punch and rhythm all delivered with precision. They're engaging and entertaining in a way few headphones manage. The ANC won\u2019t beat Sony\u2019s XM6 at #4 or the Bose QuietComfort Ultra at #5, but aside from those, it\u2019s among the best \u2013 although ANC performance does take a slight hit in windy conditions.\nThe PX7 S3 beat both of these for sound, though, and with a clear difference. If you\u2019re looking for top-tier audio with stunning design and craftsmanship, this is it.\nRead our full Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 review\nThe best over-ear headphones for noise cancellation\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSony has upgraded its flagship over-ears with the WH-1000XM6. As expected, they\u2019re top-tier in design, sound and specs. What surprised us, however, was just how far they\u2019ve pushed active noise cancellation. These over-ears don\u2019t just edge ahead of the competition, they beat the class-leading Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones at #5, which were top of the pile since their launch.\nThe WH-1000XM6 are a significant upgrade on previous models, especially when it comes to ANC. It\u2019s genuinely class-leading here and thanks to a new QN3 processor and a powerful setup of 12 microphones (which is four more than in previous models). During testing, even in noisy environments such as public transport or walking beside traffic, we experienced near-total silence. If immersive listening is your goal, this is as good as it gets.\nSound quality is equally impressive. A new 30mm driver, paired with that upgraded processor, delivers expressive, detailed audio with a more balanced tuning out of the box. Think punchy bass, rich mids and crisp treble all intact.\nDesign-wise, Sony has brought back everything we loved, including the foldable design from the WH-1000XM4 \u2013 making them easier to carry and store \u2013 combined with the as the sleeker look of the WH-1000XM5. You also get intuitive touch controls and a premium feel throughout, including an incredibly comfortable new headband.\nThey're expensive, but if you want the most powerful noise-blocking headphones on the planet, they're easily worth it.\nRead our full Sony WH-1000XM6 review\nThe best over-ear headphones for Bose fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones were our top pick for noise-cancelling power for a long time. Although the Sony XM6 at #4 have now edged them out in pure ANC performance, it\u2019s still a close race. But if you\u2019re a Bose die-hard, as many people are, these remain our top recommendation.\nAlthough the noise-blocking power has now been bested by Sony, that still only relegates these to second best; we called it \"mind blowing\" in our review. This power comes at a premium price, as is standard with most Bose products, but it also comes with absolutely glorious audio quality, so it feels very much worth it.\nOur review said that the Ultra Headphones \"deliver some of the most alive, exciting, textured, finely resolved, deeply engaging music I've ever heard from a pair of wireless headphones. It's the kind of sound I would expect to pay 50% extra or even twice as much for.\"\nThey also have a premium feel, while being light and comfortable \u2013 and have a travel-friendly folding design, which is always welcome. They're not flawless \u2013 it's a shame they lack USB-C audio and general aptX support (they do have Snapdragon Sound, though), and the 24-hour battery life is among the lowest here \u2013 but these things are easy to forgive if wonderful sound and active noise cancellation in equal measure is what you want.\nThough if you want to spend a little less, the ANC in the Bose QuietComfort Headphones is practically as good, though the sound quality is weaker.\nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones review\nThe best wireless planar magnetic over-ear headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPlanar magnetic headphones feature a different kind of speaker driver to the vast majority of headphones. Planar tech is known for being incredibly dynamic and detailed, making it a favorite of audiophiles, but it's also hard to power and leads to chunky headphones designs. As a result, it's always been rare to find the tech in wireless headphones, but the Edifier Stax Spirit S5 have found a way to make it work, and it's fantastic.\nWe said in our review that \"it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve listened to a recording plenty of times before now \u2013 I\u2019m confident the Edifier Stax Spirit S5 will find some tiny aspect of it or detail within it that you\u2019ve never heard (or, at least, noticed) before.\" We love just how well the reveal and resolve the fine elements of tracks, but what keeps us coming back to them is that they're also very entertaining, full of low-end oomph and energy. They're also reasonably forgiving with lower-quality streams from the likes of Spotify \u2013 you don't have to be a Tidal member to hear what they can do. At louder volumes, the treble can become a little hard-edged, but this is only really a flaw in comparison to very high-end headphones.\nThe big omission here, though, is active noise cancellation. The passive noise isolation is actually very good, and they're closed-back, but they're definitely better in less-noisy environments. However, they're well-specced elsewhere, including support for all three major high-res wireless codecs: aptX Lossless, LDAC and LHDC.\nThey're not the smallest headphones in the world, but by audiophile standards they're practically compact, and they're not too heavy at all at 347g, meaning they're very comfortable to wear. They come with two sets of ear pads, and the mesh ones do a great job of keeping your ears cool, too. Those who are against the use of animal products, be warned here, though: they have leather on outside of the earcups, and one of the sets of ear pads is lambskin.\nAt $499 / \u00a3499, they're obviously up there with the more premium headphones in our list, but they offer sound quality that exceeds this price, and are positively affordable by planar magnetic standards. For hardcore music lovers, we actually think they're incredible value \u2013 but obviously it's a steep price regardless.\nRead our full Edifier Stax Spirit S5 review\nThe best affordable wired over-ear headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAustrian Audio isn't the most famous headphones maker in the world, but it's one you should know if you want high-quality, well-priced sound. We loved the dynamic, powerful and driven audio of the Hi-X20 across the frequency range \u2013 we said the treble is \"nicely controlled and with enough substance to prevent even the crunchiest treble sounds becoming edgy or hard\", while the mid-range can deliver vocals that are \"assertive and articulate\", and through the bass they \"extract and contextualize just as much detail as elsewhere.\" We did note that the bass may not be quite as full in the deepest notes as some would like, but it's fair for the price.\nWe also noted how well the frequencies are integrated through each other, and said \"They create a large, well-defined and properly organized soundstage, too, and manage to unify even complex recordings into singular occurrences.\"\nWe also found them comfortable to wear, adjustable, well-made and reasonably good-looking for non-nonsense audiophile-friendly cans. They fold for travel, too, and come with a nice cloth bag, which we always appreciate.\nThe only clear downside is the 3m cable they come with \u2013 a shorter option would be welcome, because it's a bit much for most casual listening situations. That's hardly a big problem (you can swap it out, after all). For the $150 / \u00a3120 / AU$250 price, this is as good as headphones sound.\nRead our full Austrian Audio Hi-X20 review\nThe best open-back wired over-ear headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you love a natural, open sound, then a pair of wired, open-back headphones are the way to go and the Meze Audio 105 AER are our favorite pair for under $400 / \u00a3400. These headphones boast a big, well-defined soundstage on which every individual element is detailed and gets to express itself. But being open-back means they don't block out the outside world, so they need to be used in quiet spaces \u2013 and they're wired only as well.\nYou have to make trade-offs for this design, but if you're an audiophile then they're more than worth it as they sound fantastic, especially when paired with one of the best portable DACs or hi-res music players. The audio on offer here is best described as big, unified and poised with impressive powers of resolution. In fact, every track we listened to felt more like a performance. In our review, we wrote: \"they have the sort of direct, unequivocal overall personality that makes every listen an event and makes every recording sound like it deserves your attention.\" High praise indeed. We said in our testing that they do leak sound \u2013 which means you may not be popular in the office if you use them, but that's the nature of open-back.\nThey have premium ear cup cushioning made from velour-covered memory foam and a headband that's lined with PU faux leather. The result is a very comfortable pair of headphones, which are also Meze's lightest to date at 336g. However, it's worth mentioning here that the headband can be adjusted and yet won't suit those with smaller heads, so be warned if that's you.\nThey're wired with a 1.8m length of braided cable that has 3.5mm connections at one end and a single 3.5mm connection at the other. They also come with a 6.3mm adapter. Unfortunately, there's no balanced cable included.\nIf you're willing to make some sacrifices for their design \u2013 mainly that they're open-backed, so will leak sound in and out, and the size won't suit everyone \u2013 they sound truly exquisite. If that's what matters the most to you, have at them.\nRead our full Meze Audio 105 AER review\nThe best over-ear headphones for design\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you like your over-ear headphones to look as lovely as they sound, we recommend the Dali IO-8. Expect an exceptional level of build and finish quality here \u2013 these headphones definitely qualify for our \u2018best for design\u2019 pick. They look minimal and premium, with perfectly circular earcups, brushed and anodised metal on the exterior, memory foam lining the inside for maximum comfort, and a choice of \u2018iron\u2019 black or \u2018caramel\u2019 white finishes. The only drawback in terms of design is there is leather on these headphones and there\u2019s no alternative to opt for instead. Which is a shame as it means they\u2019re not for vegans.\nCertainly not style over substance, the Dali IO-8 deliver exceptional sound that we described as \u201calive with detail\u201d in our review. This is the case, to our pleasant surprise, across all genres and volumes. Expect a thoroughly enjoyable listen, whatever you feed them. In our review, we wrote: \u201cThere\u2019s a sensation of directness and of positivity to the way these headphones deliver music.\u201d Even with ANC on, the sonic performance isn\u2019t negatively impacted. And noise-cancelling performs very well \u2013 although it can be beaten by Bose.\nThe specs list here is impressive, packing in everything you\u2019d expect from a pair of high-end headphones, including Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive compatibility, 24bit/96kHz support, 50mm full-range drivers with 10Hz-43kHz frequency response and 30 hours of battery life with ANC on. They can also work with a wired connection \u2013 ideal if you forget to charge them and don\u2019t have access to power. The only thing that\u2019s missing here is a control app. If you like to tweak your sound settings there isn\u2019t much choice here then, with only two EQ settings on offer. But you could argue: why would you need to mess with the sound when it\u2019s this good? If you don\u2019t like fussing with apps, this could actually be another point in favor of the Dali IO-8 rather than against them.\nThe Dali IO-8 are not cheap. However, by Dali standards, they\u2019re actually more on the affordable side. If you\u2019re on a budget, or you don\u2019t like the leather or the lack of a control app, you\u2019ll find plenty more options that will better suit you. Otherwise, we really rate these headphones (we awarded them a rare 5 out of 5 stars in our review) because with an impressive list of specs, excellent sound and a gorgeous design, they\u2019re going to deliver a stellar performance for those who are willing to splurge.\nRead our full Dali IO-8 review\nThe best over-ear headphones for movies\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSonos' first headphones were highly anticipated, and a little disappointing: they don't work with the overall Sonos Wi-Fi multi-room system (even though they do support Wi-Fi), and their music quality is merely very good, not the kind of excellent audio we'd expect for headphones that come with such a high-end price.\nHowever, they still managed to win us over with their fantastic performance with movies. They support head-tracked Dolby Atmos spatial audio from any device that supports Atmos over Bluetooth \u2013 which includes iPhones, iPads and Samsung phones, so no shortage \u2013 and it's absolutely fantastic. It's weighty, it's convincingly directional and doesn't sound like the audio is being pushed right into your ears, and dialogue is elevated super-clearly out of the mix while still feeling natural. Having directly compared it to the spatial audio on the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones and AirPods Max, the Sonos were our favorite option.\nAnd they do have a Sonos ecosystem trick: if you have a Sonos Arc soundbar (and support will come to all Sonos soundbars in the future), you can connect the headphones to them over Wi-Fi, and use a button on the headphones to instantly switch from listening over Bluetooth to streaming the sound from your soundbar instead \u2013 so you can listen to anything that plays on your TV with privacy, and zero latency.\nIt all worked fantastically well for us, and the headphones also offer very strong active noise cancellation, wired listening over USB-C (lossless) or 3.5mm jack, and a 30-hour battery life over Bluetooth with ANC on \u2013 though when listening to sound from your soundbar, this battery life dropped to around 10 hours based on our testing.\nFor music lovers wanting premium ANC headphones, we would steer you towards the Bose Ultra or the B&W PX8. But if you want something heavily focused on provided a personal home theater experience, we really recommend these.\nRead our full Sonos Ace review\nThe best over-ear headphones for Apple fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe AirPods Max are the best-sounding headphones made by Apple, and the company's first over-ears. They have very strong active noise cancellation, superb sound quality, the best spatial audio available so far, and a striking look with a premium feel. There's a ton to enjoy with them, and they have way more special features if you're deep in the Apple ecosystem, including auto-switching between devices and Find My support if they're misplaced. Very few of these work on Android (basically just music and noise cancellation), so they're very much for the Apple-heavy crowd, especially at this high a price.\nAnd at this high price, their lack of hi-res audio support really grates, but a lot of people will probably be able to forgive it. They have a natural, dynamic and detail sound that we enjoy a lot, though the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are at the same level of quality and are cheaper. However, the nothing matches the Dolby Atmos 3D spatial audio that you get from these when watching a movie on an Apple device \u2013 it's so good.\nIf you've already bought into the Apple ecosystem, if the price isn't a concern, and you've got lots of Apple tech, then the extra features you get from these may put them above a lot of the competition. But we think most people will be better served by spending less on the Bose Ultra Headphones.\nRead our full Apple AirPods Max review\nThe best high-end wired over-ear headphones\n12. Meze Audio Poet\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you've read this far, you came here for the high-end headphone buy, and at $2,000 / \u00a31,899 / AU$3,550 that's what we're giving you. Don't say We didn't warn you\u2026\nYes, the Meze Audio Poet are a posh pair of planar magnetic, open-backed cans \u2013 and that is good because for this investment, you deserve \u2018posh\u2019 and nothing less than posh, thank you very much.\nLuckily, the Poet deliver in spades \u2013 from an impressive build and finish to a lagoons-deep listen. Thoughtful touches like the magnetically attached ear pads and a neat, forward-thinking adjustment mechanism exemplify the careful consdieration with which the Poet were made, and you love to see it.\nAn occasionally narrow soundstage and an eventually fatiguing listening experience serve to make them at least feel real. They're not truly perfect (nothing is, you know) but they easily sit among the best over-ear headphones on the market \u2013 and we only mention it because of the hugely-increased scrutiny premium prices must invite.\nFor those with the hi-fi equipment, the cosy chair, the ample budget and the inclination, the Poet are a pair of headphones you simply must add to your list for a listen next time you head to the dealership.\nRead our full Meze Audio Poet review\nMore over-ear headphones we've tested\nAnker Soundcore Space One Pro: We recently published our Anker Soundcore Space One Pro review, a pair of over-ears that did impress us with solid features and booming bass. However, they don't make the cut because we felt they looked too chunky and their buttons didn't work reliably enough.\nBaseus Bowie 30 Max: This is an exceptionally well-specced set of headphones for the price, delivering spatial audio, noise cancellation and more on a budget. Unfortunately, our Baseus Bowie 30 Max review found that they don't sound especially good, so they don't make it to this list.\nBeyerdynamic Aventho 300: These awesome wireless headphones very nearly made it into this guide, but they're still just a tad pricey against direct competition. For example, they're dearer than the Sony WH-1000XM5, which is an issue. Still, do read our Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 review as there really is a lot to love here.\nBose QuietComfort Headphones: The Bose QC Ultras are in this guide, but if you're looking for a cheaper alternative, the original QCs are worth your time. In our Bose QuietComfort review, you'll find they're also light, comfortable, sound great and have powerful ANC. No, they don't feel as modern or refined as the newer Ultras. But they'll suit anyone looking for a simple, no-frills option that still has the Bose seal of approval.\nBowers & Wilkins PX8: We removed the PX8 as our 'best design' choice in favor of the Dali IO-8. But they're still an exceptional pair of headphones, especially if you like the finer things in life because these over-ears look stunning. Take a look at our full Bowers & Wilkins PX8 review to find out why their classy build and finish is just one of many things we love about these B&W cans.\nCambridge Audio Melomania P100: They're no longer our top premium pick, but that doesn't mean these over-ears aren't still well worth your time \u2013 and the August 2025-issue Fan Edition option adds DynamEQ software, a blue colorway and a slightly cushier headband. They boast an understated and comfortable design with a range of excellent features, including top-tier sound, solid ANC and a great 100 hours of battery life. Read more in our Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 review.\nEarfun Wave Pro: These excellent Earfun cans have long been our 'best affordable' choice, but were pushed out by the newer, slightly more impressive 1More HQ51. Still, the Wave Pro on-ears are an excellent choice on a budget, they sound good, look nice and have a solid battery life to boot. If you find them discounted, even better. Read our full Earfun Wave Pro review for more.\nFiiO FT1: We love the FiiO brand and these are the company's very first pair of closed-back over-ear headphones. We had high hopes, but read our FiiO FT1 review to find out more about why these headphones are a rare miss that we wouldn't recommend over many rivals.\nFinal D7000: We were seriously impressed with the sound quality of these open-backed wired headphones in our recent review. They're extremely expensive, but for most indulgent music lovers, we think they earn it. Read our full Final D7000 review for more.\nMarshall Monitor III ANC: We've also had the opportunity to get an initial hands on with the Marshall Monitor III ANC over-ear headphones, an excellent-sounding pair of headphones that have a 70-hour battery life and a comfortable design. We'll need longer with them before we decide if they'll make this guide. But until then, take a look at our hands on Marshall Monitor III ANC review.\nNoble FoKus Apollo: These headphones sound excellent, have a premium look and feel and an outstanding battery life. So why don't they make this guide? Well, as you'll learn in our Noble FoKus Apollo review, these headphones have a divisive design, which we know won't appeal to everyone. Th onboard mic also didn't work during our testing.\nNothing Headphone (1): despite thoroughly modern (almost cassette-like) looks and big claims, we just didn't think the sound quality of Nothing's first stab at over-ears was beating any class-leaders. We love the originality though \u2013 and the build quality is not to be sniffed at, as you'll see in our Nothing Headphone (1) review.\nOneOdio Focus A5: The battery life here is impressive at 75 hours and they're affordable, but that's about it as far as things to shout about go. Read our OneOdio Focus A5 review and you'll discover we found these headphones to be a bit bass-heavy, and not well-balanced sonically speaking.\nPanasonic RB-M600: We really enjoyed testing these affordable over-ears from Panasonic. Not only are they cheap, they have a lightweight build and a fantastic 65 hours of battery. However, as you can read from our Panasonic RB-M600 review, their design isn't going to suit everyone \u2013 and it's hard to tell without testing them. They also lack any water resistance, which isn't ideal for wearing them everyday or to the gym.\nSennheiser Accentum Plus: A very impressive pair of mid-range headphones from Sennheiser, and we've seen them fall to ridiculously low prices during sales season. They face a lot of very hot competition above and below them in their price range, which is squeezing them out of this list, but we really like them, and anyone looking for a pair of audiophile-baiting mid-range wireless headphones with noise cancellation should read our Sennheiser Accentum Plus review.\nSennheiser HD 505: Considering an open-back design? Give our Sennheiser HD 505 review a look. For the money, they get plenty right and don't leak as much sound as you might think. The thing is, the low end feels a little lacking, and fierce competition at the level means they're far from your only option\u2026\nSennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless: We love these five-star headphones, thanks to their rich sound, huge 60-hour battery life, and great features. But the Cambridge Audio P100 knocked them off this list by offering all that at a cheaper list price. The Sennheiser are often available with big discounts that make them super-tempting, so definitely read our Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless review to learn more about them.\nSony ULT Wear: Sony's bass-loving mid-range headphones are a perfectly good listen, but they're just a little shy of special, and a little too much to be a bargain. We still liked them, but it feels like you can get better bang for your buck. Our Sony ULT Wear headphones review digs into the full nuance.\nSony WH-1000XM5: The newer Sony XM6 may have taken the crown for ANC, but the XM5 are still a solid choice, especially if you spot a good deal (which you should regularly be able to find now). They're not a massive leap from the XM4, which is why those remain top of this guide, but you still get very good noise cancellation, great sound, and loads of smart features. Read our Sony WH-1000XM5 review for more.\nSony WH-CH720N: A good all-rounder pair of headphones, with a comfortable fit, very well-balanced sound, and noise cancellation that helps to make sure you can hear what's happening. We liked them a lot in our Sony WH-CH720N review, but there are headphones with more features and bigger soundstage for a similar price.\nMeet the team\nOur expert team of reviewers have years of audio tech experience and testing. They've covered all of the latest and best headphones over the past 10 years and more, which means they're clued up on everything there is to know about the industry.\nBecky became TechRadar's Audio Editor in 2024, but joined the team in 2022 as Senior Staff Writer. She focuses on all things audio and hi-fi.

Her career as a professional dancer is what still makes listening to music all day a true joy \u2013 and why her quest for the best pair of headphones whatever your budget is never done.\nMatt Bolton is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment and has more than a decade of experience as a technology journalist. Before joining TechRadar he managed TV and audio content for T3.com, and before that he was the Editor of T3 magazine. He's contributed to many tech titles, including Creative Bloq, PC Gamer, Digital Camera World, Edge, Official PlayStation Magazine, PC Plus, MacFormat and many more.\nBecca Caddy is a freelance technology journalist and author and she's been writing about consumer tech for more than 12 years with a focus on wearables, headphones and smart home devices.

Prior to working on TechRadar, he freelanced in tech and entertainment, and also spent many years working as a mixologist.\nHow to choose the best over-ear headphones\nSound quality has got to be the most important feature to look out for when picking over-ear headphones. Audio quality from those bigger drivers (that doesn't rely on a seal betwixt ear tip and ear canal, as buds do) can be more expansive, open, nuanced and immersive.\nBut you also have to have an eye on comfort, because there's a big band going over the delicate crown of your head. Padding and material on the ear pads makes a difference too \u2013 and often, a broader headband is something to look for, so the weight can be better distributed.\nPeople often choose over-ear headphones with active noise cancellation, because the around-ear pads are great at passive noise isolation to begin with \u2013 and it's a good call. Most of our picks on this list include ANC, but it's not the case that spending more on ANC automatically gets you better results. That's why we're here.\nIt's also possible to buy over-ear headphones with 'open backs', which means they allow air to flow right through the ear cup. This can lead to an expansive, powerful sound, but it also means audio leaks \u2013 great for listening in a special room at home, less good on the subway. Here's our in-depth explanation of open-back vs closed-back headphones.\nThe last big question is whether you want to go wired or wireless. Do you want to prioritise sound that isn't compressed by Bluetooth \u2013 and does your device have a USB-C (or even 3.5mm \u2013 some still do!) port to hook 'em up to? Most of our suggestions are wireless, because they tend to be preferred in this day and age, but some feature the option of going wired.\nNot all wireless codecs are created equal, so if the cans only support SBC and AAC, you won't be getting higher-quality options such as Snapdragon Sound, aptX or LDAC. These are all CD-quality options, but your devices must also be compatible with them. Want truly hi-res audio? You'll need to go for some of the best wired headphones and add a good quality headphone DAC to the mix.\nFinally, check the weight \u2013 250g is fairly lightweight for advanced wireless headphones; 350g is about the maximum you'll want for longer listening sessions, but if the design's good, they can still be supremely comfortable.\nHow much should I spend on headphones?\nThat really depends on your budget \u2013 you don't need to overstretch yourself to prices you can't really afford in your quest for great sound.\nYou can find over-ear options among the best cheap headphones under $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$150 \u2013 check out brands like Jabra and JBL if you want to keep costs down.\nThe best noise-cancelling headphones and higher-spec options tend to cost more than this. For wireless headphones, the flagship models start around $250 / $250 / AU$450.\nWhen you get to true audiophile headphones for analytical listening, the prices really start to shoot up \u2013 but these cans will last you decades if you look after them.\nIs it worth getting over-ear headphones?\nChoosing over-ear headphones over earbuds is a personal choice. There's no wrong option here but over-ear headphones typically provide better battery life and better sound quality.\nThanks to being larger, they can pack in a better battery along with more advanced features like superior drivers. By their very nature, they tend to provide better noise cancellation too as they cover your ears more comprehensively than earbuds.\nHowever, some of your decision making process needs to come down to what you feel more comfortable with. Earbuds are easier to store away, but not everyone likes the feeling of them in their ears. Alternatively, headphones can feel more secure over your head but are heavier and require more thought when storing them.\nWhat are the benefits of over-ear headphones?\nThe two biggest differences are comfort and sound quality. Many people find over-ear headphones much more comfortable to wear than in-ear ones, and because they're much bigger they can accommodate much larger and more powerful drivers. Unlike earbuds, they're not limited by having to fit into the very limited space of your ear canal.\nBecause over-ear headphones have bigger drivers, they can potentially deliver a wider frequency range than earbuds, especially at the low end where the bass lives. For example, our current favourites, Sony's WH-1000XM4 go down to 4Hz and top out at a very high 40kHz. By comparison Sony's closest equivalent earbuds, the WF-1000XM4, still reach 40kHz but the low end only reaches 20Hz.\nThere's another crucial factor here. According to the Hearing Health Foundation, over-ears are less likely to damage your hearing. Once damaged, hearing doesn't repair itself so it's really important to look after it. Over-ears don't sit so close to your eardrums so they're less dangerous over long periods \u2013 provided of course you don't run them too loud.\nAnother advantage of over-ears, albeit a horrible one, is that they don't end up covered in ear wax like in-ears do, so you don't have to read our how to clean wireless earbuds guide. And on a more cheerful note, they're also considerably harder to misplace.\nIs over-ear better than in-ear for noise cancelling?\nThere's not really a simple answer to that one. Some earbuds are very good at passive noise cancellation, which is when the headphones simply block out a lot of external audio by being stuck in your ear canals. But over-ears can do much the same by enclosing your entire ears, so there's huge variation here.\nWhere things generally do differ is when active noise cancellation is involved. That's when your headphones analyze the sound around you and produce additional waves to cancel the sounds you don't want. As with the drivers that can deliver better sound quality, the larger size of over-ears means there's more room for tech in there.\nIn our many hours of testing and casual listening we've found that over-ears such as Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones and Sony's WH-1000XM5 deliver even better noise cancelling than the same firms' best earbuds. And they generally sound better too.\nHow we test the best over-ear headphones\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,400 audio reviews\n\u2611\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe've tested all of the headphones in this guide extensively, without exception, spending countless hours analyzing the sound, fit, design, specs, and value for money \u2013 and comparing them to the competition, of course. We always make sure we're giving you advice that's correct, considered and contextual.\nRunning-in: We allow all headphones a running-in period, to make sure the drivers are working at their best. We listen to audio from a range of sources, including both high-quality and more basic music services, as well as movies, online video, and podcasts or audiobooks. We're looking for all kind of elements here, including how deep the bass can go, whether that bass feels controlled and precise, whether the balance is right between different frequencies, whether the mid-range is able to communicate lots of detailed sound, whether treble frequencies stand out, whether treble is natural or too harsh, how spacious and natural the sound is, how dynamic the headphones between loud and quiet moments, and much more nuance.\nExtra features: We test all additional features in headphones, including spatial audio support or active noise cancellation \u2013 we will test the latter in real-world situations, including public transport and walking around a city.\nSmart functionality: We'll test any smart features, including making sure that multi-point Bluetooth works seamlessly, or testing EQ-changing options and customization of active noise cancellation. We also monitor battery life ourselves, testing the depletion of the battery from full over time.\nPerfect partnering: With wired headphones, we'll use a suitable amp where necessary to make sure they get the chance to perform at their full potential. And of course, we listen to myriad types of audio, including music, podcasts and movies, from various sources including (where connectivity permits) phones, laptops, NAS drives and dedicated hi-res audio players.\nLatest updates to our over-ear headphones guide\nAugust 5, 2025\nSwapped the Shanling HW600 out for the new and recently reviewed Meze Audio Poet, as the best high-end wired set we've tested.

      "text": "Cambridge Audio's affordable earbuds deliver lossless and LDAC through Class AB amps\nSome of my favorite noise-cancelling buds are back with a serious audio upgrade\n- Melomania A100: LDAC and aptX Lossless audio\n- Class AB amplification, Hybrid ANC and 'DynamEQ' smart EQ\n- \u00a3119 / \u20ac139 / $149.99 (about AU$248) \u2013 USA launch price tbc\nI've listened to a lot of earbuds over the years, and some of my favorites come from UK hi-fi brand Cambridge Audio: I owned the company's very first Melomania 1 buds, which punched way above their modest price tag, and I owned (and really rated) their Melomania Touch buds too. So I'm quite excited by the arrival of new Cambridge Audio earbuds with even higher sonic specs.\nThe new buds are the Cambridge Audio Melomania A100, to effectively supersede the already-fantastic Melomania M100 launched in May 2024 \u2013 and they boast a new design, a completely redesigned companion app and some important audio upgrades.\nWant to know just how good they are? You don't even have to wait! We've got a full Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 review ready for you early doors.\nCambridge Audio Melomania A100 earbuds: key features and price\nThe Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 buds have LDAC and aptX Lossless (from compatible phones) for high-quality audio streaming, and they have the same Class AB amplification you'll find in the firm's acclaimed CX and EX Series amplifiers. The amps drive precision-tuned 10mm Neodymium drivers and promise \"deeper bass, richer mids and crystal-clear highs\".\nI'm sure they deliver exactly that: I like the Cambridge Audio sound, which tends to favor clarity over low-end thuggishness and overly harsh highs, and these have been tuned to deliver the same signature sound as the firm's other models.\nThese buds also introduce something Cambridge calls 'DynamEQ', which is designed to subtly enhance the audio as you turn the volume up or down: different frequencies behave differently from one another when volume levels change, so for example bass that's great at high volume can be overpoweringly boomy at lower levels. DynamEQ promises to adjust that for consistent sound at any volume without coloring the audio.\nThere's 11 hours of battery life from the buds alone (6.5 with ANC on and 28 more via the charging case), hybrid ANC and an updated Melomania Connect app you can use to re-map the touch controls and tweak the EQ. Bluetooth is 5.4 with Multipoint. Also, there's a six-mic array for clear voice and video calling.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Cambridge Audio Melomania A100 are available from today (Thursday, June 26) in the UK, Europe and Asia with a price tag of \u00a3119 / \u20ac139 / $149.99 (about AU$248). US pricing and availability will be announced later this year.\nYou might also like\nContributor\nWriter, broadcaster, musician and kitchen gadget obsessive Carrie Marshall has been writing about tech since 1998, contributing sage advice and odd opinions to all kinds of magazines and websites as well as writing more than twenty books.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nLike past Earfun earbuds, the Air Pro 4 have a competitively low price yet offer decent audio quality, a good battery life and a nice minimalist design. There\u2019s a lot to like, but Earfun has stuffed a few too many features in, with a confusing array of EQ presets and ANC modes that overcomplicate matters.\nPros\n- +\nGood value for money\n- +\nLightweight case\n- +\nDecent battery life\nCons\n- -\nConfusing noise cancellation options\n- -\nToo many EQ presets\n- -\nSome audio peaking\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nEarfun Air Pro 4: Two-minute review\nI never thought I\u2019d be knocking a set of good budget earbuds having too many features, or excluding a set of earbuds from our best noise-cancelling earbuds guide for offering too many ANC profiles. But this Earfun Air Pro 4 review changes that.\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard of Earfun before, you\u2019ll know it as a brand well versed in putting out low-cost but competitive earbuds. You'll also know that its naming conventions can be quite baffling.\nThe Air Pro 4 are the successors to 2023\u2019s Air Pro 3 (which we gave a near-perfect review to), and their main difference from the same-priced Free Pro 3 from late 2023 is that they have stems, rather than being purely in-ear beans. They\u2019re also more premium alternatives to the Earfun Air 2, released earlier in 2024, which (like all those other Earfun options) offered some great features at really low prices. But that's a lot of Frees, Airs and graces Pros to get your head around.\nSuffice to say that Earfun has a bustling product suite, perhaps an overwhelming number for people who don\u2019t know which to opt for, and \u2018too much\u2019 is the theme of this review too.\nIn its quest to offer buyers on a budget a wide range of options, Earfun has gone a bit too far, and I found some elements of the experience a little too overwhelming. There are five different ANC modes (not counting \u2018off\u2019 and \u2018ambient\u2019) and I couldn\u2019t get my head around the differences; there are a whopping 30 equalizer presets and scrolling through the list to find the right option for certain songs or genres was more work than it was worth.\nSo testing the Earfun Air Pro 4 was initially a bit exhausting \u2013 until I gave up, and just stuck to the same modes. I think that's what you'll do too. Do that, and you'll reveal great low-budget earbuds that offer loads of options and fairly respectable, robust audio quality for the price. It's just that wading through the extraneous options becomes a little wearying.\nThey feel premium enough too, with a lightweight minimalist design that remains comfortably in the ear, and the case is lovely and small enough to slip into little pockets even though it packs a few premium features like wireless charging.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe sound quality is perfectly acceptable for the price (though if your budget breaches the $/\u00a3100 barrier, you\u2019ll have a few more tempting options) and definitely matches the \u2018cheap\u2019 with the \u2018cheerful\u2019 for most songs.\nI also appreciated how the Earfun Air Pro 4\u2019s battery life outstrips most competitors, with 7.5 hours per bud with ANC on and 11 hours with it off. That\u2019s a fair few songs more than you\u2019ll get on most earbuds in this price bracket.\nSo if you\u2019re happy to ignore a few too many superfluous and potentially confusing features, or are willing to try and get your head around them, then the Earfun Air Pro 4 are good picks for people on a budget. But if not, then the company has loads more options for you \u2013 as do its competitors (more on that later).\nEarfun Air Pro 4 review: Price and release date\n- Unveiled in July 2024\n- Cost $89.99 / \u00a379.99 (roughly AU$140)\nThe Earfun Air Pro 4 were announced right at the end of July 2024, and became available to purchase shortly afterwards. The company sells them in certain regions but also has a global option on its website, listed in USD, which is why we don\u2019t have an AUD price.\nThe buds cost $89.99 / \u00a379.99 (roughly AU$140) which is notably a lower price than the $99.99 / \u00a399.99 (roughly AU$160) Air Pro 3 \u2013 those earbuds got price cuts almost immediately after launch, so it's possible that the Air Pro 4 could too.\nEarfun has a busy line-up of earbuds and the Air Pro 4 slot in just ahead of most of the others in terms of price; the Air Pro 3, Free Pro 3 and Air Pro SV all cost just a small amount less. The company specializes in low-cost earbuds and these new models are no different.\nSo yes, the Earfun Air Pro 4 definitely count as cheap earbuds; they won\u2019t break the bank and that fact helps set expectations with the sound quality and features.\nEarfun Air Pro 4 review: Specs\n| Drivers | 10mm |\n| Active noise cancellation | Yes |\n| Battery life | ANC: 7.5 hours (buds) 35 hours (case) / No ANC: 11 hours (buds) 52 hours (case) |\n| Weight | 56g |\n| Connectivity | Bluetooth 5.4 |\n| Frequency range | 2.402Ghz - 2.480GHz |\n| Waterproofing | IPX5 |\nEarfun Air Pro 4 review: Features\n- Many (many) equalizer presets\n- ANC is good but too many modes\n- Good battery life compared to rivals\nOne of my favorite things about Earfun\u2019s other earbuds is that they often trump the competition in terms of battery life, and that\u2019s certainly the case with the Air Pro 4.\nWith ANC turned on, the buds last for roughly seven and a half hours before you need to return them to the case to power back up; turn ANC off and that figure is even longer at 11 hours. Most same-price rivals go for about 6 and 9 hours respectively, so the Pro 4 is, ahem, Pro-4-ming well here.\nEarfun has said that the case can provide up the 52 hours of music playback between all its charges; the website doesn\u2019t state whether that\u2019s with ANC on or off, but I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s with it off. At an estimate, I\u2019d give you 35 and a half hours of listening time from the case if you only listen with ANC on.\nOn the topic of ANC: it has potential on the Air Pro 4, but an annoying abundance of choice makes it hard for you to make the most of it.\nThe standard ANC is pretty heavy-duty, cutting out annoying background noises to help you enjoy your music without the chattering of keyboards or whine of noisy trains that you\u2019re working on (at least, those are my favorite uses of it!).\nThe thing is, in the app there\u2019s no one noise cancellation mode. Instead, there are seven.\nThese include ambient mode and no ANC (pretty self-explanatory) but five different versions of ANC: strong, balance, AI environment adaptive, AI ear adaptive, and wind noise cancellation. These five all have descriptions about how they\u2019re different but it\u2019s all very vague and I couldn\u2019t hear much of a difference between them, especially the adaptive one. After a few listening sessions of confused testing, I decided just to stick to \u2018strong\u2019 and hope for the best.\nBeyond this confusing ANC situation, the Earfun app offers the basic features that most companion apps do: a few toggle-able features such as wear detection and low-latency mode for gaming, the ability to customize the controls and a \u2018find my headphones\u2019 feature.\nThere\u2019s an equalizer too and I really took to it: you can customize your sound yourself, or rely on a sound profile mode that tests your hearing (I didn\u2019t find this mode quite as accurate or useful as other companies\u2019 equivalents though, like Nothing\u2019s in the Nothing Ear (a) and Nothing Ear). But the best part is the presets: there are 30 in all, and lots of them make marked differences on the sound profile, so it\u2019s useful if you want to tailor your mix to what you\u2019re listening to.\nFrankly, 30 is far too many, and I didn\u2019t want to scroll through a whole list of \u2018Bass Reducer 1, 2 and 3\u2019s in order to find specific ones. Instead I stick to a core 15 based on genres of music, and that seemed enough \u2013 in situations like this, less is definitely more. I\u2019m just surprised that there can be 30 without any for spoken word or podcasts!\n- Features score: 3.5/5\nEarfun Air Pro 4 review: Design\n- AirPods-style stem earbuds\n- Fairly small charging case\n- IPX5 rating against limited showers\nThe Air Pro 4 aren\u2019t the smallest earbuds I\u2019ve ever seen, even within Earfun's lineup, but they\u2019re still pretty slender. The buds weigh roughly 5g each (according to my kitchen scales; no official weight is listed) and consist of an eartip, a small body and an AirPods-style stem.\nThe default tip fit in my ear comfortably and stayed nice and secure through the entire testing process, but Earfun has packed four extra sizes into the box, which is at least one more than you normally see in earbuds \u2013 and two more at this budget level. These range from extra-small to extra-large and I commend Earfun on it.\nEach bud has a small button, which is the round indentation at the top of the stem that you can see in the images. This only required a gentle touch and so I found them easy to use, although there was a noticeable delay between the press and the desired action being triggered.\nThe buds have an IPX5 rating, making them protected from streams of water but not immersion in liquid, so you can wear them in the rain or even in the shower, but not in the bath (or pool).\nKeeping the Air Pro 4 cozy and safe when you\u2019re not using them is their charging case; from product listing images and the size of the box, you\u2019d imagine this would be quite big, but it was a lot smaller than I expected. It weighs 56g (when the buds are in) and measures 62.4 x 46.6 x 29.2mm.\nSaid case, which opens in a clamshell style, has a USB-C port for charging but also supports wireless powering. Despite being a small plastic pebble that\u2019s smaller than the average size of a field mouse, it felt sturdy enough to protect the buds well.\n- Design score: 3.5/5\nEarfun Air Pro 4 review: Sound quality\n- Good sound, rather than great\n- Equalizer gives you customization over sound\n- Several upgrades over predecessor\nIt\u2019s good that the Earfun equalizer is so in depth in letting you customize your music, because in default mode the buds are good, but not great. For the price, they are better than lots of rivals, but you\u2019d definitely get better audio by paying more.\nUnless you boost the treble in the app, it\u2019s a little lacking by default, falling in the mix behind the relatively meaty bass. Mid is also hiding in the back, but I found it susceptible to peaking and distortion at times, with instruments like hi-hats and acoustic guitars getting mushy.\nHowever once you turn to the equalizer, and push the music to its limits, you can get a lot more legroom for enjoying your music. Bass, which is already pretty meaty by default, can gain even more prominence, though it\u2019ll never turn as forceful as on something like the Nothing Buds.\nI enjoyed rescuing the treble, with certain presets pulling it further forward, and the mid to a certain extent \u2013 though this put both at higher risk of peaking in songs. And while the presets let you play around with how the different sounds interact, I rarely felt that sounds found energetic.\nA few additions to the Air Pro 4 over the Pro 3 is support for a new audio codic, LDAC, allowing for 24-bit/96kbps streaming from supported files or apps, as well as Bluetooth 5.4 for a more reliable connection. This offsets what might, on paper, look like a downgrade in the driver size to 10mm from 11mm.\n- Sound quality: 3.5/5\nEarfun Air Pro 4 review: Value\n- Good feature set for price\n- More cash will get you better audio\nIf you know low-cost earbuds, you\u2019ll know that Earfun always gives you good value for money, and that\u2019s no different here.\nThe Air Pro 4 give you decent music quality, a long-lasting battery and admirable noise cancellation, and the only thing more slender than the easily-pocketable charging case is the price.\nSure, the Earfun Air Pro 4 isn\u2019t quite as feature-packed as some of the biggest names on the market, but it also costs a third of its big Bose, Apple and Samsung alternatives.\n- Value: 4/5\nShould I buy the Earfun Air Pro 4?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Features | The Earfun have the feature set you'd expect, but with too many extras complicating matters | 3.5/5 |\n| Design | A fairly standard design with a useful button but limited IP rating | 3.5/5 |\n| Sound quality | Fine sound for the price with the equalizer saving matters. | 3.5/5 |\n| Value | You're getting a good range of features and sound quality for what you're paying. | 4/5 |\nBuy them if\u2026\nYou don't want to pay much\nEarfun can be relied upon to offer good-value earbuds for people on a budget, and that's no different for the Air Pro 4.\nOther buds' battery lives seem limited\nIf you (understandably) find most earbuds these days to have really limited battery lives, you'll find the Air Pro 4 a nice palate-cleanser.\nDon\u2019t buy them if\u2026\nYou don't like fiddling in settings menus\nWhich ANC option should you pick? Which equalizer preset should you select? How should you configure your touch settings? If you can't be bothered to keep fiddling with these options, the Earfuns aren't for you.\nYou need ANC\nIf noise cancellation seems like an optional feature for you, then the Air 2 are pretty similar, but cost less and don't come with ANC.\nEarfun Air Pro 4 review: Also consider\n| Earfun Air Pro 4 | Nothing Ear (a) | Sony WF-C700N | Earfun Air 2 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Price | $89.99 / \u00a379.99 / Approx.

I mainly used them connected to my Android phone, but also paired them to my Windows laptop and iPad during testing.\nThe listening for this review was done at home, in the office, at the gym, on walks around my neighborhood and also on a couple of long train journeys, so their ANC was really put to the test. I listened to music, podcasts and audio books on Spotify and also watched YouTube videos, streamed Netflix movies, caught lots of the Olympics on Discovery Plus and partook in phone and video calls, all using the buds.\nI've been testing gadgets at TechRadar for over five years now, and in that time have used plenty of budget earbuds including previous Earfun options.\n- First reviewed in August 2024\nTom Bedford joined TechRadar in early 2019 as a staff writer, and left the team as deputy phones editor in late 2022 to work for entertainment site (and TR sister-site) What To Watch.

Otherwise, read on to find out our top picks for every budget, from affordable picks to luxury audio investments.\nWhy you can trust TechRadar's choices\n\u2b63 Read more\nWe've tested all of the headphones you'll find here ourselves, along with dozens of options among the competition. The decisions we make about what makes this page and what doesn't are based on real-world comparison testing, balancing everyone from the effectiveness of the active noise cancellation, to the price, to the fit and comfort in the real world.\nI lead our audio reviews team, and I put together this guide in conversation with our team of expert reviewers and editors.\nI've reviewed over 150 audio products since becoming a tech journalist, ranging from super-budget earbuds to high-end Hi-Res Audio music players. Before joining TechRadar, I spent three years at What Hi-Fi? testing everything the world of audio had to offer; before that, I was a professional dancer. I've tested noise cancelling headphones of all stripes in all kinds of conditions, from trains to offices to planes.\nI work with writers who know the audio world inside and out, and can pick up on the nuances that might make the difference to what I've chosen for this guide. After all, there are hundreds of very similar headphones out there, so the difference between being in this guide and not might be a matter of a few degrees.\nKnow that this list hasn't been based on guesses or user reviews \u2013 it 100% comes from real-world experience, testing how the noise cancellation here holds up against actual conditions rather than simulations.

We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best noise cancelling headphones overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great sound and ANC in one: Most headphones make you choose, but these excel at both.\n\u2705 You work from home: ANC headphones are amazing for travel and commuting too, but they're our top pick for a cocoon of silence while you work.\n\u274c You want gym or beach headphones: They\u2019re not water-resistant and although you could wear them to the gym, the fit isn\u2019t ideal for workouts.\n\u274c You take lots of calls: Call quality isn\u2019t bad but it's not exactly class-leading either.\nThe Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones deliver strong noise cancellation and rich sound quality in a lightweight, comfortable design. Sony has since released the newer Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones at #3 in this list, which are a solid upgrade in almost every way.\nBut we still recommend the XM4 for most people because they're now available for around $229 / \u00a3199 very regularly. They're packed with great features, including multipoint pairing, DSEE Extreme upscaling, conversational awareness, and auto-play/pause. This combination of price, features and quality means they still make the most sense for a lot of people today.\nThey also tick all of the major boxes when it comes to what you should be looking for from a good pair of wireless noise cancelling headphones. They can be beaten in any particular category \u2013 the quality of the active noise cancellation, sound quality, features \u2013 but not in every category at the same price.\nThey deliver all-round satisfaction in every area, and most importantly we have no complaints about the sound. In our tests we listened to Janelle Monae\u2019s absolute banger Make Me Feel. It sounded supremely powerful on the WH-1000XM4 headphones, from the bop of the percussion to the wall of sound that accompanies the pre-chorus.\nOn top of all this, the Sony WH-1000XM4s support Sony\u2019s 360 Reality Audio format that enables spatial audio, plus the LDAC codec that can support CD-quality audio from compatible phones. It's a shame there's no aptX support, and you'll get better battery life from the Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 at #5 in this list.\nThe Sony WH-1000XM6 and newer Bose headphones (see #6 in this list) beat it for sound quality. But those are generally all notably more expensive than this model, especially during sales events, where the XM4s are almost always available for bargain prices.\nRead our full Sony WH-1000XM4 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | Refined and subtle design. Mostly durable and comfortable to wear for long listening sessions. | 4/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | Still excellent ANC several years after launch. Not best-in-class but a fantastic almost-silence for most people. | 4/5 |\nSound quality | Warm and balanced, clear and powerful bass. Support for 360 Reality Audio for spatial audio. | 5/5 |\nBattery life | No improvement on previous version in terms of battery life, but still solid at 30 hours. | 4/5 |\nThe best budget noise cancelling headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want solid ANC: All of the models in this guide do ANC well. But here it's much better than expected for the price, with a handy passthrough mode.\n\u2705 You\u2019re on a budget: At $89 / \u00a399 / AU$130 (but often less), they\u2019re sleek and affordable.\n\u274c You want top-tier audio: There's good sound for the price here, but not premium audiophile quality.\n\u274c You want a premium build: They look nice but do feel plasticky and a bit flimsy.\nThe 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 over-ear headphones prove you can get great ANC for under $100/\u00a3100. That\u2019s why they\u2019re our top pick if you're on a budget but still want immersive sound \u2013 and a way to drown out the world while you're at it.\nAs you'd expect at this price point, the ANC isn\u2019t best-in-class, but it\u2019s solid and a noticeable upgrade from previous 1More models. There are three noise-cancelling modes, which you can toggle in the 1More app \u2013 where you\u2019ll also find EQ presets and an option to activate hi-res streaming. With ANC switched off, you\u2019ll get an impressive 100 hours of battery life. But let\u2019s be real, if you\u2019re here for the ANC, expect around 65 hours, which is still good for the category.\nThese aren\u2019t the best noise-cancelling headphones money can buy, but at this price, they deliver a surprisingly strong experience. The sound isn\u2019t high-end audiophile territory, but in our tests, we were impressed by the clarity across tracks and the rich, punchy bass \u2013 courtesy of the Sonoflow\u2019s dual 40mm drivers. There\u2019s support for Sony\u2019s LDAC hi-res audio format too, though you\u2019ll need a compatible device and hi-res audio content to make the most of it.\nDesign-wise, they\u2019re simple but sleek, with a matte-like finish to the plastic casing. The ear cups are soft and adjustable, making them comfy to wear, and they\u2019re lightweight at just 246g. Physical buttons on the earcups handle controls, but they do feel a little plasticky, and the build overall lacks durability \u2013 there's no water or dustproofing here. That said, the included hard carry case is a nice touch, and the sturdy folding hinges make them ideal for travel.\nIn short, the 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 headphones are great value for money. We rated the battery life and comfort highly, especially given the price. They feel more premium than they should, thanks to the sleek finish, decent ANC, and that solid carry case. Sure, there are better headphones out there, but not at this price.\nRead our full 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | A simple design that looks more premium than it should. Very comfortable to wear, but feels a little flimsy. | 3.5/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | The ANC isn't best-in-class but it is very impressive considering how cheap these over-ears are. | 4/5 |\nSound quality | Not high-end sound, but great considering they're affordable with some fun EQ presets and both wired and LDAC listening. | 4/5 |\nBattery life | Excellent battery life of up to 100 hours, you'll still hit 65 hours with ANC on. | 4.5/5 |\nThe best premium noise cancelling headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want incredible ANC: Sure, all of the models here do ANC well, but this is Sony's best effort. They block out traffic, trains, even vacuums with ease.\n\u2705 You want top-tier features: Adaptive ANC, hi-res streaming, EQ tweaks and more via the app.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: Although you may sometimes find them for less, at $450/\u00a3400, they\u2019re pricey \u2013 cheaper models offer plenty.\n\u274c You want huge battery life: Look, 30 hours is fine, but rivals can double that and some.\nSony\u2019s WH-1000XM6 headphones represent a new high point in the brand\u2019s flagship noise-cancelling line. Fusing the convenient folding design of the Sony WH-1000XM4 with the sleeker looks of the WH-1000XM5, this latest release brings improved noise cancelling, sharper sound, and refined design into one sleek package. Sony claims they\u2019re \u201cbetter in every way\u201d and we're happy to say that\u2019s not just hype.\nYou get a full suite of features here, but it\u2019s the ANC that steals the show. With 12 mics powered by the QN3 processor, these headphones create a near-silent cocoon even on the noisiest train and airplane rides. In our comparison tests, they were slightly better than the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in this respect, which is no small feat.\nBattery life sits at 30 hours, which is distinctly average \u2013 although fast charging helps, and three minutes plugged in gives you three hours of listening time. You can also use Bluetooth while charging now, which is nice. The companion app is well-designed and feature-packed, offering EQ adjustments, adaptive sound, and high-res audio support via LDAC, which DSEE Extreme upscaling of lower-quality streams to make them sound better.\nAudio quality is another major win. The 30mm drivers deliver an expressive, balanced profile with rich mids, lively treble, and a satisfying low end. The soundstage feels wide and nuanced \u2013 great for both casual listening and critical tracks. Call quality is also excellent, with all those mics pulling double duty for voice clarity.\nComfort is clearly a priority, too. They\u2019re lightweight with a more ergonomic fit and a wider headband. The hinges feel more robust, and the styling is even more polished than before. The case is also smaller.\nThe WH-1000XM6 headphones are undeniably pricey, with a cost that climbs above previous models. But for the combination of high-end sound, unbeatable ANC, and thoughtful design improvements, they easily justify their premium price tag.\nRead our full Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | They're a little on the bulky side, but the fold up well and feel great to wear. | 4.5/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | Truly best-in-class ANC here from Sony, expect near silence. | 5/5 |\nSound quality | Bold, dynamic sound with more customization options than ever before. | 4.5/5 |\nBattery life | Only average battery life these days at 30 hours \u2013 though charging while using is a nice touch. | 3.5/5 |\nThe best mid range noise cancelling headphones\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want ANC on a budget: You get Sony's strong noise reduction here for a great value price.\n\u2705 You care about balanced sound: Detailed, well-tuned audio that punches above its class.\n\u274c You want total silence: ANC is good here, especially at this price point, but not absolute.\n\u274c You need hi-res audio: No hi-res support here I'm afraid, you'll need to look elsewhere.\nThe Sony WH-CH720N strike a great balance between price and performance, bringing active noise cancellation that reduces outside noise significantly so you can hear your music (or podcast, or whatever) more distinctly, while also giving you Sony's usual excellently balanced sound.\nOkay, for around half the price of the Sony WH-1000XM4 at #1 in our list, you're obviously losing some quality \u2013 they're not miracle workers. The active noise cancellation leaks in notably more sound in the low end (which is generally where it's most effective) as well as higher-end noises, so it's more that it reduces the volume of outside sounds than really creates that bubble of silence. On a plane, we found that we had to turn the volume up to 60% to hear soft conversation in a movie \u2013 but at least we could hear it at all. And in a less harsh circumstance than trying to watch a movie on a plane, we found that it definitely means you don't have to turn the volume up as loud when walking in the traffic of a city, for example.\nSimilarly, the sound quality has less rich bass and layered mids and treble than the WH-1000XM4, but as mentioned before, it's extremely well tuned for the dynamic range it has, so your music really sounds as it should. It has absolutely no problems with detail, serving up plenty of sharpness and clarity when needed. It just feels a little boxed in compared to the broader soundstage of more expensive headphones.\nThere's no support for LDAC here, which some mid-range competitors do have (or they offer aptX instead), but there's multipoint Bluetooth for easy switching between two devices, and a 3.5mm jack for wired audio when needed. These are also very light, and so are generally very comfortable to wear for long periods.\nRead our full Sony WH-CH720N review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | The design is light and comfortable for long listening sessions, with easy to use buttons. Don't expect a premium feel, however. | 4/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | Not the best ANC in the list, but great value \u2013 you won't be disappointed at this price. | 3.5/5 |\nSound quality | Great balance to the audio here and it's packed with detail \u2013 expect a very enjoyable. But it can feel a little compressed. | 4/5 |\nBattery life | Expect an impressive 35 hours here, not the best but better than more expensive rivals in this list. | 4/5 |\nThe best noise cancelling headphones for battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You like unusual specs: Class AB amplification is rare in wireless cans.\n\u2705 You travel long-haul: Battery life is the star of the show here and it easily covers lengthy flights.\n\u274c You want best-in-class ANC: Like all of the picks in this list, ANC is good, but not the strongest out there.\n\u274c You pack light: Their bulky case takes up quite a bit of space in your bag compared to rivals.\nThe reason these headphones are our top pick for battery life is they last an incredible 100 hours. Yes, you read that right. Although that's without ANC and we assume if you're reading this guide you absolutely need noise cancelling. In that case, you'll get 60 hours from them, which is still incredibly impressive compared to rivals.\nWe were extremely impressed by the sound quality of the Cambridge Audio Melomania P100, praising their \"lively, detailed and confident presentation\". You'll get the best experience from them with 16bit/44.1kHz FLAC files from the likes of Qobuz or Tidal. But, as we wrote in our review, \"they don\u2019t judge \u2013 give them what you\u2019ve got and they\u2019ll do their best with it.\"\nDuring our testing we were also impressed by the different customization options on offer here, like the effective seven band EQ. Noise cancelling is impressive \u2013 and most people will love the experience here \u2013 but it's worth mentioning you will find better and more immersive ANC elsewhere in this list. What you get from these Cambridge Audio over-ears is very good, but not great.\nDesign-wise, these headphones tick all of the boxes. In our review we wrote: \"They look, and feel, like a reasonably upmarket pair of wireless over-ear headphones.\" The earpads are detachable and made from a nice mix of vegan leather and memory foam. While the headband is padded on the inside. The overall package is 330g, which is pretty standard and makes them comfortable to wear. The only downside when it comes to design is they don't fold up small, so if you're using them to travel bear in mind their case will take up a lot of space.\nA year after launch, Cambridge Melomania has launched a Special Edition of the P100 headphones. For an extra $20 / \u00a320, you get a blue finish, a slightly cushier headband and a DynamEQ toggle. We tested them and we liked them. But if you already have a pair of P100s, they\u2019re definitely not worthy of an upgrade. If, however, you're considering a new pair of wireless headphones and have yet to be introduced to Cambridge, we can thoroughly recommend the new Special Edition set \u2013 because they're an awful lot like the older pair.\nRead our full Cambridge Audio Melomania P100 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | A very well built and comfortable pair of headphones. The only downside is the case is a little too big. | 4.5/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | We'd describe the ANC here as \"very good\" instead of great, but it'll still suit most people perfectly. | 4/5 |\nSound quality | Some of the best-sounding headphones overall. Expect a lovely tonal balance, packed with detail and energy. | 4.5/5 |\nBattery life | Great battery life at up to 100 hours, which makes them a top choice for long journeys. | 5/5 |\nThe best noise cancelling headphones for Bose fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You care about sound quality: We might be most focused on ANC here, but expect rich, dynamic audio with wireless convenience too.\n\u2705 You need comfort and a travel-friendly design: These cans are light, incredibly comfy and foldable.\n\u274c You want full hi-res support: No aptX or USB hi-res here, you'll just get Snapdragon Sound or go wired.\n\u274c You need marathon battery life: 24 hours is okay, but it can\u2019t compete with rivals that now offer 60+ hours.\nIf you're a big Bose fan and you want the best option from the company that literally originated active noise cancellation, then the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are the cream of the crop. And not only that, the near-silent ANC here is combined with easily Bose's best sound quality to date, which we called \"electrifying\" in our full review.\nThese are not cheap headphones (though they're less expensive than the Dali option in this list, and in practice you'll often find them cheaper than the Sony XM6), but as our review also says \"from the moment you start using them, they feel worth every penny.\" If you're looking to save some money, however, be sure to check out our Bose discount codes.\nWe tested them in as many different noisy environments as we could manage, ranging from international flights, to local buses, to walking around a busy city, to in the TechRadar office and at home. In all cases, they stamp down on sound incredibly effectively. If what you want is silence and focus, we cannot recommend these strongly enough. One thing we will say, though, is that the cheaper Bose QuietComfort Headphones are basically as good for this element, but aren't as good for sound.\nAs we've already said, the music quality is just fantastic in these headphones, even with noise cancellation turned on \u2013 a clear cut above the sound from Bose's other headphones. Our review said that they \"deliver some of the most alive, exciting, textured, finely resolved, deeply engaging music I've ever heard from a pair of wireless headphones.\"\nThere are two somewhat disappointing aspects to them, though: the 24-hour battery life is below average (you get 30 hours pretty typically, including from Sony's headphones, while you get 60 hours from the Cambridge Melomania P100 at #5 on this list); and they only support Snapdragon Sound for higher-quality audio. There's no regular aptX or LDAC support, and there's no USB-C audio input for fully Hi-Res Audio, which you get from other options here, such as the Sonos Ace.\nIf these don't sound like dealbreakers, then know that the Bose Ultra really live up to their name. We should mention, however, that if you like the sound of Bose over-ears but can't quite justify the price, it might be worth reading our Bose QuietComfort Headphones review, which are the less expensive sibling to these headphones. They're not as refined as the Ultras, which are in upgrade in almost every way, but they still provide impeccable ANC in a comfortable package.\nRead our full Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | Incredibly comfortable with a premium build and a handy folding design. | 5/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | Nearly best-in-class ANC \u2013 only the Sony XM6 do it slightly better. | 5/5 |\nSound quality | Rich sound with detailed bass. The dynamism here is also astounding. Expect a fantastic, energetic listen. | 5/5 |\nBattery life | Only a 24 hour battery life, which isn't necessarily terrible, but is weak compared to rivals. | 2.5/5 |\nThe best noise cancelling headphones for Apple fans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a huge fan of Apple products: If you already have an iPhone and love Apple's minimal design, they're well worth the expense.\n\u2705 You like a premium look, feel and sound: They're Apple headphones, they look, feel and sound amazing, as you'd expect.\n\u274c You've got an Android phone: Look elsewhere if you haven't got an iPhone, you can find something cheaper.\n\u274c You want a portable pick: They come with a carry case that is almost laughably bad and certainly won't offer any protection.\nThe Apple AirPods Max come with elite active noise cancellation, superb audio quality and a striking design that makes them instantly recognizable and that feels immensely high-quality. During our testing, we were truly impressed by these headphones, but you have to pair a hefty price to get there, which is why they\u2019re our top pick for Apple fans only.\nTheir sound is immensely expansive, natural and rich, and they offer easily the most impressive spatial audio 3D sound support of any headphones when used with an Apple device. Watching a Dolby Atmos movie with these headphones feels stunningly close to sitting in a speaker system rather than sandwiched between two headphones drivers, with the sound removed from your ears and convincingly placed in the room around you, all aligned to the screen you're watching on.\nAnd music, whether in Dolby Atmos or not, is layered, meticulously clear, crisply defined, and effortless. The active noise cancellation remains among the top-tier too, despite their age now.\nSpeaking of which, their still-high price isn't aging well. The Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones at #3 in this list sound at least as good, with even better noise cancellation. For Android users, they're also not worth it. But their Apple-specific features mean they're still commendable for those with lots of the company's devices.\nAside from the spatial audio sound, they auto-switch between any number of devices, they have Find My support, they can share audio with other AirPods, and you can personalize the sound.\nWe\u2019ve been expecting Apple to announce the Apple AirPods Max 2 for some time. But the company has updated the AirPods Max in the meantime, including several new colors (Midnight, Purple, Orange, Starlight and Blue), as well as a more recent USB-C lossless audio upgrade \u2013 so at least you can finally listen to Apple Music at full quality from recent iPhones and other devices if you don't mind using a cable.\nRead our full Apple AirPods Max review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | Distinctive, bold and comfortable. Some people report a strong clamping force and we don't like the case. | 4/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | Noise cancellation is really impressive here. Perhaps not as good as Bose and Sony, but up there. | 4.5/5 |\nSound quality | Exceptional audio performance. Even a few years after launch, this is some of the best spatial audio around. | 5/5 |\nBattery life | Enough battery life for most people, but you can do much better these days. | 3.5/5 |\nThe best noise cancelling headphones for sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want detailed sound: Expect clear, insightful audio here with little to fault.\n\u2705 You like luxury design: They might be our top pick for sound, but they have a premium build and finish to match the price tag.\n\u274c You\u2019re vegan: Unfortunately, real leather makes them less inclusive.\n\u274c You want full EQ control: You get just two presets here and no app-based tweaking.\nIf you're looking for sonic excellence, you may find it in the Dali IO-8 headphones. In our review, we struggled to find anything to criticize when it came to the way these lovely-looking headphones sound. The audio on offer here is directful, insightful and an absolute joy to listen to. During testing, we noted that this remarkable detail retrieval and full expression didn't impact the bigger picture with a large and persuasive soundstage. We wrote: \"The Dali create a large overall image, and it\u2019s only when you peer closely at it that you realise just how alive with detail it is.\" This audio is only made more immersive, more fun, by noise-cancelling, which we rated as \"very good\" in our review, meaning it can be bested but only by a select few, like the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones at #3 in this list.\nAs well as sounding fantastic, the Dali IO-8 headphones look the part. They have a premium build and finish with a distinctive design thanks to perfectly circular cups. The earpads are incredibly comfortable thanks to memory foam lining the interior and there's a handy adjustment mechanism to get the perfect fit. The only design downside is these aren't vegan-friendly. Yes, leather may signal luxury to some but we'd bet most people would prefer a version without it.\nThere's a solid 35 hours of battery life onboard. But if you're the type of person that forgets to charge your tech (we get it), then you'll also be happy to hear the Dali IO-8 can work as passive wired headphones, too. The only notable omission here is there's no control app and only two EQ settings. You could argue that most people shouldn't be messing around with the sound here anyway \u2013 we didn't feel like we needed to during testing \u2013 but some people might want more freedom in that respect.\nOf course, these over-ears aren't cheap. But that doesn't mean they aren't excellent value considering the audio quality on offer here. In fact, the features, feel, look and sound of the Dali IO-8 headphones are all well up to the standard of the asking price.\nRead our full Dali IO-8 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | A high standard of build and design. Comes in two different colorways with real leather contact points. | 4.5/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | Fantastic ANC on offer here. Not as good as Bose, but still very, very good. | 4.5/5 |\nSound quality | Nothing negative to say about the sound. It's detailed and expansive, with dynamic presentation and great low-end expression. | 5/5 |\nBattery life | A solid amount of battery here for most people. And if they run flat? They can be used passively, too. | 4/5 |\nThe best noise cancelling headphones for design\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want premium design: They're our top design pick for a reason, their luxurious build and finish feel very high-end.\n\u2705 You\u2019ll wear them out and about: They're got a slimmer profile compared to their predecessors, which makes them less bulky to wear in public.\n\u274c You want extra features: There's no fancy health tracking or touch controls here.\n\u274c You live in a windy place: Wind noise can be an issue. That's not a deal-breaker, but if you plan to wear them outdoors it could be.\nBowers & Wilkins has always excelled in balancing sound and style. The newest Px7 S3 over-ears are no exception and they might be one of the brand\u2019s best offerings yet. They\u2019re not the cheapest option and don\u2019t quite silence the world as completely as Sony or Bose does. But when it comes to a premium level of design and build with solid ANC, they\u2019re at a whole new level.\nFor starters, the Px7 S3 sound stunning. In our review, we called the sound \u201cbalanced, entertaining and thoroughly convincing,\u201d and we stand by it. The newly reworked internals \u2013 redesigned suspension, upgraded magnets, and a dedicated headphone amp \u2013 deliver an experience that\u2019s open, expressive, and remarkably detailed.\nDesign-wise, Bowers & Wilkins has taken what was already premium about its previous headphones and made these even more refined. The Px7 S3\u2019s slimmer design means you\u2019ll no longer feel like your head looks huge when you wear them outside. And the pleather-covered memory foam padding makes long sessions blissfully comfortable. The fabric-wrapped finish and precision build still ooze quality. And yes, they look expensive, because they are.\nBut although these headphones are our top pick for style and design, Bowers & Wilkins manages to marry luxury with genuine tech improvements. Bluetooth 5.3, aptX Lossless, multipoint pairing, and 30 hours of battery life make them more than just a pretty face. Noise-cancellation has had a serious upgrade, too. And while it won\u2019t leave Bose engineers sweating, it\u2019s impressive by everyone else\u2019s standards.\nThere are a few trade-offs. Controls are still a bit limited and wind noise can get through if you\u2019re caught in a gust. But these are minor gripes in a package that\u2019s otherwise impressively complete. At their price ($TBC / \u00a3399 / AU$699 (approx.), they\u2019re quite niche. But if you care about solid ANC, sound, comfort, and headphones that feel like an object of desire rather than just another gadget, the Px7 S3 are hard to beat. Pound for pound, we think they're Bowers & Wilkins\u2019 best headphone effort yet \u2013 and that's not a statement we make lightly.\nRead our full Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S3 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | Superb level of finish and design. A slim, redesigned headband. Comfortable fit and feel. | 5/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | Excellent level of ANC. Only really bettered by Bose, otherwise it's fantastic. | 5/5 |\nSound quality | Solid tonal balance delivers an entertaining and thoroughly convincing sound. | 5/5 |\nBattery life | Battery life is pretty solid. Not the best, but 30 hours including the ANC is what you'd expert from such a good-sounding, feature-rich pick. | 4.5/5 |\nBest for smaller heads\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You like bold sound: Expect big, full-bodied audio here that isn\u2019t shy.\n\u2705 You want touch controls: They're well-implemented here, and a step up from the standard Accentum model.\n\u274c You want total precision: There's fun sound on offer here, but not ultra-accurate fidelity.\n\u274c You have a larger head: They're our top pick for smaller heads for a reason. The snug design may feel too tight.\nSennheiser's February 2024-issue over-ears sit nicely between the company's entry-level Accentum and flagship Momentum 4 Wireless. If you're unsure which of those are right for you, allow us to tell you that sonically and for active noise cancellation, the Accentum Plus headphones represent excellent value for money. They also have a design that we think will suit those with smaller heads, though they're worth considering for anyone looking for a mid-range pair of ANC headphones that punch about their weight.\nThat said, while the build here is classy and expertly finished, these are hardly 'look at me!' headphones and if you're spending step-up money, you may have wanted a step up in terms of aesthetics, too. But you certainly get a step up in features, including aptX compatibility, a whopping 50 hours of battery life (which is masses of stamina for ANC cans) and a 3.5mm jack for wired listening. Considering we loved their more expensive siblings when we reviewed them, this is very very good news.\nWe enjoyed the sound on offer here. Now, it's worth saying from the get go they're not the most neutral-sounding headphones you'll find, don't expect precision. But there's no denying that they produce big and bold sound. Whether that's for you or not will be all down to personal preference.\nAre there any issues to mention? Well, that depends. Some of us often struggle to find over-ears that don't fall off or head down to the back of our crown at their earliest convenience. That won't happen here. In fact, if your skull is on the smaller side you will love these. That's why they enter this guide specifically for their smaller design. Of course, that does mean if your head is on the larger side you're likely to find the clamping force just a little heavy here.\nRead our full Sennheiser Accentum Plus review\nVisit our Sennheiser coupon page for our latest deals and discounts.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | A nice design and decent build with small enhancements over the previous version. The clamping force can be a bit snug though. | 4.5/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | The noise-cancellation is good here. Not as good as other options, but most people will be happy with the level of noise-silencing here. | 4.5/5 |\nSound quality | An all-round assertive and bold listen. Although frequency balance skews towards the lower end. | 4.5/5 |\nBattery life | An impressive 50 hours of battery life. Some options do it better these days, but this is better than average. | 4/5 |\nThe best noise cancelling headphones for movies\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You love Dolby Atmos movies: You'll get cinematic, powerful sound here without shaking the house.\n\u2705 You want hi-res options: You'll get aptX Adaptive, Snapdragon Sound, and USB-C lossless support.\n\u274c You want the best music detail: They're excellent in some ways, but fall short of rivals for expansive, expressive sound.\n\u274c You wear glasses: Unfortunately we found that, during testing, they may be uncomfortable for long listening sessions.\nSonos' very premium headphones come with some very premium features that have earned them their place on this list. Especially their highly effective noise cancellation, and their superb head-tracked spatial audio. The Sonos Ace deliver the best sound balance for watching movies, based on our testing that directly compared them with the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones and the AirPods Max. And they do this over Bluetooth from any source that decodes Dolby Atmos, or using a special connection to Sonos soundbars.\nWith movies, we found that the sound mix on the Sonos Ace allows speech to come through really clearly, while still providing plenty of power for bassy elements, such as explosions. But everything stays in its own lane \u2013 the bass power doesn't overwhelm other aspects. And the feeling of surround sound is really strong, with elements moving around the room around your head convincingly. Tied to that, the head-tracking is accurate and lag-free.\nThe fact that there's a button to instantly switch from listening via Bluetooth to the Sonos soundbar connection makes it really convenient as well \u2013 just grab and instantly to your TV to watch movies or play games with really dynamic and big sound, without disturbing anyone else (or being disturbed by them, thanks to the ANC). The only thing to note is that the 30 hours of battery life over Bluetooth drops to around just 10 hours (based on our measurements) when connected to a Sonos soundbar.\nBeyond this, the Sonos Ace are very well-featured headphones, packing in lossless Hi-Res Audio over USB-C, aptX Adaptive for CD-quality wireless audio, and a transparency mode (that's very transparent, a little too much in our opinion). The design feels very very premium and is generally extremely comfortable, though we found that glasses wearers had a harder time than others.\nHowever, the music playback quality isn't quite where it needs to be, considering the high price. It's very good, but it should be amazing. The noise cancellation is also weaker than the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones at #3 in this list, though is better than almost anything else. So, as the ranking in this guide suggests, we'd steer most people towards the Sony XM6s.\nBut if movies are a particular priority, the Ace are worth serious consideration. Especially as Sonos recently rolled out some long-awaited free upgrades to the Ace headphones. TV Audio Swap, which allows you to wirelessly send audio from a Sonos soundbar to the Ace headphones, now supports two pairs of headphones at once, so two people can watch together without waking the house.\nA feature called 'TrueCinema' creates an even more immersive, spatial audio experience by matching the sound of the virtual space to the acoustics of your room, so it feels more natural. There are also some ANC enhancements, which promise to noise-cancelling here more effective and SideTone, a feature that makes phone calls sound more natural when noise cancellation is enabled.\nRead our full Sonos Ace review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nDesign/comfort | They look and feel premium and plush. Some people find them comfortable, others don't get on with the fit for long periods of time. | 3.5/5 |\nActive noise cancellation | The ANC here is very good, but it's weaker than top rivals from Bose and Sony. | 4.5/5 |\nSound quality | Epic, Dolby Atmos movie sound. Although if you just want to listen to music, they're not the best option for you. | 4/5 |\nBattery life | Battery life is good for movies and at-home use, but you'll find much longer options in this list for travel. | 3.5/5 |\nMore noise cancelling headphones we've tested\nAnker Soundcore Space One Pro: These headphones impressed us recently, with full-sounding hi-res audio and solid ANC. But their design is a bit too chunky for our liking, and other options in this guide work better, with buttons we enjoyed using much more. Take a look at our Anker Soundcore Space One Pro review to find out more.\nBaseus Bowie 30 Max: These headphones deliver great head-tracked spatial audio and acceptable ANC for the money, but the audio sounded a little too tinny at times. Take a look at our Baseus Bowie 30 Max review for more.\nBeyerdynamic Aventho 300: These over-ears are excellent all-rounders. Take a look at our Beyerdynamic Aventho 300 review to see they serve up great sound, solid ANC and impressive customization options. We particularly rate them for their EQ settings, which bring you a high level of flexibility through the app \u2013 but in terms of overall value, they just couldn't quite push out the competition here.\nBose QuietComfort Headphones: These Bose over-ears are an excellent pick. Solid ANC, supreme comfort and good audio. So why aren't they in this list? Well, we prefer the sound signature of the Sony XM4, and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are an upgrade in almost every way. However, these are getting some really good deals these days, and the noise cancellation is fantastic for the price, so do take a look at our Bose QuietComfort Headphones review.\nCreative Zen Hybrid SXFI: We'd also recommend you take a look at our Creative Zen Hybrid SXFI review. As a set of headphones, they're gifted in several ways, including with great spatial audio, but noise cancellation (although listed on the spec sheet) isn't one of them.\nEarfun Tune Pro: They're affordable and offer a very long 120 hours of listening. But they don\u2019t have much else going for them. As you\u2019ll see in our Earfun Tune Pro review, they fall at two of the most important hurdles when it comes to finding a solid pair of ANC headphones: they don\u2019t sound up to standard and weren\u2019t comfortable to wear during our testing either.\nEarfun Wave Life: Unlike the Tune Pro above, these over-ears from Earfun are exceptionally comfortable. They also deliver strong sound, especially considering how cheap they are. But ultimately, they can't be included in this guide because the ANC was underwhelming. Find out more in our full Earfun Wave Life review.\nFocal Bathys MG: Well, this is one stunning pair of headphones, there's no doubt about it. They're built from premium materials and flawlessly finished. Sound is also expansive and detailed. But ANC is just average. Which doesn't quite fit with the rest of the package and the asking price. Though if looks matter more than noise-cancelling, do read our full Focal Bathys MG review.\nHappy Plugs Play Pro: They're a nice pair of cans in some respects. You get a very comfortable wear and fantastic battery life \u2013 bass is booming, too. But where ANC is concerned, they just don't rival other options in this list to be deserving of a spot. Do take a look at our Happy Plugs Play Pro review though, as they might suit you if noise-nixing isn't a priority for you.\nJBL Tour One M3: Expect solid ANC and an audio experience we described as \"upfront and vigorous\" in our JBL Tour One M3 review. You'll also get a good fit and some solid, high-end features. Ultimately, though, they don't sound consistent enough across the range and struggle at higher volumes.\nNobile FoKus Apollo: We recently tested these premium over-ears, but as you'll find in our Noble FoKus Apollo review, although sound, battery life and ANC are all good here, their looks are a little bulky and divisive. We also encountered some mic issues during our testing.\nNothing Headphone (1): Another case of excellent build quality and great smart features but ultimately the whole package is a little underwhelming, at least compared to what we were hoping for and where audio and ANC performance are concerned. They're still a cool proposition though, so do check out our Nothing Headphone (1) review.\nOneOdio Focus A5: If you have a quick glance at our OneOdio Focus A5 review, we wouldn't blame you for thinking it's only bad news for these wireless over-ears. However if you like a true bass-heavy listen and a svelte design, they could still be for you.\nPanasonic RB-M600: These Panasonic headphones are cheap and the battery life is excellent for the money. But as you'll learn in our Panasonic RB-M600 review, there's not much else going for them. The design isn't refined, we didn't rate the ambient mode and there's no water protection.\nSony ULT Wear: Sony launched these headphones as a new mid-tier option, sitting between two products we have in this list: the Sony WH-CH720N and the Sony WH-1000XM5. They're good, but they have a big problem \u2013 the Sony WH-1000XM4, which is number 1 in our list. The XM4 are so often reduced to the same kind of price as the ULT Wear, but offer a finer balance of sound. For us, the bass of the ULT Wear was just a little too overstated, and the call-quality wasn't great \u2013 but you can read an in-depth appraisal of them in our Sony ULT Wear review.\nSony WH-1000XM5: These are squeezed out of this list by the Sony WH-1000MX4 being better value (they're practically as good, and can be notably cheaper) and the Sony WH-1000XM6 being markedly better for ANC. But if you want something from Sony with a sleeker look than the Sony WH-1000XM4 and a few feature upgrades, check out our Sony WH-1000XM5 review, because they're still excellent ANC cans.\nMeet the team\nTechRadar's team of audio tech reviewers has years of experience putting the best headphones to the test.

Below we've collected together some of the most popular and useful ones.\nActive noise cancellation (ANC): A technology that reduces unwanted background noise. It works by using external microphones that can detect ambient sounds. The headphones then generate an opposing soundwave (often called \u2018anti-noise\u2019) to cancel out the background noise, which is mixed into whatever you're listening to. With ANC, you can listen to your audio at lower volumes and with improved clarity, especially in noisy environments, like on planes or in a busy cafe.\naptX: A Bluetooth audio codec designed for higher-quality streaming. aptX comes in different forms, with aptX Adaptive being the most common in newer headphones. It adjusts sound quality based on the strength of your connection. aptX Lossless delivers top-tier, high-resolution audio. There\u2019s also aptX Voice, which enhances call clarity, especially when you're in noisy surroundings.\nAuracast: A new Bluetooth technology that allows for easy, seamless connections without pairing. Auracast enables you to connect your headphones directly to public audio sources, like TVs in bars or announcement systems at airports. Originally developed for hearing aids, it\u2019s expected to become widely supported in upcoming headphone models for its user-friendly approach.\nBluetooth: The wireless technology used by nearly all modern headphones for connecting to devices. Bluetooth supports various audio streaming technologies, including aptX, LDAC, and LHDC. The most widely supported codecs are SBC and AAC, these are found in most wireless earbuds. Bluetooth versions vary, with higher versions like Bluetooth 5.3 and 5.4 offering improved features such as Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast. However, not all headphones with newer Bluetooth versions support these advanced features, so always check product specifications.\nBluetooth LE Audio: A next-generation Bluetooth audio standard, known as LC3, designed to deliver higher-quality sound while consuming less power than previous codecs like SBC or AAC. LE Audio is expected to become more widespread, but right now only a few headphones and devices support it. We expect more models will embrace this enhanced audio standard in the future.\nDolby Atmos: A 3D audio format used in music and movies that creates immersive, spatial sound. Instead of traditional channel-based audio, Dolby Atmos encodes sounds as objects that can be positioned in a virtual 3D space, delivering a listening experience that feels more real and dynamic.\nDrivers: The components responsible for producing sound in headphones, often referred to as mini speakers. Most headphones use dynamic drivers, which function similarly to loudspeakers but are much smaller, ranging from 5mm to 13mm in earbuds and up to 50mm in over-ear headphones. Audiophile-grade headphones may use planar magnetic drivers, which offer greater precision but tend to be more complex to manufacture and are expensive.\nEQ (Equalizer): EQ, short for equalizer, lets you adjust the sound profile of your headphones by boosting or reducing specific frequencies, like bass, mids, and treble. Many modern wireless headphones sync up to an app with preset EQ modes for different genres (like rock, classical, or pop) or manual sliders that allow you to fine-tune the sound yourself. EQs are divided into \"bands,\" with a three-band EQ offering control over bass, midrange, and treble, while a nine-band EQ gives more precise control over a broader frequency range.\nIn-ear: In-ear headphones, also known as earbuds, have tips that sit snugly in your ear canal. You might also see the term \"IEM,\" or \"In-Ear Monitor,\" which refers to high-quality in-ear headphones often used by professionals. IEMs typically offer excellent noise isolation and are designed to deliver superior sound quality.\nFind My: A feature that helps you locate lost headphones through your smartphone. Apple\u2019s version is called Find My and Android users have Find My Device. Some headphones offer their own \"find my\" feature within their apps, but the built-in phone versions are generally more reliable and easier to use.\nHead tracking: An advanced feature in spatial audio-enabled headphones that adds to immersion by detecting head movement. With head tracking, sounds stay in their virtual position, creating the effect of being in a room with speakers, even as you move your head. This technology is used in formats like Dolby Atmos to make the audio experience feel more realistic.\nHi-Res Audio: High-resolution audio (Hi-Res) refers to music files with greater detail and less compression than standard formats, like MP3. These files bring you a more expansive dynamic range and are closer to the original studio recordings. While many headphones are \"Hi-Res Certified,\" this label only ensures they technically meet certain standards, not necessarily high-quality playback. Hi-Res files are larger and typically streamed over Wi-Fi on streaming platforms like Tidal, Qobuz, or Amazon Music HD. Check our our what is Hi-Res Audio guide for a more detailed definition.\nLDAC: A high-quality audio streaming codec from Sony. LDAC enables Bluetooth devices to stream music at higher resolutions than standard codecs like SBC. LDAC is supported across Sony products and is compatible with many Android devices and best portable music players.\nLHDC: Similar to LDAC, LHDC is another high-resolution Bluetooth streaming codec designed to deliver better sound quality. It competes with LDAC and aptX, and is supported on some Android devices.\nLossless: Lossless music retains all the original audio data from a recording, unlike compressed formats like MP3, which lose some detail to reduce file size. Lossless formats, such as FLAC (used by Tidal) and ALAC (used by Apple Music), offer higher-quality sound but take up more storage space.\nMulti-point Bluetooth: Multi-point Bluetooth allows your headphones to connect to two or more devices simultaneously, so you can switch between them without needing to manually disconnect and reconnect. This feature is convenient for multitasking, like taking a call on your phone while staying connected to your laptop.\nNoise isolation: The ability for a pair of headphone to block external sounds passively, without electronic processing. In-ear headphones achieve this by fitting snugly into your ear canal (acting a little like earplugs to reduce outside noise.), while over-ear models create a seal around your ears.\nOn-ear: On-ear headphones rest directly on the outer part of your ear, rather than surrounding it. This design doesn\u2019t isolate sound as effectively as over-ear headphones and some people find it uncomfortable. But others prefer it, and find the fit lighter and more comfortable for long listening sessions.\nOver-ear: Over-ear headphones have large earcups that fully cover your ears, creating a seal for the best noise isolation. This design, especially when combined with active noise cancellation, makes over-ear headphones the best choice for blocking out external sounds and enhancing audio quality.\nPlanar magnetic: A type of driver that offers greater precision and clarity than standard dynamic drivers, making them a favorite among audiophiles. However, they tend to be more expensive and require more power, which often makes headphones using planar magnetic drivers heavier and pricier than average.\nSnapdragon Sound: A suite of wireless technologies designed to enhance audio quality when both your phone and headphones support it. It combines aptX high-quality streaming with features that reduce Bluetooth latency, improve voice call clarity, and boost connection stability. Snapdragon chips, developed by Qualcomm, power many Android devices. For more details, check out our Snapdragon Sound explainer.\nSpatial audio: A broad term for 3D sound technologies that create an immersive listening experience. Apple uses it to describe its integration of Dolby Atmos with head tracking, but other brands also offer similar 3D sound effects using technologies like Dirac Virtuo, DTS. , THX, and Dolby Atmos. The goal is to make audio feel as though it's surrounding you, rather than playing directly in your ears, providing a more cinematic experience, especially when watching movies.\nTransparency mode: A feature that blends ambient sounds with your music, allowing you to stay aware of your surroundings without turning off your audio. It\u2019s ideal for hearing announcements, having conversations, or staying alert to traffic. Various brands have different names for this feature, such as 'Aware Mode,' 'HearThru,' or 'Ambient Mode,' but we often refer to it as \u2018Transparency mode\u2019 for consistency across our guides and reviews.\nUSB-C Audio: Some headphones can play high-resolution digital audio via a USB-C cable connection from a phone or computer, offering superior sound quality compared to Bluetooth. For audiophiles, headphones with both wireless capabilities and USB-C audio support are ideal, providing the convenience of wireless listening and the high fidelity of wired playback when desired.\n3.5mm jack: A standard wired connection for headphones, often found in traditional devices. Not all modern wireless headphones include a 3.5mm jack, so it\u2019s an essential feature to look out for if you prefer or need a wired connection.\nWhat different types of headphones are there?\nShort answer: many! Design is hugely important; a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones needs to be comfortable for long listening sessions \u2013 look out for padded earcups and headbands in materials like memory foam for ultimate comfort and a boost to passive isolation here (it all helps).\nNot a fan of over-ear headphones? Our guide above is dedicated to headphones only; cups that sit over (or on) your ears with a band connecting them that fits over your head. But you can find true wireless earbuds with effective noise cancellation built-in, take a look at our best noise-cancelling earbuds guide instead. We've also got roundups for the best on-ear headphones, the best bone-conduction headphones, the best wired headphones, the best open ear headphones and more, but those generally don't include ANC (although there are exceptions).\nAs with any pair of headphones, the sound quality needs to be good, even if your focus is blocking out the world around you. Here, planar magnetic headphones (it's all to do with the drivers in the earpieces; dynamic ones are cone-shaped, PM ones are flat and controlled by various magnets) can offer a more detailed sound, if done well \u2013 but they often come at a premium, and rarely with ANC.\nThink about what works best for you, so you know what to look for. With so many different noise-cancelling headphones out there, the choice can feel overwhelming if you don't know what's most important to you. But that's why we're here.\nWhat is noise cancellation?\nNoise-cancelling headphones use both analog and electronic methods to block out the environmental sound around you, allowing you to listen to your music in peace without distraction.\nActive noise cancellation technology was originally implemented in a product (a headset for pilots) by Bose over 30 years ago, and the company has remained synonymous with it since. We asked John Rule, Senior Engineer at Bose Corporation, to explain noise cancellation.\n\"Today, noise cancellation in the majority of headphones and earbuds is achieved through a combination of both active and passive technologies. For active noise reduction, sophisticated electronics work with microphones both inside and outside the earcups to sense the sound around you and then measure, compare, and react \u2013 instant by instant \u2013 to produce an opposing cancellation signal,\" says Rule.\nBecause noise is just a signal, it's possible for ANC headphones to analyze the unwanted sound around you, and create an opposite version of that signal, which is then added into the music using clever processing. If done well, this will cancel out those unwanted extra sounds, but leave your music sounding just like you expect it to.\nBose's John Rule emphasizes that it's not just the circuitry doing the work, though. He says, \"Passive noise reduction also plays a role in headphone performance. When you place an earcup over your ear or an earbud in your ear, some noise is physically blocked. The cup or bud design, materials used, clamping force of the headband, shape of the ear tips, and many other factors contribute to a comfortable fit while providing a good seal against incoming noise. When active and passive elements are combined, the result is cancellation of the noise you don\u2019t want to hear, such as a plane engine or annoying vacuum. This lets you hear what you want, whether that\u2019s your music or silence.\"\nIs it worth buying noise cancelling headphones?\nMuch like with any purchase, it depends on how important noise-cancellation is for you. For most people, when wearing headphones, you want to be able to hear what you're listening to and not be distracted by environmental sounds.\nWhile turning up the volume may help a little, a true pair of noise-cancelling headphones are able to filter out unwanted sounds more effectively without reducing the quality of the music or podcast you're listening to.\nYou'll be surprised how soon you become accustomed to noise-cancellation headphones and enjoying the relative silence away from the world.\nWhat kind of speakers do noise cancelling headphones use?\nEvery pair of headphones here uses a speaker tech called 'dynamic' drivers to recreate sound, and this is by far the most common option for all headphones, earbuds and loudpseakers. It's the classic cone-shaped design you might be familiar with from bigger speakers, but in these headphones the drivers tend to be between 30mm and 40mm in diameter.\nTo explain how these dynamic speakers work, and what it is that makes them so popular with manufacturers, we spoke to Andy Kerr, Director of Product Marketing and Communications at Bowers & Wilkins, which has been creating these types of drivers for headphones and speakers for over 60 years.\n\u201cDynamic drivers use a magnet, a voice coil (typically made from winds of copper wire wound around a circular form), and a diaphragm/drive unit (a thin cone of material that makes the sound). The narrow end of the diaphragm's cone is attached to the voice coil; the wide end of the diaphragm is held in place by a rubber surround, also called \u2018suspension\u2019. When electrical current is supplied to the voice coil, it becomes electromagnetic. This creates a push-pull interaction between the coil and the magnet, which it is coiled around, causing the coil to move up and down over the magnet rapidly. Since the coil is attached to the bottom of the drive unit, its movement pushes the drive unit up and down in response, creating sound pressure waves that your ears and brain translate into sound,\u201d explains Kerr.\n\u201cA single dynamic driver can be made very compact, is light, and is highly efficient in terms of battery life, which is of course hugely relevant in the age of wireless earbuds. Dynamic drivers are also very popular in headphone designs essentially because they give companies like Bowers & Wilkins a way to use our knowledge and experience from designing and manufacturing them \u2013 for both loudspeakers and headphones \u2013 while customizing and continually improving the technology over time. For example, our approach to drive unit design combines stiffness in the material (for accuracy and fast response) plus good excursion (meaning how far the diaphragm is capable of moving, for deeper bass performance) that's equally important for both earbuds and loudspeakers.\"\nFor noise-cancelling over-ear headphones, dynamic drivers are effectively the only option for the speaker tech. While alternatives exist ('planar magnetic' and 'electrostatic' headphones drivers, for example, while 'solid-state' earbuds are also arriving), these are not used for ANC headphones, so dynamic driver tech powers everything in this list.\nHow we test the best noise cancelling headphones\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,400 audio products reviewed\n\u2611\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe've tested every pair of the best noise-cancelling headphones on this list and to include them here, we're looking for each product to excel at a number of things.\nEffective noise-cancellation: we test for headphones that are able to block out sound effectively, no matter whether you're on a daily commute or simply taking a walk. We always test noise cancellation in real-world environments, such as walking through traffic in a city, or travelling on subway, train and bus. We always try to test them on planes as well, but that depends on timing.\nAdditional features: around the inclusion of active noice cancellation, there's invariably a plethora of perks we have to explore, such as multiple noise cancellation modes, customization options, how well their transparency mode works and if it works in conjunction with proprietary spatial audio processing. and how does all of this affect the battery life? Stamina is important.\nAudio performance: obviously, this is a key consideration in any set of headphones. Good noise cancellation should never have to mean poor sound quality \u2013 and we made sure to check thoroughly until we were satisfied that each pair of headphones here offer clear and powerful sound, irrespective of the deployment of ANC. We test them both with ANC turned on and turned off, and compare directly to other models on the market with a range of music styles.\nBluetooth connectivity: we test for stable and reliable connections. After all, there's nothing worse than losing a track just as it reaches the good bit. Multi-point for simultaneous connection to two devices? Auracast audio sharing? Wireless charging? You'll know about it from us.\nComfort, design and style: we like to listen to music for long periods of time and we think you do too. So to assess a set of headphones looks alone would be wrong. We put in the listening hours and run them through our security/wearing tests too \u2013 because nobody wants to be running for a train and losing their headgear.\nValue: talking of budget, we also consider whether the noise-cancelling headphones in this list were good value for money. That doesn't mean we only looked at budget headphones \u2013 far from it \u2013 but we want to make sure that each pair offers something that makes their price worthwhile.\nOur ultimate goal is to make sure you buy a set of noise cancelling headphones you'll be over the moon with. We want them to furnish you with good quality music, free of extraneous noise, for years to come.

      "text": "I tried Bluetooth Auracast, and it'll change our relationship with headphones\nWe've been excited about the possibilities of Bluetooth Auracast ever since it was announced, and at CES 2024 I got to try this new way of using audio in real life, for the first time.\nBluetooth Auracast is a new way of using Bluetooth's wireless audio tech so that the best wireless headphones aren't limited to just the devices you pair them with \u2013 they'll be able to connect to public broadcasts easily too. We dig into more details in our 'Bluetooth Auracast explained' guide, but it means that people with Bluetooth hearing aids can get PA announcements beamed straight to their ears, or if you're in a bar with a TV showing sport you could listen to the sound from that match, or you might just share your music from your phone with your friends.\nBluetooth Auracast transmission devices have no limit to how many sets of headphones they can transmit to and can have a range of up to 100m, depending on the transmission device.\nIt's been a few years since it was announced, and it actually works on existing versions of Bluetooth, but it needed more devices to support the underlying tech before there was any point in launching it. Now that Bluetooth 5.2 is standard on basically every new pair of earbuds, we're getting to the point where we're the Bluetooth consortium is ready to start showing it off.\nSo at CES, I visited a room with multiple different examples of how people might use Bluetooth Auracast in their day-to-day to try it out, and now I really can't wait for it to take off.\nThe first thing I was curious about is how you would interact with it. You need the ability to choose which Auracast transmissions to connect to, and you obviously can't do that on your actual headphones. So Auracast was always going to have to use your phone, laptop or tablet as an intermediary, and sure enough when I arrived I was handed an iPhone 15 with an Auracast app on it \u2013 though there were also Samsung Galaxy S23 phones in use \u2013 and a pair of earbuds that were paired with it.\nThe Auracast app was very simple: it showed a list of transmissions being detected by the phone, all of which related to the different examples I was about to be shown.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFirst, I was directed to a demo of an example I mentioned above: a bar with TVs showing sports. On the wall were two TVs that were labelled, and in the Auracast app I could see matching names for those labels. I tapped one and immediately I could hear the commentary for the football match I was looking at. No pause, no pairing process, no wheel saying 'connecting' (at least, not for more than half a second). I had the sound in perfectly good quality. I tapped the name of the other TV and it switched just as quickly to let me hear some talking heads discussing a game. I tapped the name again to stop it playing.\nNext, we moved to a faux airport section, with a sign for a particular departure gate. I tapped in the Auracast app for the gate name, and now I could hear any announcements for the gate right in my earbuds, with no chance of missing the last call.\nI'm told that in the future Auracast should offer you the ability to listen to two streams at once, too \u2013 so at the airport, you could use it to watch the TV showing the news while you wait, but when the gate call is made, you'll still hear it. And remember, this wouldn't be for all gates \u2013 you wouldn't just have to be connected to the whole annoying PA (though that could be an option). You could choose to only hear the calls for your gate, available to you even if you go to the bathroom.\nI asked if it would be possible to listen to an Auracast transmission and something from your phone outside of the Auracast (ie, watch something on Netflix while you wait, but still hear the gate call), but this is less certain to happen for reasons I'll come back to shortly.\nNext, I was shown how Auracast means someone with a Windows laptop or iPhone could share their audio for your earbuds, protected by a password to stop random listeners joining, just like a personal hotspot, basically. For devices that don't have the right hardware to support Auracast, there's a USB-C dongle you can simply attach, too.\nFinally, I saw how it can used for public speaking. If it's connected to a microphone properly, Auracast will broadcast simultaneously with no lag, which may be much easier for people with hearing aids to make out than an echoey hall (with people whispering to each other) or an imperfect speaker setup.\nThe accessibility side of things is a huge part of why Auracast is valuable, but I found myself thinking about how often I'd like to be able to just use this instead of open sounds. I was at more than one CES announcement where the sound systems weren't set up very well, and I'd have quite happily popped in some of the best earbuds to listen to a cleaner sound devoid of extraneous noise.\nAnd then I thought about the potential for multiple people in an office to easily join a video call happening on a single-person's laptop, or the ability for tour guides in a city to just speak into their phone and for it to be broadcast to everyone's earbuds, or how two people could watch a TV quietly together in a bedroom without having to worry about pairing with it\u2026\nWhat this demo showed me is that if Auracast becomes widely available, then I think having a pair of the best wireless earbuds on you becomes something you might consider essential, because rather than being something that splits you off from the world around you, they can actively connect you to it. They can become an easily shared experience rather than a solo one. They could become a utility you want around all the time just in case, like your smartphone. Who knows what new ways people will think of to use this tech, from entertainment to safety to business.\nBut we'll need widespread support for that \u2013 and for them to really reach their potential, we'll need support built directly into the phone operating systems, not through an app. This is the thing that might make it possible for you to listen to an Auracast broadcast and your Netflix audio at the same time; without it, it'll always be a more awkward experience.\nWe'll also need the products to confirm support for it \u2013 some have been announced already, and more will be updated. At CES, JBL announced new audio tech with Auracast in, and it'll also be supported by Sennheiser's new Momentum 4 True Wireless earbuds \u2013 Samsung is also updating the excellent Galaxy Buds 2 Pro with it.\nMore will come, especially because chip makers are on board, including Intel, Qualcomm and RealTek, which covers a lot of what's out there. Here's hoping more big names come on board quickly, and Google and Apple follow with support built slickly into Android and iOS.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens. Stick with us for the big stories on everything from 8K TVs and foldable displays to new phones, laptops, smart home gadgets, and the latest in AI.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to follow us on TikTok for the latest from the CES show floor!\nYou might also like\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.

That's because there's a newer version incoming, and Bose promises that these ones are even better.\nThe Bose' QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen will launch later this summer with a price tag of $299; pricing and availability for the rest of the world hasn't been announced just yet.\nIn addition to the new earbuds, there are also two new SoundLink speakers. One of them is coming this month and the other shortly afterwards.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen): what's new\nWe're pretty unanimous when it comes to rating ANC earbuds: Bose are the best. That's been the case for quite a while, ever since we found the Sony WF-1000XM5 to be a bit of a let-down in the ANC department.\nIf I'm travelling any distance I'm more likely to take my OG first-gen QuietComfort Earbuds than my AirPods Pro 2. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are better still, and the second generation promise to improve the ANC experience yet again.\nBose says it's got new and improved AI algorithms for better filtering of sudden noise spikes via its ActiveSense system, so less outside sound will break through. Bose promises improved voice pickup and call quality too, which is good, because that was a weak spot f the Ultra compared to the competition.\nBattery life is six hours with ANC, or four with immersive spatial audio turned on too, and the case can be charged wirelessly \u2013 weirdly, the first-gen Ultra Earbuds required a sleeve for the case to add wireless charging, but it's here by default now.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThere's also a new embedded ear wax guard to prevent buildup, and avoid any audio blocking from it.\nThere are three color options: black, white smoke and deep plum.\nTwo new SoundLink speakers\nBose has also announced two new SoundLink portable speakers: the SoundLink Plus Portable, which sits between the SoundLink Flex and the Max, and a second-generation SoundLink Micro.\nThe SoundLink Plus Portable is IP67 rated, floats in water, delivers 20 hours of playback and features one subwoofer, a tweeter and four passive radiators, so it should be pretty big in the bass department.\nIt'll be $269 and comes in a choice of black, blue dusk or a new citrus yellow. Pre-orders start today, 12 June, except for the citrus yellow: those orders open on 18 June. All three models will be on sale from 26 June.\nThe second-generation SoundLink Micro speaker gets USB-C charging, 12 hours of battery life and Bose app compatibility for adjusting the EQ, customizing the buttons and other tweaks.\nThere's a new removable fabric strap that makes it easy to attach it to things, and Bose says the new model delivers clearer highs without sacrificing any of the lows.\nThe SoundLink Micro (2nd Gen) will go on sale later this summer with a US price of $129 and two color choices: black and blue dusk.\nYou might also like\nContributor\nWriter, broadcaster, musician and kitchen gadget obsessive Carrie Marshall has been writing about tech since 1998, contributing sage advice and odd opinions to all kinds of magazines and websites as well as writing more than twenty books.

That's common in cheap headphones, but some feel it more than others.\nThe best cheap headphones you can buy right now are the 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51. These budget-friendly over-ears absolutely deliver, with excellent sound for the price, standout battery life, and effective noise cancelling \u2013 all for well under $100/\u00a3100.\nYou get a lot of features for the price here. There\u2019s ANC and transparency mode, support for high-quality streaming via LDAC, and a jaw-dropping 100 hours of battery life (or 65 hours with ANC switched on). During testing, the ANC surprised us with how good it was \u2013 it really muted the usual distractions such as keyboard clatter and street noise, letting us fully focus on the music.\nSound-wise, they hold up well against the competition we compared them to. The audio is clear with a bass-forward sound signature that\u2019ll appeal to fans of electronic, hip-hop and pop. Even at higher volumes, the sound stays clean and full \u2013 and it's impressively dynamic, giving it energy and clarity that's often missing from more affordable headphones. If you want to tweak the sound profile, the companion app gives you EQ options to play with, which work well \u2013 though we found the app itself to be a little clunky.\nThey also look great for a budget set of cans. With a sleek matte finish and stylish curved design, the Sonoflow Pro HQ51 don\u2019t scream \u201ccheap.\u201d They\u2019re lightweight and comfy to wear too, with generous padding on the earcups and headband. The build does feel a bit plasticky in places, but that\u2019s par for the course at this price point, and not a criticism \u2013 just an observation from comparing them to more premium models.\nAll in all, the 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 manage to squeeze in everything you\u2019d want from budget headphones \u2013 good looks, great battery life, and strong sound \u2013 without cutting too many corners. If you want the best cheap headphones available today, these are the ones to beat.\nRead our full 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51 review\nThe best cheap on-ear cans\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want balanced sound on a budget: They might be cheap but there's no overblown bass here \u2013 just clean, well-rounded audio that suits all kinds of music.\n\u2705 You forget to charge your gear: With 50 hours of battery life, you\u2019ll rarely need to top them up. Ideal for long haul travel or anyone who's forgetful.\n\u274c You need strong noise blocking: There\u2019s no ANC here, and the on-ear fit means they don\u2019t seal sound well either \u2013 expect outside noise to creep in.\n\u274c You don\u2019t get on with on-ears: Even with padding they still rest on your ears \u2013 some people love this design, others should stick to over-ears.\nThe Sony WH-CH520 are super cheap, on-ear wireless headphones from Sony, coming in at only $60 / \u00a360 / AU$99. These headphones are on-ear rather than in-ear or over-ear, which means you won't get active noise cancellation or Hi-Res Audio support (but you wouldn't expect to at this price), but they deliver quality, well-balanced sound (as well as a few useful tricks), making them fantastic value and our favorite pair of cheap on-ears.\nThe bass adds depth but sounds controlled and fun with electronic or dance music. Mids let vocals stretch their legs, which gives denser instrumental mixes a chance to shine \u2013 although you'll obviously lose more detail here than you would with higher-end models. Trebles tend to elevate out of the mid-range well enough, giving them space to breathe.\nThe Sony CH520 replace the Sony CH510 in Sony's line-up and they're a worthy upgrade, adding in some notable improvements, like more cushioning, which is essential for a good pair of on-ear headphones where the earpads sit directly on your ears. The only thing these headphones are missing at this great value price is a 3.5mm jack, but with good app support, multi-point pairing and an impressive 50 hours of battery we really can't complain and they're our top pick if you want over-ears that won't break the bank.\nRead our full Sony WH-CH520 review\nThe best cheap earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You like clear, vocal-led sound: If you prefer crisp treble and detailed mids over booming bass, these are a rare budget gem \u2013 especially for acoustic or classical tracks.\n\u2705 You want a lightweight design: The buds are pretty light at 4.6g each, but so is the case too. Ideal for carrying in smaller pockets.\n\u274c You need proper noise cancellation: There\u2019s no ANC here, just passive isolation and ambient mode. Not ideal if you need to block out serious background noise.\n\u274c You\u2019ll be off-grid for days: The buds last well, but the case doesn\u2019t hold much extra charge. For multi-day trips without power, you\u2019ll need more backup.\nThe Sony WF-C510 earbuds are some of the best low-cost buds we've reviewed \u2013 and that's really saying something considering how many we've tested over the years. They tick all of the boxes for such an affordable pair of buds, with good sound, on-board battery life and a snug fit.\nDon't expect high-end features from buds at this price. You won't find wear detection or a low-latency mode, for example. But expect a solid 11 hours of battery life, which should see you through a long work day or most trips. Unfortunately, the case battery life is a little disappointing, bringing you only one more full charge \u2013 rivals pack in multiple.\nThere's no active noise cancellation here, but Sony has added its 'sound control' tech, which allows you to better hear what's going on around you when wearing them. There's also decent noise isolation thanks to the secure fit. And that fit really does hold up: in our review, we commented \"they always felt rigid in my testing, never once falling out or even feeling loose\". They have a minimal design with a choice of colors (black, white, blue and yellow) and there's a physical button, which is sensitive enough to use as the main control.\nSony's DSEE (digital sound enhancement engine) is here, which can restore extra range to compressed audio tracks from streaming services \u2013 great for Spotify users. You'll need to turn this on from the app, but once you do, expect clear and high-quality audio. Treble and vocals are particularly pronounced from these buds, with powerful bass lacking a little. But for everyday listening at this price, it's hard to fault them.\nThese Sony WF-C510 buds sit between the pricier Sony WF-C700N, which bring you ANC (although we've since replaced these in this guide with the Nothing Ear (a) buds), and the super-cheap JLab buds that we'd recommend if you're on the tightest of budgets. Or split the difference and get JLab's Go Pop ANC, which combine ANC and a budget price. But if you're looking for an affordable pick, you can do without ANC and can make your money stretch to the Sony WF-C510 buds, you won't be disappointed.\nRead our full Sony WF-C510 review\nThe best super cheap ANC earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want noise cancellation on a tight budget: Sure, everything in this guide is cheap. But $29.99 / \u00a329.99 for ANC this decent is rare. For the price, it\u2019s a total bargain.\n\u2705 You like your earbuds tiny and light: These are featherweight and super compact \u2013 perfect for comfy, all-day listening without ear fatigue.\n\u274c You\u2019re after audiophile sound: Audio is good for the price, but the soundstage is narrow. The other earbuds in this guide sound obviously better.\n\u274c Style matters more than specs: They're fine when it comes to practical design, but aren't the best-looking buds around.\nIf you want ANC and you want it as cheap as possible without sacrificing on sound, build or other features, then you literally cannot do better than the JLab Go Pop ANC. These earbuds from JLab are fantastic value and although the ANC is not best-in-class, it is surprisingly competent for the price.\nNormally you have to sacrifice something for a budget pair of buds, but expect all of the essentials here. That includes some surprising features you don't usually find in all budget buds, like a companion app that allows you to customize touch controls and tweak EQ settings, as well as 7 hours of battery life \u2013 although expect up to 24 hours with the case. Comfort levels here are also great. The buds themselves feel a little cheap, but that's to be expected. And who cares when they're fairly robust, with a highly unusual IP55 waterproof rating?\nSound here is energetic and fun to listen to. We rated the \"impressive bass and treble\" in our review, even if the soundstage seemed a little too narrow at times. ANC is the star of the show at this price. Of course, it's never going to compete with high-end brands, like Bose, but we think most people will be happy with the level of silencing on offer here. In our review, we wrote: \"It\u2019s certainly enough to keep conversations muted and loud noises dulled when you\u2019re out in public.\"\nOverall, these buds are very impressive considering you can snap them up for under $30/\u00a330. Having said that, if you can take a step up, do check out the Nothing Ear (a) buds literally one place below. They're pricier than these from JLab, but are still incredibly affordable for a pair of ANC buds and tick all the boxes in terms of features, design and comfort, too.\nRead our full JLab Go Pop ANC review\nThe best still-affordable ANC earbuds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great noise cancellation on a budget: Not best-in-class ANC, but probably the best budget noise-cancelling we've ever experienced.\n\u2705 You want solid sound and style: When we were testing these buds a lot of people wanted to talk about them. They're stylish and they stand out, e.\n\u274c You want spatial audio: It's not here, but you can get some spatial audio support from other cheap earbuds. We don't mind it not being here ourselves, though.\n\u274c Your ears are very small: Our small-eared reviewers tested these, so you should be fine. But you may want to see if you can try before you buy.\nIf you want a pair of buds that are still considered budget but bring you excellent noise cancelling, sound and style, the Nothing Ear (a) are the clear choice.\nLet\u2019s start with the star of the show: noise cancellation. It\u2019s superb at this level, easily some of the best we\u2019ve tested under \u00a3100/$100. There are multiple ANC profiles, and the High setting is especially impressive. It knocked out the sound of a hairdryer and even muted an extractor fan we didn\u2019t realize was on. This level of silence comes at the cost of some battery life \u2013 down from 9.5 hours to 5.5 with ANC on \u2013 but frankly, it\u2019s worth it.\nSound-wise, the Ear (a) buds bring a lot of energy. They\u2019re dynamic, punchy and fun, with a bold, zealous character that makes pop, hip-hop and dance tracks shine. They lean into excitement over audiophile precision, but that\u2019s not a drawback \u2013 they\u2019re engaging and full of life, without feeling harsh. For those who like to tweak, the Nothing X app offers EQ adjustment and a fit test, though you won\u2019t get the full personalized sound profile or ceramic driver from the more expensive Nothing Ear. But again, that\u2019s fair given the lower price point.\nDesign is another big win. These don\u2019t look like budget buds. In fact, they\u2019re more stylish and distinctive than many premium models. The semi-transparent aesthetic and bold colors make them stand out, and they feel solid in the hand despite the price. Comfort is also excellent, especially once you\u2019ve found the right tips (three sizes come in the box). They\u2019re lightweight and easy to wear for hours, and the redesigned case is smaller and more pocketable than before.\nThere are a few trade-offs, you won\u2019t get wireless charging or spatial audio, and some premium features from Nothing\u2019s flagship models are missing. But you do get Bluetooth 5.3, LDAC support for high-res audio (if your phone supports it), multipoint connectivity, low-lag gaming mode, in-ear detection, and a \u201cFind My Earbuds\u201d feature.\nUltimately, if you\u2019re after slick design, excellent sound and noise cancellation that punches way above its price tag, the Nothing Ear (a) are hard to beat. They\u2019re affordable, practical, and packed with features that usually cost a lot more.\nRead our full Nothing Ear (a) review\nThe best super-cheap buds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want ultra-portability: These might be the tiniest earbuds we\u2019ve tested and the case is seriously pocket-friendly.\n\u2705 You\u2019re into cute tech: Not just small, they're also stylish and Instagram-friendly. What we're saying is, they score high on the aesthetic front.\n\u274c You\u2019re after booming bass: The sound\u2019s clear, but if you love deep, punchy lows, these simply don't have the power to hit hard enough.\n\u274c You need proper noise cancelling: Passive isolation is fine for most settings, but not enough for noisy commutes.\nThe JLab JBuds Mini are mini in size, and mini in price. This is why they're our top pick if you're looking for a super budget pair of buds and we'd also highly recommend them if you have smaller ears, too.\nFeatures are a little light given how cheap these buds are. But we were happy to find there's multi-point pairing \u2013 this isn't always common with budget buds. There's also a Be Aware mode, which lets you better here what's going on around you and you can listen to just one bud at once, if you prefer. There's 5.5 hours of battery onboard and 20 once you add the case into the mix, which is pretty standard.\nThere's no noise cancellation here, but we were pleasantly surprised by the noise isolation during our testing. In our review, we wrote: \"While you'll still hear traffic as you walk past, it isn't as all encompassing as with other weaker earbuds.\" We think that the bass could be stronger \u2013 but that's often the case with budget buds. Still, they deliver good sound quality, which in our review we described as \"pretty lively with a wider soundstage than anyone could have seen coming here.\" The good news is you can also tweak the sound a little thanks to the app's EQ.\nThese are incredibly small buds that even come with a keyring attachment on the case so you can attach them to your keys \u2013 a good idea if you tend to lose small things. Even though the buds are small, they'll fit well \u2013 they didn't budge when we took them for a run during testing.\nRead our full JLab JBuds Mini review\nThe best super-cheap USB-C buds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want something stylish: These wired buds blend classic form with a modern look \u2013 great if you're chasing a cool, minimalist vibe.\n\u2705 You listen for hours: They\u2019re comfy enough for all-day use with a secure fit that stays put during long work or study sessions.\n\u274c You like easy volume control: There\u2019s no volume button on the inline remote, which is annoying if your phone\u2019s in your pocket or you're walking.\n\u274c You\u2019re chasing premium sound: The audio\u2019s decent, but lacks the depth and detail of pricier options. Bass lovers, look elsewhere.\nIf you want a cheap pair of wired buds with a USB-C connection, the Skullcandy Set USB-C are our top choice. They're a stylish and affordable pair of headphones that stack up well against some of the best wired headphones when it comes to value.\nAs you might expect for a cheap pair of wired earbuds, you won't get best-in-class sound here. In our review we wrote that they lacked depth and bass sounded a bit feeble at times. But considering the $31.99 / \u00a329.99 (about AU$50) price tag, these earbuds sound decently. There's certainly none of the tinny audio we've experienced from other budget buds. Instead, the Skullcandy Set offer good all-round sound. As we wrote in our review: \"it's just a bit thin on detail and dynamism.\"\nThe earbuds come with a few different sizes of in-ear gels, these provide some noise-isolation, which won't cancel out all ambient sounds but do keep them in place and ensure you're tuned into your music. They also look good. During tested we wrote that we like their sleek, curved design and come in several different colorways.\nRead our full Skullcandy Set USB-C review\nThe best super-cheap wired buds\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You game on your phone: Getting both clarity and precision at this level is rare, which is why we think they're perfect for mobile gamers.\n\u2705 You\u2019re rough on your tech gear: They\u2019re sturdy and cheap enough that accidents aren\u2019t a big deal.\n\u274c You want strong bass: These aren\u2019t built for deep, thumping lows. Bass is definitely lacking and you'll need to look elsewhere if that's a dealbreaker.\n\u274c You need extra cable length: The 1.2m cable you get here is fine for phones, but too short for console or TV gaming.\nThe Final Audio VR500 are among the most affordable headphones from Japanese tech company Final Audio, and a great choice if you're looking for a pair of wired headphones with a 3.5mm jack that are cheap and sound great.\nAs we commented in our review, just because they're cheap \"doesn't mean they\u2019ve missed out on the customary Final Audio attention to detail.\" They're a fantastic option for gamers and music-lovers with good specs, a solid build quality that weighs only 12g for maximum comfort, and a 1.2m cable that's tangle-resistant and should be long enough for most situations.\nThere are better-sounding buds and in our review we said that some listeners might crave more punch. But in terms of spaciousness, detail retrieval, fidelity and precision, the Final Audio outperform their budget asking price. We wrote: \"By the standards of profoundly affordable wired in-ear headphones, the VR500 are basically as good as it currently gets.\"\nRead our full Final VR500 review\nOther cheap headphones to consider\nApple AirPods 4: The AirPods 4 sound great and offer top-notch spatial audio. They're relatively affordable for Apple, but there\u2019s plenty of strong competition at this level. Only go for them if you specifically want the classic AirPods fit \u2013 they rest just outside your ear canals, with no in-ear tips, yet still feel secure and comfortable. If budget isn\u2019t a concern, you might also want to consider the ANC version. Read our full Apple AirPods 4 review for more.\nEarfun Air 2 NC: We were disappointed by theater mode here (that's Earfun's spatial audio setting) and the design isn't going to suit everyone because the ear stems are long. But for solid ANC on a budget, we'd still recommend you take a look at our full Earfun Air 2 NC review.\nEarfun Wave Pro: These very capable over-ears were once our top pick for most people, but were replaced by the 1More Sonoflow Pro HQ51. But that doesn't mean these Earfun cans aren't still well worth your time with good sound, solid ANC, impressive battery life and a comfortable fit all for an affordable price. Take a look at our Earfun Wave Pro review for more.\nHuawei FreeArc: If it's an open pair of earbuds you're after, head straight to our Huawei FreeArc review. There\u2019s plenty of competition in this space, but these are the best-sounding open-ear headphones we\u2019ve tested so far \u2013 and while it's hard to call them cheap, they\u2019re the best affordable in this style.\nMaster & Dynamic ME05: These wired earbuds were a joy to test with stunning audio and solid design and build quality. However, they're just a bit too pricey to be considered 'cheap' for this guide. If you can make your budget stretch, do take a look at our Master & Dynamic ME05 review.\nPanasonic RB-M600: Panasonic has done a decent job with these over-ears, which are less than $80/\u00a380 with a great battery life. However, the ambient mode didn't impress us during testing and the design absolutely reflects the cheaper price. Find out more in our Panasonic RB-M600 review.\nSony MDR-EX15AP: If you're looking for a super cheap second pair of wired earbuds, you've found them. There's not much to say here, they get the job done, covering the basics. But that's about it. Read our full Sony MDR-EX15AP review for more.\nSony WF-C700N: When we first tested these buds in our Sony WF-C700N review, we said that they're among the best cheap ANC buds you can buy. We stand buy that. The audio is detailed and immersive, and they\u2019re extremely comfortable. They\u2019re getting on a bit now, but if you spot them at a big discount while they\u2019re still available, snap them up.\nSony WF-C710N: Sony's latest mid-range earbuds are very good in basically every way, but we prefer the Nothing Ear (a). Still, if you know you like Sony's sound profile, the C710N remain a great alternative, with excellent noise cancellation and impressive sound for the price. Check out our full Sony WF-C710N review for the details.\nSony WH-C720N: These Sony over-ears offer solid sound and smart features at a great price. They don\u2019t quite borrow the magic from Sony\u2019s flagship range, but that\u2019s okay. Because what you get is a comfortable fit, enjoyable audio and surprisingly decent noise cancellation for the money. A strong pick for everyday listening without the premium price tag. Read our full Sony WH-C720N review to find out more.\nHow to choose the best cheap headphones for you\nChoosing the best cheap headphones comes down to a few key factors: the design that suits you best, the features you prioritize, the device you'll use as your music source, and just how cheap your budget will allow you to go.\nDesign: You'll find cheap headphones that are in-ear, over-ear, on-ear and wired. The one you choose will mostly come down to your personal preference. If you can't decide, consider what you'll be using them for. For example, if you want the best ANC for travel, you might get a better experience with over-ears. If you want flexible buds for walking and popping in and out easily, true wireless options might work better.\nFeatures: When choosing budget headphones, it\u2019s important to remember that affordability often comes with trade-offs. If a specific feature \u2013 like ANC \u2013 is a priority, it\u2019s worth focusing on that and accepting that other aspects may not be as strong. You can find features like ANC, on-ear volume controls, dedicated apps, and wearer detection at lower prices, but you won\u2019t get them all in one package.\nSource: What phone do you use? While most headphones are compatible with a wide range of devices, you may unlock extra features and enjoy a more seamless experience if your phone and headphones are part of the same ecosystem. If you\u2019re considering wired earbuds, check whether your phone has the right connection\u2014or be prepared to buy an adapter.\nBudget: Finally, how small is your budget? Yes, this is a guide to the best cheap headphones, but our definition of 'cheap' varies, from the super-cheap JLab JBuds Mini at $39.99/\u00a339.99 through to the Sony WF-C700N at $119 / \u00a399 / AU$199. This should give everyone with a smaller budget several options.\nFinal thoughts: But we haven't just included headphones because they're cheap. We highly recommend all of the devices in our guide above. Even if they don't all offer sonic sound performance, they all represent excellent value for money.\nOverall, there's no going wrong with any of the headphones in this guide. They're all affordable, great value and offer some top features and decent sound. But it is worth taking the time to consider what's important to you \u2013 just because headphones are cheap doesn't always mean they're worth it.\nWhich are the cheapest headphones?\nYou'll find lots of cheap headphones online, especially if you hunt on Amazon. There are some true wireless and wired earbuds there that are incredibly cheap.\nBut even if you're on a tight budget, we'd urge you to look at our top recommended cheapest headphones, rather than just the cheapest you can find. Even if they don't cost much, buying a cheap pair that aren't any good will still feel like a waste of cash.\nThe cheapest headphones in this guide are the JLab Go Air Pop, which retail for $20 / \u00a320 / AU$49.95. They're not a perfect pair of true wireless earbuds, but deliver good audio and a comfy design considering their price.\nDo cheap headphones sound good?\nThe cheap headphones in this guide all sound good and pack in enough audio tech to deliver your music in a way that's balanced, loud enough and bassy.\nOf course, what sounds good and what doesn't is subjective. For some of the budget prices above, you won't be getting the high-end audio that you'd expect from some of the best headphones and best earbuds you can buy today.\nBut we've tested each pair of the best cheap headphones we've included in this guide and although none of them provide a stellar, premium audio experience, they sound good enough for accompanying you on a workout, blocking out some sounds as you travel or providing you with a good backup if you need a reliable second pair of buds.\nWhy do cheap headphones have so much bass?\nWhen it comes to the best cheap headphones you'll often find there's a trade off to make them so cheap. They might have fantastic battery life but a plasticky design or they might have a comfy fit but the sound is only mediocre.\nSomething that you might notice if you try cheap headphones is that they have a bit too much bass. This is sometimes intentional and headphone makers are trying to create a product with mass appeal. Other times it could simply be that the headphones aren't great quality.\nFinally, many cheap headphones don't come with many customization options, so by default they might have a lot of bass but, unlike premium headphones, you don't have an option to tweak their settings.\nAre cheap headphones worth it?\nWe think all the budget headphones in this guide are worth considering - but if you're ever unsure about buying a pair of cheap headphones, be sure to look into their specs.\nThese days, you don't need to settle for poor sound if you're on a budget, so look for large drivers that can displace lots of air and give you a powerful sound. Support for hi-res audio codecs might not be on the cards for cheaper models, but wireless headphones should have good connectivity and will ideally use the latest Bluetooth 5 standard.\nWireless headphones should also offer a decent battery life - if not class-leading, budget wireless headphones should at least be able to get you through a few commutes or workouts.\nBuild quality probably won't be as good as more expensive headphones, but they should still be comfortable to wear.\nWhat about extras? While you can get cheap headphones with extra features like noise cancellation, pricier headphones will probably perform better when it comes to these quality-of-life extras.\nWhat are the best cheap headphones brands?\nIt may surprise you to know that lots of big brands offer cheaper versions of their flagships headphones. Sony have several budget-friendly models in our guide that are worth checking out.\nAs for less well-known brands? We wouldn't recommend taking a risk on a totally unknown headphones brand on Amazon, but there are a few out there that are worth checking out. These include Earfun, 1More, Skullcandy, Jlab, Jabra, and more.\nHow we test the best cheap headphones\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 3,000 headphones reviewed\n\u2611\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nIt\u2019s no surprise that cheap earbuds won\u2019t match high-end ones, so we judge budget options against similarly priced competition. Our testing ensures they offer clear, detailed sound without the dreaded tinny quality that's common in lower-end models.\nWe assess both wired and wireless options, listening across various genres for several days. Where it applies to the headphones we\u2019re testing, we also evaluate features like ANC, battery life, usability, and companion apps, considering how well they perform at this price point.\nComfort, design, and ergonomics matter too. We note how they feel during extended wear to help you find the right fit. Finally, we compare performance to price, ensuring every pick offers solid value.\nTake a look at our more rigorous explanation about how we test products here at TechRadar and, more specifically, how we test earbuds.\nLatest updates to the best cheap headphones guide\nJuly 21, 2025\nSwapped the Sony WF-C700N for the Nothing Ear (a) as our 'Best still-affordable ANC earbuds' because they're cheap and well worth buying, but not quite as cheap as the JLab Pop ANC.

      "text": "What is Bluetooth LE Audio? The next-gen wireless connection explained\nBluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio is a new Bluetooth wireless standard that's set up upgrade the way we listen to music and bring a whole boatload of new audio features to a range of devices. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) is an industry collective that makes the Bluetooth wireless standard. It first unveiled Bluetooth LE Audio at CES 2022 and, in 2022, it announced the latest specification had been completed and could be rolled out to apps and devices.\nDescribed by SIG as \u201cthe next generation of Bluetooth audio\u201d, it\u2019s best to consider LE Audio as an umbrella term to describe a bunch of new technologies that focus on both power efficiency and audio quality. This new standard also introduces some innovative new features, making this the biggest upgrade to Bluetooth audio in years, especially if you own a pair of the best true wireless earbuds that support it (which some do already).\nIn our guide below we\u2019ll cover everything you need to know about Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio and what it\u2019ll mean for the future of audio devices.\nBluetooth LE Audio: What is it?\nMost of us know that Bluetooth is a wireless standard that allows for data to be exchanged between, say, a phone and a pair of earbuds. But if you hadn\u2019t given Bluetooth much thought beyond that, you\u2019re not alone.\nThe main thing you need to know is that there\u2019s a standard version of Bluetooth, such as Bluetooth 5.0, which is sometimes called Bluetooth Classic and is used in most devices. Then there\u2019s Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) which is more focused on low power consumption and running smaller devices (such as true wireless earbuds, or smart home devices). Both can co-exist in devices, so this isn't necessarily a case of choosing one over the other.\nTo understand the benefits of Bluetooth LE Audio we need to talk codecs. An audio codec encodes audio data at its source (ie, a smartphone) so it can be transmitted to a device (ie, wireless earbuds) where it\u2019s decoded so it can be played back. Bluetooth LE Audio uses a new codec called Low Complexity Communication Codec (LC3) that changes how audio is transmitted via Bluetooth and replaces the Bluetooth Classic codec, which is called SBC (Sub-band Codec).\nThe LC3 codec is designed to be a more efficient codec for transmitting audio. The result is a Bluetooth standard that improves efficiency (meaning less battery power is required to use it), as well as audio quality, because it's a more modern codec. According to according to Bluetooth SIG, it provides higher quality at the same data rates as SBC. If you head on over to the Bluetooth SIG\u2019s Audio Codec Demonstration, you can actually listen to a comparison between the two codecs to hear the difference for yourself.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBluetooth LE Audio: What are the benefits?\nAll of this news is exciting for those building tech products, but how will you and I benefit? The top line benefits according to Bluetooth SIG are: \u201cimproved audio quality, reduced power consumption and improved interoperability.\u201d It\u2019s worth saying at this point that it\u2019s still early days and we don\u2019t know yet whether these claims will deliver in the real world.\nThat being said, we can expect to experience improved bitrates, better battery life, and lower latency \u2013 good for gamers when every second of audio lag counts. Some predict that these improvements could also lead to cheaper products, too. In the past, companies had to pay licensing fees to make improvements to Bluetooth \u2013 such as if companies want to include aptX for Hi-Res Audio, but LE Audio can support the high bitrates needed for that kind of sound quality on its own.\nHowever, one of the most interesting new features of Bluetooth LE Audio is something that Bluetooth SIG is calling Auracast. It says that this will allow a single source device, like a phone, to broadcast multiple streams of audio to many devices all at once, such as a whole group headphones. Not only would this allow you to share your music with your friends as you listen, but Bluetooth SIG also gives several other use cases of how this kind of tech is so useful. For example, everyone at a gym could connect their wireless earbuds up to a public TV.\nAnother benefit that could have major implications for the future is that Bluetooth LE Audio brings support for hearing aids and hearing implants. This means people who use these hearing devices may soon be able to access audio from TVs and smartphones that carry the new standard. This is significant as lots of audio sources will have traditionally been inaccessible to them.\nBluetooth LE Audio: How can you use it?\nBluetooth LE Audio is, technically, available now. There are multiple headphones that already say they support it, and many more that hypothetically could after a software update (it requires Bluetooth 5.2 or later hardware).\nBut Bluetooth SIG needs consumer electronics companies to actually adopt the new standard on devices that send the audio as well as those that receive it. This means there\u2019s no official date you\u2019re going to get it. But it\u2019s down to tech manufacturers to include the new standard in their devices.\nThe problem really is the phones right now. Android 13 appears to have theoretical support for it, but it's not active on devices. Perhaps lots of phones could have it activated in the future, but there's no official word on that, and different phone makers may approach it differently.\nAnd it's unclear if Apple is interested in the technology. According to 9to5Mac, Bluetooth LE Audio was being tested on the Apple AirPods Max back in mid-2022, but the technology isn't support in iOS 16 or in AirPods Pro 2, released since then. Perhaps Apple will look at it in iOS 17, but that's a long way away.\nWe expect that companies will begin to adopt the latest version of Bluetooth, but may focus on improved features, like 50% better battery life, in future products without mentioning that it\u2019s only possible because of LC3 and Bluetooth LE Audio.\nBluetooth LE Audio: Do you need it?\nBluetooth LE Audio certainly sounds innovative, but do you need it? Some industry commentators have shared their concerns about LE Audio saying that it focuses too much on efficiency and not enough on audio quality. We\u2019ll find out as devices and headphones start rolling out with Bluetooth LE Audio over the next few years.\nHowever, if Bluetooth LE Audio delivers on some of its biggest promises, we could all have better-performing \u2013 and possibly even cheaper \u2013 wireless devices in the coming years that still play great-sounding audio.\nBecca is a contributor to TechRadar, a freelance journalist and author.
