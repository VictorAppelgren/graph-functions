  "title": "After tragedy in Minneapolis, Trump officials join a cherry-picked rush to judgment",
  "description": "Top officials leapt this week to attach a mass shooting at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis that killed two children and injured more than a dozen others to the left \u2013 both implicitly and explicitly.",
  "content": "Eleven days after an assassination attempt against Donald Trump last year, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray testified in front of lawmakers who were hungry for information.\n\nBut he was circumspect. Yes, the shooter targeted Trump, but Wray wasn\u2019t going to sit there and speculate or draw inferences about his motive.\n\nA congressman asked Wray, \u201cdo you and your team know the motive of the shooter or have any idea what could have driven it?\u201d\n\nWray responded: \u201cWell, \u2018know\u2019 and \u2018have any idea\u2019 are two very different things.\u201d\n\nWhen a Republican asked him if Democrats\u2019 rhetoric played any role, Wray balked: \u201cRespectfully, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me, as the FBI director, to be characterizing or engaging in public commentary on specific people\u2019s rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThat was then; this is now.\n\nIn keeping with the second Trump administration\u2019s extraordinary moves to comment on ongoing investigations and politicize them, top officials leapt this week to attach a mass shooting at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis that killed two children and injured more than a dozen others to the left \u2013 both implicitly and explicitly.\n\nThey did so even as the known picture of the shooter Robin Westman\u2019s words painted a complicated and often incoherent picture of Westman\u2019s beliefs and possible motives.\n\nPerhaps most striking of all was Wray\u2019s successor as FBI director, Kash Patel.\n\nWhile Patel didn\u2019t ascribe a motive to Westman, he cherry-picked a handful of Westman\u2019s words. He said that Westman \u201cleft multiple anti-Catholic, anti-religious references,\u201d spoke of \u201chatred and violence toward Jewish people\u201d and said \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d and wrote \u201can explicit call for violence against President Trump on a firearm magazine.\u201d\n\nPatel said the crime was being investigated as not just terrorism, but a \u201chate crime targeting Catholics.\u201d\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed Patel, noting Westman wrote \u201cWhere is your God?\u201d and \u201cKill Donald Trump\u201d on her weapons and ammunition.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was more explicit about Westman\u2019s motive, saying it was \u201canti-God sentiment that motivated the shooter.\u201d\n\nWhat do those things have in common? They happen to align with groups and people Republicans have set themselves up as protecting \u2013 and have accused the left of attacking. Along with citing Westman\u2019s references to Trump, the intimation is clearly that this was an attack motivated by leftist ideology.\n\nBut the fuller picture of Westman\u2019s words shows this is a highly selective reading. It suggests the shooter could have been influenced by a host of extremists with varying and even often right-wing views. Westman expressed hatred towards a whole host of groups, including ones that could be coded as allies of the left.\n\nWestman wrote racial slurs against Black and Hispanic people and an epithet for gay people, as well as \u201cNuke India.\u201d Westman appeared to celebrate anti-Muslim terrorists Anders Breivik from Norway and Brenton Tarrant from New Zealand. Westman cited the cases of anti-government, white-supremacist extremists Randy Weaver and Timothy McVeigh and the Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas \u2013 cases that became rallying cries on the far right.\n\nWestman also appeared to celebrate those who attacked Christian institutions and Jews. But the common thread seems to be the celebration of hatred and massacres of many kinds.\n\nIt\u2019s a hodge-podge of potential motivations that suggest an ideology that isn\u2019t neatly pinned down.\n\nTrump administration officials and others have also gestured at the fact that Westman was transgender. Patel seemed to make a point to call Westman \u201cthe male subject,\u201d despite Westman having taken legal steps to transition and live as a woman, according to court documents from 2019 and 2020. Noem said Westman \u201cwas a 23 year-old man, claiming to be transgender.\u201d\n\nThey weren\u2019t necessarily saying that was relevant, but they were certainly making a point to say it. And that too fed into right-wing allegations that trans people are more likely to commit such atrocities.\n\nThere is no evidence supporting that latter claim, though. The perception seems to owe in large part to people falsely claiming previous mass shooters were transgender, often shortly after the shootings. This happened after school shootings in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022 and Madison, Wisconsin last year, among others. Even Thursday, Donald Trump Jr. repeated the false claim that the shooters had been transgender.\n\nConservative media figures, especially on Fox News, were happy to connect the dots more explicitly.\n\n\u201cThe left is weaponizing trans kids and turning them into culture warriors, and they\u2019ve been turned loose against the church, schools, and Trump,\u201d Fox host Jesse Watters said Wednesday. \u201cYou see it, I see it.\u201d\n\nAdded Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida on Fox host Laura Ingraham\u2019s show that night: \u201cThis is about mental health issues that the radical left refuses to acknowledge, comes from their crazy ideology, which is damaging so many children in the United States who are now becoming young adults.\u201d\n\nIngraham responded: \u201cMutilating their bodies and their minds.\u201d\n\nEven the idea that Westman was necessarily targeting Catholics appears speculative. Yes, this was an attack on a religious school. But it also happens to have been a religious school that Westman attended.\n\nAnd to the extent we\u2019re taking Westman\u2019s words at face value, Westman explicitly said that wasn\u2019t a motivation.\n\n\u201cThis is not a church or religion attack, that is not the message,\u201d Westman wrote. \u201cThe message is there is no message.\u201d\n\nThe episode highlights a kind of rush to judgment has become especially common on the right. Trump and his allies have attached his would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, to the left, despite Crooks having been a registered Republican and there still being no solid picture of his motivations. It was a similar story with the attack on Paul Pelosi and the shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers this year.\n\nThe lure of attaching these people to the other side based on incomplete and often-wrong information is apparently too tempting.\n\nBut usually this isn\u2019t done with an assist from top administration officials who are supposed to be circumspect about prejudging a case.",

  "summary": "After a mass shooting at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, top officials from the Trump administration have politicized the death and injury of two children and injured several others in relation to the left-leaning ideology of the shooter, Robin Westman, following an assassination attempt against President Trump last year. Despite this, then-FBI Director Christopher Wray was cautious about speculating about the shooter's motive, stating that he had no knowledge of his intentions. His successor, Kash Patel, cherry-picked a handful of Westman's words, including anti-Catholic references, anti-religious references, and an explicit call for violence against President Donald Trump on a firearm magazine. Patel also stated that the crime was being investigated as a \"hate crime targeting Catholics\". Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed this sentiment, stating Westman had expressed anti-God sentiment and expressed hatred towards groups Republicans have accused the left of attacking. Despite these statements, there is no evidence supporting the claim that trans-identified individuals are more likely to commit such atrocities than those who have previously been accused of being transgender.",
  "shortSummary": "US officials rushed to politicize the Minneapolis school shooting motive, suggesting it may have been motivated by leftist ideology but cautious about attributing it to specific political motives.",

      "text": "How Republicans Fed a Misinformation Loop About the Pelosi Attack\nSuggested Mr. Pelosi\nknew his attacker.\nSuggested the attack\ninvolved male prostitution.\nRepeated a false report\nthat the attacker was\nin his underwear.\nSuggested Mr. Pelosi\nknew his attacker.\nSuggested the\nattack involved\nmale prostitution.\nRepeated a false report\nthat the attacker was\nin his underwear.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Within hours of the brutal attack last month on Paul Pelosi, the husband of the speaker of the House, activists and media outlets on the right began circulating groundless claims \u2014 nearly all of them sinister, and many homophobic \u2014 casting doubt on what had happened.\nSome Republican officials quickly joined in, rushing to suggest that the bludgeoning of an octogenarian by a suspect obsessed with right-wing conspiracy theories was something else altogether, dismissing it as an inside job, a lover\u2019s quarrel or worse.\nThe misinformation came from all levels of Republican politics. A U.S. senator circulated the view that \u201cnone of us will ever know\u201d what really happened at the Pelosis\u2019 San Francisco home. A senior Republican congressman referred to the attacker as a \u201cnudist hippie male prostitute,\u201d baselessly asserting that the suspect had a personal relationship with Mr. Pelosi. Former President Donald J. Trump questioned whether the attack might have been staged.\nThe world\u2019s richest man helped amplify the stories. But none of it was true.\nHere are 21 of the elected officials, candidates and other prominent figures who spread misinformation or cast doubt on the attack.\nIn tweets, podcasts and TV appearances, these figures questioned whether the public was being told the full story of what happened and in some cases spread theories that were unfounded.\nSenator Ted Cruz\nRepublican of Texas\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene\nRepublican of Georgia\nRepresentative Clay Higgins\nRepublican of Louisiana\nLt. Gov. Mark Robinson\nRepublican of North Carolina\nMary Williams Benefield\nRepublican statehouse candidate of Georgia\nState Senator Wendy Rogers\nRepublican of Arizona\nState Representative Anthony Sabatini\nRepublican of Florida\nRepresentative Claudia Tenney\nRepublican of New York\nGlenn Beck\nConservative commentator\nTucker Carlson\nFox News host\nDinesh D\u2019Souza\nConservative commentator\nRyan Fournier\nFounder, Students for Trump\nSebastian Gorka\nFormer Trump adviser and podcast host\nPete Hegseth\nFox News host\nMegyn Kelly\nTalk show host\nElon Musk\nChief executive of Twitter and Tesla\nDevin Nunes\nFormer representative of California\nMichael Savage\nTalk show host\nRoger Stone\nTrump associate\nDonald J. Trump\nFormer president\nRoyce White\nHouse candidate of Minnesota\nThe flood of falsehoods showed how ingrained misinformation has become inside the G.O.P., where the reflexive response of the rank and file \u2014 and even a few prominent figures \u2014 to anything that might cast a negative light on the right is to deflect with more fictional claims, creating a vicious cycle that muddies facts, shifts blame and minimizes violence.\nIt happened after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, which was inspired by Mr. Trump\u2019s lie of a stolen election, and in turn gave rise to more falsehoods, as Republicans and their right-wing allies tried to play down, deny or invent a different story for what happened, including groundlessly blaming the F.B.I. and antifa. Mr. Pelosi\u2019s attacker is said to have believed some of those tales.\n\u201cThis is the dynamic as it plays out,\u201d said Brian Hughes, a professor at American University who studies radicalism and extremism. \u201cThe conspiracy theory prompts an act of violence; that act of violence needs to be disavowed, and it can only be disavowed by more conspiracy theories, which prompts more violence.\u201d\nThe Justice Department moved swiftly to bring criminal charges against the suspect in the attack, David DePape, 42, who prosecutors said broke into the Pelosi home intending to kidnap Ms. Pelosi and shatter her kneecaps, and assaulted her husband with a hammer, leaving him with a cracked skull. The San Francisco district attorney said it was imperative for prosecutors to present the facts to the public, given the misinformation circulating widely about the case.\nBut by then, it was far too late. In a pattern that has become commonplace, a parade of Republicans \u2014 helped along by right-wing media personalities including the Fox New host Tucker Carlson, and prominent people including the newly installed Twitter owner Elon Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest man \u2014 had already abetted the viral spread of lies about the attack, distorting the account of what happened before facts could get in the way. Finding life on far-right websites and the so-called dark web, conspiracy theories and falsehoods leaped from the fringes to the mainstream.\nFringe Websites and Mainstream Figures\nThousands of posts containing conspiracy theories about the attack were shared on message boards, social media and in comments sections of popular far-right sites, according to data from Pyrra, a company that tracks fringe social media. As the chatter picked up, several elected officials and mainstream right-wing influencers also shared their doubts about the attack.\nComments from fringe websites mentioning ...\n\u201cProstitute\u201d or similar terms\nOther sex-related conspiracy theories\nDoubts about the official account\n12:23 p.m. A Fox affiliate in San Francisco\nreports that the attacker was found in his\nunderwear.

That left others to fill the void.\n\u201cJust produce the police body cam, \u2014 why is that so hard?\u201d Mr. Carlson demanded on his show on Wednesday night. Addressing those criticizing the conspiracy theorizing, he added: \u201cWe\u2019re not the crazy people; you\u2019re the liars. There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking questions, period.\u201d\nThe disinformation surrounding the attack on Mr. Pelosi presented many of the standard elements of alt-right conspiracy theories, which relish a culture of \u201cdo your own research,\u201d casting skepticism on official accounts, and tend to focus on lurid sexual activities or issues related to children, often driven by a fear of society becoming immoral.\nNina Jankowicz, a disinformation expert, said no amount of evidence \u2014 be it police body camera footage or anything else \u2014 could get in the way of such falsehoods in the eyes of those who do not want to believe facts.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter when there are documents or sworn testimony claiming something is, in fact, not the case,\u201d Ms. Jankowicz said. \u201cThere will be an elaborate reframing effort. If the footage was released, people would claim it was fabricated. There\u2019s no bottom.\u201d\nMany of the Republicans who amplified the fiction couched their comments as jokes, effectively pre-empting any criticism by suggesting they might not be serious. Hours after the attack, Donald Trump Jr., the former president\u2019s son, shared online a viral image of a costume that included an oversized pair of men\u2019s briefs and a hammer, remarking \u201cthe internet remains undefeated.\u201d\nA spokesman for Mr. Trump said he \u201csimply posted a joke meme and has always rejected political violence in all forms.\u201d\nRepresentative Claudia Tenney, Republican of New York, circulated a photograph on Twitter that showed a group of young, white men holding oversized hammers beside a gay Pride flag, commenting simply: \u201cLOL.\u201d\nMs. Tenney did not respond to a request for comment.\nIt is not clear whether the elected officials and media personalities who have trafficked in falsehoods believe the conspiracy theories they are elevating, or simply want to be rewarded by their right-wing base. According to public polling, as many as 70 percent of Republicans still believe that Mr. Trump was the true winner of the 2020 election.\nMary Williams Benefield, a Republican running for a seat in Georgia\u2019s statehouse, said she had responded online to a tweet suggesting the attack was staged because \u201cthe official narrative is unwilling to present all the facts.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe their daughter has a film crew shooting a documentary on this too,\u201d wrote the mother of three and former music teacher at a church school, making a reference to newly surfaced footage from a documentary Ms. Pelosi\u2019s daughter Alexandra was filming that showed the speaker in a secure location during the Jan. 6 riot.\nIn an interview, Ms. Benefield brought up a report that the police have debunked, which wrongly asserted that the intruder was dressed only in his underwear. The Fox News affiliate that originally reported the detail issued a correction saying the article had previously \u201cmisstated what clothing the suspect was wearing.\u201d\nThat did nothing to change Ms. Benefield\u2019s mind.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions that need to be asked before there\u2019s any legitimacy,\u201d she said.\nAccording to federal charging documents, Mr. DePape was enthralled by the conspiracy theories that have portrayed Ms. Pelosi as an enemy of the country. His online activities show him ranting about the 2020 election being stolen, seeming to deny the gassing of Jews at Auschwitz and claiming that schoolteachers were grooming children to be transgender.\nHis attorney has said he planned to argue that Mr. DePape was so influenced by disinformation that it should be considered a mitigating circumstance."

      "text": "One of the problems with assessing President Donald Trump\u2019s legal retribution campaign against his foes is the many things we don\u2019t know.\nWe don\u2019t know, for example, what evidence the administration actually has against all these people. The fact that it has now launched investigations into key figures involved in every major probe of Trump sure suggests that this is about retaliation.\nAnd its attempts to turn these investigations into public spectacles really give away the game \u2014 as was seen most recently on Friday morning as the FBI was searching the home of former Trump national security-adviser-turned-critic John Bolton.\nOver and over again, the administration has not just probed Trump critics, but it\u2019s made a show of it \u2013 often in ways that run afoul of legal ethics.\nThose ethics rules hold that prosecutors and investigators should not seed unwarranted suspicion of people. They should instead speak through legal filings and keep their public comments to a minimum.\nThe idea is that the legal process is not used to impugn people whom the government doesn\u2019t have the goods on.\nBut the Trump administration has obliterated that norm. That raises the prospect that these people are not necessarily being targeted for prosecution, but for a public shaming and to send a message to others. And a top DOJ official has even acknowledged publicly that could be the goal.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s flouting of these rules and norms really kicked up a notch Friday morning.\nRight around the time the FBI started searching Bolton\u2019s home, FBI Director Kash Patel took to social media. \u201cNO ONE is above the law\u2026 @FBI agents on mission,\u201d he posted on X at 7:03 a.m..\n\u201cPublic corruption will not be tolerated,\u201d FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino added 13 minutes later.\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s safety isn\u2019t negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi added at 7:45 a.m.\nIt\u2019s all quite a contrast to 2022, when the FBI searched Trump\u2019s residence at Mar-a-Lago looking for classified documents.\nIt took two days for then-FBI Director Christopher Wray to become the first senior DOJ official to comment, saying the search was \u201cnot something I can talk about\u201d; he instead talked about threats against FBI officials.\nThen-Attorney General Merrick Garland didn\u2019t comment for three days. When he did speak, it was a just-the-facts-ma\u2019am recitation of how the search came about. Garland took care to emphasize Trump\u2019s \u201cpresumption of innocence.\u201d\nThere were no leading allusions to how this was justice being served or references to \u201cpublic corruption\u201d or nobody being above the law \u2013 at least from top DOJ officials.\nBut the public comments about the Bolton search are very much in keeping with how the Trump Justice Department and other top administration officials have conducted business. They\u2019ve often used these investigations to seed suspicion about Trump\u2019s foes by making extraordinary public comments.\nLast week, top DOJ official Ed Martin was photographed by the New York Post outside the home of another target, New York Attorney General Letitia James, clad in a trench coat. He later appeared on Fox News and suggested it hadn\u2019t been a planned photo-op.\nBut after The New York Times wrote a story about how Martin\u2019s actions had appeared to violate Justice Department ethics guidelines, he posted a photo of himself apparently outside James\u2019 house.\n\u201cGood morning, America. How are ya\u2019?\u201d Martin said.\nThe president\u2019s allies often point to how James, a Democrat, once seemed to pre-judge investigations of Trump, promising to go after him while she was campaigning for her job. James\u2019 comments at the time earned rebukes even from some Democrats.\nBut those kinds of statements and actions have been much more commonplace with key Trump administration officials.\nIn late July, Bondi posted on social media about an ethics complaint the DOJ had filed against a judge who had ruled against the Trump administration, pointing to comments he had made at a judicial conference. But the ethics complaint misconstrued the comments of the judge, James Boasberg.\nIn early June, Bondi used a news conference announcing criminal charges against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man the administration wrongly deported to El Salvador, to surface uncharged allegations against him.\nBondi mentioned allegations from a supposed \u201cco-conspirator\u201d about Abrego Garcia soliciting nude photos and video of a minor and even playing a role in a murder. When a reporter noted such charges weren\u2019t in the indictment, Bondi acknowledged they weren\u2019t.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s ethics manual states that \u201cprosecutors should strive to avoid unnecessary public references to wrongdoing by uncharged parties.\u201d\nWhen former FBI Director James Comey in May posted an image of shells organized to read \u201c86 47,\u201d a series of top Trump administration officials leapt to accuse him of a crime. (Comey said he didn\u2019t know some interpreted \u201c86\u201d to mean violence and deleted the post.)\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard quickly said Comey should be \u201cput behind bars for this.\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced an investigation of the matter, while prejudging it as Comey having called for Trump\u2019s \u201cassassination.\u201d\nComey still hasn\u2019t been charged with anything of the sort; he\u2019s instead being investigated for something else.\nMany of these apparent breaches of prosecutorial protocol have involved Martin, who formerly served as interim US attorney for the District of Columbia, before his nomination was pulled in the face of some GOP opposition. Martin now leads the DOJ\u2019s so-called \u201cWeaponization Working Group.\u201d\nMartin has been unapologetic about using his authority to apply pressure in extraordinary ways, from the earliest days of the Trump administration.\nHe has posted about DOJ officials being \u201cTrumps\u2019 [sic] lawyers,\u201d which isn\u2019t what they are supposed to be. He pledged to go after critics of then-top Trump administration official Elon Musk even when their conduct was merely unethical, rather than illegal. He has publicly suggested Trump critics could be investigative targets. He has used politically charged language like alluding to January 6, 2021, defendants as \u201cJan. 6 prisoners.\u201d\nAnd one comment Martin made near the end of his time as interim US attorney stands out. It\u2019s from May.\n\u201cThere are some really bad actors, some people that did some really bad things to the American people. If they can be charged, we\u2019ll charge them,\u201d Martin told reporters. \u201cBut if they can\u2019t be charged, we will name them. And we will name them, and in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are ashamed.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThat\u2019s the way things work.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not how the Justice Department is supposed to work. But at least it\u2019s transparent."

      "text": "A far-right terrorist who killed 51 Muslim worshipers in New Zealand\u2019s worst mass shooting in modern history will spend the rest of his life in prison with no chance of parole, the first time such a sentence has been handed down in the country\u2019s courts.\nBrenton Tarrant, 29, was sentenced Thursday after pleading guilty earlier this year to murdering 51 men, women and children at two Christchurch mosques on March 15, 2019. The youngest victim was just three years old.\nThe Australian citizen also pleaded guilty to 40 counts of attempted murder and one charge of terrorism \u2013 he is the first person in New Zealand to be convicted of that crime.\nTarrant represented himself at the hearing and chose not to address the court, but instructed lawyer Pip Hall to speak on his behalf. \u201cMr Tarrant does not oppose the application. He should be sentenced to life in prison without parole.\u201d\nJustice Cameron Mander turned to the convicted killer and asked him if he wanted to speak. \u201cNo. Thank you,\u201d Tarrant quietly replied.\nJustice Mander read the names of every victim, both the injured and the dead, telling Tarrant about the lives he destroyed or cut short. \u201cYou showed no mercy. It was brutal and beyond callous \u2013 your actions were inhumane,\u201d Mander told Tarrant.\n\u201cAs far as I am able to gauge you are empty of any empathy to your victims,\u201d Mander added. \u201cYou have said you were in a poisoned emotional state at the time, and terribly unhappy. You felt ostracized by society and wanted to damage society as revenge.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s sentence came at the end of a harrowing four-day hearing at Christchurch High Court where 91 survivors and relatives of the victims described the pain Tarrant had inflicted on the Muslim community.\nTarrant sat quietly, showing little-to-no emotion as they expressed fury, revulsion, forgiveness and sadness.\nAfter his sentencing, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said nothing would take away the pain of the attack.\n\u201cToday I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or utter the name of the terrorist behind it,\u201d said Ardern, who has made a point of not saying extremist\u2019s name. \u201cHis deserves to be a lifetime of complete and utter silence.\u201d\nNew Zealand abolished the death penalty for murder in 1961, and judges cannot impose cumulative sentences for crimes that relate to the same incident, unlike in the United States. Murder carries a mandatory life sentence, although the sentencing judge specifies how long they need to spend in jail before they are eligible to apply for parole.\nWhat happened on March 15, 2019\nThe Christchurch attack was unprecedented in New Zealand, a country of only five million people where gun killings are uncommon. The massacre prompted New Zealand to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons. The public rallied in support of the country\u2019s 60,000-strong Muslim community.\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Crown prosecutor Barnaby Hawes detailed the chilling timeline of the attack.\nOn March 15, Tarrant made the 4.5 hour drive from the South Island city of Dunedin to Christchurch, around 360 km (220 miles) away. At about 1.30 p.m. that day, as worshipers were taking part in Friday prayers, Tarrant sent a message to his family outlining his plans. He then activated a GoPro on his vest and began live streaming to Facebook, Hawes told the court.\nTarrant drove to Al Noor Mosque in an inner-city Christchurch suburb, where he killed 44 people and wounded 35. \u201cHe fired methodically into the bodies and heads of anyone still showing signs of life,\u201d Hawkes said.\nTarrant then sped 6 km (4 miles) to the Linwood Islamic Centre where he killed seven people and injured another five.\nAs he ran back to his car for more ammunition, he was chased by Abdul Aziz Wahabazadah who threw an EFTPOS machine at the gunman\u2019s head. Wahabazadah also picked up a rifle Tarrant had dropped and threw it at Tarrant\u2019s car, shattering a glass panel. \u201cYou should thank God on that day I didn\u2019t catch you. It would have been a different story,\u201d Wahabazadah told Tarrant in court Wednesday.\nAfter Wahabazadah gave his victim impact statement, Justice Mander told him: \u201cI have seen the video and I want to acknowledge your courage.\u201d Applause broke out in the public gallery.\nTarrant was on his way to a third scene in Ashburton \u2013 a town around an hour\u2019s drive from Christchurch \u2013 but was stopped by police who rammed his car and arrested him without resistance.\nDuring the hearing, the court was told that Tarrant began planning the massacre in September 2017 \u2013 18 months before the attack. He got a firearms license and began stockpiling weapons and ammunition. He also took drone vision of the Al Noor Mosque, researched the mosque plans, and noted details about prayer times and important days in the Islamic calendar.\nIn an interview with police, Tarrant admitted \u201cgoing into both mosques to kill as many people as he could.\u201d Hawes told the court that Tarrant planned to burn the mosques to the ground and said he \u201cwished he had done so.\u201d\nHawes said Tarrant intended to instil fear into those he described as \u201cinvaders,\u201d including the Muslim population and, more broadly, non-European immigrants.\n\u2018You are already dead to me\u2019\nDozens of survivors and their supporters were given special exemptions from the government to enter the country so they could be at the sentencing.\nHeavy security was in place around the courthouse and suppression rules prevented Tarrant from using the occasion to promote his extremist views.\nDuring the four-day hearing, many victims directly addressed the man who had taken away their loved ones or attempted to kill them \u2013 and many asked the judge to give Tarrant the harshest possible sentence.\nBefore Tarrant, the heaviest sentence ever handed down was a minimum non parole period of 33 years for William Bell, who killed three people in 2001. That sentence was reduced to 30 years on appeal.\n\u201cYour actions were of gutless character of a person. There\u2019s nothing heroic about your shooting, shooting people from behind and people not having a chance of defending themselves,\u201d said Ahad Nabi, whose father was killed in the attacks. \u201cMy 71-year-old dad would have broken you in half if you had challenged him to a fight. You are weak.\u201d\nAmbreen Naeem lost both her husband Naeem Rashid and her 21-year-old son Talha Naeem in the attacks. In a statement read by a support person, she called the killings \u201cinhumane\u201d and said Tarrant\u2019s punishment \u201cshould continue forever.\u201d\nSome told Tarrant that his true punishment would come later. \u201cKnow that true justice is waiting for you in the next life and that will be far more severe,\u201d said Aden Diriye, whose three-year-old son was among the victims.\nNoraini Milne, whose 14-year-old son Sayyad was shot in the back of the head while he knelt in prayer, told Tarrant: \u201cYou are already dead to me. Whatever punishment you get will never be enough.\u201d\n\u2018I do not see a future without pain\u2019\nMany victims detailed the physical and emotional scars that they were still dealing with a year and a half on \u2013 and would continue to live with.\nTurkish-born Temel Atacocugu, who was shot nine times at the Al Noor Mosque, said he played dead to save his own life. \u201cI thought I was going to die and I tried to lie as still as possible when the gunman came back a second time,\u201d Atacocugu said. \u201cI could feel the blood and brains of the person next to me running down my neck. If I had moved, I wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d\nHe said that six bullets were removed from his body and three remained. Despite multiple surgeries, he remains in pain and is severely depressed. Although he continues to pray at the mosque, he has been unable to work since the shootings and has been forced to sell his business.\n\u201cI feel anxious and nervous with any sounds behind me, and when prayer has finished, I feel a sense of relief nothing has happened to me,\u201d Atacocugu said. \u201cThe trauma will live with me forever, the images and smell of the mosque haunts me. I do not see a future without pain.\u201d\nSazada Akhter, who will likely never walk again, described her horrific injuries through a support person.\n\u201cI am in a wheelchair for the rest of my life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will not stop me from achieving my dreams. While you are in prison please think about what you have done to me.\u201d\nChe Ta Binti Mat Ludin described hiding from the gunman in the women\u2019s prayer room, and seeing dead bodies on the pathway as she left the mosque. After the shooting, she moved back to Malaysia. \u201cI felt unsafe in Christchurch. I feel reluctant to socialize and do not feel like talking to people much.\u201d\nNathan Smith, who is White and Muslim, said that he held a three-year-old boy in his arms at Al Noor Mosque, praying he was still alive. \u201cHe was not. You killed in my name,\u201d he told Tarrant. \u201cAll you have done is cause great shame for Europeans around the world.\u201d\n\u201cYou have changed my life forever and I will never forgive you.\u201d\n\u2018We are not broken\u2019\nOthers struck a defiant tone, telling Tarrant that he had failed in his mission to spread hate \u2013 instead, he had brought the community closer together.\n\u201cMy heart is broken, but we are not broken. You did that. Thank you for that,\u201d Khaled Alnobani, a worshiper at Al Noor Mosque, told Tarrant in court.\nSome, like Mirwais Waziri, who hails from Afghanistan, went off script. Rather than reading his victim impact statement, he told Tarrant: \u201cI came here as a refugee and I\u2019m not going anywhere. You are the loser \u2013 we are the winners.\u201d There was applause from the public gallery as he spoke.\nMohammad Siddiqui, who spent eight days in hospital after being shot in the arm at Al Noor mosque, said he tried not to talk about the attacks because he did not want to give Tarrant the satisfaction.\n\u201cWe have grieved, we have cried, yet we are stronger.\u201d\nSome even offered forgiveness for the man who had taken away their loved ones.\nJohn Milne said he had forgiven Tarrant for killing his 14-year-old son. \u201cYou are a terrorist, a murderer but still a man. Not a single bullet hit me, but there\u2019s a huge hole in my heart.\n\u201cIf you get the chance, I would like you to say sorry.\u201d\nJanna Ezat said that she cries every day for her son Hussein Al-Umari who was killed in the attacks. She takes anxiety and anti-depression medication, and is still haunted by the image of her son\u2019s body, which was returned to her on her birthday.\nShe told Tarrant that she had decided to forgive him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have hate and I don\u2019t have revenge. I forgive. The damage is done and I have only one choice \u2026 I forgive you.\u201d\n\u2018He\u2019s never going to see the light of day again\u2019\nTarrant is likely to spend much of his sentence in solitary confinement, according to Waikato University law professor Alexander Gillespie.\nThat\u2019s partly because allowing him to mix with the general prison population would give him a chance to spread his extremist views. It\u2019s also because some prisoners are \u201cgoing to want to kill him,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just going to have to be roped off for a very long time,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cHe will always have a target on his back.\u201d\nGillespie said it was possible Tarrant would appeal his sentence in a bid to boost his notoriety.\nThere are calls in New Zealand for Tarrant to be sent to his native Australia to serve his sentence, especially given the enormous cost to the taxpayer of keeping him imprisoned for decades. According to a Cabinet paper that was made public earlier this year, 3.6 million New Zealand dollars ($2.35 million) was set aside to cover the cost of only his first two years in custody, suggesting that it could cost tens of millions of dollars each decade that Tarrant is locked up.\nBut currently, transferring Tarrant to Australia is not an option, Gillespie said. For that to happen, New Zealand and Australia would need to sign a prisoner transfer agreement.\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that Ardern hadn\u2019t raised the issue with him. He welcomed Thursday\u2019s sentence, saying: \u201cJustice today was delivered in New Zealand.\u201d\n\u201cAll Australians were and remain horrified and devastated by his despicable terrorist act.\u201d\nWhether Tarrant is sent to Australia or stays in New Zealand, the sentence will stay the same, Gillespie said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s never going to see the light of day again.\u201d\nJournalist Donna-Marie Lever reported from Christchurch, New Zealand.

      "text": "Texas shooting: How false rumours spread that gunman was trans\nMinutes after Tuesday's tragic shooting at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, false rumours began spreading about the identity of the gunman.\nImages of three separate trans women were shared online purporting to be of the gunman, and leading to a barrage of abuse.\nThe inaccurate claims were also amplified by US politicians and political influencers, some of whom also more broadly linked transgenderism to violence.\nRumours begin\nAlmost immediately after the shooting, pictures of the gunman, Salvador Ramos, 18, appeared online.\nRamos didn't have a huge social media footprint - but one photo in particular was widely circulated. Taken from his Instagram and TikTok accounts, it showed him looking into a mirror wearing a dark grey hoodie.\nThe rumour that he was trans appears to have started on the fringe message board 4chan, and in particular the /pol/ or \"Politically Incorrect\" board, which has for years been associated with the far-right and mass shootings. A controversial hub of internet subculture, 4chan has been the birthplace of many harassment and trolling campaigns.\nUsers posted an image of a trans woman who slightly resembled Ramos, along with a link to her Reddit profile, and baselessly claimed she was the gunman.\nIt didn't take long for the claim to migrate to other, larger social platforms, and it began to be repeated by far-right and right-wing activists and politicians.\nConservative activist Candace Owens claimed there were photos of the gunman \"cross-dressing\", and claimed this was evidence that \"there were plenty of signs that he was mentally disturbed\".\nRepublican congressman Paul Gosar, of Arizona, repeated the trans claim in a tweet that he later deleted. Mr Gosar also called the gunman, who was born in the United States, an \"illegal alien\", although Texas governor Greg Abbott, also a Republican, stated that Ramos was a US citizen.\nWe contacted Ms Owens, and Mr Gosar's spokesperson, for comment.\nAnother congressman, Pete Sessions, claimed in an interview on the Today Programme on Thursday that Ramos \"wore dresses\".\nSam, the transgender woman targeted by the 4chan campaign, posted on Reddit saying that she didn't live in Texas and was alive after the shooting, even though Ramos was shot dead.\nBut Sam - not her real name - wasn't the only trans person targeted by false stories. Images of Sabrina, another trans woman, appeared in photo collages alongside the actual photo of the gunman, with similar false claims.\nShe posted an image of herself holding her phone with the time and date visible to prove she was alive after the shooting. And another trans person's image which also appeared on 4chan later popped up in far-right spaces, including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's Infowars website.\nCommon pattern\nThis is not the first time that trans and other LGBT individuals have been the targets of misinformation, says Mallory Moore, a researcher with the Trans Safety Network, a UK-based organisation.\nShe says the organisation advised Sabrina on how to put social media safeguards in place following the attack and online abuse - something she described as \"pre-emptive\".\n\"As things tend to spiral, people will pick through someone's social media and dump it online,\" she says. \"Getting ahead of that is a sensible precaution.\"\nAs often happens after mass shootings, a number of other false rumours spread in the wake of the attack.\nBBC News observed at least a dozen fake accounts claiming to belong to the gunman in the aftermath, most of which were attempts to copy his removed, genuine account on Instagram. Most have been removed."

      "text": "If there was a telling recent moment when it comes to how ugly our political discourse has become, it might well have been the brutal 2022 hammer attack on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul.\nSoon after the attack on the then-82-year-old man, misinformation flowed about Paul Pelosi and the attacker, David DePape. But it wasn\u2019t just right-wing influencers leading the charge; it was also the likes of then-former President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and a coterie of prominent Republicans.\nThese theories generally held or winked at the idea that the attack was a \u201cfalse flag,\u201d and/or that Paul Pelosi had been engaged in a gay lover\u2019s quarrel \u2013 even as he was recovering from nearly being killed.\nThese claims were baseless and highly suspect at the time, and they were ultimately disproven by audio and video evidence. Musk even offered a brief apology.\nBut that episode did nothing to dissuade some observers from doing it again. And again.\nThe lure of quickly politicizing a violent attack with misinformation and speculation has proven more tempting than being circumspect and sensitive about a tragedy.\nSome on the modern right apparently can\u2019t allow that someone on their side could be responsible for such violence, so they\u2019ve again leapt to link the attacker to the other side with innuendo and falsehoods.\nToday\u2019s example deals with the shootings of two Democratic Minnesota state lawmakers. State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, while state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife are recovering at a hospital.\nAuthorities are still piecing together evidence on a possible motive, but Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has said the attack was a \u201cpolitically motivated assassination.\u201d The suspect who has now been detained after a manhunt, Vance Boelter, had an apparent hit list of nearly 70 targets. The names on the list, which CNN obtained, are largely Democrats or figures with ties to Planned Parenthood or the abortion rights movement. A longtime friend, David Carlson, said Boelter is a conservative who supported Trump and opposed abortion rights.\nSo much remains to be learned about what spurred the attack, and it\u2019s important to wait for more information before drawing definitive conclusions. These incidents are often carried out by disturbed individuals with no neat and tidy political motivation.\nBut many on the right weren\u2019t about to wait for all that; they tried to attach the shooter to the left \u2013 and quick.\nThey pointed to the fact that Walz in 2019 had appointed Boelter to the state\u2019s Workforce Development Board \u2013 a group of business owners who consult lawmakers. (The New York Post described Boelter in a headline as a \u201cformer appointee of Tim Walz.\u201d) But such boards, which are numerous in Minnesota, are not particularly high-profile and generally feature a bipartisan cast of characters.\nOthers suggested Hortman had been targeted because she in May spearheaded a compromise with Republicans under which undocumented adults would no longer be eligible for a state health care program. Hortman last week tearfully recounted voting for that compromise. But the other lawmaker victim this weekend, Hoffman, didn\u2019t vote for it.\nStill others pointed to flyers for the anti-Trump \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests this weekend that were allegedly found in Boelter\u2019s car, as if he supported those protests. Protest organizers canceled their events out of fear the protesters could be targeted.\nDespite the tenuousness of the evidence linking the attack to left-wing politics \u2013 and the more-compelling evidence suggesting the opposite \u2013 many prominent right-wing figures have quickly cast Boelter as an angry left-winger.\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah repeatedly suggested Boelter is not just a leftist but a \u201cMarxist\u201d and linked him to Walz in an X post: \u201cNightmare on Waltz Street.\u201d Lee also wrote: \u201cThis is what happens when Marxists don\u2019t get their way.\u201d\nMusk, apparently unchastened by the Paul Pelosi situation, also promoted a post linking the shooter to the left, writing, \u201cThe far left is murderously violent.\u201d\nRepublican Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio added in his own X post about the flyers: \u201cThe degree to which the extreme left has become radical, violent, and intolerant is both stunning and terrifying.\u201d\nDonald Trump Jr. on Monday wagered that that shooter \u201cwent after someone that didn\u2019t just blindly follow Democrat radical leftist dogma.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s scary stuff, but it seems to all be coming from the left.\u201d\nInfluencers went even further, with some of the most prominent and recognizable ones suggesting without any evidence that Walz was somehow involved in the attack. \u201cDid Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?,\u201d asked right-wing figure Mike Cernovich on X.\nWhile these claims have been much more prevalent and firm on the right, Republicans weren\u2019t the only ones leaping to conclusions. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said Sunday that the shooter \u201cappears to be a hate-filled right winger\u201d and urged his side not to dance around \u201cMAGA\u2019s legitimization of political violence.\u201d\nAs noted, there is more evidence for this view than the inverse, but we still don\u2019t know a lot. Murphy has previously cautioned his side about the political perils of being too apolitical soon after school shootings, arguing it cedes the debate and allows people to move on from tragedy without addressing the problem.\nTo be clear, these Republican lawmakers and conservative influencers aren\u2019t just suggestively raising questions \u2013 as their ilk often did with Paul Pelosi\u2019s attackers \u2013 they\u2019re suggesting this is a settled issue.\nThe situation carries echoes of not just the Pelosi attack, but also other recent major acts of political violence in which the right, especially, has leapt to blame others using incomplete or bogus information.\nAfter the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year, Republicans including Trump suggested a link to Democrats\u2019 rhetoric, despite the still-opaque picture of Thomas Matthew Crooks\u2019 politics and motivations. Some congressional Republicans suggested law enforcement deliberately jeopardized Trump \u2013 something that would be a massive scandal \u2013 without evidence.\nMany noted Crooks had once donated a small amount to a Democratic-leaning group, but that group has been criticized for misleading fundraising appeals. And Crooks later registered as a Republican and, according to CBS News, unsubscribed from the group\u2019s email list.\nAfter the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters, many on the right leapt to claim the attacks were somehow the result of provocateurs or even FBI agents. (Lee himself tweeted about a claim that one rioter was flashing a badge, when in actuality it appeared to be a vape.)\nThere remains no evidence for these theories. A report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general last year found no undercover FBI employees were present on January 6 and that none of the FBI\u2019s confidential human sources present had been \u201cdirected by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a real question here about how much of this leaping to conclusions is about prominent people getting caught up in fast-spreading misinformation, or whether there\u2019s a deliberate political strategy. Sharing such misinformation is a great way to win engagement and followers \u2013 and it also muddies the waters.\nShould we one day learn Boelter was indeed a MAGA supporter who targeted Democrats for political reasons, the seeds of doubt about that conclusion will have been planted and fertilized on the right at a crucial, very early stage.\nAnd the price of that is that incidents of political violence could serve to radicalize yet more people against their opponents \u2013 and often, the illusion of those opponents\u2019 violent tendencies. And there is evidence that Americans are viewing these incidents more through the lens of politics.\nWhen then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat from Arizona, was shot in 2011, 71% of people in an NBC News poll said the attack was mostly about a \u201cdisturbed person\u201d rather than political \u201crhetoric.\u201d\nThat number dropped to 46% for the shooting of Republican congressmen at a baseball practice in 2017, to 40% for the attack on Paul Pelosi, then to 37% after the Trump assassination attempt.\nEach of these circumstances were different. But the total picture is one of a country that instantly searches for political answers. And at this moment, one side of the aisle is particularly anxious to provide them \u2013 no matter how true they are."

Westman would have attended Wednesday Mass with other students at the school, they said.\nWestman was \u201cdifferent\u201d for an eighth grader, former classmate Mason Wille said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t think anything of it,\u201d adding that Westman seemed to get along with everybody.\nHearing the news that Westman was suspected as the Annunciation shooter was a shock, Wille said. \u201cI would have never seen this coming.\u201d\nNathan Bergstrom, another former classmate, said he vaguely remembered Westman \u201cwould get mad sometimes, maybe more angry than a normal student would,\u201d but no major incidents. At the time, Westman stuck out for often wearing Heelys \u2013 shoes with a wheel on the bottom \u2013 Bergstrom said.\nA fifth former classmate, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation, said she did remember Annunciation taking disciplinary action against Westman at one point, but she did not know details about what happened.\n\u201cThere was some drama around it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe students and parents never really found out what it was.\u201d\nSeveral former classmates remembered Westman frequently carrying around a notebook \u2013 and one of the former students said she recognized Westman\u2019s handwriting in the videos posted online.\nAfter graduating from Annunciation\u2019s grade school in 2017, Westman attended at least two Minneapolis high schools, including an all-boys private military-style prep school. It\u2019s unclear if Westman graduated from any high school.\nIn 2019, Westman\u2019s mother filed to legally change the shooter\u2019s name from Robert Paul Westman to Robin M. Westman, court documents show. A judge who approved the petition in January 2020 wrote that Westman \u201cidentifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\u201d\nWestman had no past criminal record, according to police and court records.\nThe journal includes discussions of other mass shooters, and dark fantasies about Westman reveling in killing children and following in the footsteps of murderers like Adam Lanza, who gunned down 26 people \u2013 including 20 children \u2013 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012.\nThe entries are also full of racist and antisemitic slurs and sentiments.\nEarlier this year, even while indulging in fantasies about mass violence, Westman described deciding not to carry out an attack to spare family members the pain. But that changed in recent months. In a more recent entry, Westman wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t want to f**king do this I hate myself. I cannot turn back. I cannot stop myself.\u201d\nWestman zeroed in on Annunciation \u2013 and specifically the all-school mass on Wednesday \u2013 after finding an online school schedule, the journal shows. The next month, Westman described making a trial run by going to Mass in the morning and testing doors.\nAt one point, Westman expressed surprise that family members didn\u2019t expect the coming violence.\n\u201cI feel like my mom would have seen it coming due to my rocky past with violent threats,\u201d the journal states. \u201cThe other day my stepmom\u2026 said she could feel a \u2018dark energy\u2019 around me\u2026 if only you know!\u201d\nWestman\u2019s family have not responded to requests for comment from CNN.\nPolice are still investigating where Westman obtained the guns used in the attack, which authorities said included a rifle, a handgun and a shotgun. One of the YouTube videos posted the day of the attack showed antisemitic and racist slurs painted on an array of weapons.\nIn the journal, Westman mentions a plan to try to buy a rifle from an acquaintance, and also opines on how it \u201cshould be harder for people like me to carry out these attacks.\u201d\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said at a press conference Thursday that authorities are not aware of Westman having any prior mental health diagnosis or mental health commitments, which could have prevented Westman from purchasing firearms.\nThe journal entries continued up to just days before the shooting. In one entry dated last week, Westman wrote about plans to go to a shooting range, and described visiting Annunciation to \u201cscout one last time.\u201d\nPages later, Westman scrawled a diagram of the inside of the church \u2013 with pews, windows and aisles clearly marked \u2013 before stabbing the drawing on camera with a knife.\n\u201cWent to church this morning,\u201d Westman wrote, adding that the teachers \u201cwill not be expecting an attack in the very first week of school.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Thomas Bordeaux, and Arit John contributed reporting."

      "text": "Only 38 minutes after a Madison, Wisconsin, teacher called 911 to report Monday\u2019s school shooting, the lies began to spread.\nThe first one, in a post on X, said simply: \u201cTaking bets on another trans shooter.\u201d The post didn\u2019t pick up much traction.\nBut 57 minutes later, the false claims about the shooter\u2019s gender identity found their footing.\nConspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who regularly spreads unfounded claims after shootings, posted on X: \u201cIf the statistical trend continues with this tragic event, there is a 98% chance the shooting is trans or gang related.\u201d Jones has 3.4 million followers on the site, and his post was viewed 282,000 times in a day.\nJones was tapping into a trend on the conservative internet that now plays out after many high-profile crimes: People hunt for clues to try to connect a given crime to transgender people, or they jump to the conclusion that a suspect is transgender regardless of whether evidence points that way or is relevant to the crime.\nConservative news website Townhall followed one minute after Jones, posting a clip of Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes giving a hurried initial news conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a male or female,\u201d he said in the clip.\nThe Townhall clip was eight seconds long and did not show the context of Barnes\u2019 comment. Reporters had asked him several questions and he didn\u2019t know the answer to many of them, such as what type of gun the shooter used. It wasn\u2019t clear from the clip whether the shooter\u2019s gender was ambiguous or whether the chief simply didn\u2019t have the information.\nWithout the context, dozens of X accounts used the Townhall video to speculate that the shooter was transgender. The video received more than 650,000 views, and, after other accounts reshared the video with speculation of their own, the number of views ballooned to more than 1.5 million. For hours afterward, other conservative accounts with millions of followers, including @EndWokeness and Ian Miles Cheong, joined in the speculation about the shooter\u2019s gender and whether it might be nonconforming.\nBut the speculation was wrong: Police eventually identified the shooting suspect as a 15-year-old girl, with no evidence that she was transgender.\nAt a subsequent news conference Monday night, hours after his initial remarks, Barnes was asked by a reporter about the transgender rumors. He said he didn\u2019t know how she identified and that he believed the answer was inconsequential.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that whatever happened today has anything to do with how she or he or they may have wanted to identify,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wish people would kind of leave their own personal biases out of this.\u201d\nLater, the EndWokeness account said in a direct message on X that they shared the video of Barnes\u2019 initial news conference because they found his statement about not knowing the gender hard to believe.\n\u201cIf the guy giving the press conference (police chief) didn\u2019t know and others knew, he should find a new job,\u201d the account posted on Thursday.\nAlex Jones did not respond to a request for comment sent to his media outlet, Infowars. Townhall, Cheong and X did not respond to requests for comment either.\nThe trend of trying to link crime to transgender people is a potential distraction and time-wasting exercise for law enforcement, the news media and social media users who, in the wake of a mass shooting, are trying to sort through fact from fiction. And LGBTQ advocates say the false claims spread irrational fear throughout the community.\nA similar dynamic of falsely saying a mass-shooting suspect is transgender or nonbinary has played out before, including after shootings in Houston in February, in Philadelphia last year and in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022.\nThe Gun Violence Archive, which maintains a database of shootings, estimates that 0.11% of known suspects in mass shootings were transgender over the past decade, said Mark Bryant, the archive\u2019s executive director. The archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured or killed, not counting the shooter. There were many more instances in which trans people were victims, Bryant added.\nFormer Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., added to the baseless speculation Monday afternoon when he asked on X why \u201ctrans control\u201d wasn\u2019t being considered as a response to the shooting, rather than gun control.\nThat prompted a response from Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus.\n\u201cYour ignorance speaks volumes. Your hate is consuming your brains (or what\u2019s left of them),\u201d he posted on X late Monday. His post received only about 47,000 views, compared to the millions of views the false claim got on the platform.\nThe attempts to connect trans people with criminal tendencies are not rooted in fact, experts say.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence whatsoever that trans people are any more dangerous than cisgender people,\u201d said Henry Fradella, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at Arizona State University who has studied the subject.\nSome researchers have looked for a potential correlation, and one study \u2014 conducted in Sweden with data collected since the 1970s, in a broader effort to measure the mortality of trans people \u2014 showed mixed evidence. But an author of that study, Mikael Land\u00e9n, cautioned against interpreting his work as implying that transgender people cause increased crime. Land\u00e9n, in an email to NBC News, said that even if there were a correlation between the two, other factors could be at play, including substance use disorders, socioeconomic stressors and neurodivergent conditions.\n\u201cTo my knowledge, no research has attempted to disentangle these effects,\u201d he wrote.\nTrans people are four times as likely to be the victim of a crime as others, according to a study published in 2021 in the American Journal of Public Health.\nSarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD, an LGBTQ advocacy group, said the anti-trans speculation Monday was a \u201csmoke screen\u201d to hide measures to reduce gun violence.\n\u201cGun violence remains the number one cause of death for children, yet social media extremists routinely exploit these horrific crimes to distract from that fact with more of their harmful rhetoric about vulnerable and marginalized communities,\u201d Ellis said in a statement Tuesday.\nIn the case of Monday\u2019s shooting, the speculation about gender competed for attention with the search for her actual motives. The shooter, Natalie Rupnow, who went by Samantha, died en route to a hospital of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nMany of the posts speculating that Rupnow was transgender came from accounts that have an anti-trans slant in other contexts. Those accounts include Libs of TikTok, which is devoted to sharing videos of trans, queer or progressive people in an attempt to expose what it sees as wrongdoing. Libs of TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe speculation about the Wisconsin shooter happened mostly on X, the app owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk. X conducts minimal content moderation, especially around transgender issues, and Musk has expressed opposition to trans rights. Musk has a trans daughter, from whom he remains estranged. Musk has also made changes to X\u2019s operation \u2014 including revenue-sharing with accounts based on viewership \u2014 that have changed the incentives on the platform.\nSome of the speculation also occurred on other apps including Instagram, where a post saying falsely that the shooter was transgender received more than 2,100 likes. Instagram\u2019s parent company, Meta, did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe X posts from Monday included a decade-old image that has been recycled on a regular basis for alleged transgender shooting suspects: an altered photo of comedian Sam Hyde holding a rifle.\nIt\u2019s not clear why people on X thought that Rupnow was transgender. One X account said \u201cthe trans thing is obvious\u201d from comments on an X account that appeared to belong to her. Other accounts focused on her appearance, calling it \u201cambiguous,\u201d despite her being a minor. Some cited a Discord account with no confirmed connection to her that used they/them pronouns. And one account cited \u201cunconfirmed social media postings\u201d from alleged classmates of Rupnow.\nAfter the posts by Jones and Townhall, other accounts picked up the speculation and spread it. One post alleging that the shooter was trans and \u201con testosterone\u201d received 3.2 million views and, eventually, a user-generated fact-check from X\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes\u201d feature debunked it. Most other posts on the subject did not have community notes."

      "text": "No, there is not an 'epidemic' of shootings by trans people\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting on Aug. 27, a familiar narrative appeared on social media: The suspect, some high-profile accounts began positing, was transgender.\nThis happens almost every time there is a school shooting in America. Commentators and politicians with huge social media followings peddle conspiracy theories that the attacker is trans, and that claim is quickly debunked.\nThis time, however, the claim was correct. The shooter who killed two children and injured 18 more, was, indeed, transgender. Cue the outrage. Right-wing commentators, congresspeople and influencers seized on a now-2-year old narrative that America is witnessing an \"epidemic\" of violence from the trans community.\nThat is not true.\nAmericans who identify as transgender do not attack and kill people at a disproportionate rate. And, according to several experts on extremism and mass shootings interviewed by USA TODAY, there's no evidence gender identity had any influence on Robin Westman's decision to shoot children at a Catholic school. Rather, the evidence the attacker left behind indicates a deep interest in mass shooters and mass shootings, suggesting involvement in an internet subculture that obsesses over these attacks and that has become known as \"nihilistic violent extremism.\"\nIt's essentially killing for killing's sake. It's a search for fame and infamy among an in-group on the internet, and it has characterized several recent deadly school shootings, said Michael Jensen, research director at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism.\n\"What is perpetuating the cycle is this ecosystem online in which individuals are seeking to gain notoriety and doing that through emulating past attackers,\" said Jensen, who who maintains an exhaustive database on incidents of mass violence in America. \"In their minds, one-upping them is doing something more significant \u2212 greater harm that propels their name to the to the top of the list. This is more about an individual seeking notoriety and recognition from a certain community.\"\nThere is no epidemic of trans violence\nThe claim that trans people are disproportionately responsible for mass violence in America comes up every few months.\nIt has never been true, Jensen said.\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of no evidence to support the claim that transgender people are disproportionately responsible for mass violence events in the U.S., including shootings in schools,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cIn fact, the data suggests quite the opposite.\u201d\nJensen\u2019s research has identified more than 1,000 mass casualty plots \u2212 when the perpetrator clearly intended to kill or injure as many people as possible \u2212 since the start of 2023. \u201cYou can count on less than one hand how many of those were perpetrated by a transgender individual,\u201d he said.\nAnd in the case of the Minneapolis shooting, there\u2019s plenty of evidence suggesting Westman was influenced by another community the shooter was a part of, multiple experts on extremism and mass shootings told USA TODAY.\nThe latest example of nihilistic violent extremism\nTwo videos Westman posted to YouTube suggest the attacker was involved with an online subculture that venerates mass shooters, said Hannah Gais, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center. Westman\u2019s writings, viewable in the videos, and the words, phrases and symbolism the shooter drew on the weapons used in the attack show an apparent obsession with past shooting attacks, Gais said.\n\u201cIt showed a mishmash of idolizing other mass shooters,\u201d Gais said. \u201cTo me, this feels very much like an example of nihilistic violent extremism.\u201d\nThat term, \u201cnihilistic violent extremism,\u201d was referenced by Jensen and three other experts on mass violence who spoke with USA TODAY. It describes an extreme online subculture in which participants fetishize and obsess about mass shootings and mass shooters. That subculture is sometimes also called the \u201ctrue-crime community.\u201d\nAgain, this world is not new. For years, online communities on message boards like 8Kun (formerly 8Chan) have celebrated mass shootings and venerated killers \u2212 even anointing the most violent attackers \u201cSaints.\u201d\nWestman\u2019s videos show weapons scrawled with the names of at least three other mass shooters. They also show other clues that the Minneapolis attacker was involved in this subculture, including the use of specific memes, phrases and antisemitic terminology.\nWhat they do not show is any specific political ideology, said Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic, who examined the Minneapolis shooter\u2019s videos closely.\n\u201cOf the pages and pages and pages of this manifesto, it\u2019s all incoherent and self-contradictory,\u201d Caraballo said. \u201cThe way that these people find meaning in their lives is to commit these atrocities and do whatever they can do to get people talking about them.\u201d\nInside a violent, hateful world\nWhat is notable about the Minneapolis shooter\u2019s gender identity is the fact the shooter appears to have chosen to interact with an online community that generally denigrates and vilifies the LGBTQ+ community in general and transgender people specifically, Caraballo said.\nIn that respect, along with the Minneapolis shooter\u2019s apparent obsession with other mass shootings, this week\u2019s attack mirrors the January shooting at Antioch High School in Nashville, Caraballo said. In that case, a 17-year-old Black student injured two people and killed another student and himself. The attacker\u2019s writings and social media posts showed he was also obsessed with mass shooters and had expressed White supremacist beliefs.\nThese two shootings show how young people can become so poisoned by their veneration of mass shooters that they willingly associate with groups who openly hate the same ethnic or gender identity groups they belong to, Caraballo said. That, in turn, causes them to feel more self-hatred and confusion, she said.\n\u201cIt's hard to explain to people that these folks don't actually believe in anything,\u201d Caraballo said. \u201cIt's hard to explain this kind of level of black-pill nihilism to anyone because it fundamentally means that you don't believe in anything \u2212 you just believe everything is meaningless.\u201d\nAt a news conference the day of the attack, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged the public not to use the shooting \"to villainize our trans community.\"\nThe ongoing and untrue narrative that the trans community is disproportionally violent and mentally unstable appears to have gained steam from this week\u2019s shooting as prominent politicians, influencers and commentators post content on social media, including congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and conservative commentator Matt Walsh.\nAnd that backlash is raising concern among transgender Americans.\n\u201cAs the investigation into yesterday's shooting unfolds, we ask the public and the media to remember that one person\u2019s actions must never be used to target or stigmatize entire communities,\u201d said Ash Lazarus Orr, a spokesperson for Advocates for Trans Equality. \u201cTrans and nonbinary people, in particular, are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators.\u201d\nEditor's note: This article was updated with the latest information from the city of Minneapolis on the number of people injured in the attack."

      "text": "Ten years ago, Norwegian far-right extremist Anders Behring Brevik killed 77 people, many of them teenagers, in a bomb attack and gun rampage. The July 22 attacks left Norway, a small, close-knit Nordic country, stunned and grieving.\nJust over a year later, Breivik was sentenced to 21 years in prison, the maximum possible term. And Norway, led by then-Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, came together in a show of unity in the wake of the deadliest violence seen there since World War II.\nA decade on, the anniversary will be an occasion of great sadness for many in the country of just over 5 million people. Several commemorative events are taking place Thursday in the capital, Oslo, and on Utoya Island, where the attacks took place.\nAt a televised memorial concert, King Harald said lessons could be learned. \u201cCertain dates are written into our country\u2019s story as defining days. Days, which in different ways, have contributed to making us who we are today,\u201d he said, according to Reuters.\n\u201cAt the same time, we must acknowledge that we as a society have not done nearly enough to see, to help, to carry the burden together - and to counteract the dark forces,\u201d he added.\nBut it has also prompted questions about the wider impact of Breivik\u2019s radical views on far-right extremism \u2013 circulated in a 1,500-page \u201cmanifesto\u201d shortly before the attacks \u2013 and some soul-searching about how Norway deals with his legacy.\nIn a national memorial address at Oslo Cathedral just two days after the attacks, Stoltenberg called for \u201cmore democracy, more openness, and more humanity.\u201d\nSpeaking with CNN\u2019s \u201cAmanpour\u201d show in an interview to mark the anniversary, Stoltenberg \u2013 now NATO secretary-general \u2013 repeated that message and applauded the way Norwegians had responded. But, he warned, the \u201chatred is still out there.\u201d\nLast month, the University of Oslo\u2019s Center for Research on Extremism (C-REX) published a series of analyses looking at Breivik\u2019s long-term influence.\nThe author of one of the reports, Dr. Jacob Aasland Ravndal, told CNN it appeared more limited than media coverage would suggest. \u201cThere was of course a lot of concern after the attacks that they would generate copycat attacks,\u201d he said. But \u201csomewhat surprisingly,\u201d he said, there haven\u2019t been many clear-cut cases of direct inspiration from Breivik.\nOne of the more apparent links is to the shooting attack in Munich, Germany on July 22, 2016, in which an 18-year-old German-Iranian man killed nine people. The rampage was carried out on the fifth anniversary of the Norway attacks and the attacker had been \u201ctalking a lot about Breivik,\u201d Ravndal said. \u201cBut he was also deeply inspired by many other figures,\u201d Ravndal said, some of them school-shooters.\nThe other obvious case is that of Brenton Tarrant, the Australian far-right terrorist who live-streamed an attack in which he killed 51 Muslim worshipers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March 2019.\nBut although Tarrant claimed to have been inspired by Breivik, investigators found that he had started his planning some time before he read Breivik\u2019s manifesto. \u201cSo even there, you can question how much of an impact Breivik had,\u201d Ravndal said. Tarrant\u2019s own manifesto is very different from Breivik\u2019s, including in its politics, he added.\nUS Coast Guard officer Christopher Hasson, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison last year on weapons and drugs charges, consulted Breivik\u2019s manifesto for tips on amassing weapons, according to another of the papers published by C-REX. Prosecutors alleged that he was a White nationalist who was plotting an attack.\nThe Counter Extremism Project (CEP), an NGO that combats extremist groups, said in a statement Thursday that survivors of Breivik\u2019s attacks had voiced concern regarding his \u201cstatus as an inspirational figure among far-right extremists.\u201d\n\u201c[This status] underlines the need for greater action to target the dissemination of known extremist propaganda with clear links to violence on online platforms,\u201d said David Ibsen, CEP executive director. \u201cThe continued presence of far-right views online, along with greater exposure to extremist content over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, is of particular concern.\u201d\nAccording to Ravndal, research indicates that within Norway the far right has not gained much appeal overall since the attacks and has been unable to turn out supporters in any numbers on the streets.\n\u201cOf course in Norway, as everywhere else, online activity has grown over these 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whether that reflects a substantial increase of far-right activity or simply mirrors the growth of social media on the internet, that\u2019s very difficult to say.\u201d\nShooting spree\nOn that quiet summer day in 2011, Breivik drove a van packed with a homemade fertilizer bomb into Oslo and parked it outside a government office. A few minutes later, it exploded, killing eight people, injuring many more and damaging several buildings.\nBreivik, meanwhile, had set off by car on the 25-mile trip to Utoya Island, where a Labour Party summer youth camp was taking place. Posing as a police officer who was checking on security following the Oslo attack, he caught a ferry to the island and carried out a shooting spree in which 69 people died \u2013 most of them teenagers. Many others were seriously wounded.\nDuring his trial, Breivik boasted of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway, saying he acted out of \u201cnecessity\u201d to prevent the \u201cIslamization\u201d of the country under the ruling center-left Labour Party.\nA court ruling meant his testimony was not televised, denying him a chance to broadcast his views to a wide audience. But Breivik believed his writings would inspire right-wing terrorists to follow in his footsteps.\nWhile parts of his three-book manifesto were lifted from other sources, such as the writings of \u201cUnabomber\u201d Ted Kaczynski in the United States, Breivik also detailed his meticulous, years-long planning and gave strategic and operational advice.\nAccording to Professor Matthew Feldman, director of the UK-based Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right (CARR), Breivik\u2019s document can still \u201ceasily\u201d be found in the darker reaches of the internet despite efforts to remove it.\nThat manifesto was \u201cparadigmatic,\u201d Feldman said, \u201cnot just because it showed what one individual can do in terms of the horrific loss of life\u201d but also in its targeting of Muslims and what Breivik called \u201ccultural Marxism.\u201d\nEven more importantly, Feldman said, Breivik\u2019s case showed the dangers posed by lone-wolf actors who self-radicalize online through networks of like-minded individuals and carry out their preparations for violent attacks online, making them very hard to detect.\nAt the same time, Feldman said, there has been the \u201cslow rise, some would call it mainstreaming, of right-wing extremism,\u201d helped in part by exposure on right-wing media platforms. \u201cFor some it was laid bare on January 6 in the United States [in the assault on the Capitol] but it\u2019s something that\u2019s been gathering pace slowly but steadily in recent decades,\u201d he said.\nDespite this backdrop, Breivik\u2019s actions and manifesto have gained limited traction, according to Ravndal.\nHis analysis for C-REX indicates that \u201cin the beginning the far-right across the board rejected him,\u201d said Ravndal. An online support network that was established for Breivik later collapsed. It was only with the emergence of online forums like 4chan and 8chan that Breivik once again started to get positive mentions, Ravndal said.\n\u201cThe main finding, all in all, both when it comes to tactics but also for political, ideological support, is that it\u2019s been surprisingly little,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been possible to find support, but fortunately less than one might have worried about initially considering the high death toll and all the attention these attacks got globally.\u201d\nSocietal impact\nToday, the debate has shifted in parts of Norwegian society to broader ideological questions, Ravndal said.\nSome \u2013 particularly in the youth wing of the Labour Party \u2013 feel that there has not been a reckoning with the country\u2019s far-right movement, the biggest player in which is the populist, right-wing Progress Party, he said.\nBreivik had been a member of the Progress Party when he was younger but the party distanced itself from him after the attack.\nIn a joint statement published on the party\u2019s website earlier this month, party leader Sylvi Listhaug and deputy leaders Ketil Solvik-Olsen and Terje S\u00f8viknes pushed back against any suggestion that the Progress Party was not united with other Norwegians in rejecting Breivik\u2019s attitudes and actions.\n\u201cWe must all stand together against violent extremism \u2013 regardless of whether it comes from the \u2018far right\u2019, \u2018far left\u2019 or extreme interpretations of religion,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOnly the extremists will win if we exclude each other from the grief after July 22 and weaken the unity around the struggle for democracy, freedom of expression and equality.\u201d\nLabour has promised that if it wins power in elections this September, it will set up a new commission to look at radicalization.\nThere is also debate about whether the attack should be interpreted as an attack on Norwegian society as a whole, or as an attack on the Labour Party specifically, Ravndal said. \u201cToday, some within the Labour Party perhaps feel that that part of the story has been neglected a bit.\u201d\nFeldman considers that Norway\u2019s response was shaped by the sense that the perpetrator was \u201cone of their own,\u201d as were the victims, without a sense of \u201cotherness\u201d to force a more multicultural response.\n\u201cNorway essentially asked itself this question, and it\u2019s a very valid one \u2026 \u2018How did Norwegian society produce such a monster?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very inward-looking question.\u201d\nBy contrast, he said, New Zealand took a much more global approach as it looked at what led up to the Christchurch attacks. This was in part because Tarrant, an Australian, had targeted worshipers at mosques, many of whom were foreign-born.\nAt the same time, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s response, including wearing a hijab to meet survivors and relatives of those killed, was central in bringing all New Zealanders together in support of the victims as fellow citizens, he said.\nJust weeks later, New Zealand collaborated with France to produce the \u201cChristchurch Call\u201d \u2013 a commitment by governments and tech companies to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online \u2013 and subsequently worked with the United States and United Nations to keep the issue on the agenda, Feldman said.\nHe hopes to win further commitments to counter extremist content online at an event he is involved with in Bergen, Norway, next month.\nBreivik\u2019s ideology \u2018is still out there\u2019\nSpeaking to CNN earlier this month, Stoltenberg spoke of the shock he felt as he realized the scale of the horrors perpetrated by Breivik \u2013 and the personal sadness it brought, since he knew many of the victims.\nHe also stood by the message he delivered to the nation as it was still reeling from the July 22 attacks.\n\u201cI still believe that our answer was the right one,\u201d Stoltenberg told CNN. \u201c[Breivik] wanted to attack our free, open democratic societies. So the best response is more openness, more democracy, because then we prove that he is not winning, we are winning.\n\u201cHe demonstrated hatred. The best response to hatred is love. So \u2026 I really welcomed the strong message from the people of Norway, as (we) have seen also in many other countries that have been attacked, that we stand up for our values.\u201d\nThat notwithstanding, Stoltenberg does not believe that Breivik has been entirely defeated.\n\u201cHe is convicted, he is in prison. But his ideology, that is still out there. And therefore we need to continue \u2013 I think we never will be in the position where we can say that we have won the fight, we can close the chapter fighting against extremism.\u201d\nSince 2011, Norway has implemented measures to protect \u2013 as far as possible \u2013 against such attacks in the future, Stoltenberg said. And, he added, Brevik \u2013 whose 21-year sentence could be extended in the future if he still poses a threat \u2013 has lost in one key respect.\n\u201cWe have to understand that the purpose of this attack was to change Norway fundamentally. And \u2026 yes, of course, this will be part of Norway\u2019s history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be part of who we are as long as we exist. But fundamentally, it has not changed who we are.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report."
