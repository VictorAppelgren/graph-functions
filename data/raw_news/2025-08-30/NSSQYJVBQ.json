  "content": "Fears are mounting that the movement also threatens to take hold in the UK\n\nLONERS AT WAR The dark world of \u2018Sovereign Citizens\u2019 ready to KILL\u2026 with fears anti-establishment extremists will spark carnage in UK\n\nGUNSHOTS echoed through the crisp morning air - a foreign sound in the normally idyllic countryside - as a routine warrant execution turned deadly.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, two policemen were shot dead in cold blood and a third was left hospitalised, with the alleged shoot - self proclaimed \"Sovereign Citizen\" Dezi Freeman - still on the run.\n\nThe man-hunt for the \u201chomicidal Bear Grylls\u201d still rages - and the spotlight has once again been shined on the \"cult-like\" belief shared by hundreds of thousands worldwide.\n\nWhile most common in the United States and Australia - it is believed tens of thousands of Brits also lean towards the ideology that has been linked to numorous acts of violence.\n\nPolice are struggling to locate the radical, self-proclaimed sovereign citizen in the Victorian high country, fighting against the harsh environment and winter weather.\n\nThe 56-year-old fugitive is part of a growing number of people who self-identify as Sovereign Citizens, a group of anti-establishment and anti-government individuals, conspiracy theorists and tax protesters.\n\nAdherents to the extreme libertarian ideology believe they have a right to live under their own laws without any government interference.\n\nAnd many have shown they are willing to kill or be killed in pursuit of that goal.\n\nChillingly, experts fear the movement - that has taken root Down Under and in parts of the US - also threatens to take hold in the UK.\n\nSovereign Citizens hold deeply anti-government beliefs which often coincide with conspiracy thinking.\n\nTheir main tenet is that governments have been replaced by a corporation that controls people through birth certificates, licences and other identification documents.\n\nThe movement was born in the US in the 1970s and believers have since been labelled as \"anti-government extremists\" by the FBI.\n\nDr William Allchorn from the American International University in London, said there are two main groups active in the UK - the Sovereign Citizens and the slightly distinct \"Freeman on the land\" movement.\n\n\u201cThese groups reject government authority, legal systems and taxation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMembers often employ pseudolegal arguments to challenge legal obligations, such as refusing to pay taxes or contesting fines.\"\n\nHe explained there are tens of thousands of people in the UK who adhere to these beliefs.\n\nDr Allchorn added there had been evidence of cross communication between groups, in both \u201cideological overlap and informal collaboration\u201d.\n\nWhile the UK has not experienced widespread violence, Dr Allchorn said \u201cthe potential for escalation\u201d existed - pointing to the double cop killing this week in Australia.\n\n\u201cThis \u2026 underscores the potential for violent actions stemming from sovereign citizen ideologies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe UK has seen some clashes - such as a sovereign citizen-linked group led by the self-proclaimed \"Chief Judge of England\" Mark Christoper trying to kidnap a coroner in Essex.\n\nThe risk of violence among sovereign citizen communities is not limited to Australia, according to Dr Joe McIntyre from the University of South Australia, who called the movement a \u201cglobal phenomenon\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe potential for violence has been present for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe UK is in no different position to Australia on this.\n\n\u201cThough there is a slightly different emphasis on types of crime, we\u2019ve seen the same growth, the same radicalisation and it\u2019s becoming increasingly problematic with the rise of generative AI.\u201d\n\nDr McIntyre said the groups had a \u201ccult-like\u201d appeal.\n\n\u201cPsychologically, there is something deeply captivating when you\u2019ve got a community of righteous warriors around you trying to save society from the corrupt government,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessor Christine Sarteschi from Chatham University said the groups would continue to rise in popularity, but governments are beginning to take them more seriously.\n\n\u201cAustralia, for example, is taking the group more seriously,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c[They] are being seen for what they are - disruptive, combative people who will not follow the laws of their country.\u201d\n\nPeople are motivated to join these groups for various reasons, including \u201ca belief the legal and political systems are corrupt or unjust\u201d and a desire to \u201creject external authority\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe movement has integrated with other anti-establishment and conspiracy-driven ideologies, such as anti-vaccination and far-right groups,\u201d Dr Allchorn said.\n\n\u201cOnline platforms have helped facilitate the spread of these ideologies and allowed individuals to connect, share resources and reinforce their beliefs across borders,\u201d Dr Allchorn added.\n\nBack in Australia, Freeman remains on the run, however his alleged fatal attack is not the first incident to end in police officers losing their lives Down Under.\n\nIn 2022, couple Gareth and Stacey Train alongside Gareth\u2019s brother Nathaniel Train, shot dead constables Rachel McCrown and Matthew Arnold and their neighbour Alan Dare, on a Queensland property.\n\nThe incident has since been linked back to a notorious American sovereign citizen Donald Day Jr, who was a \u201cclose confidant\u201d of the Trains family.\n\nDay Jr has since been arrested and charged with inciting violence online and making interstate threats.\n\nAnd there have been a number of killings linked to the movement in the US, such as Gavine Eugene Long who shot six police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana - killing four.\n\nThe Christmas parade car ramming attack in Waukesha, Wisconsin, that killed 6 and injured 62 was also carried out by a soverign citizen Darrell Edward Brooks Jr.\n\n\u201cSOVEREIGN citizens\u201d \u2013 often called SovCits \u2013 are part of a fringe movement that falsely claims individuals can opt out of Australian law and government authority. Followers often argue they are not bound by taxes, licences, fines, or court rulings. The movement has existed in Australia for decades, borrowing heavily from conspiracy theories in the US. While always on the margins, SovCits became more visible during the Covid pandemic, when mistrust in government and police surged. Although many adherents are non-violent, police say confrontations can escalate when SovCits refuse to recognise authority. Some have clashed with officers over property disputes, traffic stops, and legal orders. The Australian Federal Police has warned the movement has \u201can underlying capacity to inspire violence.\u201d A 2023 AFP briefing note said SovCits are becoming more organised, using social media to spread their views and recruit supporters. Authorities say numbers remain small but pockets of activity have been reported in regional areas. Most activity involves disruptive legal claims and anti-government rhetoric \u2014 but some adherents have been linked to armed standoffs and violent threats.",
