      "feedback": "Actionable edit note: restructure the piece into a tight 3–6 month scenario map with a clear causal chain from tariff policy and enforcement to real-world transmission through inputs, prices, and margins; drop tangential tech-sentiment dives (e.g., the M6 MacBook MacBook notes) and instead anchor every assertion to one of the IDs in the SOURCE MATERIAL; attach a source ID after each data point or claim to ensure density and traceability. Build the scenario map as: Baseline (tariffs remain elevated with tight enforcement), Trigger-driven Alternate A (Supreme Court or DOJ actions alter authority or enforcement intensity, or a favorable court stay shifts near-term flows), Alternate B (tariff escalations or broader use of IEEPA-type measures materialize, sustaining price/margin pressure). For triggers/invalidations specify timing windows: oral arguments around July 31 with a decision within the ensuing weeks to months (WLXM1819K; OFY11YO0I); UK DCTS rollout and Asia Regional Cumulation Group in early 2026 with Sri Lankan apparel benefiting from 100% input sourcing while keeping zero tariff entry (WLXM1819K); Goodyear-style tariff exposure reinforces pass-through dynamics (tariff costs about $300–$350 million annually and roughly $4 per tire passed to consumers) to calibrate inflation/pass-through relevance for manufacturing sectors (AJTHKYXQ3). Quantify base-case and alts with ranges drawn from sources: tariff-driven annualized cost around $350m (Goodyear) and recent UK Sri Lanka export gains (Sri Lanka apparel exports up 20.4% to $67.33m in June 2025; 5.2% YoY to $439.39m) to anchor demand/diversion signals (AJTHKYXQ3; WLXM1819K). Ensure the watch-list includes: Supreme Court stay/decision timing (WLXM1819K; OFY11YO0I), progress of the UK DCTS/Asia Cumulation Group (WLXM1819K), and any near-term inflation surprises that validate or deflate tariff-pass-through expectations (AJTHKYXQ3; OFY11YO0I). Revise for coherence by aligning all path-dependencies to a single frame: policy risk (tariff authority and enforcement), supply-chain reconfiguration, and demand-side transmission through prices; drop redundancy, keep every assertion tethered to a source ID, and end with a concise base-case, 1–2 alts, explicit risks, and a confidence rating (cite after each point).",
