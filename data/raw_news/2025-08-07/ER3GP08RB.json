  "title": "How mountain meditation helped SF Giants\u2019 Adames find his form",
  "description": "Adames is tied for third among all players in WAR since June 10",
  "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Willy Adames found himself meditating on a mountain in Colorado.\n\nAdames had not been performing well when the Giants flew into Denver for a three-game series against the Rockies in early June. As a hitter, he was below average. As a defender, he was subpar. As a player, he was underperforming.\n\nAmid those struggles, Adames took a mental respite. On June 8, he sat out for the first time all year. On June 9, the Giants had an off day and Adames retreated to the mountains with a close friend, someone who had previously guided him in meditation.\n\nOnce Adames descended that mountain, he began his ascension as a player.\n\n\u201cIt made me go back to my roots,\u201d Adames said. \u201cI come from a small town in the Dominican Republic, which is in the mountains. She said, \u2018Let\u2019s go to the mountains \u2014 the waters and rivers \u2014 so you can remember where you come from and who you are.\u2019 That helped a lot. That cleaned my mind of all the stuff that was going on.\u201d\n\nIn December, the 29-year-old shortstop joined the Giants on a seven-year, $182 million deal, the largest contract signed by a free agent in franchise history. With that money came the burden of expectation.\n\nAdames has always been a slow starter over his eight-year career, but his new contract amplified his struggles in April and May. The Giants were winning, but their new franchise cornerstone wasn\u2019t performing.\n\nBy May\u2019s end, Adames was hitting .207 with five home runs and a .620 OPS. Adames didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be susceptible to the pressure that comes with signing a large deal. That is, until he felt it himself.\n\nAdames found himself doing too much, perpetually cognizant of the expectations that come with signing a nine-figure deal. His inner circle told him the right things, affirming to Adames that he would be fine. Adames heard them; he just couldn\u2019t believe them.\n\n\u201cThe first month, I was OK and I was hitting the ball well, but I wasn\u2019t putting up numbers,\u201d Adames said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s like, \u2018The next month, I have to do it.\u2019 Then I put myself in a bad situation there because I was striking out a lot and not being myself because I was trying too much.\u201d\n\nHitting coach Pat Burrell knows Adames\u2019 struggles all too well.\n\nBurrell spent the first nine years of his career with the Philadelphia Phillies, averaging about 28 homers per season and putting up an .852 OPS. After beating the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2008 World Series, he joined them in free agency. He never performed with the Rays and was shipped to the Giants in 2010.\n\n\u201cIt can be challenging for these players to come to new settings, new surroundings,\u201d Burrell said. \u201cPut yourself in their shoes. It\u2019s new clubhouse, new city. You might have family, wife, kids, all that. It\u2019s a lot.\n\n\u201cTypically, when guys do make that change or do that transition, it takes them a little while to get comfortable. So, we embrace it. It\u2019s Year 1 of seven years. We want him to respect us. We want him to enjoy his teammates and enjoy being part of a team.\u201d\n\nAs Adames looked over Colorado\u2019s vast landscape, he allowed himself to let go.\n\nHe rid himself of the thoughts that had plagued him for the first two months of the season. He knew his numbers would improve by September. He had become one of baseball\u2019s better shortstops over seven seasons in Tampa Bay and Milwaukee by being himself \u2014 and only himself. There was no reason to change now.\n\nAdames homered against the Rockies in his first game back from his double off day. He went yard the next day, too, his 452-foot blast being the longest home run by a Giant this season. In retrospect, it was the start of an extended run of excellence.\n\nSince June 10, Adames is tied for third among all players in WAR (according to FanGraphs). During that stretch, he\u2019s hitting .286/.367/.555 with 13 homers and 35 RBIs.\n\nAlong with the offense, Adames\u2019 defense has remarkably improved as well. Adames was worth -5 outs above average following his two-error game against the Chicago Cubs on May 5. Entering Thursday, Adames has been worth +3 outs above average on the season.\n\n\u201cThat (day) put me in a better spot mentally. Since that day, I was like, \u2018Just be yourself,\u2019\u201d Adames said. \u201cIt\u2019s been better. It\u2019s been going in the right direction even though we haven\u2019t been playing the best ball as a team. We\u2019re moving forward.\u201d\n\nAdames is personally thriving, but now he\u2019s fighting another battle.\n\nThe Giants have been one of baseball\u2019s worst teams in recent weeks. They transitioned from buyers to sellers and traded Camilo Doval, Tyler Rogers and Mike Yastrzemski. They\u2019re just 17-26 since adding three-time All-Star Rafael Devers on June 15 and are currently five games behind the San Diego Padres for the final NL wild card spot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still struggling mentally because I\u2019m a big team guy,\u201d Adames said. \u201cThat\u2019s why in the beginning when I was struggling people asked, \u2018How are you doing?\u2019 We were winning. Now, I\u2019m getting better, but as a team, are we better? It\u2019s that balance. I haven\u2019t been at my best yet because I haven\u2019t gotten both at the same time: me doing good and (us) playing good baseball.\u201d\n\nAdames has already climbed one mountain. As the Giants push for the playoffs, he\u2019s hoping to climb more.",

      "text": "By BEN WALKER and RONALD BLUM\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jen Pawol is set to become the first woman to umpire in Major League Baseball when she works games this weekend between the Miami Marlins and Atlanta Braves.\nPawol will work the bases in Saturday\u2019s doubleheader at Truist Park and the plate on Sunday, MLB told The Associated Press on Wednesday.\nPawol, a 48-year-old from New Jersey, worked spring training games in 2024 and this year.\nMLB\u2019s move comes 28 years after the gender barrier for game officials was broken in the NBA, 10 years after it ended the NFL and three years after the men\u2019s soccer World Cup employed a female referee. The NHL still has not had a woman referee.\nPawol in 2024 became the first woman to umpire big league spring training games since Ria Cortesio in 2007. Cortesio spent nine years in the minor leagues, including the last five in the Double-A Southern League, then was released after the 2007 season.\nPawol was an all-state softball and soccer player in New Jersey for three seasons in each sport at West Milford High School. She went to Hofstra on a softball scholarship and became a three-time all-conference pick and was on the USA Baseball women\u2019s national baseball team in 2001.\nPawol got a master\u2019s degree and was living in the Binghamton area of New York and taking teacher certification classes at Elmira College while still playing on the side.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really satisfied,\u201d she said last year. \u201cComing off of a huge competitive career, just playing locally, I wasn\u2019t getting my fix. And I remember looking at the umpire and being like, I think that\u2019s it. I got to go for that.\u201d\nAfter umpiring NCAA softball from 2010-16, she attended an MLB umpire tryout camp in 2015, was invited to the Umpire Training Academy at Vero Beach, Florida, and was offered a job in the Gulf Coast League in 2016.\nViolet Palmer became the NBA\u2019s first woman referee when she worked Dallas\u2019 opener at Vancouver on Oct. 31, 1997, and Sarah Thomas was the NFL\u2019s first woman on-field official when she served as line judge for Kansas City\u2019s game at Houston on Sept. 13, 2015.\nSt\u00e9phanie Frappart of France became the first woman to referee a men\u2019s World Cup game when she worked Germany\u2019s 4-2 group stage win over Costa Rica on Dec. 1, 2022, and Rebecca Walsh became the first to referee in England\u2019s Premier League when she officiated Burnley\u2019s 2-0 win at Fulham on Dec. 23, 2023.\nMLB has 76 full-time staff umpires and uses fill-ins on crews for openings created by injuries and vacations.\n___\nWalker is a retired AP Baseball Writer."

      "text": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Jerar Encarnacion cannot catch a break.\nThe Giants\u2019 4-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday at PNC Park was dimmed by Encarnacion sustaining a right hamstring injury after hitting his second home run in as many days. Encarnacion still needs to undergo an MRI, but manager Bob Melvin did not sugarcoat the prognosis.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d Melvin said. \u201cYou get hurt in spring training, you\u2019re playing catch up all the time. We get him back here the first time. Now, finally gets enough at-bats. We see the type of at-bats and what we\u2019ve been wanting from him, especially as far as (against) left-handed pitching. He\u2019s going to be down for a while now, unfortunately. It just ends up being, so far, a really tough year for him.\u201d\nThe Giants lessened the blow of losing Encarnacion by taking two of three from the Pirates after taking two of three from the New York Mets. This 4-2 road trip comes after San Francisco was swept by both New York and Pittsburgh right before the trade deadline during its most recent homestand.\nThere was no shortage of contributors as the Giants improved to 58-57 on the season.\nDominic Smith delivered a go-ahead, pinch-hit RBI double in the top of the ninth. Robbie Ray tossed six innings of two-run ball with eight strikeouts. Patrick Bailey had a run, an RBI and two hits after entering as a pinch-hitter. Randy Rodr\u00edguez bounced back from Monday\u2019s blown save to shut the door with a 1-2-3 ninth inning.\nAnd there was also Encarnacion, who showed off his elite power with an awe-inspiring, no-doubter to left field, his second homer in the last 24 hours. At 442 feet, Encarnacion\u2019s solo shot was the Giants\u2019 second-farthest home run of the season, not too far behind Willy Adames\u2019 452-foot homer at Coors Field in June.\nNow, Encarnacion will likely have to wait quite a while before taking another at-bat for San Francisco.\n\u201cIt really sucks,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe\u2019s so young and so talented and means so much to this group. He\u2019s so selfless. If you see his energy in here, he was happy that we got the win. He was pulling for everybody, and he didn\u2019t really make it about himself. That\u2019s the type of person and player he is, and somebody that you root for and really want on your team and in your clubhouse.\u201d\nWith Encarnacion set to hit the injured list, Grant McCray is poised to receive a good chunk of playing time in right field going forward. The Giants will likely recall a right-handed hitting corner outfielder to take Encarnacion\u2019s place on the active roster, the two likeliest candidates being Luis Matos and Marco Luciano.\nLuciano, who has yet to make his season debut, has been on a power surge over the last month. Entering Wednesday, Luciano has hit eight home runs and posted a 1.037 OPS since July.\nEncarnacion was poised to make the Opening Day roster following his excellent play during spring but suffered a left hand fracture right before the start of the season. He made his season debut June 2 following an abbreviated rehab assignment, but the bad luck continued when he strained his left oblique and hit the injured list on June 17.\nAfter being reinstated from the injured list prior to Friday\u2019s 5-4 loss, Encarnacion hit his first home run of the season in Saturday\u2019s all-around 8-1 win. In the fourth inning on Wednesday, he took the Pirates\u2019 Andrew Heaney deep to tie the ballgame at one apiece.\nTwo innings later, Encarnacion\u2019s afternoon took a turn for the worse.\nIn the top of the sixth, Encarnacion hit a grounder up the middle that looked on its way to center field. Pirates second baseman Nick Gonzales made a sliding stop and fired to first for the out. Encarnacion immediately began hobbling after crossing first base and grabbed at his right hamstring, prompting a visit from trainer Dave Groeschner.\nEncarnacion would walk back to the dugout under his own power but had a noticeable limp. Melvin removed Encarnacion from the game and replaced him with McCray, who went hitless in his one at-bat.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big part of our lineup,\u201d Ray said of Encarnacion. \u201cHe\u2019s got pop. He\u2019s got power. He brings a different dynamic to our lineup that feels like we\u2019ve been missing a little bit. Hopefully, it\u2019s not too bad and he won\u2019t miss too much time.\u201d"

      "text": "Outs Above Average (OAA)\nDefinition\nOuts Above Average (OAA) is a range-based metric of skill that shows how many outs a player has saved. Prior to 2020, OAA was an outfield-only metric. But it has been expanded to include infielders. OAA is calculated differently for outfielders and infielders (details below).\nOutfielders\nOuts Above Average for outfielders starts with Catch Probability, which takes the distance an outfielder must go, the time he has to get there, and the direction he travels to put a percentage of catch likelihood on each individual batted ball. OAA for outfielders is the season-long cumulative expression of each individual Catch Probability play. For example, if an outfielder has a ball hit to him with a 75 percent Catch Probability -- that is, one an average outfielder would make three-quarters of the time -- and he catches it, he'll receive a +.25 credit. If he misses it, he'll receive -.75, reflecting the likelihood of that ball being caught by other outfielders.\nAdding up credit for every play made or not made contributes to a seasonal Outs Above Average number. In 2019, Victor Robles led MLB outfielders with +23 OAA.\nIn addition, the leaderboards show columns for \"Expected Catch Percentage,\" \"Actual Catch Percentage,\" and \"Catch Percentage Added,\" providing the ability to see how a player has performed on a rate basis.\n\u2022 Expected Catch Percentage shows how many plays an average outfielder would be expected to come up with based on the difficulty of the batted balls hit to the outfielder in question. Of the outfielders with at least 150 chances in 2017, Mike Trout's Expected Catch Percentage of 89 was the highest, meaning an average outfielder catches 89 percent of the balls Trout saw. This shows he got the least challenging opportunities sent his way, while Norichika Aoki, at 77 percent, got the toughest.\n\u2022 Actual Catch Percentage shows the production of the actual fielder on the balls hit his way. Given the difficulty of batted balls, Trout would be expected to make the catch 89 percent of the time, but in actuality, he made the catch 88 percent of the time.\n\u2022 Catch Percentage Added shows the difference between the Expected and Actual numbers. For example, Heyward and Ben Gamel were each given the same difficulty of opportunities, being expected to catch 86 percent. But with an Actual Catch Percentage of 90, Heyward added four points of value. Meanwhile, Gamel's Actual Catch Percentage was 83, so he subtracted three points of value. Heyward was seven points more valuable on a rate basis than Gamel, and +18 (comparing his +10 to Gamel's -8) Outs Above Average on a cumulative basis.\nInfielders\nOuts Above Average for infielders takes the following factors into account.\n\u2022 How far the fielder has to go to reach the ball (\"the intercept point\").\n\u2022 How much time he has to get there.\n\u2022 How far he then is from the base the runner is heading to.\n\u2022 On force plays, how fast the batter is, on average. (A runner's average Sprint Speed is used in the calculation, rather than his Sprint Speed on that particular play. For new players with no data, a league-average -- 27 ft/sec -- score is used; once the player qualifies for the leaderboard, all of his previous plays are re-run.)\nThe Statcast technology allows us to know exactly where each fielder stands, which is helpful in a baseball world where shifting and out-of-position defenders are commonplace. What that means is that every tracked play is accounted for, regardless of if the third baseman is standing in his regular spot, at shortstop or in short right field. It allows you to know exactly \"how far\" and \"how much time,\" regardless of shifts. It also allows for an OAA breakdown by fielder role.\nFor example, Nolan Arenado was +17 OAA in 2019, all coming as a third baseman, because he played every single inning of his season at third base. But that doesn't mean he was always standing at third base. Due to shifting, Arenado's +17 actually breaks down into +14 OAA where third basemen typically play, and +3 OAA where shortstops play.\nJavier Baez led all infielders with +19 OAA in 2019. His breakdown: +17 where shortstops typically play, and +2 where second basemen play, even though he technically was never listed on the lineup card as a second baseman in 2019.\nAdditional resources\n\u2022 Statcast introduces Outs Above Average metric\n\u2022 Statcast Outs Above Average metric expanded to include infielders"
