  "content": "The best smoke detectors quickly and reliably detect fire and carbon monoxide to alert you to potential danger. As a residential carpenter, I've installed plenty of hardwired and battery-powered smoke detectors over the years. For this guide, I interviewed three fire safety experts and tested dozens of smoke detectors for sensitivity, audibility, and ease of installation, using an aerosol spray to mimic real smoke. The best smoke detector you can buy is the X-Sense SC01, which is easy to install, reliable, and loud. It came highly recommended by fire safety experts, performed strongly in our tests, and has a 10-year battery life, so you don't have to worry about changing the batteries or incessant chirping every few months. If the X-Sense is unavailable, we also like the First Alert PRC710, which came in just behind X-Sense in our testing.Learn more about how Insider Reviews tests and researches home products.Best overall: X-Sense SC01 - See at AmazonRunner up: First Alert PRC710 - See at AmazonBest dual-sensor: First Alert SM310 - See at AmazonBest interconnected: X-Sense Wireless Interconnected - See at AmazonBest for heavy sleepers or hearing loss: First Alert BRK 7030BSL - See at Amazon\n              The X-Sense SC01 features a 10-year lithium battery, carbon monoxide detector, and a color-changing LED to let you know its current status.\n            SpecificsThe X-Sense SC01 responded well in my testing and activated its alarm within two sprays of the aerosol. Its loud alarm could be clearly heard from across the 2,700-square-foot house I tested it in, and its red LED flashed continuously while the alarm was sounding. The alarm and light shut off simultaneously when the sensor no longer detected any aerosol. The X-Sense SC01 lacks an ionization sensor and uses only a photoelectric sensor to detect smoke. This makes it marginally less sensitive to flash fires but also cuts down on the chances of it being set off by nuisance alarms, or false alarms caused by cooking smoke or steamy showers. Its screen displays the real-time amount of carbon monoxide in the air, the status of the unit during a test, and a battery level icon.Installing the X-Sense SC01 was simple. With a power drill and pencil, I attached it to the ceiling in about two minutes. The anchors are white, so they blend in with the ceiling. They also came in a resealable plastic baggie, which was convenient.Overall, the value of the 10-year battery, integrated carbon monoxide detector, and digital readout make it the best smoke detector I tested. It also comes highly recommended by our fire investigator expert.\n              The multifunctional First Alert PRC710 alerts you to the presence of both smoke and carbon monoxide and boasts an ultra-thin profile that will blend into your ceiling.\n            SpecificsThe First Alert PRC710 uses a photoelectric sensor to quickly and effectively detect smoldering fires, which should cut down on frustrating false alarms. It also uses different beeps for each type of alert \u2014 three beeps for smoke and four for carbon monoxide \u2014 allowing you to know exactly what the problem is upon activation. Although these are useful, I wish it used a voice-alarm to explain the alerts. The First Alert PRC710 performed well during my testing on all three days and consistently activated its smoke alarm after two sprays from my aerosol canister. Installation was a breeze as well; it took just a couple of minutes to insert the anchors and screws and twist into place.  The First Alert PRC710's 1.38-inch height makes it the slimmest unit I tested. Combined with its relatively compact diameter (5.75 inches), it doesn't have the bulky, industrial look of some other detectors. Its smooth face and lack of additional screens or controls really allow it to blend into its surroundings, making it convenient for those who want a minimal look. With this sleek appearance, some of the helpful features of similar models are sacrificed, like the informative LED screen of the X-Sense SC01, so keep that in mind if you prefer something a bit more interactive.\n              The First Alert SM310 has photosensitive and ionization sensors, which can make it too sensitive, but provides two types of protection.  \n\n            SpecificsWhen we first tried products for this article, we tested the now-discontinued SA320 model. The brand has since come out with a replacement, the SM310, which has a non replaceable battery. The First Alert SM310 features both photosensitive and ionization sensors, which is likely the reason the initial model we tested was the only unit that activated its alarm after a single aerosol spray test. Although this high sensitivity sounds good on paper, it can also cause frequent nuisance alarms. These alarms, combined with the removable AA batteries, greatly increase the odds that someone will remove the batteries or the alarm itself. The NFPA reported that between 2009 and 2013, 21% of deaths in home fires occurred when smoke detectors were \"present but did not operate.\" It's important to keep this in mind if you're planning to get this unit.I didn't experience any issues installing the First Alert SA3210. It uses red wall anchors, which aren't ideal if you want to move the unit to a different location in the room. It also has optional locking features to discourage unauthorized battery or alarm removal. This is a good feature for landlords or anyone else placing the unit who won't be there to monitor it.The First Alert design makes it feel more functional and less clunky. It does lack the polished appeal of the X-Sense models, though it shouldn't be a big factor compared with safety and effectiveness. Andler describes this as \"a standard smoke detector at a good cost.\"\n              The X-Sense Wireless Interconnected comes as a set of three, six, or 12 separate smoke detectors with a range of more than 820 feet each, so they can cover small and large spaces safely.\n            SpecificsEven though the X-Sense Wireless Interconnected smoke detectors are smaller and lighter than typical ones, they still meet UL 217 standards. They also beeped at the same 85-db level as every other model tested. Their red alert lights were easy to see, and because of their side-mounted position, they reflected off the ceiling to increase visibility.  Because they are interconnected, all the units will sound even if only one detects smoke, so you'll be notified regardless of where you are in your home when a fire breaks out. They performed effectively in every test I did and were all relatively sensitive, responding within two aerosol sprays. Since the silence button is also the alert light, it was easy to quickly find the button to silence the unit, even in low light. Each unit was interconnected right out of the box, so no additional setup was necessary. You can add up to 24 units to the network, but every new set will need to be manually connected to the rest. This process seems pretty straightforward, though, and X-Sense's instructions are clear.Installation of the six-pack took longer than other smoke detectors I tested because there were more units to install. Their small size only required two anchor holes per unit, as opposed to the three that the other units I tested needed. This not only made them easier to install but also reduced the amount of damage to the ceiling and walls. Each of the units easily clicked onto its mounting bracket, and they were the simplest to install out of all smoke detectors I tested. Like all X-Sense models, their smooth finish gave them a nice, high-quality look. \n              The First Alert BRK 7030BSL combines an ultra-powerful flashing LED strobe with a 85 decibel alarm, making it a safe option if you're a heavy sleeper or have hearing loss.\n            SpecificsThis First Alert combination detector features a powerful 177 candela (cd) LED strobe. If you can't hear an auditory alarm, the extreme brightness of the strobe makes this smoke detector a great choice. Along with the LED, the detector also emits an 85 dB alarm, which is louder than a typical alarm clock and likely to wake even heavy sleepers. This combination alarm features a photoelectric sensor for smoke detection as well as an electrochemical sensor for carbon monoxide. It even uses a different strobe pattern for each alarm, allowing you to instantly recognize each type. This hardwired model can connect up to 18 detectors, and if you do use this interconnectivity, all detectors will blink in unison. The quick-connect wiring makes the First Alert BRK 7030BSL easy to install, as long as you have an existing mount to connect it to. The sealed 10-year backup battery will have you covered in the event of a power outage, and the long battery life eliminates the hassle of replacing it every year. According to the brand, this smoke detector meets UL 1971 standards for visual signal devices and fulfills requirements set by the American Disabilities Act. It doesn't come cheap, but if you or a family member have partial or total hearing loss, this model could certainly be worth the investment. We didn't personally test this model, but we've had great experiences with other First Alert models and feel confident in recommending this one.Battery-powered units: These are entirely powered by their batteries, which can be either replaceable or permanent lithium batteries sealed inside.  Hardwired units: These connect directly to your home's electrical wiring and typically have a backup battery in case of a power outage.Photoelectric: These use an LED to detect smoke, which disrupts the light beam and reflects it into a sensor, activating the alarm. Ionization: These have a small amount of radioactive material between two electrically charged plates. When smoke displaces the radioactive ions, this disrupts the current between the plates and the alarm goes off.Understanding the different features of smoke detectors is important to ensure you're choosing the best one for your home. Multifunctionality: If possible, try to choose a smoke detector that includes more than one function, like a combination smoke and carbon monoxide model. The best smoke detectors generally have both ionization and photosensitive sensors for greater effectiveness. Smart features: Smoke detectors with smartphone connectivity allow you to shut off nuisance alarms without having to climb a ladder. Smart features can also let you know if the alarm goes off while you're not home.Backup power: Hardwired smoke detectors require a backup battery to power the unit in the event of a power outage. These will either use replaceable batteries or permanent 10-year batteries. Certifications: Smoke detectors must meet specific industry requirements before they're approved for use. They should have a clear marking on the back to indicate the testing laboratory \u2014 typically UL (Underwriters Laboratories) or ETL (Intertek Testing Services).Verbal and visual alerts: The best smoke detector for your home may also give verbal commands instructing you what to do or include visual aids like bright LEDs. These features can be especially valuable in a dark or smoke-filled house. State and local laws and regulations: Different states may have different requirements for smoke detectors and their batteries, so check your local laws to make you choose the best smoke detector for your area. The Kidde website has a helpful interactive map that provides all the information you need.Interconnectivity: Interconnected smoke detectors will automatically trigger every alarm if one is activated. If you use hardwired detectors, you need to physically connect them to achieve this. Battery-powered options, on the other hand, connect via a radio frequency, which requires much less effort to set up. Dave Nicholas, professional electrician and founder of SparkyBase.com, considers wireless interlinking one of the most important features to consider. \"Having interlinked detectors is a regulation in many areas,\" Nicholas says, adding that the alternative \u2014 trying to hardwire the link \u2014 can be incredibly disruptive since it requires lifting carpets and floorboards.Installation: You can mount battery-powered detectors on your ceiling with a pair of wall anchors. If you have an existing ceiling mount for a hardwired alarm, you can fit those in easily. However, if you're wiring them from scratch, you'll need to hire a professional. \"I wouldn't advise homeowners to try to install hardwire detectors themselves, as getting a permanent supply to the detector can be tricky,\" Nicholas says. Sensor type: The best smoke detector for any space will have both ionization and photoelectric sensors. Ideally, you'll want to have at least two separate units because ionization units are too sensitive to place near the bathroom or kitchen \u2014 though we do have a two-in-one recommendation in this guide. Ionization sensors have a higher chance of detecting nuisance alarms and tend to be less effective at detecting slow-burning, smoldering fires. These fires can go unnoticed for longer periods of time than flash fires, which are fires that develop suddenly and intensely. Photoelectric detectors respond more quickly to smoldering fires, according to the NFPA. They also cut down on unnecessary nuisance alarms that may prompt you to remove the batteries out of frustration.For this guide, I tested dozens of smoke detectors after consulting with fire and building experts and doing online research. I relied on my extensive experience as a residential carpenter, which frequently required the relocation of hardwired units. I've also installed plenty of hardwired and battery-powered smoke detectors in my own apartments and my parents' home. To check these detectors' effectiveness, I installed each and tested it three times a day for three days. I performed a basic maintenance test according to the manufacturer's instructions (usually just by pressing the \"test\" button) and then sprayed the units twice with an aerosol spray that mimics real smoke. Most smoke detectors won't activate after a single spray, so you will need two three-second sprays to set them off. I found this to be the case with every unit I tested except for the First Alert SA320, which activated its alarm after only a single spray.  I broke these tests up throughout the day to allow time for the spray to dissipate and the detectors to return to their working levels. Although I didn't personally test the First Alert BRK 7030BSL, I have experience with other First Alert models and consider them a reliable and effective option. I also interviewed three experts. Patrick Andler is a fire investigator with 38 years of experience and a board member of the Arizona Burn Foundation. This organization supplies free smoke detectors to low-income housing units across Arizona. Andler's expertise helped us understand the overall effectiveness and value of smoke detectors and their ideal placement in the home.  Nick Yahoodain is a home remodeler with more than 11 years of experience at Advanced Builders & Contractors. His hands-on experience during construction and home planning gave us insight into the logistical issues involved with detector installation.Dave Nicholas is a professional electrician and founder of SparkyBase.com. His electrical expertise helped us better understand how hardwired models worked and their potential installation issues. The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) recommends photoelectric smoke detectors over ionization options. According to their website, the increase in the use of photoelectric technology \u2014 alarms that pass the new 8th Edition UL217 Standard, in other words \u2014 have the potential to save hundreds of lives each year. The IAFF promotes these as their technology of choice. A hardwired detector with a 10-year battery may be the most reliable and best smoke detector for your home. It can still function in a power outage and doesn't require regular battery changes. Built-in 10-year batteries will last for a full decade. If you install a smoke detector that uses replaceable batteries, you'll need to change these every year. The NFPA recommends installing alarms inside and outside every bedroom and on every level of your home, including the basement. Andler also says you should place smoke alarms on your ceiling, not the wall, since smoke rises and begins gathering at the ceiling first. He also stressed the importance of having additional smoke detectors throughout your home. In the event of a house fire, hallway smoke detectors may sound their alarms much earlier than units in the bedroom. Installing your smoke alarm near the kitchen instead of in the kitchen also reduces the chances of false alarms, according to Andler. The Arizona Burn Foundation recommends keeping your detector at least 10 feet away from the stove.Your smoke detector should have a \"test\" button. When you press and hold this button for a few seconds, a high-pitched siren should start to sound. If you don't hear anything or the sound seems quiet, it's time to replace the battery or smoke detector. Many insurance companies advise replacing smoke detector batteries every six months regardless of the siren's loudness.Whichever smoke detector you choose, make sure it meets the standards of UL Solutions, a third-party certification company that has been developing smoke detector standards for more than 40 years. The UL 217 code covers both \"single station\" smoke alarms that function as standalone units and \"multiple station\" smoke alarms with interconnectivity. All of the picks in this guide have this UL 217 certification. The combination smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, like the X-Sense SC01 and First Alert PRC710, also have a UL 2034 certification, which covers the CO detector.Smoke detectors can work effectively for up to 10 years, but you still need to test them every month to ensure they function properly. If you have a battery-powered unit, you'll want to replace the batteries every six months. That said, if your smoke detector has an integrated carbon monoxide detector, you'll need to replace the unit every five to seven years, according to the manufacturer's directions. Some people may consider hardwired units the best smoke detectors, since they have both a main power supply and battery backup. \"This, coupled with an alert to warn when the supply is disconnected, makes it much less likely the alarm will run out of power,\" Nicholas said, adding that many new homes require hardwired smoke detectors. Smoke detectors that last 10 years may be a great option if you don't want to change the batteries every year. Just keep in mind that you'll still need to test the batteries every month to ensure your smoke detector still operates.",

  "summary": "The best smoke detector you can buy is the X-Sense SC01, which is easy to install, reliable, and loud, and comes with a 10-year battery life. The X-sense SC01 was highly recommended by fire safety experts and performed well in our tests. The First Alert SM310 was the best dual-sensor, with a photoelectric sensor and a color-changing LED to alert you to the presence of both smoke and carbon monoxide. If unavailable, the First Alert PRC710 was also mentioned as a good alternative. The best for heavy sleepers or hearing loss is First Alert BRK 7030BSL, which provides protection but provides two types of protection.",
  "shortSummary": "The X-Sense SC01 and First Alert PRC710 are the best smoke detectors for reliability, reliability, and ease of installation, with superior dual-sensure technology and easy installation.",

      "text": "Mark H.\nSmall. Compact. Easy to install. Much easier than any other interconnected alarm.\nPapa\nWe live in an older house that doesn't have the wires connecting all the smoke detectors together. That's why I chose these because they were wireless and I wanted something that would alert us to a fire anywhere in the house. They are photoelectric and can detect smoke, but I'm not sure if they have the sensitivity of our existing ionizers. So now we have both types in most rooms. These connect to each other without any hassle, and we install to the ceiling very easily.\nMike\nBought these for my Ford pickup towed travel trailer. one in the cabin,\nOne is in the basement where I have a ton of solar and other electrical equipment and the other is in a pickup truck.\nThis way, if there is a fire/smoke in transit, I'll be warned and given a chance to put it out.\nWorks as advertised.\nDipson\nVery easy to install. Small size. Even the screws and anchors it comes with are of good quality. It uses a photoelectric sensor, unlike most other inexpensive ones that use an ionization sensor. Our new house, the builder placed all the ionization sensors. Also, for extra peace of mind, I added these to each room.\nJojo\nDidn't have high expectations for these, but I was blown away. Installation is simple, and they're paired out of the box. Place them throughout the house for full coverage. We tested with a manual sprayer, activating a different sprayer each time.\nKeri\nI like this better than my previous smoke alarms. Easy to take off. And easy to mute.\nGood thing the battery lasts so long.\nJanet Cullen\nCouldn't be happier!\nWe have a home built in 1890 & hardwired smoke detector systems aren't an option.\nThis system works really well. Easy to install & get warning sound level.\nMamaBear\nIt is very easy to install and synchronize with each other. I love that if the ONE goes out, the whole house goes out, so important to help you and your family escape safely! They are also small and a must-have in every household! ! !\nSantos\nThere were no complaints from the inspectors, so I'm happy with these. They are not as striking as the larger ones.\nTutnkmn\nGosh, this thing is tiny. Pictures are quite deceptive. It's only about three inches, but it seems to work well. Very loud siren.\nKara985\nI'm very cautious and small and it works. nothing to say\nMM44nela\nWe recently got a trial version of it and it's easy to install, like size and aesthetics - will order more\nShaffer\nJust like that, they've been programmed to connect to each other. Tested them and they work. Super high-pitched chirps.\nNick\nLinks easily and its loud\nJim\nLove that it's so lightweight and easy to deploy, looks cooler than the usual alerts. Well made and effective, cheer them on!\nHepner\nGood unit, but really lacks guidance on how to remove the mounting bracket and install it!\nKisor\nThey are small and easy to work with, I tested mine with a little smoke and it worked great.\nAtkinson\nTested with blown match smoke, smoked 7 matches at a time, but all 3 matches worked and was shocked by the smoke. Satisfied with them. Hopefully the battery will last 7+ years...we'll see...\nPalmquist\nInstead of drilling new anchors, I decided to use Velcro to stick the new siren to the bottom of the old one. good results.\nGBA\nEarly this morning, they detected a melted wire in my workshop and alerted me in my bedroom. I was able to get out of there and turn off the power before it turned into fire. Thanks to X-Sense for saving my studio.\nKroninger\nVery compact and easy to install. 10 year old battery check and replace every year especially my old model 9v battery. The alarm is loud and has led to confirmation that it is working.\nSteve\nIt took a minute to hook them up, but overall it was fine. It gives you peace of mind that no matter where the fire is, you will be alerted through the interconnect function.\nRalston\nI bought a pack of 6 and installed them all in 1/2 hour, tested and they all work, they are small but easy to install. I would expect a ten-year battery life to be closer to 10 years.\nSkip\nCompact unit, easy to install, have installed 6 units in about an hour via RF link and all tested fine/linked on the first try.\nGoukiman\nIt's a little easier to install than a larger, more traditional siren in terms of keeping the device from looking sideways or curved.\nI love how small they are. In my opinion, they look better at home.\nThey are all connected together, giving an excellent sense of security.\nLee\nInstalls to replace original RV smoke detectors.\nGoing to change the battery this year, forget that the battery can be used for 10 years! ! ??. Great little unit, easy to install!\nRoquer\nI like them because they are small but loud. They work as advertised, which is to say, they're a series - so one happens, they all happen, and most likely, the victim will wake up in time and leave.\nThey are not expensive and easy to test.\nCatherine\nSmall and loud! ! !\nNolden\nPerfect for my electrical cabinet and my RV refrigerator service area. I have a small electrical fire which is the reason for this purchase. If the battery is enough, I'd say it's a solid product.\nBill\nThese are simple to put up. The 6-pack comes pre-programmed on a single interconnect network. I installed one in a separate garage approximately 100 feet distant, via metal siding, and it communicated with the others. They are modest in size but quite loud, especially when many go off at the same time in the same house. Recommended!\nBryan\nThe package and ease of installation pleased me. I installed six of them in a couple of minutes and they all function flawlessly. By pushing the quiet button on one of them, you can easily tell which alarm has been activated. These are considerably cuter and less intrusive than standard smoke detectors.\nG\nI just received them in, and my first thought was, \"Wow, these are small.\" I have yet to install them, but I plan to do so this weekend. I'll provide an update later. These smoke detectors are extremely loud and simple to install. I ordered six, one for each bedroom, one for the dining room, and one for the living room. These are additions to the ones I already have in my house. I purchased these because I appreciate how if one of them goes off, they all go off. So far, I'm pleased with the goods.\nJohn Stortz\nThe alarms were ready to install, and the process was simple. Because we have a ranch-style home, a 6 pack system was used to cover all of the major living spaces and bedrooms. The only issue is that the single alarm in the center corridor \"chirps\" intermittently throughout the day and night. We checked for firm battery contact and attempted to reset and reinstall the alarm. There has been no success, and the chirp is loud and obnoxious....\nShaggy\nI purchased three of them. I put one in my garage, one in my barn, and one in the home so I could monitor the other two. They all started screaming at 5:30 a.m. today. There was no fire in the home, garage, or barn. The only thing that comes to mind is that the chilly nighttime temperatures in the barn have either reduced battery life or something else is amiss. Until this morning, I was pleased with my purchase. It's really simple to set up. The connection worked well, as demonstrated by all three of them lighting up.\nA. Hayes\nTo bring our new home up to code, we required numerous smoke detectors that could communicate with one another. An electrician informed us that if we followed the hard wired route, it would cost at least $1000. We might also look for some Bluetooth smoke alarms. Take a look at these tiny beauties. They were less than $50, simple to install, and have brought us up to code.\nLyn Craven\nI bought these primarily because we have an oddly shaped house and I was concerned that if the smoke detector went off downstairs I might not hear it in our bedroom at night. So I put one in various spots throughout the house including the bedroom. I liked the idea that if there was smoke downstairs I would be alerted to it before the fire got to the point that the one upstairs picked it up. I hope I never have to test them IRL, but the other day I burned something on the stove end it set the alarms off and, boy, you could sure hear it EVERYWHERE. They may be slightly less sensitive than the \ufffd\ufffdregular\ufffd\ufffd kind because they are still there and that one went off first, but these started up mere seconds after and every one went off with a shrill insistent sound you could not miss.\naverage jane\nEasy to install\nVery small compared to a traditional ones, close to palm sized\nInterconnected so when one goes off they quickly all start going off. We have one in each bedroom, hallway, living room and basement. After a few seconds they will all be going off.\nNice and loud will definitely wake you up if you've got one in your room or right outside. And since they all go off you can hear them throughout the house.\nBattery operated so no wiring required.\nWouldn't recommend for installation in the kitchen or garage. We have one just outside our interior garage door and around the corner from our kitchen. Regular cooking or automotive smoke can set them off and then the whole house is beeping loudly. Only way to shut them all off in a non emergency is to remove the battery of the one that went off first. Which can take a while when its on the ceiling. Waking to the smell of bacon is awesome, waking to the sound of the whole house beeping because you like your bacon extra crispy is not awesome according to my family.\nDavid Werner\nThe setup instructions were not the best at explaining how to establish the interconnect feature or test it. Their website looks like it has a better selection than Amazon, I wish my 6 pack came with the test remote!! Can you buy it separately? The installation was easy. They have only been up for a day and I have yet to buy some test smoke.\nThe Illuminator\nI got the three pack of X-Sense Mini Wireless Interconnected Smoke Alarms. One was placed in a detached 30 x 42 foot three bay garage with 12 foot ceilings, the others in my house located about 150 feet way. (I had an electrical issue scare that caused me to want an early warning in the house if a problem developed in the unoccupied garage). The detached garage detector was mounted to the ceiling in the middle of the center bay. When tested all the detectors alarmed which was just what I wanted. Recently light cooking smoke from a propane fired BBQ unit temporarily located at the middle bay (open) door set all detectors off. They are acceptably loud. I was so impressed I bought two more sets of six detectors for family members. The promised 10 year battery life is an added plus if it comes to pass. All this in an attractive, easy to mount, well engineered package.\nLisa H.\nOur house was built in 1994 and had three places wired for smoke detectors, this was not enough. We wanted to install nine detectors that were all connected. We did not want to extend the existing wiring to more locations. So these wirelessly interconnected detectors were a great solutions.\nBomber19555\nI have 2 hard wire smoke detectors in my 1800sf home. I found i needed something to let me know if a fire ever broke out in my garage. I looked for smoke detectors that talked to each other, these fit that requirement. I now have full coverage of my home and garage. This way if anything happens we stand a far better chance of getting out unharmed.\nPam\nEasy to setup and use.\nChris H.\nEasy to install and they\ufffd\ufffdre small and nice looking. Covers smoke and carbon monoxide.\nTori Lee\nI like them in the sense that they all go off if I be does and they are super small and sleek , a little inconvenient to set up if you buy the WiFi / Bluetooth app on your phone alarm , but regardless they work well ! I\ufffd\ufffdm glad I upgraded my alarms in my home , you never really think about it and these are sure to make me feel safer !\npaul moll\nThe battery lasted only 6 weeks before the unit started chirping to change the battery. I measured the 3volt battery at 2.7 volts, clearly very low for a Li Ion battery. Also, they don't pair to each other very well, have to follow the instructions carefully and even then doesn't work every time. Do NOT recommend.\nJ. Wong\nThis little device can wake the dead. It could definitely save your life. We supplemented the wired, interconnected ionization detectors with these wireless, interconnected photoelectric ones.\nJeff N. in Northern California\nThese smoke alarms are so much better looking and more compact than anything I could find at the local hardware store. The multipack came pre-networked and installation was a breeze!\nEdwin Oyler\nI installed three of these, garage, laundry room and hallway. They came already synced together so all I had to do was install them. After installing them I tested them with real smoke with the garage smoke alarm and all three sounded at the same time.\nThe reason I put one in the garage is I do a lot of welding and grinding in there and needed the peace of mind in case a spark started a fire long after I went inside. Also, no false alarms with welding. My old smoke alarm would sound everytime I welded.\nMike Perry\nWe ordered a six-pack of the XS01-WR wireless interlinked smoke detectors to replace a network of 35-year-old hardwired heat detectors that were tied to an outdated and broken alarm system and service that we never used. The six-pack of detectors came in two separately packaged and interlinked sets of three that were super easy to interlink into a single set of six interlinked detectors and install in place of the much larger, yellowed, and grungy heat detectors. As promised, the interlinked signal easily spanned all three levels of our large four-bedroom home as well as an attached garage. We'll rest much easier knowing that the detector in our bedroom will immediately warn us of a fire located in a far corner of our home even with the door closed and an air conditioner running. Needless to say, hiring someone to replace the antiquated heat detectors and alarm system with a modern hard-wired equivalent would have been much more complicated and expensive. Definitely give the XS01-WR system a try if your family is facing a similar situation.\nRichard S\nSet up went fine. They are very small, if you have painted around the old detectors you may need to do a touch up. They have a loud alarm but not one that is just ear splitting loud and aggressive like some. Can't say any more until after a fire. Hope to not have to come back here for that. We 'feel' safe. Cant say any more than that for now.\nben 4\nGreat product, i use them to replace the older units now I don\ufffd\ufffdt have to worry if i will hear the ones that\ufffd\ufffds far away, if the one in the garage is triggered in the middle of the night, the one in my room will alert me immediately great!!!!!\nMT aus HB\nDa es bei uns im Haus R?ume gab, in dem noch keine Rauchmelder hingen, mussten wir welche nachr\ufffd\ufffdsten. Ich habe mich dann f\ufffd\ufffdr dieses Modell entschieden, da es von der Beschreibung her einen ganz ordentlichen Eindruck auf mich gemacht hat. Au?erdem bietet ein Smarthome-Funktionalit?t und wenn schon, denn schon. Direkt nach der Lieferung habe ich den Rauchmelder dann auch gleich an der Decke installiert, wo er seitdem seinen Dienst verrichtet.\n\ufffd\ufffdber seine Qualit?t vermag ich nicht wirklich etwas zu berichten, denn zum Gl\ufffd\ufffdck gab es noch keinen Brand, vor dem der Rauchmelder uns h?tte retten sollen. Vergangene Woche erfolgte aber eine Inspektion durch den Schornsteinfeger und hier haben diese Rauchmelder den amtlichen Segen des Schornsteinfegers erhalten.\nVon daher hat dieser Rauchmelder bislang alles geleistet, was von ihm zu erwarten war.\nlina\nThe product seems good and was pretty easy to install. Whilst expensive compared to other models, I wanted the ease of just being able to plug into the existing wiring and mount. Installation was a breeze - installed the batteries, connected it to the existing wiring loom and screwed onto the existing mount. Took no more than 2 mins.\nMitchell Hartman\nThe smoke alarms linked flawlessly. Very easy to install with the provided screws and poly anchors. I have 9 of them installed on 3 levels of my house and they work perfectly. I really like the small and inconspicuous profile\nCATHERINE\nMake sure you install this during the day, when noone is sleeping. I made the mistake of programming it and installing it after put child to sleep and when it powered on/tested, it was LOUD!! im glad its that loud, i feel confident if my alarm ever does go off, it would wake up a hibernating bear, I like how it talks rather then only beep\nJames\nI have been trying for several years to find reliable wireless smoke detectors for my older home. I tried both of the larger national brands in the USA, and wasted a large sum of money on both. Neither was reliable, and both had problems linking the units together and staying linked.\nThe two sets of X-Sense detectors linked easily, and the instructions were clear and simple. I have tested them several times so far, and they have remained linked and performed as expected. I also like the supplied 5 year battery.\nI would highly recommend these units for anyone who would like linked smoke alarms without needing to run wires through existing walls and ceilings.\nNicole Shorter\nWe just got these. We bought two sets to link together. They were super easy to install. We\ufffd\ufffdve tested them and they work great.\nWe got them because two of my boys sleep above the garage. If something happened in there I would wanna know before they fell into the garage as they slept. Very much added peace of mind.\nFummins Family\nThese are great! Very easy to install, came with everything you need. Very effective, we have done a couple fire drills/tests and couldn\ufffd\ufffdt be happier with the performance.\nDaniel\nIn meinem neuen Haus ben?tige ich einige neue Rauchmelder. Da ich bereits von diesem Hersteller einen gr??eren f\ufffd\ufffdr das Wohnzimmer (mit Kamin) bestellt habe und mit diesem wirklich sehr zufrieden bin, habe ich mich erneut f\ufffd\ufffdr diesen Hersteller entschieden. Diesmal f\ufffd\ufffdr die Mini Rauchmelder. Besonders gut finde ich dabei, dass diese nicht ganz so auffallen, z.B in den Fluren.\nVon der Verarbeitung bin ich genauso \ufffd\ufffdberzeugt wie bei dem ersten Rauchmelder dieses Herstellers. Es wirkt alles sehr solide verarbeitet.\nDie Montage der drei Rauchmelder war leicht. Der Preis f\ufffd\ufffdr drei Rauchmelder ist v?llig in Ordnung. Alles in allem eine gute Erg?nzung zu dem Rauchmelder den ich schon habe. Ich bin voll zufrieden.\nVoyagePortugal.fr\nLes d\ufffd\ufffdtecteurs sont beaux et design. ?a change des d\ufffd\ufffdtecteurs classiques qui sont moches dans les cuisines. Ils sont beaucoup plus petits que la moyenne!\nOn peut connecter jusqu'\ufffd\ufffd 24 d\ufffd\ufffdtecteurs entre eux, c'est utile pour les grandes maisons ;).\nLes d\ufffd\ufffdtecteurs arrivent d\ufffd\ufffdj\ufffd\ufffd connect\ufffd\ufffds entre eux. Il suffit qu'un seul d\ufffd\ufffdtecte de la fum\ufffd\ufffde pour alerter les autres. C'est pratique pour des pi\ufffd\ufffdces isol\ufffd\ufffds. J'avais un d\ufffd\ufffdtecteur a c?t\ufffd\ufffd de ma chaudi\ufffd\ufffdre \ufffd\ufffd granul\ufffd\ufffds dans mon garage mais je l'entendait l\ufffd\ufffdg\ufffd\ufffdrement. Maintenant, ?a sonne en m\ufffd\ufffdme temps dans ma cuisine, je suis sur de l'entendre :)!\nLes piles CR123A sont fournis pour chaque d\ufffd\ufffdtecteur.

      "text": "Business Insider's history traces back to 2007 when it was a tech and business blog called Silicon Alley Insider. It has since grown into a major site for news and lifestyle stories. In 2015, the company launched Insider Picks, the precursor to what is now the Reviews team, to help shoppers navigate the complex retail industry and make the best purchasing decisions.\nToday, the Reviews team is part of Business Insider's Service Journalism department and is helmed by a group of experienced commerce journalists who test and write about consumer products in a variety of categories, including home and kitchen, tech and electronics, pets, health and fitness, style, and beauty. Our in-depth research and testing are what help inform our recommendations to readers.\nWhat types of products we test\nBelow is a sampling of some of the core products and services the Reviews team tests. All products undergo a rigorous research or testing process and, when applicable, long-term testing.\nHome and kitchen: Cookware, small appliances, furniture, home decor, mattresses, bedding, DIY and gardening tools, smart home, and home office. The team also tests foods and drinks, delivery services, and many other home and kitchen-related products.\nPets: Cat and dog food, harnesses, litter boxes, collars, apparel, flea medication for dogs and cats, and many other pet accessories and services. Reporters enlist their cats, dogs, and other pets to help test products, while pet health articles are medically reviewed by veterinarians and supported by expert interviews.\nTech: Smartphones, desktop and laptop computers, smartwatches and wearables, TVs, stereo systems, headphones, home entertainment/streaming, and gaming.\nStyle and beauty: Apparel and shoes for all genders, bags, jewelry, underwear, bras, skincare, cosmetics, and other fashion-related topics. The team also puts health-related personal care products through a medical review to ensure they are safe to use.\nHealth and fitness: Workout clothes for women and men, thermometers, bikes, tents, outdoor gear, fitness equipment, health supplements, oral care, and more. Insider Reviews' health articles are medically reviewed by doctors and other health professionals, and supported by expert interviews.\nTravel: Travel gear, backpacks, commuter bags, luggage, travel tech accessories, and travel-related tips and tricks.\nEntertainment: Streaming platforms, how-to-watch major sporting or streaming events, concert and sporting tickets, and VPN services.\nHow we test products\nThe Reviews team tests products the way people would use them in everyday life. Instead of a lab environment, we use products in the real world. That means we're cooking with kitchen tools and appliances in our own kitchens, installing smart devices in our homes, wearing and washing clothing the way we would in our daily lives, and more. This helps us share real-life insights with our readers about how products integrate into our everyday environments.\nTo conduct our tests, we create a methodology for each product category, which is based on research, consultation with experts in the area, and experience from editors and reporters. All tests are tracked and the results are used to determine which products are worth recommending to readers. Our testing process is explained in greater detail within our buying guides, including information on why some products pass the grade and others don't.\nIn addition to our in-house and freelance testers, we also have an internal council of volunteers and freelancers who help us test products and offer additional perspectives. We occasionally make recommendations based on research and expert feedback \u2014 for example, asking professional makeup artists what products they recommend for certain skin types.\nWhy you can trust us\nThe Reviews team includes a roster of full-time, topic-based editors and reporters, plus several experienced freelance writers with strong backgrounds and expertise in their areas of coverage. Each of our editors and reporters has years of experience testing products and translating the results of those tests into recommendations for readers. Our team is organized based on our core coverage areas mentioned above, with each section focusing on reviewing the products, services, and industries they know best.\nIn addition to individual product review stories, we also maintain a vast collection of buying guides. These guides, which are tied to our reviews, recommend the best products for what readers are searching for (for example, the best espresso machines). We thoroughly test or research every product we recommend in both reviews and guides. We often apply additional scrutiny by consulting a panel of experts to ensure our information is accurate and offer buying advice. And for topics like health, parenting, and pets, we have a third-party medical review board that fact-checks our reviews and buying guides.\nIn all our articles, the reader always comes first. The Reviews team aims to answer every question that readers may have while helping you discover new products and services.\nHow our affiliate links work\nBusiness Insider earns commissions when products and services are purchased through links in our stories. However, our editorial team has complete independence to write about the products and services we truly deem the best based on our extensive testing and research. We do not make decisions based on affiliate relationships, and we would never write about a product that we didn't fully stand behind as product journalists.\nMeet our senior team leaders\n| Sally Kaplan, Executive EditorSally joined Insider in 2018 as an editor and has since held the role of senior editor and deputy editor on the Reviews team. She has interviewed CEOs and brand founders, reported on the rebirth of a fashion startup that narrowly escaped bankruptcy, developed testing methodologies for hundreds of stories, and edited countless others.

      "text": "From soft-yet-durable sheets to powerful vacuums, the Business Insider Reviews team rigorously tests and reviews a wide variety of items for the home. For nearly five years, the team has tested hundreds of products, including mattresses, sheets, vacuums, home-office furniture, cleaning products, and many more.\nWhat types of home products we test\nMattresses: We test the best mattresses for all types of sleepers from a wide range of brands, including Casper, Helix, Leesa, Tempur-Pedic, and more. And yes, our sleep reporter sleeps on every single mattress he tests for at least two weeks.\nBedroom furniture and bedding: Our reporters review and test bedroom products, including the best bed frames and linens, all price points and climates. They've tested practically every fabric and have tried sheets, duvet covers, pillows, and comforters from Brooklinen, The Company Store, Crane & Canopy, L.L.Bean, and more.\nVacuums: From the best robot vacuums to cordless to upright, we use benchmark and objective tests for vacuums and recommend products from Bissell, Dyson, Roborock, Shark, and more.\nBath linens and laundry care: It's important to keep your bathroom free of mold and mildew, so we test bath mats and towels to make sure they dry quickly. We've developed tests for clothes steamers, hangers, and drying racks, and have also evaluated laundry detergent for efficacy.\nAir conditioners, fans, and heaters: We've tested space heaters, air conditioners, and fans to ensure they provide great climate control without being too noisy or difficult to use.\nFurniture and large appliances: These are some of the biggest investments you'll make for your home. We use expert sources, in-depth research, and hands-on testing to review the best sofas, dishwashers, bathtubs, and more.\nHome office: From office chairs to standing desks, we put home-office furniture through the paces to ensure it's sturdy and easy to use while still being stylish and affordable.\nHome improvement tools: We methodically research the tools and equipment you need to care for and repair your home. We interview industry experts and do extensive research and testing to review the best lawn mowers, best paint, best drills, and more.\nHome accessories, decor, and services: We believe your home should be a safe and comfortable place to be. To help you find the best smoke detector, trash can, compost bin and more, we extensively research and test a wide variety of home accessories, decor, and home services.\nHow we test home products\nWe test home products by using them every day for weeks and months. We develop original testing methods and use benchmarks to evaluate home products and objectively compare them. We sleep on pillows for weeks, wash and rewash sheets, run cordless vacuums until their batteries run out, and assemble office chairs and standing desks. We take factors like price, durability, style, and other factors into consideration to offer quality options for all budgets.\nWhat sets us apart from other review sites\nInstead of testing in labs, we use products in our own homes in real-life conditions. We test products as professionals to evaluate how each item meets industry standards, but we don't stop there. Where other sites may evaluate a mattress based on performance in lab tests, our reporters sleep on every mattress for a minimum of two weeks. Every product we test becomes part of our daily routines, so we know if a vacuum can keep up with heavy shedding or if an air conditioner is loud enough to keep you awake at night.\nThough we earn commission on products purchased through our stories, no company can pay us to be included. All of our top picks are researched, tested, and then compared to our previous experience.\nMeet our expert home team\nOur home team has years of experience testing and reviewing products. Each editor and reporter is an expert in their beat, having reviewed dozens of products from their categories.
