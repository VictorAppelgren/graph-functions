      "summary": "The emergency court hearing on Lisa Cook’s potential removal by President Trump ended without a ruling, leaving the case to be decided later. The proceedings highlighted concerns over the Federal Reserve’s independence and the legal precedent of a president removing a governor. Market reactions were muted, with equities falling and bond yields holding steady, while gold and commodities saw modest gains. The outcome of the case could influence future Fed policy and the broader perception of central bank autonomy.",
