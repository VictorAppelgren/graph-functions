  "title": "Microsoft is being sued for killing Windows 10 - here are 5 reasons why the lawsuit could actually force its hand to extend support further",
  "description": "Turning up the heat on Microsoft",
  "content": "Windows 10 reaches its End of Life in October 2025, and a California resident is particularly disgruntled about this looming deadline.\n\nHe isn't alone, of course, but Lawrence Klein feels strongly enough that Microsoft is out of order in bringing the shutters down on Windows 10 in just a couple of months that he has fired up a lawsuit against the company.\n\nAs The Register reports, Klein has accused Microsoft of violating consumer legal code and business code (including false advertising law) by winding up support for Windows 10 too early, in his opinion.\n\nThe crux of the argument is that too many people remain on Windows 10 for the operating system to have support pulled (there are nuances here, which I'll come back to). And that some 240 million devices don't meet the hardware requirements to upgrade to Windows 11 \u2013 due to Microsoft setting those PC specifications at an unreasonable level \u2013 and the potential e-waste nightmare that could prompt.\n\nIn short, the upgrades required for Windows 11 - including TPM 2.0 security, as well as ruling out some surprisingly recent processors - aren't justified.\n\nFurthermore, Klein argues that this upgrade timeline is all part of Microsoft's drive to push folks to use its Copilot AI with Windows 11, in a broader push to get more adoption for Copilot+ PCs - in other words, to buy new machines and discard old Windows 10 hardware (and again, we're back to that e-waste issue).\n\nYou can read the lawsuit in its entirety (it's a PDF) here, but that's the gist, and Klein argues that Microsoft should postpone killing off Windows 10 and wait until far fewer people are using the older operating system.\n\nAs the suit states: \"[The] Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief requiring Microsoft to continue providing support for Windows 10 without additional fees or conditions until the number of devices running the operating system falls below a reasonable threshold, thereby ensuring that consumers and businesses are not unfairly pressured into unnecessary expenditures and cybersecurity risks [of running a Windows 10 PC without security updates].\"\n\nIs Klein justified in this lawsuit? In some respects, I think so, and while I don't imagine for a minute that this legal action will go anywhere in terms of the outcome of the suit itself, I've a feeling it could come into play, and be important, indirectly.\n\nWhat do I mean by that exactly? Well, let's dive into the thinking behind Klein's lawsuit, and the key reasons why it might force Microsoft to sit up and take notice.\n\nDo we really need TPM 2.0 forced upon us? Yes, it ushers in a better level of security, I don't dispute that \u2013 but hundreds of millions of PCs potentially heading to landfill seems too heavy a price to pay. For me, as already mentioned, the decision to rule out some relatively new CPUs in the Windows 11 specs is particularly baffling.\n\nThe key point here is that Microsoft has never pushed the PC hardware requirements as hard as it has with Windows 11, and that leaves it open to criticism, although this observation is nothing new. What is new, though, is that the lack of fairness in setting this higher hardware bar has become crystal clear with the number of people who are still using Windows 10, which brings us onto my next point.\n\n2. This close to End of Life, there are clearly too many people still using Windows 10\n\nThe lawsuit cites outdated figures as to how many folks are still on Windows 10 - an estimate drawn from April 2025 suggests that 53% remain on the older OS. While that's no longer the case, the level remains high.\n\nBased on the latest report from StatCounter (for July 2025), Windows 10 usage is 43%, which is very high with the End of Life deadline imminent. Normally, an outgoing Windows version would have way fewer users than this - Windows 7 had a 25% market share when it ran out of support (and it was a popular OS).\n\nThere are always holdouts when a new version of Windows comes out, but it's looking like this is going to be really bad with Windows 10's end of support. This is Klein's central argument, and I think it's a key factor that Microsoft doesn't appear to be taking into account - or perhaps doesn't want to face up to.\n\nMaybe the software giant is thinking there'll be a last-minute flood of Windows 11 migration, but given the outlined hardware requirements problem, I doubt it.\n\nAnother part of Klein's case against Microsoft is the assertion that the company is using Windows 10's end of support and Windows 11 upgrades to persuade people to buy new PCs that major in AI, namely Copilot+ PCs. And indeed Microsoft hasn't helped itself here, openly pushing these Windows 11 devices as the lawsuit points out \u2013 and that includes intrusive full-screen advertisements piped to Windows 10 machines.\n\nThat feels like a crass tactic, and makes it seem like part of this is indeed about pushing those Copilot+ laptops. Yes, by all means, advertise Copilot+ PCs and their AI abilities (which are limited thus far, I should note) \u2013 but don't do it in this way, directly at Windows 10 users, and expect that to be viewed in anything other than a negative and cynical light.\n\n4. Microsoft has already made a concession, true - but it's not enough\n\nIt's worth noting that not everything Klein puts forward in this suit seems reasonable. I don't think you can argue that 10 years of support is stingy, which is what Microsoft has given Windows 10. However, Klein picks out 'transitional' support in his lawsuit, meaning the length of support after a succeeding OS has been launched \u2013 four years in this case \u2013 which isn't entirely fair and looks lean. The problem here is not the length of time for support as such, but the different circumstances around hardware requirements.\n\nAlso, calling Windows 11 'wildly unpopular' as Klein does at one point is equally unfair - even if adoption of the operating system has been very sluggish, admittedly. There's a definite bias towards shooting the OS down across all fronts, and I think that weakens Klein's argument.\n\nBut my main bone of contention here is that Klein ignores the concession Microsoft has made in terms of the extended year of support for consumers who want to stay on Windows 10. As the lawsuit states, this extra support through to October 2026 can be had for the price of $30, but recently, Microsoft introduced the ability to get this extension for free, well, kind of. (Financially, you won't pay a penny, but you need to sync some PC settings to OneDrive, and I don't think that requirement is too onerous myself.)\n\nThat was an important move by Microsoft, which it isn't given any credit for here, but that said, I still don't think the company goes far enough. As I've said before, an extra year of support is certainly welcome, but Microsoft needs to look at a further extended program for consumers.\n\nSo, while the lawsuit does go off the rails (at least for me) around these issues, it does effectively put a spotlight on how we're looking at measuring support, and a different perspective other than a hard timeframe. Instead of talking about 'x' years of extended coverage, it mentions a level of Windows 10 adoption that should be reached before Microsoft pulls the plug on support for the OS.\n\nI think that's a valuable new angle on this whole affair, and while 10% of total Windows users \u2013 which is the low bar Klein sets for Windows 10 \u2013 maybe feels too low, there's an interesting conversation to be had here. (The other route Klein's suit suggests, which others have raised, is Microsoft simply relaxing the hardware requirements for Windows 11 - but I think at this stage of the game, we can safely conclude that this won't be happening.)\n\nMy final point in terms of why this lawsuit could prove a compelling kick in the seat of the pants for Microsoft is that while, as already observed, I can't see Klein triumphing over the company, it's more fuel to the fire in the campaign to stave off a potentially major e-waste catastrophe.\n\nSimply put, the PR around this \u2013 and it has been spinning up headlines aplenty over the past couple of days \u2013 is another reason for Microsoft to sit up, take notice, and maybe do some rethinking over exactly how Windows 10's End of Life is being implemented.\n\nWe've already seen one concession \u2013 the aforementioned free route to get extended support for Windows 10 \u2013 in recent times, which surely must have been a reaction to the frustration that Klein and many others feel. So, perhaps this lawsuit could be the catalyst to prod Microsoft into going further in its appeasement of the unhappy Windows 10 users out there \u2013 fingers crossed, at any rate.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Microsoft finally fixes one frustrating Windows 11 pop-up \u2013 just as a more irritating one arrives to take its place\n\u2022 Microsoft promises to crack one of the biggest problems with Windows 11: slow performance\n\u2022 Microsoft has all but given up on Windows 11 SE \u2013 and it looks like the war against Chromebooks has been lost",

      "text": "Windows 10 is ten years old and it had some of the best and worst ideas ever\nEdge and Windows Hello FTW\nI'm writing this Windows 10 tribute on a MacBook Air, which tells you exactly how well my relationship with Windows is going. Even so, back in the day, Windows 10 was a broadly good iteration of Microsoft's venerable platform, and it was also a showcase for one of Microsoft's most quixotic efforts: Cortana.\nMicrosoft and Windows were my jam, and I spent decades covering every version of Windows from Windows 3.1 to Windows 11, but Windows 10 was special. It fixed so many missteps, all while taking a rather huge digital assistant and other swings.\nNow, though, we celebrate Windows 10's tenth birthday with the specter of its demise looming in October. That's when Microsoft will officially stop supporting Windows 10. Until quite recently, it was overwhelmingly Microsoft's most popular Windows version. Windows 11, its adoption held back in part by stringent TPM 2.0 security requirements that many still-new PCs could not meet, has in recent months surged to essentially match the Windows 10 install base.\nSome of the best stuff\nWindows 10 was one of the upgrades that introduced bold new furniture without redesigning the whole house. The platform felt familiar, but I remember bumping into a cluster of new ideas, some that stuck and others that were dropped by the time Windows 11 arrived.\nThis was the update where Microsoft finally shoved aside the much-maligned Internet Explorer in favor of Microsoft Edge. Over time, it grew into my favorite web browser, one I loved for its vertical tabs, speed, and stability. It's still a distant third in browser market share, behind Safari and Chrome, even though it uses the same Web engine, Chromium, as Chrome.\nWindows 10 introduced Windows Hello, a biometric security system so new that most PCs at the time didn't fully support it. The face ID system relied on 3D scanning, which used standard and IR cameras to map a face. Even the laptop I tested Windows 10 on in 2015, a Surface Pro 3, couldn't fully support Windows Hello, though subsequent Surfaces would all ship with it as standard equipment. I loved how easy it was to unlock my PC and that it was virtually impossible to fool.\nThere were other nifty bits like the Action Center, which thankfully replaced Windows 8-style Charms, and the Xbox App, which brought the console's profile management and other gaming features to the Windows platform.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nLike most of the best platform updates, Windows 10 remained fantastically familiar with unchanged Printer menu, Device Manager, File Manager, File Folders, and Recycle Bin. Some might argue, as I did at the time, that Microsoft was still struggling to go more than skin deep with its Windows updates. After all, the inscrutable Registry was still a thing. But to know and love Windows is to understand that it's still the world's most widely used platform. Fundamental changes to the core of the OS risk breaking Windows for millions of users and, possibly, rendering some of their trusted hardware and systems incompatible. I always appreciated the care Microsoft took in not severing these critical connections.\nNot all the great ideas\nThere were still vestiges of Windows 8 oddities living on in Windows 10, like Continuum, which could transform Windows into a touch-first interface for use on tablets like the Surface Pro. I know, no one uses Surface devices without keyboards, but Microsoft always positioned the convertibles as, well, convertibles. They thought the Surface Pro could ably compete with both the iPad and the MacBook Air. In the end, all Surface devices, those with or without detachable keyboards, mostly compete with traditional laptops. Continuum's disappearance in Windows 11 is mourned by no one.\nThis brings us to Cortana, Microsoft's biggest Windows 10 idea.\nCortana was not, in and of itself, new. After all, Microsoft took the name and modeled the digital voice assistant on Master Chief's helpful (and occasionally murderous) AI companion in the company's popular Halo console game series.\nIn Windows 10, Cortana occupied critical real estate next to the start button. It essentially replaced Search. You could talk to it and ask it to manage some system tasks. It was even a bit conversational. That's right, years before ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini, Microsoft had us talking to our computers.\nHere's how, in 2015, I described an early interaction with Cortana:\n\"Cortana can be smart and sassy. When I told her to \"turn on Bluetooth,\" she perfectly interpreted my speech and, because she has access to system-level tools, told me (in her Halo-esque Cortana voice) that she had turned on Bluetooth. And when I asked Cortana, \u201cFlights in Denver,\u201d she correctly interpreted it and launched a webpage featuring MSN Travel results for flights. Later I asked her if she would marry me and she responded: \"Among a handful of challenges, I don't think the Supreme Court would approve just yet.\" She's such a card.\"\nSome things never change.\nCortana was as adept at written queries as she was at spoken ones and could even launch a Bing search for web-based queries, which is ironic since Bing's big ChatGPT-powered AI glow-up marked the end of the line for Cortana. Microsoft ended Cortana's standalone app existence in 2023, right around the time it introduced Bing AI, which was built on ChatGPT, and that eventually became Copilot.\nWhat Windows 11 got wrong\nWindows 11, which arrived roughly six years after Windows 10 is arguably a better version of Windows, ushering in one of the platform's most radical redesigns, including a divisive, centered task bar, finally redesigned core app icons, and a deeply integrated Copilot that is riding the AI interrest wave to a prominence Cortana could only dream of.\nStill, Microsoft's insistence on requiring TPM 2.0 support when it knew that vast numbers of consumers owned PCs that didn't include that was the opposite of the classic Windows big-tent approach: support everyone, make everyone happy. To be fair. Better security is better for everyone, but if Microsoft knew it was going to do that, it should've given Microsoft customers five years' notice and worked with Windows system partners to sell them all TPM 2.0-ready PCs.\nI celebrate and will ultimately miss Windows 10. It's the bridge between the iconic Windows many of us grew up with and all that it would become in the 21st century. In it, Microsoft was willing to try big ideas, all while still holding its arms open for a deep embrace of all Windows PC owners. Windows 11 never felt like that, and now, as everyone is herded onto the Windows 11 and soon, Windows 12 train, it's worth taking one last look back at maybe the best Windows there ever was or will be.\nYou might also like\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered technology since PCs were the size of suitcases and \u201con line\u201d meant \u201cwaiting.\u201d He\u2019s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before that, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for Ziff Davis, Inc.

      "text": "Can\u2019t upgrade your PC to Windows 11? Buy a new one, is Microsoft\u2019s laughable solution\nMicrosoft\u2019s advice may make some sense from a limited perspective, but it glosses over concerns about a towering scrapheap of Windows 10 PCs\nWindows 11 adoption has been way slower than Microsoft would like, no doubt, and part of the reason for that is that some PCs (particularly older models) can\u2019t upgrade due to system requirements \u2013 and if you fall into that boat, the software giant has some simple advice for you: buy a new PC.\nNeowin noticed that Microsoft has updated a help document about what it means if you\u2019re using an unsupported version of Windows (spoiler alert: if you\u2019re online at all, it\u2019s a huge security risk), which currently means PCs running Windows 8.1 (or 8) and Windows 7, or earlier.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that this will also be the case for Windows 10 devices in a year\u2019s time if their owners don\u2019t take any action, as the end of support rolls around for that OS in October 2025.\nMicrosoft\u2019s article takes the form of a short discussion followed by a FAQ, and the main update applied to the document pertains to the options for staying supported with Windows, with a new choice added here: \u2018Recommended: New PC with Windows 11.\u2019\nSo, this is Microsoft\u2019s primary recommendation if your unsupported PC isn\u2019t up to scratch, hardware-wise, for Windows 11 \u2013 get a new computer.\nMicrosoft elaborates: \u201cWindows 11 is the most current version of Windows. If you have an older PC, we recommend you move to Windows 11 by buying a new PC. Hardware and software have improved a lot, and today\u2019s computers are faster, more powerful, and more secure.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s a link to \u2018view Windows 11 PCs\u2019 which takes you to Microsoft\u2019s hub which showcases new devices from itself and partners.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAnalysis: That enormous landfill blot looming on the horizon\nThat first (\u2018recommended\u2019) choice of buying a new PC is not the only option covered in the FAQ, of course. Microsoft also lists a couple of other possibilities, including upgrading your old computer to Windows 11 \u2013 maybe via Windows 10 first \u2013 but this may not be possible with older PCs. Indeed, a PC running Windows 8 (from pre-2015, when Windows 10 started arriving on new hardware) will very likely not meet the needed system specs for Windows 11 (the CPU will probably be too old, and TPM security requirement may not be met either).\nAnd, in fairness to Microsoft, an upgrade of such an ailing PC to Windows 11 may indeed be relatively impractical (as you\u2019ll likely have to replace a bunch of components \u2013 the CPU, the motherboard to get a socket that fits the new CPU, and probably memory too, and maybe more besides). By the time you reach the end of the component shopping list, you may as well be buying a new PC (with a new warranty to boot), and of course some PC owners won\u2019t want to take on such an upgrade, or have the technical knowhow to do so.\nSo, in this case, Microsoft\u2019s foremost recommendation to get a new PC makes at least some sense \u2013 to those with rapidly aging PCs, as frankly, in some scenarios they might not have much choice, particularly if they\u2019re not tech-savvy, or they have a laptop (or all-in-one PC) which can\u2019t be got inside and upgraded anyway.\nHowever, it\u2019s equally true that some folks (perhaps quite a few) could upgrade to Windows 10 (with its lighter system requirements) if not Windows 11, a possibility Microsoft touches on \u2013 while simultaneously observing that support runs out in a year for Windows 10, a fairly sizeable caveat. And indeed, therein lies the rub \u2013 we must bear in mind that this article\u2019s advice will apply to Windows 10 PC owners next year, when they find themselves in the unsupported boat.\nGiven that, it\u2019d be nice to see Microsoft working towards a solution in respect of somewhat newer PCs, which goes somewhere down the path of tackling some of the alarming stats we\u2019ve heard about the number of Windows 10 machines heading to landfill in the future. This is a potential environmental disaster that could see hundreds of millions of PCs lumped unceremoniously on the scrapheap.\nAnd ever since those concerns have been raised, we haven\u2019t heard anything from Microsoft as to how they might be mitigated. What Windows 10 users (who can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, upgrade) can do is pay for extended support beyond October 2025 \u2013 but that could turn out to be an expensive way to go, particularly beyond the first year if Microsoft\u2019s previous pricing in these schemes is anything to go by.\nLogically, then, Microsoft needs to be looking at a way of keeping Windows 10 alive \u2013 for those totally blocked by Windows 11\u2019s more demanding requirements on the security front and elsewhere \u2013 which works out to be way more cost-friendly for users, in an effort to save what might be a much heavier price to pay for the planet. In short, \u2018buy a new PC\u2019 will soon not be the answer we need frontloaded here, and pushing folks to make a purchase of a new computer is already a very dubious first port of call given what we\u2019re facing down the road.\nYou may also like...\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "Microsoft accused of \u2018tech extortion\u2019 over Windows 10 support ending, from campaign urging people to upgrade to Linux\nKDE concocts a campaign that pulls no punches\n- KDE has a campaign to persuade Windows 10 users to switch to Linux\n- The desktop environment maker accuses Microsoft of \u2018tech extortion\u2019 with the end of support deadline for Windows 10\n- There are serious environmental concerns here, but at the same time, the language used in this campaign is going too far\nAs Windows 10 comes nearer to its End of Life \u2013 and we\u2019re getting quite close now \u2013 there\u2019s a growing movement attempting to persuade those who can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) switch to Windows 11 to migrate to Linux instead.\nRecently we saw the \u2018End of 10\u2019 project, which is a group of Linux enthusiasts urging folks to switch to one of the flavors (known as distros) of that operating system as an alternative to Microsoft.\nAnd now, Windows Latest flagged up that we\u2019ve got \u2018KDE for Windows 10 Exiles\u2019 which is, shall we say, a bit more full-on in its attempts to persuade people to defect to Linux.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what KDE is, it makes a desktop environment called Plasma which comes preinstalled with some of the best Linux distros (and can be installed with others, too).\nThe portal on the official KDE website doesn\u2019t pull any punches, as we\u2019re told: \u201cRunning Windows 10 on your computer? On October 14 Microsoft wants to turn it into junk.\n\u201cIt may seem like it continues to work after that date for a bit, but when Microsoft stops support for Windows 10, your perfectly good computer will be officially obsolete.\u201d\nKDE then points out that if it\u2019s unpatched, which is what happens when support ceases, Windows 10 is insecure, and you open yourself to being hacked, adding that also: \u201cNew versions of your apps will not run, but Microsoft will still block you from upgrading to the next version of Windows until you buy the new computer they decide.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n\u201cYou will be forced to spend your hard-earned cash and will be unwillingly polluting the earth and water as your old machine rots in a landfill. The air will also be polluted with the emissions that come from manufacturing and shipping a new device you don\u2019t really need.\n\u201cEven if you agree to this tech extortion now, in a few years time, they will do it again as they have done many times in the past.\u201d\nAnalysis: Firing the big guns\nOuch, in a word. That\u2019s quite the heavy cannon fire aimed at Microsoft. Indeed, the KDE website accuses Microsoft of leveraging a form of \u2018tech extortion\u2019 here \u2013 but is this fair? Not really, no, but it\u2019s not entirely baseless either.\nThe anger is coming from the fact that Windows 11\u2019s heftier system requirements mean that some Windows 10 PCs simply can\u2019t have the newer OS, because their CPU is too old (or they don\u2019t have TPM 2.0, a security feature).\nThis could be an impossible issue to resolve with a laptop (where the hardware can\u2019t be replaced at all), and perhaps even super-tricky on a desktop PC (you may end up upgrading basically everything, which might be well beyond the abilities of many owners, or not make any sense cost-wise).\nThat enforcement of a loftier PC spec is done for what Microsoft argues is (primarily) security improvements with Windows 11, and it\u2019s a move that many organizations have criticized because it\u2019s likely to push a whole heap of computers onto the scrapheap. This is where the stark images of landfill come into play, and this is a looking environmental disaster on the tech front, I wouldn\u2019t argue against that.\nCan Linux rescue your old PC from that fate? Well, yes it can, though it\u2019s not quite as simple as that. For less tech-savvy users, a move to Linux will be a complex process where they may wonder where to even begin (picking a good Linux distro for beginners, or perhaps one that\u2019s similar to Windows, would be a start).\nAnd I can\u2019t pretend there aren\u2019t serious shortcomings with Linux in some ways: it\u2019s a whole new interface to learn, some of the apps you\u2019ve spent money on may not work with the OS, and certainly some games won\u2019t run (at all).\nThere are brick walls that may be run up against, including potential hardware or driver issues \u2013 and for a less experienced computer user, that\u2019s going to be a whole lot to cope with, only relying on online support from the community to get them through. (Although I must admit, the Linux community cannot be faulted for their helpfulness).\nI\u2019ve covered this ground before, but for somewhat more experienced Windows 10 users, a switch to Linux could be a viable enough way to keep old hardware alive. For the less confident tech types out there, though, maybe not so much.\nAs for calling out Microsoft for extortion \u2013 well, that\u2019s going too far. Windows is a paid OS, and as such, it won\u2019t last forever. Windows 10 has been around for a decade, so really, that\u2019s hardly bad value for money \u2013 especially seeing as a fair few folks got the upgrade for free, anyway. You can also pay for another year of support for Windows 10, and it doesn\u2019t cost a whole lot.\nIf I was to chuck stones at Microsoft\u2019s Windows greenhouse, it would be for including promotional activity in a paid-for OS, not charging for the software in the first place. That is a serious frustration with Windows. It\u2019d also be nice to have the option of extended support for consumers that\u2019s longer than a year, too (while that could still happen, Microsoft hasn\u2019t said it will yet).\nIt\u2019s worth noting that some folks who work on KDE were part of the End of 10 project, and there\u2019s a link across to the latter website, too. So, it\u2019d appear that KDE really is making a big play to capitalize on disgruntled types who feel Microsoft is being unfair with its Windows 11 system requirements, and that\u2019s fair enough.\nHowever, I think it\u2019d be wise to rein in some of the language and the way this campaign is angled here.\nYou might also like...\n- Windows 11 is getting some big upgrades to tackle dreaded boot failures \u2013 and help novices set up their new PC\n- Been hiding from Windows 11 24H2 due to the fuss about all the bugs? There\u2019s nowhere to run now as Microsoft\u2019s made the update compulsory\n- Windows 11 fully streamlined in just two clicks? Talon utility promises to rip all the bloatware out of Microsoft\u2019s OS in a hassle-free way\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "Microsoft has all but given up on Windows 11 SE \u2013 and it looks like the war against Chromebooks has been lost\nSurface Laptop SE owners may well be confused here, too - with good reason\n- Microsoft has said Windows 11 SE will run out of support in October 2026\n- This brings an end to this alternative spin on Windows 11\n- However, Surface Laptop SE owners were previously promised a longer timeframe of support for their devices\nMicrosoft has announced that it's dropping support for Windows 11 SE in just over a year's time, leaving buyers of low-cost laptops running this spin on its OS in the lurch - and admitting defeat with this most recent initiative to take on Google's Chromebooks.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Windows 11 SE, it was designed as a (kind of) lightweight version of the desktop operating system. It was preinstalled on affordable laptops that were priced to do well in the education sector, trying to take a piece of the pie that Chromebooks dominate (SE seemingly stood for Student or School Edition).\nWindows Central reports that Microsoft announced via its Learn portal that Windows 11 SE support is being shuttered in October 2026.\nThe company said: \"Microsoft will not release a feature update after Windows 11 SE, version 24H2. Support for Windows 11 SE - including software updates, technical assistance, and security fixes - will end in October 2026. While your device will continue to work, we recommend transitioning to a device that supports another edition of Windows 11 to ensure continued support and security.\"\nSo, you won't be provided with Windows 11 25H2 later this year on your SE device, if you own one - version 24H2 is as far down the line as you'll get, and all updates will cease full-stop in just over a year.\nAnalysis: Silly Ending for a Student Edition?\nMicrosoft has been trying to take on Google's Chromebooks for a long time now, including efforts such as Windows 10X - which badly misfired and ended up being canned before it even arrived. Windows 11 SE was the most recent effort, emerging late in 2021, and it was showcased by Microsoft in its Surface Laptop SE. However, as we observed in our review of that machine, there was a problem here - the performance level of the notebook was rather poor.\nThe simple truth about Windows 11 SE is that while it was supposed to be a streamlined operating system for low-cost devices, this variant of the desktop OS was still too unwieldy. There just wasn't enough emphasis on trimming down Windows 11 so it performed better.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIndeed, much of the thrust of Windows 11 SE was about simplifying the computing experience for students - the interface, and locking the system to only admin-approved apps, plus cloud services - rather than actually streamlining the operating system so it ran well on lesser hardware. And let's be honest, the latter was the whole point, really, at least in terms of making affordable laptops to rival cheap Chromebooks (which run very slickly indeed, despite their low cost).\nSo, all in all, it's not surprising to see Microsoft shutter this effort in this manner. What is surprising, though, is how owners of Windows 11 SE machines, like the Surface Laptop SE, have now been left in the lurch by this announcement that support is being killed in a year.\nAs Neowin, which also picked up on this move, points out, the Surface Laptop SE has an end-of-service date (for firmware and drivers) of January 11, 2028. But with Microsoft now having revealed that Windows 11 SE won't be going on beyond October 2026, that's cutting this support window (pun not intended) short by over a year.\nThose who own a Surface Laptop SE, who thought they were good for another couple of years, have effectively now been told they're going to be a year shorter on support. If Microsoft promised support for this showcase laptop through to 2028, then why not extend support for the dedicated OS it runs to that date, too? Strong-arming folks into moving early hardly seems fair here.\nIt seems an odd decision to make, and one that won't endear Microsoft to some people. Indeed, when it comes to Microsoft's next big shot at taking on Chromebooks - if there is one - those in the education sector might remember what's happened here, and be less trusting of new ideas from the software giant.\nFor those who do have a laptop running Windows 11 SE, and now need to plan on switching away sooner from that OS, maybe to a different flavor of Windows 11, this is possible, albeit somewhat problematic in some reported cases. Going by this Reddit thread, if you're running into trouble in this endeavor, you may want to try turning off Secure Boot in the laptop's BIOS to get a working installation of Windows 11 Home or Pro on an SE machine (you can switch the feature back on afterwards, apparently).\nYou might also like...\n- Fed up with your mouse cursor supersizing itself randomly in Windows 11?

      "text": "Microsoft finally fixes one frustrating Windows 11 pop-up \u2013 just as a more irritating one arrives to take its place\nGiving with one hand, taking with the other\u2026\n- Windows 11 users are seeing a positive change, but also a less-welcome one\n- The good news is the 'second-chance out-of-box experience' nag has been streamlined considerably\n- The bad news is there's a new nag pop-up in the Start menu that pushes you towards taking out a OneDrive subscription\nMicrosoft has tidied up one annoyance with Windows 11, but sadly appears to have introduced another - and more vexing \u2013 irritation in its place.\nLet's start with the good news here, which Neowin flagged up and involves the 'second-chance out-of-box experience' (SCOOBE for short). That's fancy-talk for a nag screen that appears after booting to the desktop, trying to get you to configure elements of Windows 11 that you didn't bother with when setting up your PC originally.\nSetting up your Windows PC is known as the out-of-box experience (OOBE), as in you just got the device out of the box and turned it on \u2013 so this panel is essentially pushing this stuff on you again, in the hopes you might use the Windows Backup app, for instance (or switch to Edge).\nNow, as it exists currently, this SCOOBE nagging is a multi-panel affair that you have to click through (there are three panels, if my memory serves correctly).\nHowever, in a recent preview release in the Dev channel for Windows 11 (build 26200.5722), Microsoft has changed the SCOOBE so it's just a single panel, and you can dismiss it with one click.\nAt least now when it appears \u2013 and if you leave parts of Windows 11 setup unfinished it'll keep popping up every few months or so \u2013 it'll be more painless to swat aside.\nSo, that's something (vaguely) positive \u2013 but unfortunately Microsoft appears to have introduced a new nag in its place.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWindows Latest noticed the new, more annoying, addition that has arrived in the Start menu of Windows 11 and consists of a pop-up that states: 'Action advised \u2013 back up your PC'.\nUnderneath that is some spiel about backing up your files, settings and so forth in the cloud, and if you click on the 'Continue' prompt Microsoft provides you'll be whisked off to Windows Backup. (And that backup app is facilitated by OneDrive \u2013 and with the low amount of free space included with Microsoft's cloud storage service, you'll almost certainly need a subscription, which is the crux of this prompt in terms of selling you something).\nAnalysis: SCOOBE Dooby don't\nSo, while this Start menu addition is a warning on the face of it, really it's just a way of trying to get you to take out a subscription with Microsoft. And while this could be a useful prompt to remind some people they need to back up their files, the problem is that others may well have already sorted out a backup via another app (or gone elsewhere in the cloud) \u2013 but if they've not used Microsoft's official channel, then they're going to get nagged to do so.\nAs Windows Latest makes clear, these prompts will likely keep appearing periodically \u2013 like the SCOOBE \u2013 and there's no way you can turn them off. That's because Microsoft has flagged this Windows Backup nag as a 'required' prompt, so it can't be avoided, unlike the SCOOBE, which you can actually switch off. (You can do so in Settings > System > Notifications > Additional Settings).\nIn my book, there should be no such thing as compulsory nags, and if you want to use Windows 11 without being pestered by a single pop-up along these lines, you should be able to tick a box to that effect. Interestingly, Windows Latest observes that with a test Windows 11 installation using an EU region, this alert didn't appear in the Start menu \u2013 so this change may not happen in Europe due to its data regulations (which are proving quite a boon in some ways).\nYou might also like...\n- Microsoft promises to crack one of the biggest problems with Windows 11: slow performance\n- Microsoft finally plays its trump AI card, Recall, in Windows 11 \u2013 but for me, it\u2019s completely overshadowed by another new ability for Copilot+ PCs\n- Microsoft has all but given up on Windows 11 SE \u2013 and it looks like the war against Chromebooks has been lost\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "It only took four years, but Windows 11 is now the most popular desktop OS - and time is running out for Windows 10\nThe support deadline for Windows 10 is close now - but there isn't the same sense of urgency to upgrade that there once was\n- Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 for market share\n- 52% of those using Microsoft's desktop operating systems are now on Windows 11\n- That's a hefty swing of almost 10% away from Windows 10\nAt long last, Windows 11 is present on more PCs globally than Windows 10, at least according to one set of figures from an analytics firm.\nStatCounter provided fresh statistics for July which show that Windows 11 has accelerated to account for 52% of all Windows versions worldwide, leaving Windows 10 in its wake on 44.59%.\nThat's quite a shift from the previous month where Windows 10 remained just in the lead on 48.76% with Windows 11 on 47.98%. So, Windows 11 was not far off a full percentage point behind in June, but is now in the lead by 7.4%, a swing of near 10%.\nCould this be the start of a mass exodus of Windows 10 stalwarts fleeing for the shores of Windows 11? Well, that can't be ruled out, and it's clear that time is running short when it comes to the looming deadline for the end of support for Windows 10, which is October 2025 - which is only three months away now.\nHowever, I'm not convinced that there will be a stampede of migrators, because while I've argued in the past that you should be making the upgrade to Windows 11 early - assuming you can (due to your PC's spec) - there's no longer quite the same sense of urgency in this matter.\nWhy not? Let's go over that next.\nAnalysis: Support and scrapheaps\nSomething changed with Windows 10's extended support program for consumers recently, and it's worth recapping in case you missed it. Microsoft decided to offer an alternative to the $30 fee that was previously required to get an extra year of security updates for Windows 10 (through to October 2026).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSo, instead of stumping up that cash, you can now elect to have the Windows Backup app sync all your PC's settings to the cloud. If you allow that to happen - via signing in with a Microsoft Account - then you can get the extra year of all-important security updates at no cost. This gives you a lot more breathing space to work out what you might want to do next, which is great for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to its loftier system requirements (or those who simply refuse).\nOf course, 'free' is not usually completely free, and the cost here, as it were, is allowing your settings to be synced. Due to this, some online commenters have accused Microsoft of almost a kind of 'blackmail' in terms of getting access to your data. However, I should note that the wording of Microsoft's offer is important here, and you're not syncing all your personal data to OneDrive or anything - all you have to sync are your Windows settings.\nAnd having those settings synced should help in the future, too, if you want to make the transition to Windows 11 (or the following version of Windows) at a later date on a new PC. Microsoft's hope, it seems, is this will make that transition easier, and so folks are therefore more likely to tread that path.\nI don't think there's any underlying motive from Microsoft here to get its claws into your personal data as some are suggesting, so in my book, this all seems fair enough. If you're not convinced, however, that's equally fair - you don't have to take Microsoft up on this option. You can pay instead (or redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points, if you have them, which is another alternative), or just go ahead and switch from Windows 10 come its End of Life in October 2025.\nWhatever you do, don't stay on Windows 10 without security updates - never mind worrying about Microsoft's nose potentially being in your data, a hacker could really make your life a misery by compromising your PC due to an unpatched vulnerability because your system doesn't have security updates.\nTaking a broader perspective, I've half-convinced myself that Microsoft may even offer more than a year of additional support to consumers (in the same way it treats businesses).\nMainly because this new Windows Backup-related offer has come in at the last minute, largely I suspect to assuage some of the fears of the 'towering scrapheap of Windows 10 PCs' activists who are (rightly) concerned about the environmental impact of Microsoft's Windows 11 system requirements. (Those that prevent a lot of would-be upgraders from moving to the newer OS, due to having an older CPU, or the lack of a specific security feature, TPM 2.0).\nAnd so I don't think it's unimaginable that Microsoft might offer a second year of extended support for consumers, and I very firmly believe the company should do so. We shall see, but for now, with an extra year of support on the table for free (effectively), there's no need to rush to abandon Windows 10 for many folks. Not unless your trust in Microsoft is particularly low, or you don't have a Microsoft account and don't want to sign up for one (to sync your settings).\nThere are, of course, other options aside from Windows - the main one being a switch to Linux. Of course, in that case, you need to be prepared to leave Microsoft's ecosystem and put up with some of the limitations that one of the best Linux distros will come with (mainly around compatible software, particularly PC games).\nMeanwhile, we can expect further spikes in adoption for Windows 11 in the near future, although perhaps not to the same extent that some people might expect, given those extra choices Microsoft has just introduced.\nYou might also like...\n- No, Windows 11 PCs aren't 'up to 2.3x faster' than Windows 10 devices, as Microsoft suggests \u2013 here's why that's an outlandish claim\n- macOS Tahoe 26: here's everything you need to know about all the new features\n- Can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11?

Doubtless as 2025 rolls onwards, we\u2019ll be seeing even more of this kind of badgering from Microsoft.\nBuying a new PC is an idea Microsoft has been pushing elsewhere for those whose machine isn\u2019t compatible with Windows 11\u2019s hardware requirements \u2013 likely due to a lack of TPM, or having an older processor.

      "text": "Californian man so furious about forced Windows 11 upgrade that he's suing Microsoft\nHe wants Microsoft to keep supporting Windows 10 until its market share drops below 10%\nMany are unhappy about Microsoft's Windows 10 retirement plans, but a California man appears to be angrier than most. He's sued Redmond over the matter, and is demanding continued free Win 10 updates until the OS's popularity wanes.\nComplainant Lawrence Klein is identified in the filing [PDF] only as a California resident who owns two Windows 10 laptops that can't be updated to Windows 11 due to their lack of a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 (TPM), which is required for the updated OS to run. Microsoft designed that restriction to improve security, but the company previously had a workaround that would allow you to install the OS without TPM.\n\"With only three months until support ends for Windows 10, it is likely that many millions of users will not buy new devices or pay for extended support,\" Klein's lawyers argue in their complaint. Support for Windows 10 ends on October 14.\nKlein's argument boils down to claims that Microsoft violated California's business, advertising, and consumer legal relief regulations by forcing unnecessary upgrades on Windows 10 users and leaving those who choose not to upgrade without necessary security updates.\nUsers actually don't have to switch to Windows 11 to keep getting support after October, however. Microsoft currently charges $30 for the first year of extended Windows 10 support, and you get this year free if you use Microsoft Reward points or sign in with a Microsoft account and sync your data to the cloud.\nBut Klein wants the court to force Microsoft to offer free support for Windows 10 \"until the number of devices running the OS falls below 10% of total Windows users.\" Alternatively, his lawyers said, the court could also force Microsoft to loosen those unnecessary hardware restrictions.\nA rushed phaseout\nThe complaint says that, unlike with previous Windows phaseouts, the end of life for Windows 10 is premature.\nAfter Windows XP, which lost support seven years after Vista's release, all the subsequent versions of Windows ended their lives eight years after their successor launched. Windows 11 has only been on the market for four years, meaning that Windows 10 should have another four years of support available if Microsoft had adhered to the same retirement calendar.\nThe complaint also notes that Windows 10 still had more than 50 percent market share at the time Microsoft announced the phaseout plans last year. This has since changed, with Windows 11 finally overtaking Windows 10 in July when the new OS reached 53.5 percent of Windows installations, but nearly 43 percent are still on Win 10.\nThat's far more than prior phaseouts, the complaint contends.\n\"Each time Microsoft announced that it would end support for an operating system, the number of active users had declined to a small overall percentage of the operating systems in use,\" Klein's legal team maintains.\n- Windows 10 turns 10: Dying OS just worked, lacked compatibility chaos\n- Windows 11 leads as October looms, but millions still cling to Windows 10\n- How to stay on Windows 10 instead of installing Linux\n- Microsoft confirms there will be no U-turn on Windows 11 hardware requirements\nIn essence, Klein argues, the Windows 11 transition has been forced, artificial, and unfriendly to users, while potentially being incredibly profitable for Microsoft and the PC makers that license Windows from it.\n\"Windows 11 does not present many enticing features that warrant an upgrade, and consumers do not find the new interface appealing,\" the complaint continues. \"This sluggish demand for Windows 11 presents a unique challenge to Microsoft in the race to corner the AI market.\"\nBy forcing users to transition to a PC that's fully compatible with Windows 11 and Copilot, Microsoft could build an advantage over competing AI firms.\n\"Consumers do not need to seek out or install Copilot because it is already integrated into the OS. Microsoft can also actively promote Copilot within Windows 11 settings, making it a central AI experience,\" the complaint states. \"In contrast, other AI companies ... rely on web-based or app-based distribution, meaning they must convince users to opt in rather than being the default AI assistant.\"\nIn other words, Microsoft and the OEM manufacturers of AI PCs and other Windows 11 devices have a strong incentive to make 2025 year of the Windows 11 refresh, and need to push satisfied Windows 10 users along.\nMicrosoft didn't respond to questions for this story. \u00ae"

      "text": "Hate Windows 11 and don't want to upgrade? You can now extend the life of Windows 10 until October 2026 \u2013 here's how\nFree updates for another year with Microsoft's ESU scheme\n- Windows 10's scheme for extended updates is now open\n- You can sign up using your Microsoft account and get free updates (if you sync your PC settings to OneDrive)\n- The enrollment wizard to access the scheme seems to still be rolling out, but you should see it very soon\nWindows 10 users can now sign up for extended updates, meaning security patches that are delivered past the end-of-support deadline to keep the PC safe.\nAs you're doubtless aware, it isn't long before Windows 10's End of Life arrives, when Microsoft officially stops supplying security updates (or feature updates for that matter). This happens on October 14, 2025, and after that date a PC without updates will potentially be open to exploits.\nThe Extended Security Updates (ESU) program allows for Windows 10 users to sign up for another year of updates, all the way through to October 2026, and enrollment for that scheme has now opened to consumers.\nIn a blog post (mostly pertaining to the most recent update for Windows 11, and the heap of new AI features therein), Microsoft explains that: \"Starting today, individuals will begin to see an enrollment wizard through notifications and in Settings, making it simple to select the best option for you and enroll in ESU directly from your personal Windows 10 PC.\"\nHow to enroll for the Extended Security Updates program\nAt this point you might be scratching your head and asking: so where is this enrollment wizard?\nAs Microsoft observes above, you may see a notification pop up in Windows 10 offering a link to sign up for the ESU scheme \u2013 and obviously you can use that if you see it. Otherwise, you can head to Windows Update (in Settings), where you should find a link to the same end, though you may have to bide your time.\nIn the Windows Update panel, you may see a link to 'enroll now' for Extended Security Updates either under where you check for updates (at the top), or with the links over on the right-hand side. I can't see this on my Windows 10 PC yet, but this YouTube video (from ThioJoe) shows where the links should be visible.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe reason why I can't see this is presumably because the rollout hasn't fully kicked off yet. As Microsoft says in the blog post, consumers will \"begin to see\" the enrollment wizard, meaning the rollout hasn't reached everyone yet. You may not see it either, and it's just a case of being patient \u2013 nobody should have long to wait at this point.\nWhatever the case, when you click to enroll, if you're not signed in to a Microsoft account, you must do so. This is because you'll need to register for the scheme, and also if you want to get the year of extra updates for free you'll need to be signed in to verify that you have synced your PC settings using the Windows Backup app.\nThat's the alternative way to enroll for the ESU, as opposed to paying a $30 fee (or using Microsoft Rewards points, which is a third option). Note that you don't have to use Windows Backup to actually make a full backup of your system to get free updates, you just need to sync your PC settings to OneDrive using this app, which seems a relatively small price to pay (compared to $30, certainly).\nThose who've already synced settings in this way will be able to click straight through and get the ESU offer for free with no fuss.\nAccording to YouTuber ThioJoe, it is possible to sign in to a Microsoft account to get the ESU on your PC, then switch away to a local account afterwards \u2013 and you'll still receive the additional updates throughout 2026 on that computer. Just in case you were curious about that tactic, it works \u2013 or so we're told, anyway.\nYou might also like...\n- Microsoft promises to crack one of the biggest problems with Windows 11: slow performance\n- Windows 11's handheld mode spotted in testing, and I'm seriously excited for Microsoft's big bet on small-screen gaming\n- No, Windows 11 PCs aren't 'up to 2.3x faster' than Windows 10 devices, as Microsoft suggests \u2013 here's why that's an outlandish claim\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "Windows 11 system requirements \u2013 is your PC compatible?\nMay the odds be in your favor\nNow that the newest operating system from Microsoft is out, you might be wondering what the Windows 11 requirements are before grabbing that free upgrade. Since it is so new, not every Windows laptop or PC out there will meet the minimum requirements to take advantage of what the OS has to offer.\nSome of the requirements are a bit unusual. Now that security is a focus, rare hardware like a TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) is a must to make the new OS the most secure Microsoft has ever released. This will be frustrating to a lot of people looking to upgrade since they might not have the right hardware, even if they have a somewhat new laptop or powerful gaming PC.\nBut, there\u2019s no need to rush out and buy a device just to get access to Windows 11 pre-installed as Windows 10 will be supported until 2025. But, you can do a few things to prep your current machine to make the leap to the new OS sooner than later.\n- Check out our Windows 11 review\n- Find out where to buy Windows 10\n- How to download Windows 11 right now\nWindows 11 system requirements\nIf you head on over to the Microsoft page for Windows 11, you can find a section right at the bottom of the page for the PC Health Check App. While its original release caused a great deal of confusion (listing new, powerful PCs and laptops as unable to support the upcoming OS without stating a specific reason), this has since been fixed.\n- Download the PC Health Check app found on the link provided above.\n- Run the downloaded file and follow the onscreen instructions to start the installation process\n- When installation has finished, run the application and you should see the \"PC health at a glance\" screen.\n- Under the Introducing Windows 11 section, click the Check now button.\n- When completed you will see one of two messages, either \"This PC can run Windows 11\" or \"This PC can't run Windows 11\".\nThere are still a few issues we will go over later but this is the quickest way to find out if your PC or laptop is windows 11 ready.\nIf you want a full overview of what components your device will need, here is the full list of minimum system requirements you need to meet to be eligible for the free Windows 11 upgrade:\n- 64-bit processor (a full list of compatible CPUs can be found on the Microsoft Blog)\n- 1Ghz clock speed\n- 4GB of RAM\n- 64GB drive\n- UEFI, Secure Boot capable\n- TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module)\n- A display larger than 9-inches with HD Resolution (1366x768)\n- DirectX 12 compatible graphics / WDDM 2.x\n- Internet connection\nMost devices released in the last few years will meet these requirements with ease, save for one: the TPM 2.0 module took many people by surprise and caused many otherwise eligible devices to be rejected from the update, even resulting in temporary rapid inflation of prices for TPM modules as people scrambled to get one installed into their PCs.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Trusted Platform Module is basically a little security co-processor that beefs up your PC\u2019s defenses against being tampered with, but you wouldn\u2019t be alone if you\u2019ve never heard of it, though there's a chance that your device already has a TPM 2.0 module installed that needs enabling.\nSo before you run off to add one to your basket, try the following:\n- Press Windows key + R\n- When the box appears, type tpm.msc to open the Trusted Platform Module Management window\n- Look for a sub-window titled TPM Manufacturer Information and check under Specification Version to see what TPM version your device has\nWhat if my system isn't compatible?\nA Windows 11 Readiness Audit conducted by LanSweeper revealed that over 55% of enterprise systems don't use a supported CPU to run the OS, with an additional 19% of laptops and PCs surveyed failing to meet the TPM 2.0 requirement, so if you find that Microsoft isn't content to upgrade your device, you won't be alone.\nMicrosoft has argued that the requirements for Windows 11 are in place for security reasons, so while the reasoning is justified, many of us will still be understandably frustrated that Microsoft is unlikely to change its stance on the matter.\nIf you attempt to install Windows 11 on a device that doesn't meet the system requirements then it's possible that you won't receive updates and that all future support will be dropped. If you try and force an installation anyway then some users have reported a pop-up window that asks you to sign a waiver that makes you acknowledge all damages to your PC due to a lack of compatibility will not be covered under your manufacturer's warranty.\nNot all hope is lost if you're prepared to be a little naughty though. You can bypass the TPM 2.0 requirement thanks to a GitHub project that contains a script called 'Skip_TPM_Check_on_Dynamic_Update.cmd,' which will allow the Windows 11 installer to ignore an insufficient TPM module (or a lack of one entirely).\nIn fact, this script doesn't just remove the TPM 2.0 limitation, also allowing the Windows 11 installer to ignore other issues that don't meet the system requirements such as available storage space.\nWe're in no way advising that you do this mind \u2013 these requirements have been put into place for a reason and ignoring them could result in an unstable version of the new OS, likely the reason why the waiver exists. Ignoring Microsoft's restrictions could void your warranty and leave you with an unusable device in the worst-case scenario so if you're set on trying to bypass the strict system requirements, do so at your own risk.\nIf you don't fancy breaking any rules then don't fret. Windows 11 PCs and laptops are coming in the next few months so if you have the cash to spare and were in need of an upgrade, you can get the best of both worlds by just ensuring your next purchase comes with the new operating system installed.\n- Here are our picks of the best laptops in 2021\nJess is a former TechRadar Computing writer, where she covered all aspects of Mac and PC hardware, including PC gaming and peripherals.

Windows Insiders are encouraged to provide feedback when experiencing PC issues related to slow or sluggish performance, allowing Feedback Hub to automatically collect these logs, which will help us root cause issues faster.\"\nEssentially, Microsoft is attempting to expand the quantity and scope of logs relating to performance issues that it's receiving, in order to better deal with speed-related niggles in Windows 11.\nThe logs pertaining to performance issues are stored in a temporary folder on the system drive, and Microsoft says they're only sent across to the company when the user submits feedback (via the Feedback Hub, where there's a new section for reports of 'system sluggishness').\nAnalysis: exploring new avenues of improvement\nThere have been a good few complaints about performance hiccups \u2013 or indeed more serious failings \u2013 with Windows 11, so it's good to see Microsoft launch a fresh initiative to help combat these issues (with any luck \u2013 the results, of course, remain to be seen).\nSluggish search functionality and wonkiness with File Explorer performing sub-optimally have been a couple of obvious problems that Windows 11 has caused for some users.

      "text": "Windows 10 support ending could be an environmental disaster that puts 240 million PCs on the scrapheap\nMicrosoft needs to rethink Windows 10 support deadline, analyst firm warns\nWindows 10 running out of road for support is going to be something of an environmental disaster in terms of old PCs going into landfills, an analyst firm has warned.\nCanalys wrote an article on the state of the PC market and Windows 10\u2019s end-of-support date, which rolls around in October 2025 \u2013 still some way off, of course, but getting closer all the time.\nThe core issue here is not just support coming to an end for Windows 10 in just under two years, but that the hardware requirements for Windows 11 \u2013 ruling out PCs with older CPUs, and machines that lack Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 security functionality \u2013 mean that those computers likely won\u2019t be recycled either.\nAs Canalys puts it: \u201cDespite the channel\u2019s growing capabilities to support circularity, partners will not be able to refurbish and resell PCs unsupported by Windows 11.\u201d\nThe end result will be an estimated 240 million PCs becoming e-waste, which is around a fifth of all Windows 10 devices. Canalys underlines this by saying: \u201cIf these were all folded laptops, stacked one on top of another, they would make a pile 600km taller than the moon.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a stark, bleak image, though Canalys also observes that Microsoft does offer ways to extend support for Windows 10 \u2013 at a cost, naturally. You\u2019ll be able to pay for updates to continue to be piped through, as was the case with Windows 7 when its support expired. In fact, you\u2019ll be able to keep on going for another three years this way.\nThe trouble is that with Windows 7, Microsoft cranked up the costs of this scheme considerably with every additional year. Given that, Canalys argues that it likely won\u2019t be a cost-effective way for most businesses and individual users to proceed \u2013 and upgrading to a Windows 11 system will be the sensible path to take from a cost perspective.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis will be good news for PC manufacturers, but not so great news for the environment. Indeed, Canalys expects the PC market to grow again next year \u2013 by 8% in 2024, in fact \u2013 in contrast to this year, during which a sales slump hit vendors hard (Apple in particular struggled with Mac sales).\nAnalysis: Growing pressure on Microsoft\nThis isn\u2019t the first warning of this nature about how Windows 11\u2019s system requirements are bad news.\nIn October, PIRG, the Public Interest Research Group in the US, made an even gloomier forecast of 400 million Windows 10 PCs ending up on the scrapheap, and that the end of support for the old OS could usher in the biggest rise ever seen with junked computers.\nOf course, you could argue that Windows 10 has been around since 2015, and in 2025, that\u2019ll be a full decade of its existence \u2013 and you can\u2019t expect an operating system to last forever. We\u2019d agree with that, but the catch is, as mentioned, that Windows 11\u2019s requirements (in particular the need for TPM 2.0) are a concrete wall blocking upgrades for many users or businesses - something that has not been the case before.\nAfter several high-profile calls for action on this front, how will Microsoft respond? Maybe we can hope that the pricing for extended support for Windows 10 is reined in, compared to what was charged for Windows 7 (with an escalating scale as time went on, going up a lot in the final year).\nWe shall see, but a lot of noise is now being made about dire e-waste concerns here, and this is a topic Microsoft has been keen to be proactive with of late (in terms of more sustainable and easily repaired hardware, for example).\nYou might also like...\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "How to prepare for Windows 10 End of Life\nThe end is coming for Windows 10, and it\u2019ll be here sooner than you think \u2013 so what should you do?\nWindows 10 debuted in July way back in 2015, and the operating system has had a pretty good run \u2013 but the road is rapidly running out for support, and in fact the End of Life (EoL) for the OS is scheduled for next year, a decade after it first came out.\nMicrosoft will officially stop supporting Windows 10 in October 2025, when its successor, Windows 11, will become the only game in town (unless Windows 12 happens to creep out next year, that is).\nWhatever the case, come October 2025, if you\u2019re running Windows 10, it\u2019ll no longer receive updates. And right now, a whole lot of folks are still using Windows 10, with Windows market share figures showing the OS remains the dominant power, still way ahead of Windows 11.\nSo, if you\u2019re one of the majority of the computing public still using Windows 10, what do you need to do ahead of time, and what are your options as the End of Life date comes ever closer? Let\u2019s dive into the details and explore all the avenues potentially open to Windows 10 users.\nWindows 10 End of Life: on what date does Windows 10 support end?\nWindows 10 support ceases on October 14, 2025. While that might seem a long way off at this point, think of it this way: in a year, you\u2019ll be not much more than four months away from your operating system having all updates dropped. (And we all know how quickly a year seems to fly by these days).\nWindows 10 End of Life: what happens next?\nHaving no cumulative updates piped through to your Windows 10 PC is a big problem. Mind you, it doesn\u2019t mean your computer will suddenly stop working \u2013 in fact, Windows 10 will continue to chug along just fine. And doubtless there\u2019ll be a number of people that just keep on trucking with Windows 10 in this manner.\nThe trouble is that with no security updates being provided (well, except in very rare cases when Microsoft may make an exception), any vulnerabilities that become known in Windows 10 will remain open to exploit. And the longer time ticks on, the more of those exploits will be present, leaving multiple holes that could be leveraged by hackers to compromise your PC (and maybe your bank account or who knows what else).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWindows 10 End of Life: what should you do?\nSo, as you can see, while you can stick with Windows 10 beyond 2025 in theory, it really isn\u2019t recommended, especially not for any length of time. Given that, let\u2019s see what the best courses of action to take are, rather than remaining a sitting duck for hackers on an unprotected operating system.\nThe obvious choice is to switch to another OS which is fully supported and protected with security updates \u2013 like Windows 11 of course, or something entirely different. But there are possibilities besides this which we\u2019ll cover.\nWindows 10 End of Life: upgrading to Windows 11\nThe good news about upgrading to Windows 11 is that it\u2019s free for Window 10 users, but there is a catch of sorts. This lies in the hardware requirements, which Microsoft has made far more stringent than has previously been the case with Windows upgrades.\nTo make the move to Windows 11, your PC will need to support the hardware requirements we outline in full here \u2013 though the sticking points for many will likely lie in two main places.\nFirstly, if you have an Intel CPU older than an 8th-gen model (8000 series, such as the 8700K is fine for example), or an AMD processor older than a Ryzen 2000 series, then you won\u2019t be able to upgrade. And secondly, you need TPM 2.0 which is a requirement for the bolstered security Windows 11 provides (better security was one of the main driving forces behind the underpinnings of the OS for Microsoft).\nIf your PC is eligible for upgrading to Windows 11, at this point, you will likely have been offered that upgrade (probably about 10 times or more). To fire up the Windows 11 upgrade, you simply need to head to Windows Update (type that in the search box on the taskbar) and go from there, following Microsoft\u2019s instructions. (Be sure to back up your files and system first, though \u2013 we\u2019ll return to that at the close of this article).\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether your PC is good for a Windows 11 upgrade, odds are it isn\u2019t if you haven\u2019t been prodded to switch to the newer OS by Microsoft (but you may be able to make your computer eligible yet).\nWhatever the case, you can find out for sure what the score is by using the PC Health Check tool. Head to this Microsoft web page and scroll right to the bottom, then click the link to \u2018Download PC Health Check app.\u2019 Once it\u2019s been grabbed, find the file \u2018WindowsPCHealthCheckSetup\u2019 in your browser\u2019s downloads folder, and double click to run it \u2013 then follow the instructions you\u2019re given. When you click \u2018Finish\u2019 the Health Check app will automatically run, and you can click the \u2018Check Now\u2019 button.\nYou\u2019ll then be told if there are any stumbling blocks preventing your PC from getting Windows 11. If there are, the issues are most likely to be the ones we outlined above.\nIf it\u2019s the case that the Health Check app tells you that your CPU is too old, then you\u2019ll have to upgrade that processor in order to get the new OS. Otherwise, you\u2019re out of luck for running Windows 11 (and further bear in mind that a CPU upgrade may well require your motherboard to be switched out, too, if the processor uses a different socket, which will almost certainly be the case).\nAs for TPM, if the Health Check tells you that TPM 2.0 isn\u2019t detected, it\u2019ll provide a link to help with troubleshooting that. That comprises of a bunch of useful information from Microsoft that will guide you through the process \u2013 see the section on \u2018How to enable TPM.\u2019\nWe recommend you read the whole thing, but the crux is you need to go into your BIOS and find the relevant setting, usually contained in a sub-menu choice called \u2018Advanced\u2019 or \u2018Security\u2019 or \u2018Trusted Computing.\u2019\nThe option to turn on TPM 2.0 functionality is called a variety of names, and this is part of the problem with enabling it \u2013 there\u2019s such a wide range of possibilities that you really need to consult the specific instructions from your motherboard maker. As Microsoft notes, it\u2019s likely named something like one of the following: Security Device, Security Device Support, TPM State, AMD fTPM switch, AMD PSP fTPM, Intel PTT, or Intel Platform Trust Technology.\nSo, you\u2019re most likely looking for something that says \u2018TPM\u2019 or \u2018fTPM\u2019 (firmware TPM) or maybe \u2018PTT\u2019 (Platform Trust Technology) on the Intel side, but it\u2019s well worth double-checking with your motherboard vendor\u2019s documentation or support site. Remember: be careful in the BIOS. There are settings here which can be bad news if you flip the wrong switch, so whatever action you carry out here, make sure it\u2019s right before you go ahead.\nOnce you\u2019ve changed the setting and rebooted, TPM 2.0 should be active, and the PC Health Check app will reflect this \u2013 and you\u2019ll then be offered the upgrade to Windows 11 (again, head to Windows Update to avail yourself of it).\nWe discuss all this in more depth here, if you want further guidance beyond what Microsoft provides, as well as covering the possibility of a BIOS update that may enable TPM functionality without you having to do so manually.\nThose whose motherboard doesn\u2019t support TPM 2.0 will need to upgrade to one of the best new motherboards, leaving them in much the same situation as those with older CPUs (as that\u2019ll doubtless mean upgrading the processor too, due to the board having a different socket, most likely).\nWindows 10 End of Life: pay to stick with the OS\nMaybe you can upgrade your PC to Windows 11, but you don\u2019t want to. That might be because you don\u2019t like the look of the operating system, or indeed the sound of it going by some of the chatter about its problems. (And not everything in Windows 11 land is shiny and wonderful, it has to be said \u2013 there are notable niggles some folks have with the interface for example). Or perhaps legacy software is a thorny issue for you, and that gives pause for thought concerning upgrading.\nEqually, you might not be able to install Windows 11 at all after performing the above checks (and you may not want to go through the hassle of, say, upgrading your PC, switching out the CPU and motherboard, and maybe other components too).\nWhatever the case, you might want to stick with Windows 10 for any number of reasons, but it all comes back to those security updates \u2013 you really shouldn\u2019t stay on the OS without them. But \u2013 hold up a second \u2013 there is actually a possibility that you can keep on motoring with Windows 10 after October 2025, but the catch is it\u2019ll cost you. The other catch is we don\u2019t know how much yet.\nMicrosoft operates a scheme called Extended Security Updates (ESU) and as the name makes clear, this is a way in which you can continue to get security updates past the End of Life deadline. It\u2019s really more for businesses, but with Windows 10, Microsoft will seemingly offer some kind of personal plan for extended updates on a subscription \u2013 we just don\u2019t have the pricing details yet. (Businesses will fork out $61 per device per year, for the first year, to give you some perspective, though the price will be hiked considerably thereafter).\nThe individual offering may be cheaper (we hope), but it\u2019s really only a band-aid, as even extended support won\u2019t go on forever (typically for up to three years). That does give you breathing space, at an increasing cost year after year, but it is at least a way to keep Windows 10 safely.\nWindows 10 End of Life: buy a new PC\nIf you\u2019re staring down the proverbial barrel of an expensive upgrade for your computer to ensure compatibility with Windows 11, then you might decide to cut your losses, and just get a new machine \u2013 which will already have Windows 11 on it.\nWhile buying a new PC might seem drastic \u2013 in terms of cost, and sustainability issues too, and also, let\u2019s be clear, this isn\u2019t a software upgrade, but an entire hardware upgrade, which is really a different kettle of fish \u2013 it still deserves a mention.\nMainly because it could make sense in some scenarios where, as we mentioned above, replacing the CPU may entail a new motherboard, and that\u2019ll require new RAM too, and while you\u2019re at it\u2026 you get the idea. A all-new PC with a fresh warranty and new components all with zero miles on the clock might just seem a better option, or at least a palatable alternative.\nOf course, with an older laptop as opposed to a desktop PC, you\u2019ll very likely not be able to upgrade it in order to get Windows 11, anyway, even if you wanted to. In this case, a new device is a more obvious route \u2013 and one Microsoft wants you to take. Indeed, Microsoft is pushing its new Copilot+ PCs as the laptops to have, with certain AI features tied specifically to these machines (the big Recall functionality for example, an all-encompassing supercharged Windows 11 search).\nTo be fair, that is a benefit of going the new Copilot+ laptop route to get onto Windows 11 \u2013 you will have a device with a powerful NPU to accelerate AI features, and give you access to AI-powered functionality that other users simply won\u2019t get. The same will be true of desktop PCs in the future, when silicon emerges with NPUs that have enough grunt built-in \u2013 certain Windows 11 features are going to be locked to these new machines.\nHowever, if you don\u2019t want or can\u2019t afford a new PC, can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11, and don\u2019t want to pay to keep Windows 10, there\u2019s another choice \u2013 and that\u2019s to switch to an alternative non-Microsoft operating system.\nWindows 10 End of Life: hop on board the Linux express\nThe good thing about Linux is that it\u2019s free, and with this operating system you have a choice of different distros that you could install on your PC to replace Windows 10.\nOf course, the main sticking point with this move is that you\u2019re shifting over to a very different kind of operating system. If you were worried about Windows 11\u2019s changes to the Windows 10 interface, something we touched on before, obviously this kind of cross-platform switch is a whole different ballgame.\nAlthough to be fair to Linux, there\u2019s a wide selection of options, and some of the distros out there are intentionally crafted along similar lines to Windows, which helps when acclimatizing to a whole new way of working on an entirely different platform.\nOkay, so you must bear in mind that there are definite limitations to using Linux in terms of considerations like software compatibility and gaming. That said, matters are improving in many respects for gaming notably, and if you move to Linux, you can be assured that your computing life is going to be relatively straightforward in the future. By which we mean that it\u2019ll remain cost-free, and the major distros are well-supported and regularly updated, and unlikely to see the kind of rug-pulling antics witnessed with the introduction of Windows 11 in terms of hardware requirements.\nFor guidance on choosing the flavor of Linux you might want, be sure to peruse our roundup of the best Linux distros. As recommended, Nitrux is a good place to start for those new to Linux, and Ubuntu is a great pick for beginners and a huge name.\nFor those worried about familiarity, or lack of it when migrating to Linux, we\u2019ve also chewed over the best Linux distros for Windows users that\u2019ll help you feel more at home initially.\nAnd if the reason you\u2019re not upgrading to Windows 11 is because your PC is long in the tooth with old hardware inside, you might want to consider the best lightweight Linux distros which will run nicely on such a computer. As mentioned, there are plenty of options in the land of Linux, which is very much part of the appeal.\nWindows 10 End of Life: back up all your files\nWhichever of the above options you plump for, you need to make sure you back up your PC and its contents before making any major changes. An upgrade to Windows 11 could go wrong, if that\u2019s the path you\u2019re taking. Or if you\u2019re buying an entirely new device, or switching over to a new OS like Linux, then you\u2019ll need to back up your files in order to shift them across.\nIndeed, even if you\u2019re sticking with Windows 10 by paying for support (or just doing without updates \u2013 though we\u2019d strongly recommend against that), you should still have a regular file backup strategy.\nAs for what to do here, you can implement some kind of full backup \u2013 we discuss that in this article, and also check out our roundups of the best free backup software and best cloud backup services. Or you might simply grab one of the best external hard drives out there to copy over your files.\nThe safest approach with backups is to keep multiple copies of your files (or system), meaning at least two as well as the originals \u2013 one local (on an external hard drive for example), and another off-site (like a cloud backup). This way, if a disaster such as a fire strikes your house and takes out not just your computer(s) but your hard drive backup as well, you\u2019ve still got another copy of your data sat in the cloud.\nReally, backups aren\u2019t just for when you\u2019re looking at changing your operating system, they should be a part of your everyday computing life. That said, you should definitely make sure you have freshly backed up everything before switching or upgrading your desktop OS, just in case anything goes wrong.\n- Don\u2019t make these 5 big mistakes when using Windows 11\n- Why Microsoft should give up on Windows 11 and throw everything at Windows 12\n- See how a VPN for Windows can make your computer more secure\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "'It's obvious that users are frustrated': consumer rights group accuses Microsoft of not providing a 'viable solution' for Windows 10 users who can't upgrade to Windows 11\nPIRG believes Microsoft still isn't doing enough to help those stuck on Windows 10\n- Microsoft recently threw a lifeline to consumers, offering alternatives to paying $30 for extended support for Windows 10\n- PIRG thinks this doesn't go far enough in terms of avoiding an impending e-waste calamity\n- The organization suggests Microsoft considers providing longer-term support for Windows 10, or relaxes the spec requirements for Windows 11\nMicrosoft's recent lifeline to help those stuck on Windows 10 \u2013 due to not meeting the stricter hardware requirements for a Windows 11 upgrade \u2013 simply isn't enough, according to a consumer rights group.\nThe Register reports that it has spoken to Lucas Rockett Gutterman, who leads the Designed to Last campaign for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) in the US.\nAs you may be aware, PIRG has a mission to combat obsolescence and e-waste. The organization has previously levelled accusations at Microsoft of its Windows 11 requirements effectively shoving hundreds of millions of otherwise perfectly serviceable PCs into landfill, come the end of Windows 10 in October 2025. (The organization isn't alone in that, either.)\nYou may have seen that last week, Microsoft made a concession on this front. We've long known that one option for consumers will be to pay $30 for an additional year of security updates (something that's never been offered before), but now Microsoft just introduced some other choices too.\nInstead of forking out cash, you can elect to use the Windows Backup app to sync all your settings to the cloud (OneDrive). Alternatively, you can redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.\nHowever, Gutterman remains distinctly unimpressed with the new choices, telling The Register that: \"Microsoft's new options don't go far enough and likely won't make a dent in the up to 400 million Windows 10 PCs that can't upgrade to Windows 11.\"\nGutterman adds that: \"What [Microsoft hasn't] done is commit to automatically providing longer support for Windows 10 or loosening the hardware requirements for Windows 11.\"\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n\"It's obvious that users are frustrated,\" Gutterman concludes. \"They feel yanked around and don't think this [latest] announcement provides a viable solution.\"\nAnalysis: thinking beyond a one-year extension\nTo be fair to Microsoft, I think that giving Windows 10 users a couple of new options to avoid paying $30 to keep security updates going for an extra year (through to October 2026) is actually a very positive move \u2013 especially because simply using the Backup app isn't a particularly hefty imposition.\nI can see where Gutterman is coming from with the points he makes, but the suggestion that Microsoft might consider loosening the system requirements for Windows 11 is, I feel, rather a waste of breath. That isn't going to happen at this point, and I think the software giant has been pretty clear on that.\nFor me, the key point raised is providing Windows 10 support beyond an extra year for consumers, and this is something I've been harping on for some time. While businesses can get a three-year program of extended security updates (if they want that much), so far Microsoft is only offering consumers a single year.\nPerhaps the software giant feels that this is enough, but it really isn't \u2013 not when it comes to keeping all those olds PCs off the scrapheap. Why isn't Microsoft looking at extending support for multiple years for consumers too, from an eco-friendly angle?\nJust a second additional year of support would be some welcome extra breathing room, even if Microsoft charged for it rather than offering any kind of alternative angle like using the Backup app. Of course, a non-paying option would be better. I'd even suggest making Windows 10 ad-supported to keep those security updates coming for two or three years.\nWhat do you mean that's already happened and ads are all over the place? Ahem \u2013 in all seriousness, I think allowing Microsoft to push more ad notifications (in a still limited fashion) within Windows 10 would be a compromise many would take, rather than paying extra to keep their non-Windows 11 compatible PC alive through to 2027 or 2028. At least suffering the adverts would have a plus side to it in this scenario, and if you can't stand the idea of yet more ads, you can stump up the $30.\nWhatever the case, I fully agree with PIRG that a one-year extension for consumers isn't good enough in terms of Microsoft's responsibilities towards preventing excessive e-waste \u2013 and hopefully the company will see the sense in further extended updates for consumers, too, not just businesses.\nYou might also like...\n- No, Windows 11 PCs aren't 'up to 2.3x faster' than Windows 10 devices, as Microsoft suggests \u2013 here's why that's an outlandish claim\n- Windows 11's hidden PC migration feature proves Microsoft isn't messing around when it comes to killing off Windows 10\n- Can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11?

  "argos_summary": "Lawrence Klein, a California resident, has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft over the impending end of support for Windows 10, set for October 2025. He argues that the company is violating consumer laws by discontinuing support too soon, given that millions of devices do not meet the hardware requirements for Windows 11, potentially leading to significant e-waste. Klein seeks to compel Microsoft to continue providing support for Windows 10 until its user base drops below a reasonable threshold, highlighting concerns about forced upgrades and the environmental impact of discarded devices.",
