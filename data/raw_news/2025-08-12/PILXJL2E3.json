  "title": "The Kayak of Rideshare: Obi\u2019s New CEO Bets on Pricing Transparency",
  "description": "Obi\u2019s new CEO aims to bring rideshare pricing transparency to a $480B market, positioning the \u201cKayak of rideshare\u201d for the future of autonomous vehicles.",
  "content": "The rideshare boom reshaped urban transportation, bringing millions of riders and drivers into a new kind of mobility network. Today, the U.S. market is dominated by a handful of players\u2014Uber and Lyft in particular\u2014while autonomous vehicle (AV) operators begin to carve out early footholds. Fares have climbed, competition has thinned, and new entrants often struggle to survive.\n\nIn this environment, Obi, a global rideshare aggregator often called \u201cthe Kayak of rideshare,\u201d is betting that rideshare transparency can shift the balance\u2014giving riders more choice, enabling providers to reach new customers, and preparing the market for the complexity that comes when AVs scale.\n\nThe latest shake-up came on August 11, when Revel, an electric rideshare operator, announced it would exit New York City, the country\u2019s largest and most expensive ride-hail market, to focus on EV charging. For Obi, it was both a market signal and an opportunity.\n\nWhen the company added Revel\u2019s pricing to its app, 10 percent of all Obi rides in NYC shifted to the electric upstart\u2014a clear indication that when riders can see all their options in one place, behavior changes. As Revel departs, Obi is doubling down on its mission to make that kind of transparency available everywhere.\n\nOn the same day Revel exited New York\u2019s ride-hail market, Obi appointed Ashwini Anburajan as CEO. Since joining as Chief Revenue Officer in 2023, Anburajan has driven global expansion, revenue growth, and headline-making data products, including an AV-pricing analysis that revealed Waymo charges $3.50 per km versus Uber\u2019s $2.90 and Lyft\u2019s $2.60\u2014yet still draws riders willing to pay the premium.\n\nHer r\u00e9sum\u00e9 blends worlds rarely seen together in mobility leadership\u2014crypto fund co-founder, startup operator, venture investor and NBC political reporter. That combination of storytelling, deal-making, and data strategy now fuels Obi\u2019s push to open a market where opacity has long been standard. She steps in as AV adoption accelerates, pricing transparency gains attention, and both riders and providers look for more sustainable economics.\n\nFounder Payam Safa, who built Obi into a platform with over 1 million users in 175 countries, moves into the roles of chairman and president.\n\nRideshare is projected to grow from roughly $190 billion in 2024 to $480 billion by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights. But in the U.S., the industry reality is consolidation. Uber and Lyft control the vast majority of rides and often move in parallel on pricing and policy, while augmenting their rideshare businesses with subscriptions (Uber One, Lyft Pink) and delivery services (Uber Eats, Lyft Delivery).\n\nBillions in venture capital once poured into the rideshare industry to break up entrenched taxi monopolies, but in the U.S., the market ultimately consolidated around two dominant players. AV entrants like Waymo and Tesla remain niche players in limited geographies, more a signal of the future than a competitive force today.\n\nWhy NYC\u2019s Rideshare Prices Could Shape the Future of Mobility\n\nNew York City isn\u2019t just the country\u2019s largest rideshare market\u2014it\u2019s also one of the most expensive in the world. According to Obi\u2019s Global Rideshare Report, $10 gets you just 1.8 km (1.1 mi) in NYC, compared to 2.3 km in London or Paris, and 27 km in New Delhi. Base fares average $24.19 before tips and fees, pushing many trips past $30.\n\nPublic-data laws make NYC one of the few cities where fare data is transparent in real time, allowing researchers and regulators to see the patterns: riders paying more, drivers earning less. Half the drivers surveyed in Obi\u2019s 2024 report said rides have become too expensive for passengers\u2014a statistic that underscores why rideshare pricing transparency is gaining urgency.\n\nIn recent years, the rideshare industry has seen advocacy around driver pay, benefits, and safety\u2014highlighted by The New York Times reporting on passenger assault claims\u2014but little focus on rideshare pricing transparency for riders. Obi is positioning that as the next frontier.\n\nIn markets where fares are opaque and fluctuating, riders are often unaware of how much more they could be paying compared to other providers for the same trip. Cities like Denver have added driver take-rate disclosures to show more transparency to customers, but it\u2019s unclear if this has influenced how riders choose rides or leave tips.\n\nThe launch of new apps promising no surge pricing underscores growing interest in models that build trust through transparent, predictable pricing. In addition to Waymo, Tesla and other AV offerings, r is offering drivers a subscription-based model and consumers lower prices. New entrant launches in NYC this month, promising no surge pricing. in Atlanta pairs female passengers with female riders. in Miami targets luxury consumers. None have captured a significant market share.\n\nObi\u2019s mission is to bring rideshare pricing transparency to every market, allowing riders to compare real-time fares across providers, just like Kayak did for flights.\n\nAV adoption is still in its early stages, with Waymo, Tesla and others operating in limited geographies. But as they expand, so will the complexity of comparing rides\u2014not just by price, but by mode, fleet type, and service level. Obi\u2019s aggregation model is built for that future, allowing riders to weigh autonomous vehicle premiums against human-driven rides in real time.\n\nIts AV pricing analysis\u2014showing riders will pay more for perceived safety and novelty\u2014highlights why Waymo pricing intelligence could become even more valuable as autonomous fleets scale.\n\nObi\u2019s data isn\u2019t just powering its app\u2014it\u2019s informing major reporting and policy discussions:\n\u2022 used Obi data to investigate surge pricing caused by driver lockouts and the resulting loss of income and impact on drivers\u2019 mental health.\n\u2022 analyzed Obi\u2019s AV pricing data, finding that Waymo pricing charges $3.50/km versus Uber\u2019s $2.90 and Lyft\u2019s $2.60 for similar trips\u2014yet riders still pay the premium for perceived safety and novelty.\n\u2022 reported on a Columbia University study that analyzed Obi's ride-hail data to investigate Uber's upfront pricing model and its potential for price discrimination.\n\nEven in the face of resistance, including instances where riders received messages warning that linking their account to a third-party app could risk deactivation, Obi has continued to grow, underscoring consumer demand for rideshare transparency.\n\nHow Obi Survived Where Other Rideshare Aggregators Failed\n\nRideshare aggregators have a grim track record. Migo raised $11 million before disappearing. Bliq raised $20 million in total, only to lay off staff and flounder earlier this year. Obi has raised just $5 million but outlasted them by focusing on product quality, user trust, and monetizing its data.\n\nWhile many rideshare companies refuse to pay affiliate commissions, Obi has built a parallel revenue stream via a data business selling anonymized, aggregated insights. That business model gives Obi independence from any one platform\u2019s goodwill, a critical advantage in a market where partnerships can be fleeting.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Obi\u2014and the Future of Rideshare Transparency\n\nAs rideshare prices climb and AV adoption accelerates, Obi is positioning rideshare pricing transparency as both a consumer right and a competitive necessity.\n\n\u201cThe most valuable thing you can own in this industry,\u201d Anburajan says, \u201cis the trust of the consumer.\u201d\n\nIf that trust shifts toward platforms that empower riders with real-time, side-by-side choice, the next wave of mobility disruption might not come from a new fleet on the street\u2014but from who controls the data in your pocket with rideshare pricing transparency.",

      "text": "Following Uber\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report, press headlines trumpeted Uber\u2019s admirable 72% annual revenue growth rate and improved profitability. But CEO Dara Khosrowshahi failed to mention that Uber\u2019s prodigious growth was mostly driven by an obscure accounting change, or reveal that Uber has been raising US ridehail prices four times faster than the rate of inflation while squeezing driver pay in its quest for profitability.\nUber was founded on the promise of making transportation \u201cas reliable as running water, everywhere, for everyone.\u201d But what we have gotten instead is increasingly a luxury service that has disappointed investors, built on a marketplace where passengers and drivers don\u2019t know what price or pay to expect from trip to trip, and where merchants face stiff fees, the loss of customer relationships, and frequently spotty service for delivered goods. How did this happen?\nUber has been a poster child of US zero interest rate policies (ZIRP) over the past decade, stimulating unprecedented levels of private and public capital investment in companies pursuing global domination \u2014 profits be damned. Between its venture capital funding rounds and IPO, Uber raised $32 billion before and during CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s reign, fueling the dubious distinction of raising and losing more money than any startup in history.\nUntil this year, the company was making a perfectly logical choice to deploy its bountiful capital to push for growth over profits, mirroring investor priorities in the cheap money era. In fact, Dara (as he is often, familiarly called) lost more money during his first four years as CEO than founder/CEO Travis Kalanick did during the company\u2019s first six years.\nBut times (and interest rates) have changed, prompting Dara to now espouse the new math he described on a recent podcast:\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n\"It's about math and math always wins. And the math for a company getting to cash flow breakeven is you have to grow your revenues faster than you're growing expenses.\"\nFor Uber, having already shed a number of ancillary money-losing businesses, this translates into raising prices and squeezing driver pay \u2014 by far the two biggest drivers of the company\u2019s financial performance. So let's dig into some key facts and figures to see how Uber's new math has been working, using third-party data to peer into the company\u2019s US ridehail operations \u2014 the company\u2019s biggest business unit.\nUber began raising US ridehail prices at a double-digit percentage clip in 2018 as the company prepared for its 2019 IPO, and has continued hiking prices ever since. According to data provided to the author by Second Measure, Uber\u2019s average US ridehail fare per trip jumped by 30% from the beginning of 2018 to Q3 2019, and then, according to data from YipitData, by another 41% between Q3 2019 and Q3 2022 \u2013 for a total of 83% over the entire 45-month period. This is equivalent to an annual price increase of 17.5% per year, considerably exceeding the CPI gain of 4.5% per year over the same period.\nWhile Uber\u2019s price escalation succeeded in boosting its mobility revenue \u2013 ridesharing demand is inelastic, at least at historical price levels \u2014 it also depressed consumer demand growth. According to tracking data from YipitData, Uber\u2019s number of US ridehail trips in Q3 2022 decreased 29% from pre-pandemic Q3 2019 levels, offset by the price hike of 41% over the same period. In essence, Uber has traded off decreased ridehail demand (as measured by number of trips) in exchange for increased revenue and profitability.\nI\u2019ve had to rely on estimates from independent sources for this analysis, because Uber has never disclosed data on its consumer prices, driver pay or trip demand trends for its US (or any other country\u2019s) ridehail operations. More on this point later.\nZooming out now to examine Uber\u2019s global financial results, on his Q3 2022 earnings call, Dara crowed that \u201cUber\u2019s core business is stronger than ever,\u201d exemplified by the company\u2019s 72% Y-O-Y revenue growth rate. The business press widely highlighted this impressive figure in their headlines and story ledes.\nBut Uber\u2019s reported revenue growth rate was significantly inflated by a material change in its Mobility and Delivery revenue accounting, as well as by an acquisition in its Freight division, both of which were conveniently buried in an earnings report footnote but overlooked in Dara\u2019s commentary and widespread press coverage. After properly adjusting for these anomalies, Uber\u2019s actual Q3 2022 Y-O-Y core business (Mobility and Delivery) growth was only 26.5%, and much of that was driven by take rate increases \u2013 the spread between prices and driver pay \u2014 not underlying growth in consumer demand or productivity improvements.\nThese deep-in-the-weeds adjustments may seem like TMI, but they are important, because going forward, Uber will not be able to achieve anything near their impressive, but misleading Q3 2022 reported growth rates, for three reasons.\n- Most of Uber\u2019s reported revenue growth was driven by one-off events, not sustainable improvements in business operations. Obscured accounting changes will eventually \u2013 actually, quickly \u2013 be recognized by savvy investors. For example, while Uber enjoyed a 12% pop in its stock price the day of its rosy Q3 pre-market earnings release, its stock slid 17% over the ensuing two months\n- Uber\u2019s future revenue growth rates will be pegged to recovering post-pandemic demand, not the deeply depressed pandemic levels that have boosted recent Y-O-Y revenue gains. For example, adjusted for accounting changes, Uber\u2019s Q3 2022 YTD Mobility and Delivery global revenues have only grown 17.5% and 6.5% respectively, compared to the 47.7% and 26.9% respective figures for Q1-Q3 2022 on a Y-O-Y basis.\n- There are limits to Uber's ability to continue to achieve revenue growth by raising prices, particularly entering a period of macroeconomic uncertainty. For historical context, Uber\u2019s US mobility trips and bookings growth declined markedly in 2018-2019, when Uber first began aggressively raising ridehail prices.\nAfter adjusting for accounting changes, Uber\u2019s core business (Mobility + Delivery ) growth rates YTD 2022 vs. 2021 were:\n- Bookings: 24.7%\n- Revenue: 37.7%\nThere are only three ways that Uber can enjoy significantly higher revenue growth than bookings growth in their core business:\n- Improve productivity (for example batched delivery orders or pooled ridehail operations), so that Uber (and perhaps drivers) can enjoy more revenue per trip\n- Generate additional sources of revenue from activities outside core platform bookings \u2013 e.g. advertising on Uber\u2019s platform\n- Increase take rates by charging passengers higher fares that are disproportionately retained by Uber and/or by lowering driver/courier compensation per trip\nFor starters, let me state a frustrating caveat. Uber has never disclosed sufficient data to allow a fully substantiated assessment of its operational and financial performance. So what follows is my best-efforts hypotheses.\n1. Improved productivity\nOver the years, Dara has repeatedly made vague references to \u201cimproved operational efficiencies\u201d and \u201calgorithmic improvements\u201d without clarifying what actual levers have enabled improved performance. I suspect that Uber\u2019s actual productivity improvements have been minimal. In ridehailing, the most obvious productivity enhancer is pooled ridesharing. With its dominant market share, Uber is in an advantaged position to be a leading pooled ride market-maker. But in fact, Uber has never been able to build a pooled service that widely appeals to riders or drivers. So while Uber doesn\u2019t break out its demand numbers, there is no reason to believe that pooled rides have been a major driver of higher revenue and take rates for Uber.\nOn the delivery side, the most obvious productivity enhancer is batched orders. But this tactic adds logistical complexity and degrades food quality and customer satisfaction. Therefore, I\u2019m skeptical that order batching has materially improved Uber Eats\u2019 economics of late. Uber can certainly dispute this hypothesis by sharing trend data on its gross merchandise value (GMV) per trip or its orders per driver per hour. I\u2019d welcome being proven incorrect on my assumption.\nAnother potential revenue enhancer is increasing ridehail use and/or delivery GMV and order frequency for customers enrolled in the Uber One loyalty program. But the impact of this program on Uber\u2019s economics is unclear. Uber trails DoorDash in its loyalty program penetration, and neither company has disclosed the extent to which their loyalty programs generate net revenue and profit improvements after accounting for discounted fares and delivery fees.\n2. Additional revenue drivers\nAdvertising is a potential game changer. For example, some reports suggest that Amazon\u2019s global ecommerce business would be unprofitable were it not for the substantial additional revenue earned from merchant advertising (currently generating $40 billion revenue per year!) . Uber has already been accepting ads on its Eats platform for a couple of years, and has recently added ad banners to its ridehail app. But these ad programs have yet to achieve the scale to account for the recent sizable difference between Uber\u2019s revenue and bookings growth rates. Perhaps ads will become a significant revenue generator down the road, but not yet.\n3. Raise ridehail passenger fares and delivery fees and/or squeeze driver pay\nThese are the actions that undoubtedly are driving Uber\u2019s recent financial performance improvements and the clearest manifestations of Dara\u2019s \u201cnew math\u201d to grow revenues (passenger fares) faster than expenses (driver pay). The sketchy data Uber does disclose confirms that the company has been increasing its take rates over the past few years. As already noted, passenger fares have been trending significantly higher for the past five years. While driver comp data is harder to come by, Uber\u2019s recent shift to \u201cupfront prices\u201d has effectively decoupled consumer prices and driver pay from actual travel time and distance, giving the company cover to increase the spread between consumer prices and driver pay.\nAnd in this regard, Uber enjoys a massive competitive advantage: more data on consumer and driver behavior on a global scale than any other mobility or delivery provider. Armed with such market insight, Uber is in an ideal position to practice what economists call first-order price discrimination \u2014 that is, charging each customer prices based on their known willingness to pay and setting each driver\u2019s pay based on their known willingness to serve. The resulting upside potential of such price discrimination is enormous, and the opportunity (massive data + AI algorithms + upfront pricing policies) and need (growing investor pressure for near-term profitability) to exploit it is urgent.\nUber has historically denied (without evidence, of course) that they in any way set prices or pay based on individual passenger or driver characteristics. However, their recent tactics de facto promote a race-to-the-bottom in driver pay by operating a bidding process on their driving app where competing drivers have literally seconds to accept low pay offers (usually after Uber\u2019s initial low pay offer to a specific driver was rejected). Anecdotal evidence also suggests that Uber may be using similar tactics to set and revise passenger fares, lowering them only if a passenger rejects its initial higher price offer.\nTo be clear, there is nothing illegal about discriminatory pricing, as long as it\u2019s not based on customer gender, race or ethnicity. And it\u2019s perfectly understandable that Uber would consider such tactics, given the enormous pressure Dara is under to finally reach its Sisyphean quest for profitability. After all, despite potential reputational risks, it\u2019s hard to ignore what may be Uber\u2019s best profit driver and possibly only true source of competitive advantage. And it\u2019s also understandable why Uber would be reluctant to talk about what would likely be viewed as deeply unpopular pricing and pay tactics.\nNonetheless, the current state of play raises some troubling questions. Travis Kalanick launched Uber over a decade ago with the promise that Uber would make \u201ctransportation as reliable as running water, everywhere, for everyone.\" His successor, Dara Khosrowshahi modified the company\u2019s mission to become \u201cthe operating system for your everyday life,\u201d and \u201ca technology company that connects the physical and digital worlds to help make movement happen at the tap of a button.\u201d\nBut what we have gotten instead is increasingly a luxury service that has disappointed investors, built on a marketplace where passengers and drivers don\u2019t know what price or pay to expect from trip to trip, and where merchants face stiff fees, the loss of customer relationships, and frequently spotty service for delivered goods (Uber Eats\u2019 NPS consumer satisfaction score is 11 out of 100). And recently, riders and drivers appear to have been increasingly drawn into an algorithmic pricing game where Uber stacks the cards in the house\u2019s favor.\nThese dynamics are carefully hidden behind Uber\u2019s veil of secrecy about its actual operational and financial performance. Given its carefully curated and limited disclosures, investors, business analysts and the press know shockingly little about even the most basic measures of Uber\u2019s performance, including:\n- How many US ridehail trips did Uber provide this quarter?\n- What was the average price and driver pay per trip?\n- What is the distribution of ridehail take rates?\n- What is the average and distribution of actual passenger wait times\n- ... and similar questions for Uber\u2019s delivery operations\nUber isn\u2019t the only company that has been extremely stingy in reporting meaningful operational data. But its secretive nature is particularly distressing for two reasons:\n- Uber serves a pivotal role in providing mobility for tens of millions of consumers. Other entities in a similar role \u2013 public transportation systems and airlines for example \u2013 routinely report detailed data on their fare levels, employee pay, on-time performance and other metrics of operating performance that are in the public interest to know.\n- Dara regularly punctuates his preternatural optimism \u2014 damn, he\u2019s good at happy talk! \u2014 with undefined or unsupported business factoids in interviews and analyst briefings. For example, our \u201cdrivers are now earning $39 per hour!\u201d or \u201cpassenger demand is back!.\u201d And yet, whenever analysts attempt to cite independent data suggesting less robust performance (e.g. YipitData, Gridwise), the company\u2019s predictable response is \u201ctheir analysis was based on incomplete and inaccurate data.\u201d\nShortly after taking the helm of Uber in 2017 to repair the company\u2019s tarnished reputation, Dara introduced a new set of cultural values, headlined by a commitment to \u201cDo the right thing. Period.\u201d Nonetheless, under Dara\u2019s leadership, Uber\u2019s lack of transparency remains stubbornly intact. If Uber is to be given credit for fulfilling their grand promise of becoming the transformative future of urban mobility, investors, consumers, and drivers deserve to know a lot more about the real costs of being taken for a ride."

YUR Drivers Network\u2014a homegrown ride-sharing company promising no surge pricing, better driver pay and cutting-edge safety features\u2014will officially launch in four NYC boroughs on July 1. (Staten Island, your ride\u2019s coming soon.)\nFounded by longtime entrepreneur and New York native Louis Paulucci, YUR is aiming to flip the script on traditional rideshare platforms. After logging more than 1,700 trips behind the wheel and talking directly with passengers and drivers, Paulucci says the message was loud and clear: Everyone feels exploited. \u201cDrivers are running on fumes, feeling exploited, while passengers are frustrated by surge pricing and a lack of transparency,\u201d he says. \u201cIt became clear: The rideshare industry needs a fundamental shift towards fairness for everyone involved.\u201d\nEnter YUR. The app will debut with approximately 250 drivers, all of whom are licensed by the Taxi and Limousine Commission and operate TLC-approved vehicles. What sets it apart? For starters, no surge pricing\u2014ever. Whether it\u2019s a rainstorm or rush hour, fares stay flat. YUR also pays its drivers up to 71-percent of each fare, what it claims is the highest cut in the business, with an extra 5-percent commission for anyone who refers a passenger or driver.\nSafety is another cornerstone. Each driver must verify their identity through a patented in-app biometric scan before picking up a fare. Riders get a real-time \u201call clear\u201d notification confirming the driver\u2019s ID. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a digital doorman,\u201d says Paulucci. \u201cYou step into your ride with the confidence of knowing exactly who\u2019s behind the wheel.\u201d\nBut perhaps the most eyebrow-raising feature is YUR\u2019s built-in revenue-sharing model. Anyone who refers a friend to the platform, whether as a driver or passenger, gets 5-percent of that person\u2019s future rides deposited into their app wallet. That cash can be used toward rides or withdrawn. According to Paulucci, it\u2019s \u201ca cash register constantly ringing for you.\u201d\nYUR\u2019s pricing model, community-driven feedback platform and launch-day promo (10-percent off your first ride) are all part of a bigger plan to create a more transparent and equitable ride-share ecosystem.\nIt\u2019s an ambitious pitch in a city that doesn\u2019t exactly love change, but with enough buzz and a few seamless rides, YUR might just steer New Yorkers in a new direction."

      "text": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are no longer a distant prospect. In cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin, robotaxis are already operating on public streets, offering a glimpse of a future that is arriving faster than many expected. Companies like Waymo are expanding their fleets, while Uber and others are investing heavily in automation, accelerating the race to transform urban mobility. This weekend, Tesla also launched its first autonomous service in Austin, signaling growing competition in the sector. For cities, the moment is both a challenge and an opportunity: how to prepare for the AV future in a way that maximizes benefits while minimizing unintended consequences.\nThe Promise of Autonomous Vehicles\nIf deployed thoughtfully, AVs hold the potential to make transportation safer, more efficient, and more sustainable. Human error is responsible for over 90% of traffic fatalities\u2014AVs could dramatically reduce collisions and save lives. By enabling more precise traffic flow and reducing the need for parking, AVs could help cities reclaim space for housing, green infrastructure, or active transportation.\nAutonomous technology also opens new possibilities for improving access. AVs can expand mobility options for people who cannot drive\u2014such as the elderly or people with disabilities\u2014and serve as flexible first/last-mile connectors in transit deserts. When combined with electrification and pooling, AVs could reduce emissions and support cities\u2019 climate goals.\nThe Risks of a Hands-Off Approach\nYet, the risks are real. A report from the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) warns that, left unchecked, AVs could increase vehicle miles traveled (VMT), further congest streets, and undermine public transit. The National League of Cities has also raised concerns about private AVs outpacing the regulatory ability of cities to manage them effectively. Without guardrails, the AV future could replicate\u2014and even worsen\u2014today\u2019s challenges.\nA Rapidly Shifting Market\nIn San Francisco, Waymo has emerged as the dominant player in the AV space. Their services are estimated to account for more than 27% of ridehailing trips in the city \u2014 more than Lyft, and rapidly eating into Uber\u2019s market share. The company has surpassed 10 million paid rides and delivers approximately 250,000 driverless trips weekly across its service areas, including recent expansions into Los Angeles, Austin, and parts of Silicon Valley.\nMeanwhile, other major players are preparing to enter the autonomous ride-hailing market. Tesla, for instance, is planning the broader launch of its \u201cCyberCab\u201d robotaxi service, with early testing and limited rollout beginning this year. The arrival of new entrants will likely accelerate competition and intensify pressure on cities to modernize their regulatory frameworks.\nThis rapid scaling of AV deployments signals the urgent need for cities to prepare. Parking authorities, in particular, will need to reexamine their policies as curb usage fundamentally shifts from long-term parking to dynamic pick-up and drop-off zones. Traditional metered parking models may no longer apply in a world where vehicles don't park but circulate. Cities must proactively redesign curb management strategies to accommodate these changes while ensuring equitable access and efficient traffic flow.\nPolicy Levers Cities Can Use\nDespite the pace of innovation, cities are not powerless. While the AV hardware and software are driven by private investment, the rules of the road are local. Cities can and must use their authority over streets, curbs, and zoning to shape AV deployment in the public interest.\nKey strategies include:\n- Curb Management: AVs will increase demand for curb space as they pick up and drop off passengers. Smart curb policies\u2014like prioritizing high-occupancy and zero-emission vehicles\u2014can prevent gridlock and improve safety.\n- Data Sharing Requirements: Cities need data from AV operators to evaluate performance, ensure accountability, and update policies. Standardized, anonymized data-sharing frameworks such as the Mobility Data Specification (MDS) are essential.\n- Incentives for Electrification and Pooling: Cities should align AV permits and pricing structures with their sustainability goals, rewarding fleets that are both electric and shared.\n- Integration with Transit: AVs should serve as a complement to, not a replacement for, public transportation. Cities can incentivize service models that improve access to transit, particularly in underserved neighborhoods.\n- Parking Policy Reform: With fewer drivers needing to park, cities can rethink their parking infrastructure, repurposing on-street and garage space for housing, commercial use, or green space.\nLearning from Early Deployment Cities\nSan Francisco\u2019s experience with AVs has been both promising and contentious. While some residents have raised concerns about safety and disruptions, others have embraced the convenience and innovation. Importantly, the city\u2019s experience underscores the need for clear oversight, transparent communication, and ongoing public engagement.\nOther cities\u2014including Pittsburgh, Boston, and Los Angeles\u2014are taking proactive steps to prepare. They are forming AV task forces, developing deployment principles, and engaging community members. These early adopters are creating roadmaps that others can follow, with a focus on equity, sustainability, and accountability.\nPreparing for What\u2019s Next\nThe AV race is well underway, and cities that delay action risk being caught flat-footed. By contrast, cities that lead with purpose can shape how AVs contribute to their broader transportation, climate, and equity goals.\nTo prepare, cities should:\n- Create clear AV policy frameworks grounded in public values\n- Invest in digital and physical infrastructure to manage AV operations\n- Build staff capacity and expertise to evaluate AV data and performance\n- Coordinate across jurisdictions to align standards and reduce regulatory fragmentation\n- Leverage data-sharing agreements\u2014through incentives or mandates\u2014to gain visibility into AV operations and ensure outcomes align with public goals\nAutonomous vehicles offer a rare chance to reimagine mobility from the ground up. They can help cities reduce traffic deaths, lower emissions, and improve access\u2014if the right policies are in place.\nInnovation alone won\u2019t guarantee progress. But with leadership, planning, and a clear vision, AVs can help cities build a safer, greener, and more inclusive transportation future."
