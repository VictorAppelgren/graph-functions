  "content": "Aug 8 (Reuters) - Eddie Jen, a drag queen from San Francisco, wants to show that \"America still fights for kindness\", while Abby Govindan, a U.S. stand-up comic of Indian heritage, aims to convince audiences Texas is not what they think.\n\nThe performers are among those who make the number of U.S. acts at this year's Edinburgh Fringe the highest in at least a decade.\n\nThe Edinburgh International Festival, held every August, was established in the aftermath of World War Two with the goal of using culture to heal divisions.\n\nIt immediately spawned an unofficial Fringe that became bigger than the original festival, attracting thousands of more maverick performers in venues across the city.\n\nThis year's Fringe includes productions from Armenia to Zimbabwe, organisers say.\n\nThe percentage of U.S. acts is 12.1%, compared with 11.1% last year and 6.1% in 2014. No earlier data is available.\n\nBritish acts have decreased to 69.8% of the total, from 71.2% in 2024, and 81.5% in 2014. Performers have said high costs, especially for accommodation, are a deterrent.\n\nFor U.S. artists, that can matter less. Their numbers had already risen as producers chose Edinburgh to test the appeal of musicals as a cheaper alternative to Broadway .\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump , who changed laws on diversity after he returned to office in January, making many artists anxious about freedom of expression, is a factor.\n\nGovindan said she would have brought her show \"How to Embarrass Your Immigrant Parents\" to Edinburgh \"regardless of politics\".\n\nHer aims include doing justice to Texas, which she says is \"commonly misrepresented as white and racist\". \"Houston, my hometown, is the most diverse city in the country,\" she said.\n\nJen is also keen to get beyond stereotypes with \"Seeking a Pen Pal for the End of the World\" that tells the story of an immigrant drag queen exchanging letters with his high school English teacher - a retired, white, Republican woman from Bountiful, Utah.\n\n\"When Trump was re-elected in November, I wanted to let the world know that America still fights for kindness,\" Jen said.\n\nThe number of Canadian acts at the Fringe has hovered around 1% for the last decade.\n\nConnor Malbeuf, who has lived in the United States for eight years, says the Fringe is \"a safe space\" for his show \"Sorry: A Canadian's Apology for America\".\n\n\"There\u2019s no better neutral ground to comment on the absurdity, political landscape, and poke the bear without the bear threatening the possibility of deportation,\" he said.\n\nFor Govindan, whose comedy is established in the United States, Edinburgh amounts to healthy risk-taking.\n\n\"Being here is really pushing me out of my comfort zone in a way that is undoubtedly going to make me a better performer and comedian,\" she said.",

      "text": "The Trust Principles\nThomson Reuters is dedicated to upholding the Trust Principles and to preserving its independence, integrity, and freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of information and news.\nTrust Principles \u2013 the history\nThe Trust Principles were created in 1941, in the midst of World War II, in agreement with The Newspaper Proprietors Association Limited and The Press Association Limited (being the Reuters shareholders at that time). The Trust Principles imposed obligations on Reuters and its employees to act at all times with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias.\nReuters Directors and shareholders were determined to protect and preserve the Trust Principles when Reuters became a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. A unique structure was put in place to achieve this. A new company was formed and given the name 'Reuters Founders Share Company Limited', its purpose being to hold a 'Founders Share' in Reuters.\nThe legal structure has evolved over time and the Founders Share and other contractual arrangements now confer a number of special rights upon the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company. For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations. The charter documents of Thomson Reuters Corporation include provisions to safeguard the Trust Principles as they apply to the Thomson Reuters business and require Thomson Reuters Directors, in the performance of their duties, to have due regard to the Trust Principles, by the proper exercise of their powers and in accordance with their other duties as Directors.\nThe Trust Principles are:\n- That Reuters shall at no time pass into the hands of any one interest, group, or faction;\n- That the integrity, independence, and freedom from bias of Thomson Reuters shall at all times be fully preserved;\n- That Reuters shall supply unbiased and reliable news services to newspapers, news agencies, broadcasters, and other media subscribers and to businesses, governments, institutions, individuals, and others with whom Reuters has or may have contracts;\n- That Thomson Reuters shall pay due regard to the many interests which it serves in addition to those of the media; and\n- That no effort shall be spared to expand, develop, and adapt the news and other services and products of Thomson Reuters so as to maintain its leading position in the international news and information business\nThomson Reuters Founders Share Company was established in 1984 when Reuters became a public company. The directors of Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company (known as \u2018Trustees\u2019) have a duty to ensure, to the extent possible, that the Trust Principles are complied with.\nThe Trustees are experienced and eminent people from diverse arenas in politics, diplomacy, media, public service and business. The Trustees are selected by a nomination committee and proposed to the board of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company for appointment. The nomination committee assists in scrutinizing candidates\u2019 suitability and its members include two persons appointed by the chairman after consultation with the European Court of Human Rights and representatives of certain press associations. The Thomson Reuters Corporation board has two representatives on the nomination committee. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company Board are members of the nomination committee, and the Chairman appoints three other directors of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company as members of the nomination committee. The Chairman of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company acts as chairman of the nomination committee.\nThe number of Trustees has to be at least 14 and not more than 18. Trustees have a minimum of two meetings per year, and receive reports on our activities in the different fields in which we operate (including Reuters news). The Trustees meet with both the Thomson Reuters Board and representatives of senior management. Through Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company's Chairman, regular contact is maintained with our company. The relationship is one of trust and confidence.\nIndependence of Thomson Reuters\nCustomers across the world depend on us to provide them with reliable and objective news and information.\nThis means that we have a special need to safeguard our independence and integrity and avoid any bias which may stem from control by specific individuals or interests.\nThe Thomson Reuters Trust Principles were adopted in 1941 and include the preservation of integrity, reliability of news, development of the news business, and related principles.\nToday, the Trust Principles are fundamental to our entire business.\nMore information\nContact us\nBrian Moss\nFor inquiries pertaining to Reuters reporting standards and the Trust Principles please email: brian.moss@thomsonreuters.com."
