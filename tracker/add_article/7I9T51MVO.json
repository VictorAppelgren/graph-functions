      "summary": "A 46‑year‑old hiker, Ryan Wardwell, was rescued by helicopter after spending two days trapped behind the Seven Teacups waterfalls in Sequoia National Forest. He had fallen off his rappel lines and become stuck in a dark cave beneath the waterfall, where he could not escape or dry out. Rescue teams located him with a drone, lowered a helicopter crew member into the cave, and hoisted both men to safety, treating Wardwell for minor injuries and dehydration. The incident highlights the dangers of white‑water canyoneering and urges hikers to assess their experience and equipment before venturing into such environments.",
