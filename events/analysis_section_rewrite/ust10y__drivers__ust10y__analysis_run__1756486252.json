      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist**  \n1. **Causal chain**: Explicitly link the 3.3 % Q2 GDP revision (VDO8D9T7M) → higher corporate earnings expectations → higher equity valuations → S&P 500 range 4,200–4,300 (VDO8D9T7M).  \n2. **Yield context**: Add a sentence that the 10‑year Treasury yield is near its current level, supporting risk‑seeking sentiment (VDO8D9T7M), and map this to the canonical handle ust10y.  \n3. **Corporate lift**: Cite EPAM upside (H86O3XRUJ) and CrowdStrike Q3 earnings (+5 bp to NDX) (KNWKYIQ1W) with explicit magnitude (0.1–0.2 % for SPX, 5 bp for NDX).  \n4. **Catalyst window**: List the three key dates—tariff announcement 13 Aug 2025, Fed meeting 16–17 Sep 2025, CrowdStrike Q3 earnings release—each with a brief causal note and a citation.  \n5. **Fragility**: Keep only supported fragilities: Fed tightening (VDO8D9T7M), tariff delay (source implied by the 13 Aug date), and a potential earnings miss (remove the un‑cited “high‑beta tech firm” line).  \n6. **Mapping**: Ensure every claim references a canonical handle (spx, ust10y, fed_policy) and has an inline citation.  \n7. **Length & focus**: Trim any generic “small, but measurable” phrasing; keep the paragraph to one concise watch‑list block that ends with a confidence rating (“moderate”) and the 60‑day horizon.  \n8. **Remove drift**: Delete the sentence about “a corporate earnings miss—particularly from a high‑beta tech firm—could erode the modest upside” because it lacks a source.  \n\nApply these edits to tighten the reasoning, satisfy the citation and mapping requirements, and deliver a clear, actionable 60‑day view for the S&P 500.",
