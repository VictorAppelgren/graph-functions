      "summary": "Oklo, a nuclear microreactor developer, has seen its shares soar amid AI hype, drawing comparisons to Nvidia, yet the company remains speculative with no operational reactors or revenue and faces high capital costs and regulatory hurdles. Its growth narrative is buoyed by high-profile partnerships, including the Department of Energy and the U.S. military, and the influence of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, but investors should note that the stock’s valuation is largely driven by hype rather than fundamentals. While Oklo’s technology could address the energy demands of AI, its current lack of a proven product and reliance on future approvals make it a risky, meme‑style investment rather than a sustainable growth story.",
