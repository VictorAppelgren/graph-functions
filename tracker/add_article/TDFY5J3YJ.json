      "title": "Why AMD Stock Is Sinking Today",
      "summary": "AMD shares fell 2.2% after a 42% rally, as a new MIT study shows 95% of firms using generative AI are not profitable, dampening enthusiasm for AI‑driven growth. Inflation data from the PPI and comments from Target and Home Depot suggest rising costs could keep the Fed from cutting rates, adding pressure on growth stocks. The sell‑off has mirrored broader tech sector weakness, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also slipping. Investors now question whether AMD’s AI chip sales can sustain the valuation gains amid macro‑economic headwinds.",
