  "content": "Today's video game consoles are hundreds of dollars more expensive than you'd expect based on historic pricing trends. That's according to an Ars Technica analysis of decades of pricing data and price-cut timing across dozens of major US console releases.\n\nThe overall direction of this trend has been apparent to industry watchers for a while now. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have failed to cut their console prices in recent years and have instead been increasing the nominal MSRP for many current consoles in the past six months.\n\nIf the original Switch followed historic pricing trends, it could be selling for a bargain basement $100 to $150 right now.

Even accounting for inflation, some PS5 consoles are more expensive today than they were at launch. Even accounting for inflation, some PS5 consoles are more expensive today than they were at launch.

Even accounting for inflation, some PS5 consoles are more expensive today than they were at launch. Despite cratering Xbox hardware sales, Microsoft has been unwilling to cut prices on Xbox consoles.\n\nBut when you crunch the numbers, it's pretty incredible just how much today's console prices defy historic expectations, even when you account for higher-than-normal inflation in recent years. If today's consoles were seeing anything like what used to be standard price cuts over time, we could be paying around $200 today for pricey systems like the Switch OLED, PS5 Digital Edition, and Xbox Series S.\n\nTo determine the extent of today's relative console overpricing, we dug through old news reports, press releases, advertisements, and store catalogs for annual price data going back to the Atari 2600's launch in 1977. We used permanent MSRP announcements wherever possible so that temporary sales or store-specific closeouts wouldn't affect the data. If a console dropped in price multiple times in one year, we took the lowest price from that year. We then adjusted all the nominal prices for inflation to consistent July 2025 dollars using BLM's CPI calculator.\n\nAlmost every classic console saw significant price drops by its second or third year on the market (and beyond).

Some classic consoles saw significant, drastic price drops after just a year on the market, often before disappearing from shelves altogether shortly afterward. Others stayed at their nominal launch price for a year or three, letting inflation slowly chip away at that value of those dollars before finally dropping the price as a way to bolster lagging sales for aging hardware.",

Pricing for all current versions of the PlayStation 5 console will increase by $50 starting tomorrow.\nThe price of the PS5 Digital Edition will increase from $450 to $500; the standard PS5 will increase from $500 to $550; and the PS5 Pro will increase from $700 to $750. If you've been on the fence about buying any of these, retailers like Target and Best Buy are still using the old prices as of this writing\u2014for other console price hikes, retailers have sometimes bumped the prices up before the date announced by the manufacturer.\n\"Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,\" wrote Sony Global Marketing VP Isabelle Tomatis. \"As a result, we\u2019ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.\"\nSony says it's not increasing prices for games or accessories and that this round of price increases only affects consoles sold in the US.\nSony was the last of the big three console makers to raise prices this year. Microsoft raised the prices for the Xbox Series S and X consoles in March. And Nintendo has gone through two rounds of price increases\u2014one for Switch and Switch 2 accessories in April and another for more accessories and Switch 1 consoles earlier this month."

Those preorders were initially delayed from a planned April 9 opening so Nintendo could \"assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions\" on the console's launch. \"We apologize for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing,\" Nintendo said in its announcement Friday.\nHere are the newly announced planned prices for Nintendo's official Switch 2 accessories (the original prices announced on April 2 are struck out in parentheses):\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $84.99 (\n$79.99) - Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Controllers: $94.99 (\n$89.99) - Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $39.99 (\n$34.99) - Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Straps: $13.99 (\n$12.99) - Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheels: $24.99 (\n$19.99) - Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $54.99 (\n$49.99) - Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set: $119.99 (\n$109.99) - Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector: $39.99 (\n$34.99) - Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case: $84.99 (\n$79.99) - Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $34.99 (\n$29.99)"

      "text": "Microsoft is increasing the recommended asking price of Xbox hardware and accessories worldwide starting today and will start charging $79.99 for some new first-party games this holiday season. The announcement comes after \"careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,\" Microsoft said.\nIn the United States, this means Microsoft's premiere Xbox Series X will now cost $599.99 for a unit with a disc drive (up from $499.99), while the Digital version will cost $549.99 (up from $449.99). On the lower end, a 1 TB Xbox Series S will now cost $429.99 (up from $349.99), while a 512GB unit will cost $379.99 (up from $299.99).\nThe new prices are already reflected on Microsoft's official online store, and Microsoft says it will \"provide updated recommended pricing to local retailers.\" That might leave a small window where you can get Xbox hardware and accessories from those retailers at the older, lower price while supplies remain available.\nFor headsets specifically, Microsoft said that pricing will change \"in the US and Canada only,\" a potential recognition of the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods imported into the United States. Microsoft also warned that \"Xbox Series S and X availability may continue to change over time depending on the retailer and by country\" as those tariffs threaten to upend international trade worldwide.\nOn the software side, Microsoft said the increase to $79.99 will apply to both digital and physical versions of \"some\" new games this holiday season. Existing Xbox games will not be seeing a price increase, and \"different games and expansions will continue to be offered at a variety of price points.\""
