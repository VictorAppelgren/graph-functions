  "description": "The Washington Monthly magazine today is releasing its 2025 college rankings, which upend everything you thought you knew about which colleges are the best.",
  "content": "The only ranking that tells you both is the Washington Monthly's revised and expanded 2025 College Guide\n\nWASHINGTON, Aug. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The magazine today is releasing its 2025 college rankings, which upend everything you thought you knew about which colleges are the best.\n\nOther college rankings, like those by U.S. News, reward universities for their wealth, prestige, and exclusivity\u2014ensuring that the top ranks are always dominated by the same 10 or 20 elite schools, which few students can get into, much less afford. By contrast, the Washington Monthly measures colleges and universities by how much they help ordinary middle- and working-class students get ahead economically and become good citizens. Those are the outcomes most Americans\u2014students and taxpayers\u2014want from their investments in the higher ed system.\n\nAs a result, half of the top-scoring institutions on the Washington Monthly's Best Colleges for Your Tuition (and Tax) Dollars list are hidden gems that most students don't know about\u2014and that in many cases outperform elite universities.\n\u2022 The University of Texas\u2013Rio Grande Valley ranks 21 slots above Harvard University.\n\u2022 The highest-ranking elite school, Princeton University, comes in at number five, immediately below three campuses in the California State University system, including second-place Fresno State.\n\u2022 The number one college in America, according to the Washington Monthly, is Berea College, a liberal arts school in rural Kentucky. Berea offers a high-quality education for close to zero tuition, thanks to a work-study program that reduces costs and gives students valuable job skills.\n\nTo help students in their college search, the magazine offers short profiles of 25 of these high performing schools\u2014ranging from world-renowned Johns Hopkins University to unsung regional public universities like Northeastern State University in Oklahoma and the University of Central Florida.\n\nWith growing federal attacks on higher education and public concerns about its value, the Washington Monthly in 2025 has revised its rankings\u2014first published in 2005\u2014to provide an even clearer picture of how individual colleges are performing. Its Best Colleges for Your Tuition (and Tax) Dollars ranking combines all four-year colleges and universities into a single master list that allows readers to see how any college or university\u2014public or private, big or small\u2014stacks up against all the others. The magazine has also created two new companion rankings:",
