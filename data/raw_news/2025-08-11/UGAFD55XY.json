  "content": "Taylor Swift relishes announcing her albums in dramatic fashion. On Tuesday, she did it again, revealing the name of her 12th original studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d when a countdown clock on her website ticked down to 12:12 a.m. Eastern.\n\nShe did not disclose the release date of the album, or any other information about its tracks.\n\nKnown for meticulously placing Easter eggs ahead of announcements, Swift\u2019s team set off speculation from her hyperattentive fan base by posting a carousel of photos on Instagram on Monday. Could the 12 photos, taken at stops on the Eras Tour, correspond with the singer-songwriter\u2019s 12th studio album? Did the pattern of orange outfits align with Swift\u2019s practice of color-coding her catalog?\n\n\u201cThinking about when she said \u2018See you next era\u2026,\u2019\u201d the post\u2019s caption teased.\n\nThe announcement coincided with the news that Swift would be making a rare media appearance on the podcast \u201cNew Heights,\u201d which is hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother, Jason Kelce. The episode is slated to post on Wednesday.\n\nThe fan theorizing began to build on Monday, when the podcast posted to social media a teaser advertising a \u201cVERY special\u201d mystery guest in silhouette. Her appearance was confirmed Monday night, when the podcast\u2019s social feeds posted a short snippet revealing Swift sitting alongside Travis Kelce.",
