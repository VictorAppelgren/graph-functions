  "description": "Bangkok has rejected \"baseless\" accusations from Cambodia that it used chemical weapons during the Southeast Asian neighbours' worst military conflict in more than a decade. However, social media users have falsely claimed an old video of jets releasing coloured smoke shows the Thai army deploying lethal gases over Cambodia. The clip was in fact taken in Malaysia's Langkawi during an international airshow.",
  "content": "Bangkok has rejected \"baseless\" accusations from Cambodia that it used chemical weapons during the Southeast Asian neighbours' worst military conflict in more than a decade. However, social media users have falsely claimed an old video of jets releasing coloured smoke shows the Thai army deploying lethal gases over Cambodia. The clip was in fact taken in Malaysia's Langkawi during an international airshow.\n\n\"Thailand used toxic fumes on its territory. Cambodia has severely affected the lives of Cambodian citizens. This is a genocide against humanity and a violation of international law,\" reads text over a TikTok video shared on July 28, 2025.\n\nThe caption repeats the same claim, crediting it to Cambodia's Ministry of National Defense.\n\nThe five second video was viewed more than 3,600 times and shows three jets releasing red and blue smoke mid-flight.\n\nThe video surfaced elsewhere on Facebook and X ahead of a truce between Thailand and Cambodia on July 29 that halted five-days of military clashes, triggered by a long-standing dispute over their 800-kilometre (500 mile) border (archived link).\n\nAt least 43 people were killed on both sides and over 300,000 were driven from their homes.\n\nPrior to peace talks on July 27, Cambodia accused Thailand of using chemical weapons against its citizens, a claim Bangkok has denied and called \"baseless\" (archived links here and here).\n\nThe circulating video, meanwhile, is unrelated to the conflict -- it was taken during a Malaysian airshow in 2023 and shared online in May 2025.\n\nA reverse image search on Google using keyframes from the false post found a longer, uncropped version of the video on TikTok on May 24, 2025, captioned \"#limalangkawi\" (archived link).\n\nThe user, who goes by @zainalabidinhassanal, told AFP on August 6 that the video was taken during the biennial Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (LIMA) in 2023.\n\nThe event takes place at the Mahsuri International Exhibition Centre next to Langkawi International Airport, located in an archipelago off the northern coast of Malaysia.\n\nThe same user posted another video from the airshow on May 23, 2025, which features scenes corresponding to Google Maps Street View imagery of the exhibition centre (archived links here and here).\n\nAFP has also debunked other misinformation related to the conflict between Thailand and Cambodia.",

      "text": "Thailand and Cambodia exchanged allegations on Wednesday of breaching a ceasefire deal which has largely halted the open combat that engulfed their frontier.\nThe nations agreed a truce starting Tuesday after five days of clashes killed at least 43 people on both sides, as a long-standing dispute over contested border temples boiled over into fighting on their 800-kilometre (500-mile) boundary.\nBut Thailand's foreign ministry said its troops in Sisaket province \"came under attack by small arms fire and grenade assaults launched by Cambodian forces\" in an offensive which continued until Wednesday morning.\n\"This represents a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement,\" said a foreign ministry statement.\nThai government spokesman Jirayu Huangsab also reported overnight clashes but said \"the Thai side maintained control of the situation\" and conditions along the border were \"reported to be normal\" from 8:00 am (0100 GMT).\nOn Wednesday, a Cambodian defence ministry official accused Thailand of twice breaching the ceasefire, intended to end fighting which has seen the two countries evacuate a total of more than 300,000 people from the border region.\nUN rights chief Volker Turk urged the neighbouring nations to implement their ceasefire deal in full, and take rapid steps to build confidence and peace.\n\"This crucial agreement must be fully respected, in good faith, by both sides, as diplomatic efforts continue, in a bid to resolve the root causes of the conflict,\" Turk said.\nAt a temple in Thailand's Surin city serving as a shelter and field kitchen 50 kilometres away from the frontier, volunteer Thanin Kittiworranun said evacuees remain in limbo.\n\"We don't believe Cambodia will hold the ceasefire,\" the 65-year-old told AFP.\nBut an AFP journalist on the Cambodian side who heard a steady drumbeat of artillery fire since fighting began on Thursday reported hearing no blasts between the start of the truce and Wednesday morning.\nBeijing said deputy foreign minister Sun Weidong hosted a meeting with Thai and Cambodian officials in Shanghai, where both \"reaffirmed to China their commitment to abide by the ceasefire consensus\".\n- 'Fragile' -\nThe armistice got off to a shaky start in the early hours of Tuesday, with Thailand accusing Cambodia of continuing attacks in \"a clear attempt to undermine mutual trust\" -- before peace generally prevailed.\nMeetings between rival commanders along the border -- scheduled as part of the pact -- went ahead, with Thailand's army saying de-escalation steps were agreed including \"a halt on troop reinforcements or movements that could lead to misunderstandings\".\nBut later in the day a foreign affairs spokeswoman for Bangkok's border crisis centre, Maratee Nalita Andamo, warned the situation -- in the early days of the truce -- remained \"fragile\".\nJets, rockets and artillery have killed at least 15 Thai troops and 15 Thai civilians, while Cambodia has confirmed only eight civilian and five military deaths.\nThe flare-up has surpassed the death toll of 28 in violence that raged sporadically from 2008 to 2011 over the territory, claimed by both nations because of a vague demarcation made by Cambodia's French colonial administrators in 1907.\nThe peace pact was sealed in Malaysia after intervention from US President Donald Trump -- who both Thailand and Cambodia are courting for a trade deal to avert his threat of eye-watering tariffs.\ntak/jts/sco/dhw"

  "argos_summary": "Thailand has denied accusations from Cambodia of using chemical weapons during recent military clashes, labeling the claims as \"baseless\" and part of a disinformation campaign. A video circulating on social media, purportedly showing Thai jets releasing toxic gases, was actually filmed during an airshow in Malaysia and is unrelated to the conflict. The two countries have agreed to a truce after five days of fighting that resulted in at least 43 deaths and displaced over 300,000 people.",
