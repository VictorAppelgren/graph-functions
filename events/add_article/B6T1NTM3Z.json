      "summary": "Senate Republicans, led by Majority Whip John Barrasso, are threatening to use the nuclear option to fast‑track President Trump’s pending nominees after Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, block them. Trump has demanded that the Senate stay in Washington to approve the entire slate, while Republicans propose rule changes or recess appointments to bypass filibusters. Negotiations collapsed when Trump accused Democrats of political extortion, leaving the Senate without a deal and setting the stage for a potential rules overhaul when lawmakers return in September.",
