  "description": "Seamstresses say they are seeing more women undergoing rapid weight-loss before their big day.",
  "content": "Angie Smith said she has asked brides if they are using slimming jabs after a trend emerged this year\n\nIt's said that your wedding day is one of the most important days of your life, and with that comes pressure for everything to be perfect, including how you look. Medications designed to aid weight-loss, such as Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Wegovy, have transformed weddings for brides wanting to slim down quickly. But with some brides losing multiple stone \"within weeks\" bridal companies have said they are overwhelmed, leaving them to reassess how they run their businesses. Seamstresses have said they are seeing more women undergoing rapid weight-loss before their big day, leading to expensive and stressful last-minute dress alterations.\n\nIt is believed an estimated 1.5 million people are using weight loss jabs in the UK, designed to suppress your appetite and lead to weight loss. This year alone, seamstress Angie Smith has worked with 11 brides who have chosen to use these drugs. \"I had a bride come in, [who had] already been on a weight journey a year before and then reached a plateau... she then decided she was going on the slimming jabs. \"When she came for a final fit, I didn't recognise the lady walking up the drive.\" The 64-year-old from Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan, said she had \"a little bit of a wobble\" when she could \"put her fist down the back of the dress\" but was eventually able to tailor it.\n\nShe acknowledged despite the pressure to keep up with orders, there was a pay off when a bride received the dress of their dreams. \"I think personally, if it's making a difference to their wellbeing, I don't see the problem with it,\" she said. This increase in the number of people turning to weight-loss jabs has seen seamstresses such as Ms Smith make decisions on how they work in the future to protect their businesses and staff. \"Logistically, it's been a bit of a nightmare,\" said Ms Smith. She said that after discussing \"all of the normal things\" with the bride about their dress and their wedding, she asks outright if the brides are using slimming jabs. \"It's not being rude or being nosey, I need to know from a planning point of view because it's the change that I work.\"\n\n\"A lot of brides don't realise the amount of work that goes into the dresses,\" said Rhiannon Brown. The 55-year-old has run a bridal alterations business for more than a decade. Ms Brown, from Cardiff, added while she had \"dealt with weight loss\" in brides throughout her career, many of her clients using jabs were \"losing stones within weeks\". With less than 24-hours to go until her wedding, one of Ms Brown's brides required a last-minute alteration as a result of further unexpected weight loss. She said she planned to make clear in future paperwork an additional fee would apply if a bride required a second full alteration due to significant weight loss. \"As long as brides are honest with us and tell us that they're on this journey, then we can put the fittings a bit closer to the wedding,\" she said. \"If they come for their second fitting and it's like doing the first fitting again because they've lost so much weight, we're going to have to charge for that because its more man hours.\" She added there was also a limit to how much work could be done before an entirely new dress was required. \"We can take dresses down two sizes comfortably depending on the style. \"But once you go over that, there's going to be a point where we can't alter the dress for the bride.\"\n\nGeorgie Mitchell and Beth Smith host The Unfiltered Bride, a wedding podcast where people share their wedding dilemmas and tips, including their experience of weight loss. \"I think weight-loss jabs are still very taboo,\" said Beth. \"I don't know if everyone feels comfortable to say they're on it.\" As wedding planners and suppliers themselves, Georgie and Beth recognised the pressure brides are under on \"the most documented day of their lives\". They added they had also seen grooms opt for injections as well.\n\nKatie, who is due to get married in 2026, said she understood why alteration companies would need to charge extra to accommodate extreme weight-loss. \"I have lost 4.5 stone (28.5kg) while I've been on Mounjaro,\" she said. \"I was quite open and honest with the original dress shop I went to.\" Katie is now on a maintenance dose in the run up to her wedding next year. \"I probably will go down again soon to see what the dress looks like on, because I think I have lost another stone since I tried it on.\"\n\n\"The average cost of a wedding dress in the UK tends to be about \u00a32,000,\" said Nikita Thorne from Guides for Brides, an online wedding directory. She said while brides should expect to pay extra for alterations, the impact of weight-loss jabs on the wedding industry was likely to be \"shorter-term thing\", because of the way the industry was trying to help couples in understanding the effects of this long term.",

      "text": "How do weight-loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?\n- Published\nThere are currently thought to be about 1.5 million people on weight-loss drugs in the UK.\nSome people are able to get the injections - called Mounjaro and Wegovy - through the NHS but most buy them privately.\nThose buying Mounjaro are expected to see prices rise from September.\nHow do Wegovy and Mounjaro work?\nThere are two drugs on the market - semaglutide, marketed under the brand name Wegovy, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro.\nThey are given as weekly injections via pre-filled pens that can be self-administered into the upper arm, thigh or stomach.\nBoth drugs work as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone which makes people feel fuller. Mounjaro also affects metabolism and helps regulate energy balance.\nPatients generally start on a low level dose which is gradually increased until they reach a maintenance dose.\nHow much weight do people lose?\nPeople typically start to lose weight within a few weeks.\nThe first head-to-head trial of the two drugs suggested that Mounjaro was more effective.\nMounjaro's 20% weight reduction, after 72 weeks of treatment, exceeded the 14% for Wegovy.\nThe trial - funded by Mounjaro manufacturer Eli Lilly - involved 750 obese people, with an average weight of 113kg (nearly 18 stone).\nHowever, research suggests people put most of the weight back on within a year of stopping the drugs, as their normal food cravings return.\nThe NHS has been urged to provide regular check-ups, support and advice, to prevent this happening.\nWho can get weight-loss drugs on the NHS?\nWegovy is currently available on the NHS in England, Wales and Scotland.\nTo qualify, adults must be obese (with a BMI of at least 35) and have at least one pre-existing weight-related health condition such as high blood pressure.\nPeople with cardiovascular disease who are classed as overweight, but not quite obese, can also be given the drug.\nPatients should follow a diet and physical activity programme, and the drug should be only prescribed for a maximum of two years, according to NHS guidelines.\nMounjaro has been available from specialist NHS weight-loss clinics in England and Wales since March 2025.\nIn June, some GPs in England started offering it to NHS patients who meet strict criteria:\na BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 if from a minority ethnic background)\nand four out of five of these conditions: type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart and vascular disease, high cholesterol and obstructive sleep apnoea\nPatients who are prescribed Mounjaro will also get regular check-ups, exercise support and advice on healthy eating.\nIt is thought around 3.4 million people could eventually qualify for Mounjaro.\nHowever, the body which assesses how the NHS uses drugs, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has warned that it could take more than a decade to roll out access to everyone who could benefit.\nWhat do Wegovy and Mounjaro cost to buy privately?\nWegovy and Mounjaro can both be bought privately, in supermarkets, chemists and high-street clinics. Estimates suggest nine in 10 pay for the drugs privately.\nPens typically cost between \u00a3100 and \u00a3300, depending on the dose.\nHowever, the price of Mounjaro is expected to rise sharply in the UK. In August, Eli Lilly announced it was putting up the list price by as much as 170%.\nThis could have meant the cost of the highest dose going up from \u00a3122 to \u00a3330 per month. However, the BBC understands the highest dose will now be sold to suppliers for \u00a3247.50.\nThe drugs should not be bought from unregulated sources.\nSince February online pharmacies have been required to employ stricter checks to stop people who are already a healthy weight or have a history of eating disorders buying weight-loss jabs.\nThe BMI of patients who have completed online questionnaires or sent photos must also be verified.\nWhat are the side-effects of weight-loss injections?\nThe most common side-effects are feeling sick, vomiting, bloating, constipation and diarrhoea. Some people report hair loss.\nFor many, the side-effects are manageable and tend to go away in time; others say they stopped taking the drugs because of them.\nExperts warn the complications can be worse if the drugs are abused, for example, taken as a quick fix to lose a few pounds.\nIn rare cases, serious side-effects can include gallbladder and kidney problems and depression.\nThere have also been hundreds of reports of people suffering problems with their pancreas - although none are confirmed as being caused by the medicines.\nWhat are the warnings about pregnancy?\nThe UK's medicines regulator, the MHRA, has warned women that the lack of information about how the drugs could affect unborn children means they must not be taken:\nduring pregnancy\nwhile trying to get pregnant\nduring breastfeeding\nThe drugs can also stop the contraceptive pill being absorbed properly.\nThe MHRA recommends that women taking the jabs consider using additional or alternative contraception.\nWhat is obesity and what is a healthy BMI?\nThe term obese describes a person with excess body fat.\nIn the UK it's estimated that around one in every four adults is obese.\nThe standard way of categorising people's weight is by calculating their body mass index, or BMI.\nFor most adults, if your BMI is:\nbelow 18.5 \u2013 you're in the underweight range\n18.5 to 24.9 \u2013 you're in the healthy weight range\n25 to 29.9 \u2013 you're in the overweight range\n30 to 39.9 \u2013 you're in the obese range\n40 or above \u2013 you're in the severely obese range\nThose with an Asian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean family background need to use a lower BMI score:\n23 to 27.4 \u2013 overweight\n27.5 or above \u2013 obese\nBMI has some limitations because it measures weight, not fat. Someone who is very muscular can also have a high BMI.\nBut for most people, it is a useful indication of whether they are a healthy weight."

      "text": "Daily weight loss pill could help patients lose 12% of body weight\n- Published\nTrials of a daily obesity pill have shown it can help patients lose around 12% of their body weight over 72 weeks.\nThe manufacturer, Eli Lilly, says the drug, which is not yet licensed, could be available next year.\nThe daily pill, called orforglipron, works by suppressing appetite and making you feel more full.\nPreliminary results of a major trial show those on the highest dose lost an average of 12 kilos (nearly two stone) over 16 months but about one in 10 stopped taking the pills due to side effects, including nausea and vomiting.\nIn addition to weight loss, participants also benefited from reductions in cholesterol, blood fats and blood pressure.\nDr Kenneth Custer of Eli Lilly said the company was planning to submit the drug for licensing before the end of the year and preparing for a \"global launch to address this urgent public health need\".\nSo where might this weight loss pill fit in to the blockbuster multi-billion pound market dominated by injectable drugs like Mounjaro, Wegovy and Ozempic?\nThe pill is much less effective than injectables.\nThe 12% weight loss achieved by those taking orforglipron compares to 22% weight loss for patients on Mounjaro, given by weekly injection. Both drugs are made by Eli Lilly.\nDespite being less effective, there is likely to be a significant market for weight loss pills, as a needle-free means of cutting obesity levels.\nObesity experts hope the oral drug will be far cheaper than current injectables which would make it available to many more patients.\n- Published5 August\n- Published13 hours ago\nThe full results of the trial will be presented next month at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal.\nRival manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, also has an oral version of its injectable drug Wegovy which it has already submitted for approval in the US.\nIn trials, patients on the highest dose of the Novo Nordisk daily pill lost around 15% of their bodyweight after 64 weeks."

He could not stand still for long periods because of back pain.\nThe 38-year-old only qualified as a midwife in September 2024 and had previously worked in insurance.\nHe told the BBC it was the \"sedentary nature of the job\", coupled with eating out of boredom and feeling low, that led to his weight creeping up.\n\"I would eat to feel better. When I had a bad day, I would order a huge takeaway - it was a way of coping,\" he added.\nBut after completing his midwifery training, he could see how it was affecting the care he was able to provide and he realised he had to do something drastic.\n\"I knew I could not be front line defence in an emergency at this weight\", he said.\nSo 10 days before starting his new role at Doncaster Royal Infirmary, he flew to Turkey to have a gastric sleeve fitted.\nDuring the procedure he had about 80% of his stomach removed, meaning he was forced to eat less.\n\"I lost about a stone in the first three days, then it was gradual. I don't feel as hungry anymore and I am now down to 12 stone.\n\"I have so much more energy, have more patience at work and I'm not falling asleep the minute I get home,\" Mr Gigg said.\nHe has also taken up running and is hoping to raise \u00a31,500 to go towards a new electrocardiogram (ECG) machine for the maternity unit at Doncaster Royal Infirmary, through Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals Charity.\nThe machines cost \u00a32,500 and Mr Gigg is hopeful he will be able to raise enough money to pay for a new one outright.\nWith a second ECG machine, the unit would be able to speed up care by carrying out heart checks on patients without borrowing equipment from other departments at the hospital.\nMr Gigg's plan is to run 124 miles (200km) throughout the month of August and he is currently at the 80 mile (129km) mark.\n\"I started training at the gym three months after the operation and started running in January - a minute at a time - and one day decided to do a 5k.\n\"I gradually increased the distance and wanted to prove to myself I could do this - and the reward is helping the hospital and reaching my target.\"\nMr Gigg, who is originally from Bristol but has lived in South Yorkshire for 10 years, said his surgery has also led to other positive lifestyle changes.\n\"I enjoy horse-riding and seeing my friends and family more and I can just be more me - it's very freeing.\"\nMr Gigg's husband and his colleagues think he is doing \"amazing\" but also \"a bit crazy\" - especially after he runs home straight after a 13-hour night shift.\nWhen asked why he wanted to switch careers to midwifery, Mr Gigg said: \"I wanted to help women go through one of the hardest things that any person can go through.\n\"It's a magical experience seeing a family being created and I wanted to be part of that.\"\nSuzy Brain England OBE, chair of the board at Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals, said: \"We're so inspired by Lee's story.\n\"This is an incredible personal challenge that will leave a lasting legacy for maternity patients.\"\nShe added: \"His determination and willpower to take on such a massive feat is inspiring and we wish him all the best with his remaining miles.\"\nMr Gigg said he hopes he can inspire others to lose weight and to change careers if they are unhappy.\n\"Life is just too short,\" he added.\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Yorkshire\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North"

And could her honesty quieten the critics?\nThe 43-year-old tennis star, who broke records and won 23 grand slam titles through her career, was the embodiment of fitness and athletic prowess.

Despite \"training five hours a day\" and \"running, walking, biking, stair climbing,\" she couldn't pulverise this adversary like she did to her opponents on the tennis court - so in the end, she says, she had no other choice but to \"try something different\".\nMany of her friends were using GLP-1 - the group of medications which help with weight loss, so she decided to try it.\nWilliams is adamant that the medication route - she won't say which brand she is taking - wasn't easy, and certainly not a shortcut to her losing 31lb (14kg) over the past eight months.\nThere is scepticism about the timing of the tennis star's recent transparency - she has just become a spokesperson for Ro, a company which sells GLP-1 brands like Wegovy and Zepbound (known as Mounjaro in the UK) through its weight-loss programme, and her husband is also an investor.\nDespite this and the potential side effects of taking the medication, her honesty will hit a nerve for many - she says she is speaking out to take away the shame that so many women feel when it comes to using drugs to help them lose weight.\n- Published13 hours ago\n- Published19 October 2024\nCaleb Luna, assistant professor of feminist studies at the University of California, says having someone like Serena Williams speaking out is \"a breakthrough\".\nThey say it helps silence the critics of how \"weight loss is achieved\" who say that \"people are taking the easy way out\" by using weight loss drugs.\n\"It gets rid of the stereotype that these drugs are for fat people who are being lazy and incompetent.\n\"In that respect it's maybe a good thing.\"\nBut Caleb also says the revelation about her need to resort to using GLP-1 medication is slightly \"terrifying\" and makes them feel \"a little bit sad\". They worry that all it does is belittle hard work and dedication, instead, focussing on appearance and the pressure to look a certain way.\n\"She has achieved things that so few people, in our time and throughout history have achieved.\n\"But now it just shows how all those accomplishments can be undermined by body size.\n\"Scarily, weight loss seems to outshine all those record-breaking achievements.\"\n'Healthy weight'\nWilliams' weight and her looks have been scrutinised throughout her life. The burden, the pressure to fit in with society's expectations does not diminish no matter how much sporting success an athlete has in their career.\nAnd while she may be the most high profile sports star who openly uses weight loss medication, there are many others in the public eye who have spoken out.\nOprah Winfrey says she uses GLP-1 as a tool, along with exercise and healthy eating, to stop herself \"yo-yoing\" with her weight.\nActress Whoopi Goldberg says she lost the weight of \"two people\", external after taking the drug, and singer Kelly Clarkson, who says she was \"chased\" by her \"doctor for two years\" before she agreed to take it, are among the dozens of stars who have been open about taking the medication.\nWilliams left the world of tennis behind back in 2022, when she played the final match of her career in the US Open, but she is still a powerhouse of strength and has wanted to reach what she describes as her \"healthy weight\" since the birth of her second child, Adira.\nIn her interview with the Today Show, says she felt like her \"body was missing something\" and she wasn't able to get down to what she felt comfortable with - despite intense training.\nDr Claire Madigan, a senior research associate in behavioural medicine at the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, says elite athletes can find it hard to lose weight.\n\"They are used to consuming a lot of calories and when they leave the sport they can find it difficult - it needs a change in behaviour.\"\nDr Madigan said it was good to see that Williams mentioned her weight loss was not just down to the drug - \"she did have to focus on the diet and physical activity\".\nShe added: \"It's great she is talking about how difficult it is to lose weight after having a baby.\"\nBut she wonders if Williams's message might be lost and even demotivate some women. \"The drugs are quite expensive and the average person may think here is an elite athlete, she's got access to the gym, she's got time, she has a nutritionist\u2026 and she's had to use GLP-1s\".\nDr Madigan also expressed concern that the potential side effects of taking the drugs - which can include gastrointestinal problems like vomiting and diarrhoea, and in rare cases, gallbladder and kidney problems - may not have been widely discussed in the publicity surrounding Williams's announcement.\nWilliams says she did not experience any side effects, and told Women's Health magazine that she is finally seeing the benefits of all her hard work at the gym.\n\"My joints are a lot better,\" she says, \"I just had my check-up, and the doctor said everything - including my blood sugar levels - looked great.\"\nAnd, even though, she's no longer breaking new ground on the tennis courts, she is still smashing her own records, with the help, she says of weight loss drugs. She's currently training for a half marathon.\n\"I am running farther than I ever have,\" she says proudly.\nAdditional reporting by Alex Kleiderman\nRelated topics\n- Published14 August\n- Published12 May"

      "text": "Price of Mounjaro to be discounted in UK pharmacies\n- Published\nThe company behind popular weight loss drug Mounjaro has offered a discounted deal to UK suppliers which is expected to limit the price increase to consumers from September.\nEarlier this month, Eli Lilly announced it was putting up the list price of the drug by as much as 170% which could have meant the cost of the highest dose going up from \u00a3122 to \u00a3330 per month.\nBut the BBC understands the highest dose will now be sold to suppliers for \u00a3247.50.\nPharmacies and other private weight-loss services will add their own mark-up to consumers, but it means the price rise for patients is unlikely to be as large as initially feared.\n- Published13 hours ago\nEli Lilly originally said the UK price of Mounjaro had to increase to be more in line with higher prices in Europe and the US.\nUS President Donald Trump had previously complained about the high cost of drugs in the US, compared to other countries, and threatened the pharmaceutical industry if they didn't act.\nThe deal does not affect the price the NHS pays, as the service has negotiated its own heavily-discounted rate for those getting the drug on prescription.\nThe weekly injection works by making you feel full so you eat less, and can help people lose 20% of their body weight.\nCurrently there are thought to be around 1.5 million people on weight loss drugs in the UK with more than half of them on Mounjaro. Estimates suggest nine in 10 pay for these drugs privately, buying from online services and high street pharmacies.\nEli Lilly said: \"We are working with private providers on commercial arrangements to maintain affordability and expect these to be passed onto patients when the change is effective on 1 September.\n\"We are already seeing providers respond in different ways to the list price change, with a range of options available for eligible patients.\"\nThe price the consumer pays depends on which service they buy the weight loss drug from.\nSome offer more lifestyle and diet support while on the drug than others.\nThe BBC has spoken to a number of services and the price rise for customers may be kept under 50% for the higher doses and even less for the lower doses.\nOlivier Picard, of the National Pharmacy Association, said: \"Pharmacies will do all they can to support patients when prices change.\n\"This rebate will mitigate some of the impact of the increase, but patients should still anticipate seeing a rise in prices from 1 September.\n\"Pharmacies are working hard to support their patients and explore if there are options to minimise disruption to their treatment programme.\"\nGet in touch\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?\nRelated topics\n- Published2 days ago\n- Published14 August\n- Published5 June"
