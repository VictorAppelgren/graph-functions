      "feedback": "**Actionable edit plan (compact paragraph)**  \nCondense the brief to 5–6 crisp bullet points that each combine a single theme (e.g., macro backdrop, AI‑driven labor shift, automotive transition, insurance valuation, ACMR outlook) and end with a clear catalyst or risk. Start each bullet with a headline phrase, then state the key quantitative driver (e.g., “Fed 50 bp cut 70 % likely (C3ODMIQKZ)”), the immediate market impact (e.g., “↓ corporate spreads 300–350 bp, lift equity P/E 2–3 pts (GX057ADL7)”), and the specific catalyst or watch‑item (e.g., “Fed September minutes”). Remove redundant sentences that repeat the same source or idea (e.g., the two separate mentions of AI’s impact on the JUST Workers Index). Tighten causal chains by explicitly linking cause to effect in one sentence (e.g., “Higher real‑rate differential compresses insurance discount rates, driving Donegal’s dividend yield down (TN66GHPAT)”). Add a brief risk weighting (e.g., “Risk: Fed tightening could compress insurance valuations by 10 % (TN66GHPAT)”) and a confidence band (e.g., “Confidence: moderate‑high ≈70 % (SK994CBWR)”). Ensure every claim is backed by a source ID and that all critical sources (TN66GHPAT, 4LQD15CFU, JVKCZAPVG, SK994CBWR, C3ODMIQKZ, GX057ADL7, J99EM2TPZ, 7YQN9WX3K, U1KRCQOYR) appear at least once. Finally, format as a single paragraph of 4–6 sentences, each ending with a concise watch‑item, to meet the executive‑style, no‑filler requirement.",
