  "description": "Democratic think tank Third Way released a blunt memo Friday urging the party to abandon \"therapy-speak\" and \"seminar room language\" that alienates voters.",
  "content": "A blunt memo circulated Friday urges Democrats to ditch \"elitist\" jargon that is alienating to voters if they want to defeat President Donald Trump's agenda.In the message titled, \"Was It Something I Said?,\" Democratic think tank Third Way warned Democratic officials against using language packed with progressive framing, labeling such terms as \"therapy-speak,\" \"seminar room language,\" and \"organizer jargon,\" among others.The memo highlighted 44 words and phrases seen as divisive, including \"privilege,\" \"safe space,\" \"existential threat,\" \"the unhoused,\" \"birthing person,\" \"Latinx,\" and \"incarcerated people.\" Third Way argues these terms make Democrats appear like radical \"enforcers of wokeness\" to the average American.OBAMA BROS CONFRONTED ON DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S INTOLERANCE PROBLEM, HISTORY OF \u2018EXCLUDING PEOPLE\u2019Third Way stressed it is not policing language. The group even admitted using some of these terms in its own papers. However, it urged Democratic officials to reflect before using such terms.\"Before you draft your angry tweet thread, think about conversations with persuadable voters in your own life\u2014especially friends, family, and co-workers\u2014and consider whether the use of the language above would help or hurt your case,\" the Third Way memo said. The group argued that these terms raise red flags for many Americans, not because they are bigoted, but because they fear cancellation for speaking freely around liberals who use these terms.Matt Bennett, Third Way's executive vice president of public affairs, told Fox News Digital the memo was intended for \"everyone in Democratic politics who has a public-facing role.\"CARVILLE SAYS DEMS 'BETRAYED' WORKING-CLASS VOTERS BY NOT INCLUDING THEM IN 'TOO-COOL-FOR-SCHOOL' COALITION\"When elected officials, candidates, and high-profile spokespeople use this kind of language, it is deeply alienating. And while it might be well-intentioned, by empowering the right, it ends up hurting the very people it\u2019s intended to shield,\" he said.The group adds its messaging push stems from frustration with what they view as \"damaging, self-defeating language being weaponized against our allies.\"\"Even after the terrible losses in November, too many on the left have not gotten the message that they live in a bubble and that folks outside of that bubble think that kind of language is somewhere between silly and offensive,\" Bennett added.The memo aligns with broader concerns raised by prominent Democrats since the November election.Former Democratic Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel warned in June that Democrats needed to stop worrying about identity politics and become a big-tent party again if they wanted to win elections.\"Why do Democrats have a problem?\" he told \"The Bulwark\" host Tim Miller. \"Because we're punks, and we not only talk like punks, we talk down to people, we get caught up in a set of issues that aren't relevant.\"On \"Inside Politics\" on Friday, CNN's John King said that Third Way had a point about Democratic messaging resonating with voters.\"A lot of people used to be Democrats who are now Trump voters,\" King said. \"They do think the Democratic Party speaks a different language.\"King said politicians and journalists should talk about things that are relevant to most of America, not just those in \"New York or San Francisco.\"\"But I do think people in middle America think that the elitists have lost their way and speak a language that they don\u2019t understand,\" he continued.",

They criticized those who continue to shun Trump voters who are now expressing regret for supporting the president.\nSilverman brought up how podcast host Joe Rogan has been attacked online for criticizing Trump's second term after supporting him in the 2024 election. She called it \"ironic\" that the party of \"inclusivity\" was \"incredibly elitist.\"\nAnti-Trump Kimmel, who campaigned for Democrats in the 2024 election, defended his party while agreeing that some progressive figures have turned people away.\nTRUMP REPEATS CLAIM KIMMEL, FALLON ARE 'NEXT' AFTER STEPHEN COLBERT CANCELLATION\n\"Yes. But it's not- it's not the party. It's not the majority. It's the loud voices that scare people from saying what they believe and make you think twice about a joke or whatever,\" he responded.\n\"You know, a lot of their points are valid, but a lot of them are also just repulsive, in that they repel people,\" Kimmel continued. \"They go like, 'Oh, you're no fun. I don't want to be around you.' And I think that if you had to boil it down to one thing, that's kind of what it is.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nIn April, Kimmel blamed humorless liberal scolds trying to cancel comedians for Trump's rise to power.\n\"I think a lot of the outrage is completely manufactured, and it\u2019s like, a lot of these people who are angry aren\u2019t really angry. I think these liberals who\u2019ve done such a good job of viciously attacking comedians are a big part of the reason why Trump is the president right now,\" he said.\nAfter \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert's show was canceled in July, Trump predicted this week that Kimmel and fellow late-night host Jimmy Fallon would be \"next\" to go off the air.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News' Hanna Panreck contributed to this report."

      "text": "Veteran Democratic Party strategist James Carville warned on Thursday that Democrats need to acknowledge how they took part in the decades-long betrayal of White, working-class voters.\nSince the Democratic Party\u2019s historic loss in November, many have been trying to chart a path forward to reclaiming their coalition. While some have doubled-down on controversial far-left identity politics, some have worked to reclaim working-class men they alienated in recent years, particularly White men.\nOn the Politics War Room podcast, hosts Carville and Al Hunt addressed a comment from a listener, who suggested that rather than being reconciliation, MAGA supporters deserve to be \"beaten badly at the voting booth and then told just to suck it up.\"\n\"Oh God, who doesn\u2019t have that instinct?\" Carville responded, but nonetheless warned that politics comes down to winning elections, and that means persuading voters.\n\"It is not the most satisfying way, but what in the end are we trying to do? We're trying to do one thing, win elections.\" He proceeded to warn against the \"temptation that says \u2018I can't believe how godd--n stupid you were.\"\nWhile he said he has no temptation for the \"corporate a\u2014wipes\" who voted for Trump to become richer, the strategist nicknamed the Ragin\u2019 Cajun expressed some sympathy for working-class Whites he says have been betrayed by both parties.\n\"I have an iota of sympathy for somebody whose life hadn't turned out right,\" he said. \"The brilliant thing about MAGA is it gives you an explanation other than yourself of why your life didn't turn out the way you wanted it, and we should say to these people \u2018We kind of understand what you were trying to say but you were betrayed.\u2019\"\n\"Let's also face it, Democrats acted like these people didn't exist alright? They just did, and don't come back and say-We acted like working-class, particularly working-class non-college Whites were not part of our too-cool-for-school group,\" he continued. \"There were some real high-end people that kind of bought in to that s---.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHe returned to the listener\u2019s question and reasserted his point that it\u2019s better to reconcile with working-class White voters, even if he understands being frustrated with them.\n\"I can see it, but the best thing to do is not punch him in the mouth but to say, \u2018You know man I could hear where you're coming from you just got betrayed, and we betrayed you somewhat, and we now have learned our lesson,'\" he said."

      "text": "Two former Obama staffers admitted Tuesday that intolerance within the Democratic Party was a \"huge problem\" that needs to be addressed if the party hopes to win future elections.\nTommy Vietor and Jon Favreau, Obama alumni and hosts of \"Pod Save America,\" joined the \"Flagrant\" podcast for a wide-ranging discussion on President Donald Trump's campaign promises, political hypocrisy and the internal purity tests plaguing the Democratic Party.\n\"In my lifetime, I\u2019ve never seen a political party as obsessed with excluding people,\" \"Flagrant\" co-host Akaash Singh told Vietor and Favreau.\n\"And the irony is, Democrats seem to love talking about inclusivity. Ad nauseam. Inclusivity, inclusivity, inclusivity. But if somebody steps out of line from what we want them to say, \u2018F--- you forever.\u2019 You have no chance of redemption.\"\nOBAMA TELLS DEMOCRAT BIG WIGS TO \u2018TOUGHEN UP,\u2019 START BACKING CANDIDATES THAT CAN ACTUALLY WIN\n\"How do Dems fix that?\" co-host Andrew Schulz posed to the former Obama officials.\nVietor acknowledged there was \"a huge problem\" over the past few years with liberals being unwilling to engage in conversation with people they disagree with. But he believes that the Democratic Party is now adopting a more open attitude.\nVietor recounted how he had once been invited to a Barstool Sports show but declined the request, fearing at the time that his podcast audience would get \"upset\" with him because of things Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy had said.\n\"I think back to that, and I'm embarrassed, and I'm mad at myself,\" he confessed.\nFORMER OBAMA SPEECHWRITER ADMITS SHUNNING CONSERVATIVE IN HIS FAMILY WAS A MISTAKE\nVietor said he\u2019s since changed his attitude and believes the party at large is \"course correcting\" and \"learning from those mistakes.\"\nHe cited how Bernie Sanders welcomed podcast host Joe Rogan\u2019s endorsement in the 2020 election as a sign there was willingness for the party to be a \"big tent\" party again.\nHe also pushed back on the idea that viewpoint diversity was largely a Democratic Party problem.\n\"Democrats can be annoying. We can be scold-y. But I think sometimes it's online mobs more than the party,\" he said of left-wing cancel culture.\nVietor went on to praise Trump as a \"genius\" for inviting Democrats like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. onto his cabinet and conceded that Democrats could learn from that.\n\"Democrats, you're right, sometimes we have like a laundry list of things, and you don't check all the boxes, we don't allow you in the tent,\" he said.\nVietor advocated for the party to return to \"Obama-era politics\" where he argued leaders in the party had respectful engagement with voters they disagreed with on hot-button issues.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAt another point in the podcast, Favreau responded to a question from the co-hosts about Democrats' \"morally superior\" attitude.\nHe conceded that lecturing Trump supporters about racism and his \"horrible\" policies wasn't a winning strategy to expand the Democratic Party coalition.\n\"Is our ultimate goal to just be, like, right on the internet? Or is the goal to, like, pass policies that we deeply believe in that are going to improve people's lives? Because if that's the goal, then we're going to need to have a bigger coalition than a bunch of White liberals,\" he said."

But he confessed he still feared that his everyday conversations in public could be used against him to end his career.\n\"We did have a vibe change because the Democrats lost so badly in 2024.
