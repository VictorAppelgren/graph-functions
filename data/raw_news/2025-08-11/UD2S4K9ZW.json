  "content": "Channel Seven\u2019s media company saw a $61m drop in revenue in the year to June as TV advertising slipped, with after-tax profit nearly 20 times smaller than it recorded in 2021.\n\nSeven West Media, which owns the free-to-air Network Seven and The West Australian news group and is chaired by billionaire Kerry Stokes, published its annual earnings report this morning.\n\nBroadcast TV advertising revenue fell in 2024-25 from $995m to $915m annually. The biggest decline came in the second half of 2024 but early 2025 numbers disappointed as well, with the report saying: \u201cthe post-federal election market was weaker than anticipated\u201d.\n\nA $34m increase in ad revenue from 7plus and a $11m cut in labour costs helped offset the decline in TV ad cash, though Seven\u2019s TV division overall saw profitability fall 26%, as measured by earnings before interest and taxes.\n\nSeven West\u2019s newspaper division, led by The West Australian, saw profitability slip 8% on the same measure, with revenue falling from $174m to $169m. A 7% decline in advertising revenue more than offset a 4% pickup in newspaper sales.\n\nThe company\u2019s statutory net profit after tax has fallen each year since its financial year 2021 result of $318m and this year hit $17m \u2013 almost 20 times less than was recorded in 2021.",
