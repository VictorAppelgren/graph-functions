  "content": "A newly-opened garden at a city hospital is offering much-needed respite for critical care staff.\n\nThe calming space, at Peterborough City Hospital, was first proposed during the pandemic by sister Ros Rippon, who recognised the need for an outdoor area where staff could relax from the pressures of frontline care.\n\nIt was funded by the Friends of Peterborough Hospital and was delivered by the North West Anglia Hospitals' Charity, after construction work began earlier this year.\n\nStaff have described it as \"peaceful\" and \"beautiful\".\n\nMs Rippon added: \"We wanted to convert this under-used area into something that would be beneficial for our hard-working staff.\n\n\"We approached the Friends of the Hospital, who were in the process of handing over to the hospital charity, and they agreed that it would be a nice final project so kindly provided the funding - which was really touching.\n\n\"We're absolutely thrilled that it's all come together so well, and are so grateful to everyone involved.\"\n\nPhilip Fearn, charity project manager at North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust (NWAFT), said: \"The garden is beautiful and we're thrilled to have been able to support the creation of a space which will truly enhance the experience of NWAFT staff.\"\n\nSenior staff nurse Mary Portugal said: \"The garden is so calming and peaceful.\n\n\"It's a fantastic place to catch your breath and have a short reprieve from the busy unit.\"\n\n\"Apparently, it's beautiful overnight with the solar lights on and it has been a big hit with the night staff during these warm nights,\" she said.",
