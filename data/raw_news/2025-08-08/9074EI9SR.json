      "text": "Denver Mayor Mike Johnston broke the news to city workers Thursday morning: The city is facing a $50 million deficit in 2025 and will have a $200 million deficit in 2026.\nThe city\u2019s general fund spending will need to be slashed by more than 12 percent \u2014 more than during the pandemic, when it was cut nearly 10 percent.\nThe mayor told employees at an all-city meeting they would face furloughs this year and that a restructuring of the city would be announced in late summer or early fall, as the budgeting process begins.\nEverything, including layoffs, the reduction or elimination of programs and the consolidation of departments, is on the table in 2026, he said. The city will undergo a massive restructuring with an emphasis of making government \u201csmaller, faster and easier.\u201d\nHiring freezes start today. Furloughs begin June 1.\nThe city will move more government services online, cut red tape and rightsize the budget, the mayor said.\nThe city is launching a public outreach campaign for feedback on how the city should cut the budget, identify what services matter and don\u2019t, and how the city can speed up city services and make them cheaper.\nStarting in 2025, the city will institute a tiered furlough system, with employees taking between two to seven unpaid days off. The city will enact a hiring freeze until Sept. 15. Departments will limit discretionary spending, and the city will reduce and restructure contracts.\nJohnston still plans to spend big on homelessness and big projects\nSince taking office, Johnston has spent mightily on both the homelessness and immigration crises. In 2023, the city spent $73 million on both. The following year, Denver spent $86.6 million and in the following year $76.2 million.\nJohnston says he plans to continue spending on homelessness resolution as an investment in downtown and the city.\nAnd despite slashing government, Johnston plans to invest in \u201ccatalytic projects.\u201d\nBig projects will generate revenue, the mayor says. Those big projects include downtown reinvestment, the expansion of the National Western Center, contributing to a stadium for the National Women\u2019s Soccer League team and the debt package he hopes voters support in November.\nThese projects are not funded by the general fund but by a Capital Improvement Fund that can only be spent on infrastructure.\nElected officials and city workers alike have been in the dark about how bad things could get.\nEven as Denver City Council met last week and tried to set priorities for the 2026 budget, they didn\u2019t have budget projections from the mayor\u2019s office.\nMorale is already bad among city employees\nMultiple city workers told Denverite that morale has already tanked. An untold number of employees will lose their jobs as the mayor and his executives decide how to restructure the city government. Unlike in previous administrations, Johnston is not offering them early retirement and has not determined what a severance package might look like.\nCompared to 2018, the city\u2019s budget rate of growth has already declined slightly. In 2020, during the pandemic, spending was cut by nearly 10 percent. Last year it rose by just 1 percent to $1.76 billion.\nAgencies froze vacant positions in recent months. In April, the Department of Finance recommended that those unoccupied jobs disappear from agencies' rosters for the next few years altogether. Meanwhile, the mayor was trying to push through long-awaited raises for a dozen executives \u2014 some up to 44 percent, but that decision has been postponed.\nThe safety department has already slashed year-round mental health care for the police and sheriff departments\u2019 employees. City leaders were asked to cut discretionary spending to balance the 2025 budget.\nHeading into 2026, the cuts will go even deeper. The city will attempt to shore up core services and prioritize what residents actually need from the city: trash collection and public safety. But even those services will be strained.\nHow did Denver get here? Sales tax, Trump and the end of pandemic relief\nThe city has been spending more than it\u2019s bringing in. In previous years when Denver has done so, there has been a cushion of savings. This year, the fund balance has dropped below 10 percent of the budget.\nThe growth of sales tax revenue, a major source of general fund financing, has slowed, as the cost of living has risen. People are buying fewer nice-to-have items. Trade wars, the ebb and flow of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and high interest rates all make for a turbulent economy that has people squirreling away their money.\nConsumer confidence has dropped dramatically since January nationwide and in Colorado, Johnston said, pointing to the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment study.\nMajor construction projects have snarled the city\u2019s downtown economic engine in the Union Station, Central Business District and Capitol Hill neighborhoods. Business is down. Storefronts are empty.\nThe city was expecting 3 percent growth this year, but it has stalled out.\nThose local issues have been compounded by Trump\u2019s ongoing attempts and threats to cancel or claw back millions in federal funding, including $24 million already promised to the city, a move the city is fighting in court.\nTrump has said he will deny money to projects that do not align with his values. Through a flurry of executive orders, he has pledged he will defund projects related to diversity, equity and inclusion as well as state and city protections for unauthorized immigrants.\nDenver has defined itself as a welcoming city to new immigrants for decades, and the value of equity is baked into law \u2014 putting it at odds with federal policy under Trump.\nAcross the U.S., local government leaders have been meeting with their congressional delegations and the White House, demanding their communities get their share of federal funding.\nDenver is also grappling with the end of federal pandemic relief. The city used federal pandemic relief funding to support social service programs without a long-term plan to fund them. Those programs helped slow the bleeding from the city\u2019s housing crisis that started before the pandemic and escalated in 2022. But they did not solve it.\nThe American Rescue Plan Act money was for one-off projects \u2014 not long-term programs. But unlike many other cities, Denver didn\u2019t treat it that way.\nDenver courts have seen a record-high number of eviction cases, even as the city has scrambled to address rampant homelessness.\nLike Denver, cities around the country are trying to understand how the Trump administration\u2019s moves to limit the size of government will affect local economies \u2013 and many are uncertain, making it tough to budget for 2026.\nThese issues are not unique to Denver, said Irma Esparza Diggs, a director of federal advocacy for the National League of Cities.\n\u201cThere is economic uncertainty,\u201d Esparza Diggs said, and that is trickling down to states, cities and consumers."

      "text": "Gay Games XIII 2030\nSite Selection\nThe bidding process to choose a host for the Gay Games XIII 2030 is now in its final phase, with two cities hoping to win the bid\nFinalist Cities\n\u201cGGDen2030 is excited to continue our mission of bringing the Gay Games to Denver in 2030 to unite our global LGBTQ+ communities; Together! Out West!\u201d\nLance Husak, Denver Bid Team\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to move into the Top 3 to host Gay Games 2030. Perth\u2019s bid is from ground up; directly from Perth\u2019s LGBTQIA+ sporting teams. We want the world to share in our dynamic, vibrant and inclusive community.\u201d\nLaurie Butterly, Perth Bid Team\nThe bid process began in January 2024 with 25 cities across five continents expressing an interest in bidding to host the 13th Gay Games event in 2030.\nTen cities then moved to the next stage of the process, by submitting an official letter of intent to bid and payment of the first bid fee. Each of those cities participated in a number of meetings over the next few months in anticipation of this deadline, including informational sessions, Q&A sessions, and individual meetings.\nIn order to proceed to the next phase, each of those ten cities was required to submit a \u201cbid book\u201d - a document which describes how they aim to host the Gay Games in their city. Seven cities submitted their bid books, and were invited to present their bid at the FGG Annual General Assembly in Washington, DC. in October 2024 where the bid teams had their first in-person contact with the FGG stakeholders and member organizations, as well as presenting their Preliminary Bid Books to the assembly.\nIn December 2024 our delegates and members voted for the cities they think are offering the very best proposals, and three cities were chosen as finalists: Auckland, New Zealand; Denver, USA and Perth, Australia. In May 2025, Auckland withdrew from the process, leaving just two cities in the running to become the host of the 2030 Gay Games.\nThe two remaining cities - Denver and Perth - are now tasked with preparing their Detailed Bid Books, describing every facet of how they will host the Games, and will present these to the FGG in June 2025. The final vote will happen in Val\u00e8ncia at the FGG Annual General Assembly 2025, where the host city for Gay Games XIII 2030 will be decided.\nThe FGG is proud to maintain an equitable, supportive, and transparent bidding process which empowers communities to mobilize their stakeholders and unite to participate in the global LGBTQ+ movement as athletes, artists, and allies.\nAustin Manning, Officer of Site Selection\n\u201cWe are thrilled to congratulate Denver and Perth on advancing as finalists on this journey toward selecting the host city for Gay Games XIII in 2030. Each city has worked incredibly hard to present themselves as a potential host, and has firmly stamped their local culture and uniqueness onto their proposals. This milestone is not just about choosing a city; it's about envisioning a future where LGBTQ+ sports and culture, and the values we have in common, shine brighter than ever. We look forward to the next 12 months and working closely with the two teams as they prepare their final bid books for review in October 2025.\u201d\nSite Inspection\nIn July 2025 the FGG will undertake a site inspection tour of the two finalist bid cities - Denver, USA and Perth, Australia - vying to host Gay Games XIII in 2030, to see first hand how the bid teams plan to host the Games in their city.\nThe inspection will take place in July 2025, and take the form of a 4-day visit to each city, hosted by the bid team, and will include a detailed analysis of the bid book,visits to the facilities and sites where the Games will be held and meetings with bid team leadership and community stakeholders.. Each bid team will also help the inspectors understand local context and culture and how it supports their bid proposal.\nThe visit will be undertaken by three site inspectors, hand-selected by the FGG from outside of the Federation, but with a deep understanding of the history of the Games, and with specific sport and culture knowledge. This will allow our site inspectors to prepare a detailed view of the bid from the ground, which will then be shared with the FGG General Assembly.\nOur Site Inspectors\nJulie Williams\nMelbourne, Australia \u00b7 she/her\nJulie has been a dedicated participant in the Gay Games, attending eight consecutive editions since New York in 1994 and winning her first medal at the Guadalajara event in 2023. She has previously undertaken the role of site inspector for the 2022 bid process and served on the board of the FGG in 2017\u20132018, so is ideally suited for this site inspection.\nA passionate advocate for inclusion and equity, Julie has played a key role in numerous local LGBTIQ+ sports and cultural initiatives. She is the Co-founder and Convener of Melbourne Rainbow Golfers, actively promoting community inclusion, equity and access in sport.\nProfessionally, Julie brings extensive experience from a successful career in corporate human resources. She currently works as a consultant and project manager specializing in HR and payroll systems.\nJulie remains deeply committed to the mission of the Gay Games -championing inclusion, health, and participation. She is honored to be part of the site selection team for GGXIII in 2030, helping to shape the future of this global event.\n\u201cI sincerely thank the FGG for providing me with another opportunity to be a site inspector \u2013 this time for GGXIII 2030. I am lucky enough to have been to every Gay Games since New York in 1994. These experiences have been a fantastic way to explore new cities in a safe and inclusive environment, whilst experiencing the local arts, culture, hospitality \u2013 and participating in team and individual sports. I look forward to visiting the finalist cities with the rest of the site inspection team \u2013 and finding our host for GGXIII 2030.\u201d\nRob Smitherman\nChicago, USA \u00b7 he/him\nWith over 25 years of involvement in the Gay Games, Rob brings a deep personal and professional commitment to the movement. His first experience at the 1998 Amsterdam Games - where he competed in basketball - was life-changing, merging his identity and love of sport in a way that brought a profound sense of completeness and belonging.\nSince then, he has participated in every Gay Games, playing basketball in seven editions and competing in tennis at Guadalajara. Beyond competition, Rob has played an integral role in delivering the Games: managing eight sports for the Chicago Games in 2006, producing and overseeing 36 sports in Cologne, and serving as Chief Operating Officer and Assistant Executive Director for Gay Games 9 in Cleveland-Akron. Supporting host cities in creating this transformative event remains one of the most rewarding aspects of his career.\nFollowing Gay Games 9, he continued to support the Federation of Gay Games through service on the Gay Games Steering Committee for Paris, Hong Kong, and Guadalajara\u2014collaborating with FGG and host city leaders, inspecting venues, and supporting event readiness.\nOriginally from Virginia, where he attended college and law school and practiced law for 22 years, Rob now resides in Chicago with his husband. He currently works at Northwestern University, focusing on estate and trust matters related to donor gifts.\n\u201cI am honored and excited to be selected as part of the Site Inspection team for the 2030 Gay Games. I hope that I will be able to use my past experience to fulfill the duties in this essential part of the site selection process.\u201d\nSarah Townsend\nFrance \u00b7 she/her\nSarah is a passionate advocate for inclusion and gender equality in sport, with a long-standing commitment to driving change through research, activism, and leadership. From 2016 to 2024, she served on the board of the European Gay & Lesbian Sport Federation (EGLSF), including a term as Co-President, and was appointed as one of 15 experts to the European Commission\u2019s High-Level Group on Gender Equality in Sport.\nShe currently serves as Vice Chair of the ENGSO Equality Within Sport Committee, is an active member of the Feminist Sports Lab, and leads as President of Activ\u2019Elles - a grassroots organization working to create safe, empowering spaces for women in sport, especially in rural areas. Her advocacy is grounded in lived experience and a strong connection to the outdoors; as a certified hiking guide, rowing coach, and avid ice-water swimmer, Sarah works to break down barriers to access, participation, and equity across all levels of sport.\n\u201cI'm absolutely thrilled to accept the role of Site Inspector for GGXIII 2030. It's a privilege to support the Federation of Gay Games in this important process and to contribute to an initiative that brings the global LGBTQI+ sports community together. I still vividly remember the emotion and sense of belonging I felt at my first Games in Amsterdam, and I\u2019m proud to be part of the movement that ensures others can experience that same feeling. In today\u2019s socio-political climate\u2014where LGBTQI+ rights are increasingly under threat\u2014events like the Gay Games are about so much more than sport. They\u2019re about creating space, offering community, and affirming that sport is a fundamental human right that must remain open and accessible to all.\u201d\nThe site inspectors will be accompanied by two members of the FGG board of directors\nAustin Manning - Officer of Site Inspection\nDuncan Campbell - Officer of Communications\nThe tour will be shared on the FGG social media accounts during the month of July and a summary of findings will be shared during the FGG AGA in October 2025.\nDavid Killian, Co-Chair of the Site Selection Committee\n\u201cThe Gay Games has been an iconic event in the LGBTQ+ community and beyond for the last forty years, and adding these amazing cities to the Gay Games family in order to further our mission to change the world through sport and culture is truly gratifying. We are very excited to work with them to get the best bids possible to showcase their city\u2019s angle on \u201cParticipation, Inclusion, and Personal Best\u201d.\u201d\nProcess\n-\nProspective bidders will receive a document outlining the information they will need to provide in order to enter into the process officially\n-\nBidding cities must provide an official letter of intent by this date\n-\nThe first bid books are expected by this date, outlining how the city plans to host the Games and validating that they understand and have control over the whole process of the Games organisation and delivery\n-\nPotential bidders will be invited to attend an information session and interact with FGG stakeholders and member organizations, including presentation of Preliminary Bid Books and participation in Q&A sessions at the FGG AGA in Washington DC, USA\n-\nHaving now reviewed the preliminary bid books, the FGG will announce who are the finalist cities entering the last part of the Site Selection process\n-\nFinalist cities will now have to deliver a more detailed, compehensive document outlining the organisation of the event down to the smallest details to ensure everything is anticipated\n-\nThe culmination of the process will be the announcement of the presumptive 2030 host in November 2025 in Valencia, Spain\nThe Gay Games sporting and culture event is an opportunity to invite over ten thousand LGBTQ+ participants and allies to one\u2019s region. The week-long event represents a critical cultural and economic opportunity providing significant economic impact to a region.\nThe positive financial impact to the host city of the Gay Games is clear, as evidenced by the official economic impact highlights from the 2018 Gay Games X in Paris:\nTotal economic impact: US $117.9 million.\nLocals and non-locals contributed a total of US $72.7 million to the economy, in the areas of lodging, dining and entertainment, travel and other necessities, and tourism. An additional US $45.8 million was generated in local incomes - roughly the equivalent of 1,429 full-time jobs.\n23% of participants were from France (12% from Paris).\n40% of local participants said they would have traveled outside Paris, France to participate in the Gay Games, taking their spend of US $9.2 million to another region."

      "text": "DENVER \u2014 Colorado Gov. Jared Polis called for a special session of the state legislature and announced a statewide hiring freeze Wednesday to address a $1.2 billion loss of revenue.\nThe special session of the Colorado General Assembly will begin at 10 a.m. on August 21, Polis declared in a news conference Wednesday.\nIn the special session, the governor is asking the state legislature to address the revenue shortfall created by H.R. 1, the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\", passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, and signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025. Because of the tax changes made in the bill, the state is collecting less revenue than lawmakers expected when they approved the budget in May, according to Colorado Democrats.\n- Below is the state's estimated revenue impact, released last week:\nH.R. 1 reduces state revenue by more than $1.2 billion budget shortfall in the current fiscal year, the governor's office said. It's then anticipated to reduce state revenue by $700 million in fiscal year 2027 and fiscal year 2028.\nPolis projects the statewide hiring freeze announced Wednesday would save $3-7 million. It will start August 27 and run through the end of the year.\nBREAKING: Colorado Gov. Jared Polis calls special session, announces statewide hiring freeze to address $1.2 billion budget shortfall #coleg #copolitics @DenverChannel pic.twitter.com/652ZyUD94f\n\u2014 Brandon Richard (@BrandonLRichard) August 6, 2025\n\"That will affect state positions, except for necessary health and safety positions. We're not freezing firefighters, prison guards, 24/7 facilities, but the vast bulk of state positions will be frozen until next calendar year, when hiring will resume,\u201d Polis said.\nThe governor said he chose to call a special session in August because it would give the state 11 months in the remaining budget year to spread out cuts over a longer period of time than if state lawmakers waited for the general session in January.\nPolitics\nColorado faces new $1.2 billion budget shortfall: 'No money to pay our bills'\nColorado House Republicans called the governor's special session \"political theater.\" In a statement, party leadership said it's an \"unnecessary and expensive political stunt.\"\n\u201cInstead of working with us to rein in waste and protect the most vulnerable, the Governor is using this special session to defend a broken system,\" House Caucus Chair Anthony Harstook said in the GOP statement.\nColorado House Speaker Julie McCluskie pushed back on Republicans' claims.\n\"I strongly push back on the sentiment that this is political theater or grandstanding,\" McCluskie said. \"I welcome any member of the minority to demonstrate to me that these numbers aren't real. I believe they are.\"\n- Watch the governor's full press conference in the video player below:\nThis is the third year in a row Polis has called a special session, and the fourth time since he took office in 2019.\nDuring the special session, Polis also asked Colorado lawmakers to preserve Medicaid eligibility to Planned Parenthood services, funding the governor said is now banned by H.R. 1. The governor also wants state lawmakers to review a reduction in health insurance premiums to avoid Coloradans losing coverage and raising rates for others.\nColorado Senate President James Coleman and Joint Budget Committee leadership released the following statement in response to that concern:\n\"Due to H.R. 1 and Congressional Republicans\u2019 refusal to extend enhanced premium tax credits for people who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, premiums for private health insurance are forecast to go up an average of 28 percent with parts of Colorado, especially on the Western Slope, seeing premium increases of 38 percent,\" they said in a statement.\nIn addition to the budget deficit, Polis is asking lawmakers to tackle other issues, including healthcare costs, food security and the state's artificial intelligence law.\nPolis said other issues stemming from the BBB, like Medicaid cuts, would be addressed during future legislative sessions and possibly by future governors."
