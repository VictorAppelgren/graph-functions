  "content": "China has urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia Corp.\u2019s H20 processors, particularly for government-related purposes, complicating the chipmaker\u2019s attempts to recoup billions in lost China revenue as well as the Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented push to turn those sales into a US government windfall. Over the past few weeks, Chinese authorities have sent notices to a range of firms discouraging use of the less-advanced semiconductors, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named discussing sensitive information.

Tom Mackenzie and Minmin Low break down the situation.Source: Bloomberg In addition to Nvidia, Beijing\u2019s overall push affects AI accelerators from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., one of the people said, though it\u2019s unclear whether any letters specifically mentioned AMD\u2019s MI308 chip. Both companies recently secured Washington\u2019s approval to resume lower-end AI chip sales to China, on the controversial and legally questionable condition that they give the US government a 15% cut of the related revenue. Now, Nvidia and AMD face the challenge that their Chinese customers are under Beijing\u2019s pressure not to make those purchases. Some of Beijing\u2019s letters to companies included a series of questions, according to one of the people, such as why they buy Nvidia H20 chips over local alternatives, whether that\u2019s a necessary choice given domestic options, and whether they\u2019ve found any security issues in the Nvidia hardware. The notices coincide with state media reports that cast doubt on the security and reliability of H20 processors. Chinese regulators have raised those concerns directly with Nvidia, which has repeatedly denied that its chips contain such vulnerabilities. Right now, China\u2019s most stringent chip guidance is limited to sensitive applications, a situation that bears similarities to the way Beijing restricted Tesla Inc. vehicles and Apple Inc. iPhones in certain institutions and locations over security concerns. China\u2019s government also at one point barred the use of Micron Technology Inc. chips in critical infrastructure.\n\nStill, it\u2019s possible that Beijing may extend its heavier-handed Nvidia and AMD guidance to a wider range of settings, according to one person with direct knowledge of the deliberations, who said that those conversations are in early stages. AMD declined to comment, while Nvidia said in a statement that \u201cthe H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure.\u201d China has ample supplies of domestic chips, Nvidia said, and \u201cwon\u2019t and never has relied on American chips for government operations.\u201d China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to faxed requests for comment on this story, which is based on interviews with more than a half-dozen people familiar with Beijing\u2019s policy discussions. The White House did not respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours. The Chinese government\u2019s posture could make it more difficult for Nvidia and AMD to sell their hardware into the world\u2019s largest market for semiconductors. It also raises questions about the Trump administration\u2019s explanation for why the US is allowing those exports mere months after effectively banning such sales. Multiple senior US officials have said their policy reversal was part of a trade accord with China, but Beijing has publicly indicated that the resumed H20 shipments were not part of any bilateral deal. China\u2019s recent notices to companies suggest that the Asian country may not have desired such a concession from Washington in the first place. Beijing\u2019s concerns are twofold. For starters, Chinese officials are worried that Nvidia chips could have location-tracking and remote shutdown capabilities \u2014 a suggestion that Nvidia has vehemently denied. Still, Trump officials are actively exploring whether location-tracking could be used to help curtail suspected smuggling of restricted components into China, and lawmakers have introduced a bill that would require location verification for advanced AI chips. Second, Beijing is intensely focused on developing its domestic chip capabilities, and wants Chinese companies to shift away from Western chips in favor of local offerings. Officials have previously urged Chinese firms to choose domestic semiconductors over Nvidia H20 processors, Bloomberg reported last September, and have introduced energy efficiency standards that the H20 chip does not meet. But Beijing has stopped short of outright banning the hardware, which Nvidia designed specifically for Chinese customers to abide by years of US curbs on sales of advanced chips to the Asian country. The H20 chip has less computational power than Nvidia\u2019s top offerings, but its strong memory bandwidth is quite well suited to the inference stage of AI development, when models recognize patterns and draw conclusions. That\u2019s made it a desirable product to companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in China, where domestic chip champion Huawei Technologies Co. is struggling to produce enough advanced components to meet market demand. By one estimate from Biden officials \u2014 who considered but did not implement controls on H20 sales \u2014 losing access to that Nvidia chip would make it three to six times more expensive for Chinese companies to run inference on advanced AI models. \u201cBeijing appears to be using regulatory uncertainty to create a captive market sufficiently sized to absorb Huawei\u2019s supply, while still allowing purchases of H20s to meet actual demands,\u201d said Lennart Heim, an AI-focused researcher at RAND, of China\u2019s push for companies to avoid American AI chips. \u201cThis signals that domestic alternatives remain inadequate even as China pressures foreign suppliers.\u201d President Donald Trump on Monday called the H20 chip \u201cobsolete,\u201d saying that China \u201calready has it in a different form.\u201d That echoed previous statements by officials in his administration, who defended the decision to resume H20 exports on the grounds that Huawei already offers comparable chips to the H20. The US should keep the Chinese AI ecosystem reliant on less-advanced American technology for as long as possible, these officials argue, in order to deprive Huawei of the revenue and know-how that would come from a broader customer base. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials have also claimed that the H20 move was part of a deal to improve American access to Chinese rare-earth minerals \u2014 despite the Trump team\u2019s previous assertions that such an arrangement was not on the table. \u201cAs the Chinese deliver their magnets, then the H20s will come off,\u201d Lutnick said last month. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in late July that the magnet issue had been \u201csolved.\u201d The first Nvidia H20 and AMD MI308 licenses arrived a bit over a week after Bessent\u2019s declaration \u2014 after Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang met with the president and both companies agreed to share their China revenue with the US government.\n\u2022 Why It\u2019s Actually a Good Time to Buy a House, According to a Zillow Economist\n\u2022 The Social Media Trend Machine Is Spitting Out Weirder and Weirder Results\n\u2022 Klarna Cashed In on \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later.\u2019 Now It Wants to Be a Bank\n\u2022 The Game Starts at 8.
