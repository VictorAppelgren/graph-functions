  "title": "NRW Holdings (ASX:NWH) Is Increasing Its Dividend To A$0.095",
  "description": "NRW Holdings Limited ( ASX:NWH ) has announced that it will be increasing its periodic dividend on the 8th of October...",
  "content": "NRW Holdings Limited (ASX:NWH) has announced that it will be increasing its periodic dividend on the 8th of October to A$0.095, which will be 5.6% higher than last year's comparable payment amount of A$0.09. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 4.3%.\n\nWhile the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that NRW Holdings' stock price has increased by 36% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nNRW Holdings' Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions\n\nSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Based on the last payment, the dividend made up 75% of cash flows, but a higher proportion of net income. The company could be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but this could indicate that growth opportunities are few and far between.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 54% which is fairly sustainable.\n\nIt's comforting to see that NRW Holdings has been paying a dividend for a number of years now, however it has been cut at least once in that time. Due to this, we are a little bit cautious about the dividend consistency over a full economic cycle. Since 2018, the dividend has gone from A$0.04 total annually to A$0.165. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 22% over that duration. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. NRW Holdings' earnings per share has shrunk at 20% a year over the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this becomes a long term trend.",

  "argos_summary": "NRW Holdings Limited announced it will raise its periodic dividend to A$0.095 on 8 October, a 5.6% increase over last year and giving a yield of about 4.3%, roughly the industry average. The company\u2019s share price has risen 36% over the past three months, which has helped keep the yield near the market average despite the higher dividend. While the dividend has grown at roughly 22% annually since 2018, it has also been volatile and has been cut at least once, raising caution about its sustainability; earnings per share have fallen 20% per year over the last five years but are forecast to rebound, potentially supporting a 54% payout ratio.
