  "title": "\u2018Strong Need\u2019 for Life Sciences Investing: Portal Innovations CEO",
  "description": "Venture firm Portal Innovations is raising a $100 million life sciences fund and helping universities launch startup incubators, as institutions pursue alternatives to federal research funding. Portal Innovations CEO John Flavin speaks with Romaine Bostick and Vonnie Quinn on \"The Close.\" (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "You've already had two fundraisers, kind of in the same ballpark in terms of dollar value. Talk about the appetite right now for a third fund raise, particularly given that this is coming at a time where so many people are looking at the university pipeline and more importantly, the federal funding pipeline and are a little bit concerned as to whether there's going to be anything to fill the potential void. Well, I think people see the need. What's happening right now is, you know, through all the noise and change, there's really something deeper going on right now. And that is, you know, bringing a drug to market, bringing a device to market. Building a biotechnology company is going to look a lot different in the next decade, the next 20 years than it has for the last 50 years with new tools, new concepts, great innovation coming out of our universities, but converged with not just chemistry and biology, but air and quantum and batteries for medtech applications. So we're seeing, you know, very strong need by an increased number of universities that want to increasingly look to the outside earlier in the process to begin to form companies, move that downstream and increase the chance that the translation of the idea at the professor's lab on campus can be translated into a company that ultimately helps patients at the end of the process. One of those partnerships is with the University of Chicago. You're based in Chicago, although you have operations in other cities as well. Talk about that relationship and what the goal of that relationship between Portal and the University of Chicago. Yeah, the University of Chicago has as recently opened Hyde Park Lab. So it's a beautiful new facility in downtown Hyde Park on 53rd Street. It's part of a long term strategy that began a decade ago to attract and retain high powered faculty that are interested in not just doing great science and publishing that work in science and nature, but they want impact. And impact for them means they want to start a company around their idea and they want to treat a patient. So the partnership we have with them is providing our laboratory capabilities, and it will not only be life sciences but quantum and battery at the same time. And I it allows that first step out of the university toward the marketplace that you can make a lot of mistakes in that first year of life. And so Portal is there to really bring the market perspective in early. And by doing that, you can improve, you know, the regulatory plan, the application of this new drug and think through what it's going to need to look like after many years of development. And so that partnership will allow us to retain those faculty in our ecosystem and allow them to continue to repeat their innovation. Now, you started five years ago, so you're not just in Chicago, you're also Atlanta, Houston, Boston, but outside the traditional life sciences area in Boston. I'm curious, has the focus of any of the companies that are in your geographies shifted at all since the elevation of Robert Kennedy, for example, or since the Trump administration came to power? Well, if you think about the aspirational comments that have been made by Dr. McCaffrey, they're very favorable to the biotech and pharma industry. I mean, his ambitions are to improve the throughput, you know, shorten the timetable it requires to get through FDA clinical studies, imagining new types of protocols that might accelerate the drug approval process. So on the one hand, it's encouraging and that's the long view that Portal Innovations has As we think about the opportunity to invest, now's the time to invest because things will stabilize over time. Ambitions will be met in some form. And the thing is, is that, you know, diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, they don't know the difference between blue and red. I mean, they innovators on the front end are looking at cure patients on the back end. That isn't going to change. Well, that's optimistic now that there's 112 companies across your campuses. But you've invested in, what, 26? What are the what's the bar that those companies have to meet for you to actually invest? Well, they have to have really solid intellectual property. So the patent needs to be defensible. They have to be working on science that we think is commercialize evolved. It's an application that has some value in the marketplace. And remember, not all science is designed to be commercialized. Basic science is really important as well. In fact, you know, if reading a stat earlier in the week, NIH funding historically, if you look at the last decade of the 300 or so drugs that were approved by the FDA, about 1.4 or 5 billion goes into a successful drug by NIH and about 2.2 goes in by industry. So basic science is really important at the front end of that process. But if you look at the profile of companies we're looking for, it's breakthrough science, big market opportunities, rare disease opportunities, where smaller markets, where new business models can be imagined to improve the treatment of patients that have rare genetic diseases. Thanks to new technologies like CRISPR and gene editing that are already having an impact on patients. You bring up CRISPR and gene editing. I mean, how do you square that, though, with some of the pullback we've seen by the U.S. government, for example, the recent edict by RFK Jr about. RNA vaccines are basically suspending the council that would oversee that in a marinade. Technology, as you know, goes way beyond COVID, has really the potential to treat cancers and a lot of other deadly diseases. And I am just curious as to how you kind of square that circle. It's difficult in the short term. We know and you know, our are a rock solid in our belief that, you know, the science that brought us RNA and platforms like CRISPR and, you know, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, all breakthrough medications that are having profound effects on patients are required and so confusing. Yeah, but I think we're trying to take a longer term view that confusion in the short term does not mean that innovation can't break through. And we want to be there on the back end to support these innovators. So just to be clear, over the last few years, we've seen remarkable advancements, the speed of which we got a COVID vaccine out, a treatment for sickle cell anemia, something I never thought I would see in my lifetime. Several other things. Do you think as you look forward over the next five, ten, 20 years, we're going to see those types of advancements and maybe even something even greater? There's no question in my mind. I think I think the only thing that will be interesting to see is where will all that innovation occur? It may not be as concentrated in in the U.S. as it has been in the past. Right. But that doesn't mean there's not an opportunity to cure patients worldwide. So when I look at some of the companies forming at University of Chicago, for example, they're applying quantum and quantum sensing to biotech. We're still trying to figure out what that even means. I'm not a scientist, but the reality is, just like A.I. has had a transformative effect on our society. The same will happen with Quantum, a new battery technology. So I have no I have no doubt that we'll be able to see transformative breakthroughs even beyond what we've seen so far.",

  "summary": "Portal Innovations CEO, Dr. McCaffrey, discusses the need for more funding for life sciences research in the industry, stating that there is a strong need for universities that are looking to the outside earlier in the process to form companies that can translate ideas into companies that ultimately help patients. The company has partnerships with the University of Chicago, providing laboratory capabilities for both life sciences and quantum and battery applications. The CEO believes this partnership will allow them to retain high-powered faculty who are interested in creating companies around their ideas and ultimately treat patients. He also notes that the focus of companies in these geographies has changed since the elevation of Robert Kennedy or since the Trump administration came into power. The bar for these investments is the patentability of patentable science and the commercialization of commercialized science. Basic science is important at the front end of the commercialized process, not all science is designed to be designed for science.",
