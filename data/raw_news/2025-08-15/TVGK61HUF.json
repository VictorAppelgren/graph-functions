  "description": "Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself\u201d reaches 500 weeks on the Rap Digital Song Sales chart, a first for the superstar \u2014 but it's never reached No. 1.",
  "content": "Eminem\u2019s catalog includes more hit songs than almost any two other rap superstars combined. He\u2019s been around for so long that he\u2019s released multiple compilations of smashes, and he regularly adds to his list of winners whenever he has new music to share.\n\nAmong one of the most impressive discographies of all time, one track stands out as particularly meaningful for Eminem: \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d It is one of his top-performing cuts, and one of the most successful rap songs of all time.\n\nThis week, \u201cLose Yourself\u201d dips slightly on the Rap Digital Song Sales chart, as the cut falls from No. 6 to No. 8 on Billboard\u2019s list, which details the bestselling tunes in the rap genre throughout the U.S. As the Eminem cut declines slightly, it reaches 500 weeks on the tally.\n\nEminem makes it to 500 weeks on the Rap Digital Song Sales chart with one smash for the first time. It\u2019s incredibly uncommon for any tune to live on any Billboard tally for 500 frames, and while \u201cLose Yourself\u201d is not the first to do so, it is one of the only hip-hop smashes to come even close to that milestone.\n\nFor the generation-defining composition to manage such a showing on a sales list, instead of a streaming roster, shows a certain kind of dedication among casual listeners and longtime lovers of all things Eminem.\n\n\u201cTill I Collapse,\u201d \u201cNot Afraid\u201d and \u201cLove the Way You Lie\u201d\n\nOnly four of Eminem\u2019s singles have racked up triple-digit-week stays on the Rap Digital Song Sales chart. \u201cTill I Collapse,\u201d his collaboration with Nate Dogg, serves as his second-longest-running win, with 184 weeks on the tally. Coming behind that cut are \u201cNot Afraid\u201d with 125 turns and \u201cLove the Way You Lie\u201d with Rihanna, which has thus far managed 112 frames on the list \u2013 12 of which have been at No. 1.\n\nEminem\u2019s Smash Has Never Reached No. 1\n\nAmazingly, despite the fact that \u201cLose Yourself\u201d has now lived on the Rap Digital Song Sales chart for 500 weeks, it has never reached No. 1. The tune debuted in January 2010 and peaked at No. 2 in February 2020. It is one of nine cuts by Eminem to miss out on the throne by a single space \u2014 a roundup that also includes \u201cThose Kinda Nights\u201d with Ed Sheeran, \u201cHomicide\u201d with Logic, and \u201cVenom,\u201d among others.",
