  "title": "Tennis outfits make the U.S. Open a fashion spectacle. For players, it\u2019s also a business",
  "description": "Tennis and fashion are more intertwined than ever before, with players' outfits offering a crucial on-ramp for casual fans.",
  "content": "FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 Naomi Osaka walked on to Louis Armstrong Stadium and sparkled under the lights, with red roses on a hairpiece and a red jacket and dress studded with crystals. The four-time Grand Slam champion\u2019s night-session outfit for the 2025 U.S. Open sent out a spectacular fashion statement, and its design, conception and production were years in the making.\n\n\u201cIt was really elaborate, because the crystals are really hard to do on a performance outfit,\u201d she said after her first-round win over Greet Minnen, which debuted the look.\n\nTwo days later, Osaka wore her day outfit, bright purple and also covered in crystals. As in the night session, she paired it with a crystal-encrusted Labubu doll, the wearable plush toy with a devilish grin that has become a fashion accessory for athletes and pop culture figures across the world.\n\nThe night before Osaka\u2019s walk-on, 2006 U.S. Open champion Maria Sharapova appeared on Arthur Ashe Stadium wearing an updated version of the black, Audrey Hepburn-inspired dress \u2014 also sewn in with crystals \u2014 that she wore en route to the title 19 years ago. The tournament honored Sharapova with a special ring to mark her induction into the Tennis Hall of Fame, and if the sport had a fashion equivalent, she would be first ballot.\n\nSharapova, along with the Williams sisters, was at the vanguard of turning the relationship between fashion and tennis into a dialogue. Players have long been synonymous with certain kits, from Bj\u00f6rn Borg\u2019s Fila outfit and Serena Williams\u2018 catsuit to Roger Federer\u2019s monogrammed blazers, and luxury brands have coveted its biggest stars as ambassadors, but the business of tennis and the business of fashion and beauty have never been as indivisible as they are now.\n\nNot only are more stars signing more deals \u2014 Carlos Alcaraz with Louis Vuitton, Jannik Sinner with Gucci, Zheng Qinwen with Dior and Coco Gauff with Miu Miu via New Balance \u2014 but the interest in and economics of fashion have cascaded down the tours, bringing more exposure but also more complexity to a cocktail of financial oneupmanship, competing star power and exclusivity.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re definitely at a moment where athletes are expressing their individuality through fashion,\u201d said Joe Kudla, the founder and chief executive of Southern California athleisure brand Vuori, in a video interview last week.\n\nKudla says this from first-hand experience, having just signed Jack Draper, Britain\u2019s world No. 5, after his Nike contract expired mid-season because of a renewal knock-on caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Such a marketable player leaving one of the sport\u2019s behemoths for an up-and-coming brand from California is a symptom of that cascade, and of the relationship between sporting competition and marketing potential.\n\nTwo sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships in tennis said that Draper\u2019s headline sponsorship is worth around $5 million per year. Neither Vuori nor Draper\u2019s representatives commented on specifics. Nike pays top dollar to its biggest names, but its payment structure can be based on performance, both in terms of results and reliability. Women\u2019s world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and men\u2019s No. 1 and No. 2 Sinner and Alcaraz \u2014 the sporting duopoly that Draper will have to crack to win tennis\u2019 biggest prizes \u2014 are among its prized assets.\n\nNike did not comment on their contracts, but a spokesperson said via email that it is \u201csupporting the game at every level and partnering with some of the most iconic and talented players in the world\u201d. The latter creates a density of interest in tennis and fashion \u2014 and a lot of sales power in replica outfits. It also creates a competitive environment that mirrors that of the tennis tours, in which up-and-coming stars can run into a sponsorship ceiling as well as a sporting one.\n\nSome of those players, like Draper, would rather be the big fish in a smaller pond. Ben Shelton, who along with Iga \u015awi\u0105tek and Jo\u0101o Fonseca, is signed up with the Federer-backed Swiss company On, said during an interview last year: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be one of 50 Nike guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill I be in advertising campaigns? Will I be on billboards? That\u2019s a big consideration for players,\u201d said one player representative, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships.\n\n\u201cAnd for a lot of them, the clothing deals are by far the most important of all their sponsorships.\u201d\n\nFrances Tiafoe, who moved to athletic apparel brand Lululemon when his Nike contract expired in January, had a similar motivation to Shelton: \u201cObviously I\u2019d been with Nike for a lot of years,\u201d he said in a news conference last week. \u201cI wanted to go to the market to see what it was like. There\u2019s a lot of interest for me in the market, and more than Nike did. Obviously, I had opportunities to be the face of a brand, which was a different mindset.\n\n\u201cI can build, and they can grow, and they can brand me. They are at their best at the highest level. Why not be the guy instead of one of them?\n\nHe added with a smile: \u201cThere are a couple decent guys, a couple decent athletes, that are over at Nike.\u201d\n\nDraper also wanted to be the guy with Vuori, saying in a news conference ahead of the U.S. Open that he was \u201cblown away with the fact that they want me as kind of the face.\n\n\u201cTo feel I\u2019m not playing someone with the same kit is a bit of a different feeling sometimes.\u201d\n\nThis is a common bugbear of fans and players, and another element of tennis fashion in which Sharapova was ahead of the curve. After doing so in a match at Wimbledon in the mid-2000s she spoke to Nike executives about it. \u201cThere was like, a conscious part of me that said, \u2018Oh, if I do well and become a champion, I would love for that to never happen again,\u2019\u201d she told the New York Times last week.\n\nThe contrast in stature was evident when she won her first title in 2004. Sharapova took to the court in a white Nike outfit in the final; Serena Williams wore a custom, gold-accented dress by the same brand. But as the proliferation of sponsorships further down both tours, as the business of tennis grows ever richer and deeper, more and more matches across tournaments feature players taking to the court in identical kits with no identifying attributes.\n\nGauff joked on Thursday that when she was a kid visiting tennis events, \u201cit was kind of looking like a cheerleading squad, everybody in one kit. Now I can see that they\u2019re pushing more for that unique ability and (to) really capitalize off of that.\u201d\n\nFor those players who are with Nike, getting to the point where you have a custom-made kit is a badge of honour. Sabalenka has graduated to that stage and said that she had some input into her U.S. Open kit.\n\nGauff is the highest-profile tennis player not with Nike \u2014 aside from Lacoste\u2019s Novak Djokovic, who like Federer, set the trend in the 2010s by switching to high-street retailer Uniqlo. Djokovic generated his own stir on the opening night of this year\u2019s U.S. Open, with an all-black \u2018Darth Novak\u2019 outfit. It drew comparisons with Federer\u2019s monochrome New York kit from the 2007 tournament; Djokovic has worn all-black before in his career.\n\nGauff signed with New Balance when she was 14, and has since expanded her fashion footprint. Her custom-made leather jackets have been a hit since this year\u2019s French Open, and her Miu Miu range is one of the most visible on-court luxury brand crossovers.\n\nAmerica\u2019s male No. 1, Taylor Fritz, who wears Hugo Boss, said in a news conference after reaching the U.S. Open second round that: \u201cI feel like every brand wants to do a tennis line, even brands that don\u2019t necessarily sponsor tennis players \u2014 it\u2019s just kind of become a popular thing, like the athleisure and sporty clothes in general.\u201d\n\nFritz, who has modelled for Herm\u00e8s at New York Fashion Week, added a couple of days earlier that: \u201cIn the future I\u2019d love to do stuff like that again and walk in shows and stuff. It\u2019s drawn me in. I just think that it\u2019s something fun to do that I think suits me well, and it\u2019s just different from what I normally do.\u201d\n\nThe powers at the top of tennis are now making moves to capitalize on this interest. The ATP last week announced a collaboration with menswear label Palmes \u2014 the first for the tour with a non-tennis fashion apparel brand \u2014 and ahead of the U.S. Open set up styling suites with stylist Mobolaji Dawodu and photoshoots for five of its top-30 players (Frances Tiafoe, Flavio Cobolli, Alex de Minaur, Andrey Rublev and Holger Rune) as reported by Vogue.\n\nThe players were given outfits to wear for their pre-U.S. Open appearances from luxury brands like Ralph Lauren, Ferragamo and Issey Miyake, as well as Amiri, O\ufb03cine G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Stone Island.\n\nThis is all part of a dedicated promotional strategy, explained the ATP\u2019s SVP of marketing Andrew Walker. \u201cFashion is a big interest for a lot of our younger casual tennis fans,\u201d he said in a phone interview Friday. \u201cSo we thought it made a ton of sense to try to lean into that in different ways that could draw a deeper connection between those kind of like-minded interests and at the same time support our players\u2019 businesses and brands. Strengthening their personal brands through a connection to fashion.\u201d\n\nThe ATP did not disclose how much its first round of investment into fashion cost, but Walker confirmed that the budget will be quadrupled next year. One aim is to develop an equivalent of the NBA tunnel walk, which has become a platform for players to express themselves through their fashion choices in their sport\u2019s immediate environment but off the field of play or court.\n\nThe sociocultural breadth that fashion can bring to tennis also has an indirect impact on the sport\u2019s on-court fortunes: It offers an on-ramp for casual fans, which can be made easy to access through social media and other promotion. This is true of the players\u2019 outfits and brand sponsorships, but also of the more diffuse connection between tennis and fashion which manifests in trends like tenniscore and the growth in cultural cachet of the sport around crossover moments like the film \u201cChallengers.\u201d\n\nPlayers have also forged their own paths when it comes to fashion. Federer and Andy Murray invested in their own clothing vehicles, On and Castore respectively, while at this year\u2019s U.S. Open Taylor Townsend is designing her own kit. In Townsend\u2019s case, the TT apparel brand that she\u2019s trying to launch and is wearing at the U.S. Open came after eight years without a sponsor.\n\nTownsend\u2019s flame-print outfits caught eyes on her run to the fourth round, and her hope is to partner with a big apparel company that can bring it to retail, helping with manufacturing and distribution.\n\n\u201cTennis is a unique sport in the sense the product you\u2019re in for performance has more versatility into your everyday life. Tees and shorts and dresses and skirts, these are products that, that can be worn almost in the gym and out into your everyday life more so than like say a football kit or baseball or basketball uniforms,\u201d said Kudla, whose Vuori brand also sponsors Marcos Giron, the world No. 55 and Southern California native.\n\n\u201cI think we obviously have our core of tennis fans, but I think fashion helps bring just casual fans to the sport, a new demographic,\u201d Gauff said in a news conference last week.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t always need the core fans who know every single player. You look at NBA games, there\u2019s so many people who go who don\u2019t really know anything about basketball, other than players. And like for tennis, I think at U.S. Open we get that demographic of people, but I think more on a tour level, I would love to see that.\u201d\n\nShe confirmed that she plans to do more tie-ups with Miu Miu, the last of which was at the Cincinnati Open. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been done too much to have a collaborative kit in tennis,\u201d Gauff added. \u201cTo be one of the first is really cool. I hope more brands get involved with the sport.\u201d\n\nPlayers also genuinely believe that dressing the way they want can enhance performance. The immortal maxim from Deion Sanders, the only person to appear in both a Super Bowl and a World Series, goes thus: \u201cIf you look good, you feel good. If you feel good, you play good. If you play good, they pay good.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s like extra motivation. When I have a great kit, I want to do better to get the photos that I want,\u201d Gauff said.\n\n\u201cEspecially as a woman, I feel like when you feel good, and the fit is right, you feel really confident on the court and you\u2019re not thinking about anything else but your game and things like that. Also, I think it just brings more fans to the sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, man,\u201d Tiafoe said of the link between looking good and performance. \u201cYou look good, you feel good, you play good. It\u2019s really that simple, for sure. Hence why I\u2019m wearing a hat and need a haircut, man.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of part of it,\u201d said Jessica Pegula, the American world No. 4 and one of the Adidas athletes this year wearing Y3, a collaboration with Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re entertaining at the end of the day and you want to look good and feel good and showcase your personality.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I put on the outfit, it\u2019s almost like a super suit, so I try to channel that,\u201d Osaka said of her eye-catching outfits at last year\u2019s U.S. Open.\n\nSports psychologist Marc Sagal, who has worked with tennis players, said via text message: \u201cThere\u2019s actually some decent evidence for the \u2018feel good, play good\u2019 effect. The term is \u2018enclothed cognition\u2019 and it refers to the idea that what we wear can change how people and athletes think and perform.\n\n\u201cFor tennis players, the right outfit can boost confidence and in a way help signal that it\u2019s time to go into competitive mode. Tennis margins can be so thin that I believe they frequently get decided as much by psychology as physical skill or talent.\u201d\n\nSagal added that the placebo effect plays a role, but added that \u201cin tennis, confidence and focus are real things and when a player feels good about how they look, that psychological edge can be the difference maker.\u201d\n\nOsaka and Draper, the fashion headliners of this U.S. Open, have experienced contrasting on-court fortunes in New York, just days before the city\u2019s Fashion Week. Osaka is into her first Grand Slam second week since 2021, while Draper, who came into the tournament carrying a left-arm injury, withdrew from his second-round match after making it through the opener.\n\nWhen Osaka walks onto Arthur Ashe Stadium to face Gauff in a blockbuster match Monday afternoon, the eyes of the world will be on one of two of the biggest stars in tennis \u2014 and on their outfits.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a jersey, we don\u2019t have a uniform. I think the possibilities on court are kind of endless,\u201d Gauff said.",

  "summary": "The business of tennis and fashion and beauty has become more prominent in the sport, with stars such as Naomi Osaka, Maria Sharapova, and Carlos Alcaraz all signing multi-million dollar deals for their performances at the 2025 U.S. Open. The fashion and fashion industries have become more intertwined as they merge into each other. The rise in fashion and tennis has led to more stars signing more lucrative deals, bringing more exposure but also more complexity due to financial oneupmanship, star power, and exclusivity. Joe Kudla, founder and CEO of Southern California athleisure brand Vuori, recently signed world No. 5 Jack Draper, whose Nike contract expired mid-season due to a renewal issue caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, reflects this shift in the marketability of the sport. However, some players, like those signed with the Swiss company Ono Fonseca, may not want to be seen as big fish in the big fish pond.",

      "text": "INDIAN WELLS, Calif. \u2014 A decade on, it\u2019s not the tension they remember most. It\u2019s not the fear that after 14 years of anger and hurt, after all the attempts at rapprochement between the BNP Paribas Open tournament organizers and Serena Williams that never seemed to go anywhere, that one person among the 16,000 in the main stadium of the Indian Wells Tennis Garden might wreck it all once again.\nAdvertisement\nThey don\u2019t remember the tension because they tried to ignore the possibility. Maybe if they thought only about the opposite, they could manifest it.\n\u201cJust a lot of anticipating how she would be received,\u201d said Andrew Krasny, the tennis host, producer and close friend of Williams, who was in charge of announcing her return to that stadium after a 14-year boycott.\n\u201cI knew she would be received warmly and wonderfully and beautifully, but I knew that some people thought maybe it would be weird.\u201d\nThey might, but tennis desperately needed it not to be. The sport needed one of its ugliest stories, one that started in 2001 in the same stadium where Williams and the organizers hoped it might end, to have an ending that was far different than the beginning.\nA generation ago, Black stars were not woven into the fabric of the sport the way they are today; the greatest of them all wasn\u2019t the greatest ever. Things are a little different now.\nThis is the era of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, of Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka. It\u2019s also the era of Coco Gauff \u2014 the highest paid female athlete \u2014 and of Naomi Osaka and Ben Shelton and Frances Tiafoe and Madison Keys and Gael Monfils and Arthur Fils. Not that long ago, none of them would have been allowed to play in America\u2019s top tournaments or at its rarefied country clubs, and even when they were allowed, plenty ofpeople still didn\u2019t want them to. It\u2019s not a stretch to think some people like that are still out there today.\nAlthea Gibson and Arthur Ashe were the pioneers who opened doors in the 1950s and 1960s, winning Grand Slam titles and breaking the color line at home and abroad. Serena and her sister Venus blasted those doors open as teenagers in the late 1990s.\nAccording to Roxanne Aaron, the president of the American Tennis Association (the oldest African American sports organization in the United States), Ashe\u2019s and Gibson\u2019s routes to opportunity had required conforming to the expectations of the tennis establishment. Their work meant the Williams sisters could enter on their own terms.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThey came out there with the braids, wearing bright colors and all kinds of stuff,\u201d Aaron said of the sisters in an interview last year. \u201cThey acted like they were revolutionizing tennis, like they were revolutionaries.\u201d\nNot everyone was thrilled about that. Resentment came out in unsubtle ways. Criticism that they were too brash, that their beaded and braided hair somehow wasn\u2019t proper in a sport of blonde ponytails.\nAnd then there were the conspiracy theories. The whispers that whenever the sisters played one another, their father and coach, Richard, ordained who would win. That chorus reached its apotheosis in the final days of the 2001 BNP Paribas Open.\nFirst came the semifinal, in which Venus and Serena were pitted against one another. Twenty minutes before the match, Venus pulled out, citing a knee injury. A chorus of boos erupted from the crowd. They erupted again on the day of the final as Serena took the court against Kim Clijsters.\nWilliams\u2019 management team at IMG declined to be interviewed for this story, but in her 2009 autobiography, \u201cOn the Line,\u201d Williams described what unfolded from her vantage point.\n\u201cIt was like the whole crowd got together and decided to boo all at once. The ugliness was just raining down on me, hard.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. Nothing like this had ever happened to me. What was most surprising about this uproar was the fact tennis fans are typically a well-mannered bunch,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cThey\u2019re respectful. They sit still. And in Palm Springs, especially, they tended to be pretty well-heeled, too.\n\u201cBut I looked up and all I could see was a sea of rich people \u2014 mostly older, mostly white \u2014 standing and booing lustily, like some kind of genteel lynch mob.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to use such inflammatory language to describe the scene, but that\u2019s really how it seemed from where I was down on the court. Like these people were gonna come looking for me after the match.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThen, just before the start of play, Venus and her father entered the stadium and walked to the player\u2019s box beside the court. The boos rained down once more. Richard told USA Today that he heard people in the crowd use the N-word, too. He raised his fist to the crowd in a Black Power salute. And then he watched as his daughter won the match 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 and then vowed never to return.\nIn the first years of the boycott, the organizers of Indian Wells gave the Williams sisters space. As years passed, they began to reach out to representatives of the sisters and the family to see if a detente might be possible, according to people who served as intermediaries in those discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about them.\nA spokesperson for the BNP Paribas Open declined to comment or to make its leaders available. They include Raymond Moore, the former player and longtime chief executive of the tournament, who still works as a consultant to Larry Ellison, the billionaire founder of Oracle Corp., the software company, who purchased the event in 2009. The tournament\u2019s view is that this is Serena Williams\u2019 story to tell; it is not a story that it, or American tennis in general, likes to talk about. It doesn\u2019t line up with the story that the sport likes to tell itself about itself \u2014 especially in America \u2014which is a story of an ever-upward climb toward increased access and acceptance of people of color everywhere that tennis is played.\nBefore this year\u2019s edition, the tournament marked the occasion of Williams\u2019 return to its courts with posts on X and Instagram that did not explain the reason for what the posts called a \u201c14-year absence.\u201d\nShe always comes out on top \ud83d\udc51\nIn 2015, @serenawilliams returned to Indian Wells after a 14-year absence and received a standing ovation \ud83d\udc4f#TennisParadise pic.twitter.com/9AQAOP32yu\n\u2014 BNP Paribas Open (@BNPPARIBASOPEN) February 10, 2025\nThe first glimmer of hope that the Williams sisters might one day return to the biggest tournament in their home state \u2014 and the \u201cfifth Slam\u201d in the eyes of many in the sport \u2014 came at the end of 2009, when Ellison took over.\nEllison\u2019s purchase ended an era of financial uncertainty for the event. It had had a series of owners over the years, including IMG, Moore, and other former player investors, including Charlie Pasarell, Billie Jean King and Pete Sampras. It did not end the Williams family\u2019s boycott.\nUnder Ellison, tournament organizers reached out to people in contact with the family each year to see if there might be a chance for a return. Each year they were told absolutely not.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2014, Stacey Allaster, then-chairman of the WTA Tour (which declined to comment on this story), received a call from Moore. Moore, a former owner, told Allaster that Ellison, the new one, desperately wanted the Williams sisters to return. He especially wanted Serena, who was far and away the best player in the world by then. Was there anything she could do?\nAllaster had known the Williams sisters since they were teenagers. They\u2019d often played the Canadian Open when she was running it. Allaster told Moore she would try to get Jill Smoller, who represented Williams at IMG, to come to a meeting with him, her and Ellison.\nBy the time of that meeting, Allaster had given the Williams family a signal of intent. She had pushed for Shamil Tarpischev, the president of the Russian Tennis Federation, to be punished after he referred to the sisters as \u201cthe Williams brothers.\u201d Tarpischev was fined $25,000 and suspended for a year.\nDuring the meeting, which took place in Moore\u2019s office, Ellison conveyed how much he wanted the Williams sisters to come back. He pledged to do whatever he could to make that happen. Eventually, Serena Williams got on the phone with Ellison and let him make his case personally.\nNearly a decade and a half had passed since that ugly day in 2001. Most professional tennis careers don\u2019t last that long. In that time, Williams had read the autobiography of her hero, Nelson Mandela, \u201cLong Walk to Freedom.\u201d Mandela had died the previous year. Like everyone else, she had marvelled at the magnanimity Mandela showed when he emerged from prison after 27 years.\nAt the conclusion of the 2015 Australian Open, which she won, Williams wrote an article in Time Magazine in which she announced her return to Indian Wells.\n\u201cIt has been difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the Indian Wells locker room after winning in 2001, driving back to Los Angeles feeling as if I had lost the biggest game ever \u2014 not a mere tennis game, but a bigger fight for equality,\u201d she wrote.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEmotionally it seemed easier to stay away. There are some who say I should never go back. There are others who say I should\u2019ve returned years ago. I understand both perspectives very well and wrestled with them for a long time. I\u2019m just following my heart on this one.\u201d\nOn March 14, 2015, a Saturday, Ken Solomon, who was running the Tennis Channel at the time, was standing in the tunnel that leads to the Indian Wells center court. He was a few feet from Williams, who was waiting to be called. Her opponent, Monica Niculescu, a crafty Romanian, was there, too.\n\u201cIt was just peaceful down there,\u201d Solomon said in an interview last week. \u201cThere was a sense of harmony.\u201d\nA television cameraman had a hand-held camera, ready to get the in-motion close-up that always maximizes the drama for the audience at home.\n\u201cWhatever happened that day, whatever anyone said happened that day, Serena and her family had been vindicated,\u201d Solomon said.\n\u201cShe looked just incredibly happy to be there. The country had evolved since then. Everyone had evolved, we were in a different place.\u201d\nBy 2015, Barack Obama had been elected and reelected president, but incidents of police brutality and racially motivated attacks against Black people had not evolved out of America\u2019s history. Just months before Williams\u2019 return, Darren Wilson, a White police officer in Ferguson, Mo., shot and killed Michael Brown, a Black teenager. It sparked demonstrations and protests, a series of events that would repeat multiple times in the ensuing years. A few months after Williams\u2019 return, Dylann Roof, a self-radicalized White supremacist, shot and killed nine African Americans in a church in Charleston, South Carolina.\nKrasny, who fills the on-court host role all over the world, was on the court preparing to give his summary of Williams\u2019 career. As a Los Angeles native, Krasny had long had a special place in his heart for the Williams sisters. Venus would not return that year; she followed her sister\u2019s lead at the 2016 tournament.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI consider them both very dear to me,\u201d he said.\nHe had long worried that Serena might hold it against him that he had continued to work at the tournament. He didn\u2019t think anything awkward would happen between them, but even if it didn\u2019t, they were both going to be feeling the impact of the moment and its resonance through 14 years.\n\u201cI knew deep in my heart that it was going to be one of the most special days in my tenure at this tennis tournament,\u201d Krasny said. \u201cAnd when she walked out\u2026\u201d As Krasny told the story, he paused and choked up.\n\u201cI introduced her and she walked out,\u201d he continued. \u201cI took one look over at her sister, Isha (Price, n\u00e9e Williams), and I saw her crying. I lost it. I cried like a baby.\u201d\nUp in the broadcast booth, commentator Mary Carillo sat with her earpiece in, ready to call the match. This was the buzziest tennis news in a long time. She wasn\u2019t sure what she was supposed to say.\n\u201cBack when I used to call the Sunshine Swing, I\u2019d always had it in my head that Serena went out of her way to win the Miami tournament that followed Indian Wells just to stick it to those b\u2014\u2014s on the other coast,\u201d Carillo wrote in a text message this week.\n\u201cThe hype hysteria was bucking around like a noisy, unbalanced washing machine. I felt the opposite \u2014 pensive, contemplative. It turned out that Serena felt that way, too. Until she heard the roar and saw the standing ovation. And it just kept coming.\u201d\nSerena got choked up, too, then collected herself and went to the net. Fans screamed away, desperate for an acknowledgement.\n\u201cI was getting paid to call the match, but I still hadn\u2019t said a word,\u201d Carillo said.\n\u201cBy now, my producer actually wanted me to say something. I didn\u2019t. Unless he was holding my dogs hostage, I was not going to trample over the moment. Eventually, I\u2019m sure I must have added a little narrative, but I don\u2019t remember it. Serena had said it all.\u201d\n(Photos: Jed Jacobsohn / Allsport, Julian Finney, Adam Pretty / AUS, MIKE NELSON /AFP via Getty Images; Illustration: Demetrius Robinson for The Athletic)"

      "text": "HAMMERSMITH, LONDON\u2014As much as his breakthrough year has been about changes to his game and mentality, Jack Draper points to something else underpinning his growth on and off the court.\n\u201cI feel I\u2019ve got a goal and a purpose bigger than myself,\u201d he told reporters in a west London pub earlier this month, ahead of a memory walk to raise money for the charity Alzheimer\u2019s Society.\nAdvertisement\nDraper has seen the impact of dementia up close, with his maternal grandmother Brenda Entract battling Alzheimer\u2019s for a decade and his grandfather Chris Entract doing his best to support her in that time. Draper calls Chris a \u201chero\u201d for his support of Brenda, a former tennis coach who taught Jack the basics of sport as a youngster and was a huge influence on him growing up.\nDraper\u2019s dad was the chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) and his mother is a coach and former top British junior player, but it was his grandparents who would often take him to tournaments \u2014 and he says that Brenda\u2019s love for the sport passed down to him.\n\u201cThey were a huge part of my development,\u201d he says of his nana and pa.\nDraper has become a lot better known to the tennis world this year. His breakthrough season took in a first Grand Slam semifinal at the U.S. Open; a first (and second) ATP Tour title in Stuttgart, Germany and Vienna, Austria; and a first win against one of the very best players: a straight-sets success over Carlos Alcaraz at Queen\u2019s Club, which is close to the start of the memory walk. In 12 months, Draper has hoisted his world ranking from No. 61 to No. 15.\nBut to understand what motivates this thoughtful and sensitive soul, who turned 23 on Sunday December 22 but speaks with the wisdom of a veteran, it all comes back to his grandparents. The desire to honour them is partly why he wants \u201cto be busy the whole time. I want to be progressing \u2014 I understand a lot about myself in the last year and a half.\n\u201cMy mindset really shifted. I know that I\u2019m always someone who wants to achieve, who wants to keep on moving forward, to keep on improving.\u201d\nDraper therefore finds it tough to stand still, as he is having to do at the moment. A minor hip injury put paid to his planned trip to Spain to practise with Alcaraz and he confirmed Thursday, December 19 that he will miss the United Cup, which begins December 27 in Perth, in order to get fit for the Australian Open which begins January 12 in Melbourne. His caution is informed by a history of fitness issues; staying largely injury-free was a key driver for his success in 2024.\nAdvertisement\nThe first Grand Slam of the year offers Draper the chance to start building on a hugely promising and sometimes tumultuous year. In the face of heavy criticism after a controversial match point against Felix Auger-Aliassime at the Cincinnati Open in August, when Draper appeared to hit an illegal shot to win the contest, he told U.S. Open reporters that he had thought about the incident for \u201cfour days non-stop\u201d. Draper acknowledged that Auger-Aliassime should have won the point in question, but maintained that he genuinely wasn\u2019t sure in the moment.\nGO DEEPER\nWhy Draper and Auger-Aliassime's match point should change tennis' view on video replays\nThe last year has also been a period in which the idea that he has the chance to do something more than \u201chitting a decent tennis ball\u201d has crystalized in his mind. His work for Alzheimer\u2019s Society and his growing awareness of other causes \u2014 he\u2019s been inspired by seeing blind tennis at the National Tennis Centre in London \u2014 \u201cgives me purpose to feel like I\u2019m not just that tennis player. I have other things that I\u2019m trying to support.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cIn an individual sport, we\u2019re always focused on ourselves. It\u2019s important for me, especially as my career hopefully progresses and moves on that I have more of a purpose outside of my tennis as well.\n\u201cI don\u2019t find who I am or what I do very impressive. I know that sounds whatever because I\u2019m No. 15 in the world, but if I go out or if I meet other people, I\u2019m never talking about my tennis. I don\u2019t think of what I do as exceptional because I\u2019m around it the whole time.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a show-off. I still drive a second-hand Polo,\u201d he says.\nDraper speaks movingly about struggling to comprehend his grandmother\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s when he was only 13. \u201cYou watch that person you love or you watch that person who\u2019s always been such a significant figure then not know who you are and what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. After the two-mile walk from Hammersmith to Putney, Draper\u2019s pa was at the pub where everyone congregated, and the bond between the two was obvious. Draper always feels \u201ca bit guilty\u201d about being away because of the risk of something happening while he\u2019s abroad, but as a result maximises the time he has with his grandparents when he is at home in London.\nHe wants to maximize his time on the court too, and has added the British former world No. 242 Alex Ward to his coaching team. Ward will work alongside James Trotman, Draper\u2019s main coach. The former world No. 6 Wayne Ferreira joined in April but left four months later, after a difference of opinion on how to best harness Draper\u2019s booming leftie serve and forehand. Ferreira wanted Draper to put more emphasis on power in his game; he sees his athleticism and shotmaking as too important to let go, despite agreeing on the need to add aggression to his play in order to compete with Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner at the very top of the sport.\nAdvertisement\nDraper lost to his friend, Sinner, in the U.S. Open semifinal three months ago, when he vomited multiple times on court and looked at times to be wilting in the oppressive New York humidity. Draper spoke about feeling anxious after the match, as he had done when he was sick on court following his win over Marcos Giron at the Australian Open eight months earlier. But after experiencing nausea during a Davis Cup tie in Manchester shortly after losing to Sinner, he now thinks the U.S. Open ordeal was triggered by his taking ibuprofen for a sore ankle and the medicine \u201cruining\u201d his stomach a little bit.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel particularly anxious (against Sinner), I didn\u2019t feel particularly nervous,\u201d Draper says.\n\u201cOf course there\u2019s a lot of tension, but I think the throwing-up thing, especially when I look back across the years that I\u2019ve been playing, some things you\u2019re just not aware of until it kind of clocks in your mind that it could be something different to that.\u201d\nAmong his achievements in 2024, what pleased Draper most was the way he was able to rebound from a miserable French Open (where he lost to Dutch qualifier Jesper de Jong in a tetchy five-setter) while working his way through an identity crisis with his game. He feels more comfortable in his own skin now, playing with more variety and embracing his technical quirks rather than trying to erase them. \u201cYou look on the TV and you\u2019ve got players like (Daniil) Medvedev and myself on my forehand and you\u2019ve got all these funky techniques,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThat\u2019s their style. That\u2019s what makes them great.\u201d\nHe also insists he\u2019s not bothered by being the British No. 1 and flagbearer now that his one-time mentor and idol Andy Murray has retired. He\u2019s as intrigued as the rest of us about Murray\u2019s coaching tie-up with the 10-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic.\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll be an amazing coach, his tennis brain is huge,\u201d Draper says. \u201cAnd tactically, I think he\u2019ll find it incredibly fun. I can understand that he probably wants that buzz again \u2014 he wants to to feel like he\u2019s part of something big. He wants to be around top tennis.\u201d\nMost British tennis fans would love to see Murray coaching Draper one day. That\u2019s not a concern for Draper, however, who has a new season to prepare for and a purpose bigger than himself.\n(Top photo: Julian Finney / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story is a part of Peak, The Athletic\u2019s desk covering leadership, personal development and success through the lens of sports. Follow Peak here.\nOne day last June, during a steady rain on a chilly morning in New Hampshire, Roger Federer told a story about failure.\nOver the course of two decades, he emerged as one of the greatest tennis players who ever lived. He played 1,526 singles matches in his career and won almost 80 percent. He hoisted 20 Grand Slam trophies, including Wimbledon a record eight times.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cNow, I have a question for you,\u201d Federer said, looking out across a sea of umbrellas at the commencement ceremony for Dartmouth College. \u201cWhat percentage of points do you think I won in those matches?\u201d\nHe paused.\n\u201cOnly 54 percent,\u201d he said.\nIt was one of those statistics that at first seemed incorrect. Federer was one of the most dominant athletic forces of this century. That guy lost nearly half of his points?\n\u201cWhen you lose every second point, on average, you learn not to dwell on every shot,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cYou teach yourself to think, \u2018OK, I double-faulted. It\u2019s only a point.\u2019 When you\u2019re playing a point, it has to be the most important thing in the world, and it is. But when it\u2019s behind you, it\u2019s behind you. This mindset is really crucial, because it frees you to fully commit to the next point and the next point after that, with intensity, clarity and focus.\u201d\nBy the next day, the speech was everywhere, viewed by millions. Its message struck a chord with people from all walks of life, transcending the annual inspirational platitudes that define commencement season.\nOriginally the province of valedictorians and honors graduates, the graduation speech has long been a platform for politicians, thinkers and CEOs. But in the last two decades, another popular category has emerged: star athletes. Just this year, former Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter spoke at the University of Michigan, former NBA stars Grant Hill and Carmelo Anthony delivered addresses at their alma maters \u2014 Duke and Syracuse, respectively \u2014 and Olympic gymnast Simone Biles gave the speech at Washington University in St. Louis.\nThe American humorist Art Buchwald once mused that a commencement speech had an afterlife of 15 minutes. If you can even remember who spoke at your graduation, you probably don\u2019t remember much of what they said.\nAdvertisement\nOr, as former Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar put it at Drew University in 2016: \u201cLilacs are in bloom, love is in the air, and colleges and universities invite success stories like me to stand behind fancy podiums to convince parents and graduates that your education was worth the outrageous price.\u201d\nBut Federer\u2019s commencement address was something different \u2014 sincere, gracious, indelible \u2014 the sporting equivalent to Steve Jobs\u2019 famed commencement address at Stanford in 2005 or David Foster Wallace\u2019s speech, \u201cThis is Water,\u201d at Kenyon College the same year. When I mentioned the address to a colleague last month, he responded: \u201cI have referenced that speech like 20 times.\u201d\nAhead of the first anniversary of Federer\u2019s speech, I set out to answer a simple question: Why did it connect?\nFederer summed up his motivation for speaking at Dartmouth in two words: beer pong.\nThe actual reason was more personal; his agent Tony Godsick is a Dartmouth alum and Godsick\u2019s daughter was a member of the 2024 class. But Federer understood that nearly every commencement speech features a few local shoutouts, in this case a mention of the EBA\u2019s chicken sandwich from Lou\u2019s and the local pastime, Pong, a drinking game said to have been invented by Dartmouth students.\nFederer\u2019s speech, which was 3,200 words and lasted 25 minutes, was structured to share three lessons \u2014 \u201ctennis lessons,\u201d as Federer explained \u2014 all of which emanated from his long career and his own recent \u201cgraduation\u201d from tennis.\nThe first lesson: Effortless is a myth.\nFor as long as Federer dominated on court, commentators had remarked upon how easy he made it look. He glided around in balletic fashion, ripping one-handed backhands. He never seemed to sweat. But there was only one way, Federer explained, to make something look that easy.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about having a gift,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having grit.\u201d\nFederer\u2019s point was embodied in the address itself. He and his team spent six months working on the speech, sifting through drafts and making revisions. His delivery was tender and rehearsed.\n\u201cAs many interviews as he\u2019s done, and as much as he\u2019s been in the public eye, you could tell he practiced,\u201d said Vinay Reddy, a former chief speech writer for President Joe Biden. \u201cHe put the time into not just going up there and reading something.\u201d\nReddy has written speeches for presidents and world leaders. He also played Division I tennis at Miami University of Ohio. As a kid, he would attend the ATP event in Cincinnati, camping out on the practice courts to watch Andre Agassi, Stefan Edberg and Ivan Lendl. Their talent was mesmerizing. But when Reddy listened to Federer speak about effortlessness, he thought about the deliberate practice \u2014 the drills, the reps, the hours \u2014 he witnessed on that practice court in Cincinnati.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the things we tell ourselves growing up,\u201d Reddy said. \u201cNo matter what you do, just keep practicing, keep working, keep learning. There are just some things that are very enduring about discipline.\u201d\nThe structure of the speech was clear and clever, and the storytelling was compelling, Reddy said. Federer had something to say, and his earnest vulnerability allowed the message to break through. But there was another reason the address felt authentic: Federer opened up, sharing himself with the audience, at one point even jokingly referring to himself as \u201cDr. Roger\u201d instead of \u201cDr. Federer.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the strategies that Federer uses that good leaders use is to crack the door,\u201d said Steven D. Cohen, a professor of business communication at Johns Hopkins. \u201cI always tell people, \u2018Don\u2019t feel like you have to swing the door wide open and feel like you have to share your deepest, darkest secrets. Your goal is to crack the door. To share a little piece of yourself.\u2019\u201d\nFederer\u2019s second lesson: It\u2019s only a point.\nIt was here that he shared the story of his five-set loss to Rafael Nadal in the 2008 Wimbledon final, a match widely considered by many as one of the greatest of all time. Seeking his sixth consecutive Wimbledon title, Federer had lost the first two sets, clawed back into the match by winning tie-breaks in the third and fourth sets, only to lose 9-7 in an epic fifth, the match ending in the evening dusk.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou can work harder than you thought possible and still lose,\u201d Federer said, before adding: \u201cPerfection is impossible.\u201d\nIt was at this moment that Federer referenced his career record and his percentage of points won: 54 percent.\n\u201cNegative energy is wasted energy,\u201d Federer said. \u201cYou want to become a master at overcoming hard moments.\u201d\nIf you lose one point, there\u2019s no use in wallowing, because there might be another point \u2014 a break point, a set point \u2014 that means more. The match is long. There\u2019s always time to come back. In classical rhetoric terms, the anecdote was an example of logos, or using a compelling statistic to appeal to logic.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s counterintuitive, those stats become noteworthy and set up the rest of his argument,\u201d said James Holtje, a professional speech writer and adjunct professor at Columbia.\nIn tennis, a small, consistent edge over your opponent can translate into big margins in the long run. Nadal, for instance, also won exactly 54 percent of his points. And when Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner on Sunday in the French Open final \u2014 in one of the greatest matches since the 2008 Wimbledon final \u2014 Alcaraz, the champion, actually won one fewer point than Sinner.\nIt\u2019s an easy concept to apply to almost any field. In 2022, Ronald van Loon, a portfolio manager at BlackRock, authored a paper on the percentage of investment decisions that need to be correct to beat market benchmarks for returns. He researched markets, crunched the numbers and came up with a number: As low as 53 percent.\nMichael Kosta, a rotating host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central and a former professional tennis player, viewed the clip through the lens of a standup comedian. Federer may have only won 54 percent of his points, Kosta said, but he always seemed to win the points that mattered most.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe always brought his best at the right time,\u201d Kosta said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an important part of comedy, too. You can have a rough five minutes in your set. You can lose the audience. But as long as you get them back by the end, I think that\u2019s kind of most important.\u201d\nOne of the most important parts of any speech or presentation is connecting with the audience. Cohen, the professor at Johns Hopkins, said Federer utilized a strategy he teaches: What\u2019s in it for them \u2014 or WIIFT.\n\u201cWhat Federer does here that is so powerful is he captures the moment and he understands what\u2019s keeping these students up at night,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact they\u2019re transitioning from one part of their life to another, just like Federer is transitioning from being a tennis pro and he has to figure out what comes next.\u201d\nWhich set up Federer\u2019s final lesson: Life is bigger than the court.\nIn an interview with ESPN\u2019s Chris McKendry last summer at Wimbledon, Federer explained he had two goals. He wanted to have fun and keep the audience awake.\n\u201cThat\u2019s also my take on life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018We got to have fun along the way.\u2019 \u201d\nWhen Federer was 14, he left home in Basel to attend a school in the French part of Switzerland. He was homesick at first, but he came to appreciate the act of exploration, of traveling the world, experiencing new cultures and undertaking what he called \u201clife on the move.\u201d\nHe also had a realization: \u201cI knew that tennis could show me the world. But tennis could never be the world.\u201d\nThe graduates before him would be record-breakers and world travelers, leaders and philanthropists.

      "text": "This article is part of our New York Court Classics series, a special feature produced by The Athletic looking back at classic U.S. Open performances, iconic athletes and timeless moments.\nThe Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open\nFLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 James Scott Connors, the battler from Belleville, Ill., won eight Grand Slam titles during a 24-year career.\nAdvertisement\nHe is a five-time U.S. Open champion, a two-time Wimbledon champion, and a leading man of the first golden age of professional tennis in the 1970s and 1980s.\nJust don\u2019t look for him at the tennis \u201cStar Wars\u201d bar that every Grand Slam turns into, with old legends of the sport all over the grounds. They are in front of television cameras and behind the closed doors of corporate suites, where they receive generous checks for popping in, shaking some hands and telling some stories, before heading off to the next appearance.\nLet them have their fun and their appearance fees. Connors will keep his distance. His relationships with them were always a little spicy. Connors, known to the world as Jimmy and now 72, called his memoir \u201cThe Outsider,\u201d so maybe staying away is for the best. His two artificial hips, one of which required a second surgery, and his wife of 47 years, Patti, are happy to stay at home near Santa Barbara.\nHe golfs with a regular bunch of buddies, plays tennis several times a week and does a podcast with his son, Brett. They talk about the worlds of tennis and gambling. He\u2019s made some good investments. Money is not of concern. Getting to choose how to spend his time is his reward.\nConnors, who was, is and surely will be full of surprises for the rest of his life, saved his biggest one for his home major. Even with all those Grand Slam titles, and his record 109 tour titles, Connors may be best known for a fourth-round match he played on Louis Armstrong Stadium at the U.S. Open, on Labor Day in 1991. He woke up on his 39th birthday in the last 16 of his favorite tournament, a supposedly over-the-hill legend of the sport engaging in one of his last dances at his home Slam.\nIt\u2019s the match that U.S. Open broadcasters used to show during rain delays, back before the advent of roofs at Grand Slams made their virtual storage closet of classic matches obsolete.\nAdvertisement\nConnors had undergone wrist surgery less than a year before. He entered the U.S. Open as a wild card, ranked No. 174. He was facing Aaron Krickstein, a once and future top-10 player 14 years his junior. Krickstein, 24, was in his athletic prime and on his way back to the top of the sport. The first week had been brutally hot, sapping players far younger than Connors of their energy, leaving them depleted ahead of the business end of the tournament.\nSomeone forgot to mention all that to Connors. The crotch-grabbing exhibitionist, whose profane tirades rubbed much of the tennis establishment the wrong way, was never much for following conventional wisdom.\nKrickstein didn\u2019t know what to think of the matchup. He\u2019d never beaten Connors, winless in five tries. He\u2019d played Connors two months before at Wimbledon. Connors had dumped him in three sets, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.\nUnlike a lot of players on the tour, Krickstein liked Connors. They had known each other for nearly a decade; they were friends. Krickstein didn\u2019t really like playing against his friends. Especially this one, who could act like his soulmate off the court before transforming into the most mercilessly vindictive soul on the planet once the first ball went over the net. He would make the crowd despise his foes. He would bully the umpires and linesmen into what looked like makeup calls. If fans got so riled up that they started to yell through every shot, he would not stop them.\nStill, this was Krickstein\u2019s favorite tournament, too. It was the site of his 1983 breakout run to the fourth round, when he was just 16. There, he produced an epic comeback from two sets down to defeat Vitas Gerulaitis, a hometown favorite and matinee star of the era with his flowing blond hair and Studio 54 personality.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason that Aaron Krickstein at 24 shouldn\u2019t beat 39-year-old Jimmy Connors if I can stay mentally focused and play up to my standards,\u201d Krickstein said during an interview this summer from Florida, where he is the director of tennis at the St. Andrews Country Club in Boca Raton.\nAdvertisement\nAs match day approached, he figured the New York summer heat would give him an assist and prove too much for his opponent, given the scorchers they had been living through.\n\u201cAnd then of course Labor Day was nice and cool and no humidity,\u201d Krickstein said.\nStill, when the match started, Krickstein felt like it was going according to his plan. It was a day match. They played the first set while much of the crowd was eating lunch. Krickstein did what he had to do, keeping Connors back, winning the longer rallies, not offering much to get excited about. He won it 6-3.\nThen Connors started to find his rhythm, lacing balls across the net and charging in behind them to finish points. He surged to a 5-1 lead in the second set, only to lose it as Krickstein pushed proceedings into a tiebreak. At 7-7, Connors cracked an overhead that appeared to nick the sideline. The line judge called it in. The chair umpire, David Littlefield, overruled him. Krickstein\u2019s meticulously constructed bulwark against any kind of chaos had collapsed.\nConnors rushed the chair. The crowd howled. Littlefield told Connors the ball was clearly out, even though he was on the opposite side of the court. Connors unleashed, pointing at Littlefield, taunting him, calling him a bum and likely some obscenities, inaudible through the din. Connors told Littlefield that he couldn\u2019t see balls beneath his feet, much less across the court. Littlefield sat silently atop the chair like a stoic.\nThe howls went on and on. Connors relished all of it. He won the next point with a stinging volley and pointed at Littlefield. Two points later, the match was even.\n\u201cThat was the start of a crazy match,\u201d Krickstein said. \u201cWho knows if I pulled that out or we didn\u2019t have that altercation or him screaming at the umpire \u2026 I would have been up two sets.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cProbably history would be a lot different.\u201d\nIronically, Krickstein reset and cruised through the next set 6-1 before letting Connors back into the match in the fourth set. Littlefied overruled another call, and Connors unleashed once more, calling him \u201can abortion.\u201d More stoicism from Littlefield. No penalties.\nKrickstein grabbed a 5-2 lead in the fifth set, and that\u2019s when Connors hit the afterburners. Suddenly, he started sprinting across the court, catching up with balls that a 29-year-old might struggle to get, much less someone a decade older than that.\nNow the crowd was really going. Krickstein remembers serving for the match and pushing an easy forehand approach off of a low, chipped drop shot beyond the baseline. The errors started piling up. The crowd got louder with every point Connors won, even on some of the Krickstein errors.\nKrickstein had been in hostile environments before. He often performed well in them. This one was different.\n\u201cI was kind of in a fog in the last four to five, six games,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to really focus like I normally do in those pressure situations at the end of a match.\u201d\nHe noticed Connors stalling between points to regain his wind. He thought about complaining, but figured it would make things worse. There was no way Littlefield was going to default Connors in front of his baying faithful.\n\u201cThey would have burned the place down,\u201d Krickstein said.\nOn match point, Connors got into the net and stabbed a backhand volley into the open court. He raised his arms and pumped his fists, pointing at every side of the stadium. After four hours and 41 minutes of tennis, his work for the holiday was done.\nFor Connors, whose run ended in the semifinals with a three-set defeat to Jim Courier, it was the last great win of a great career. He would play one more season, and beat Krickstein one more time before retiring at the end of 1992.\nFollowing that Labor Day barnburner, the two men did not speak for 23 years.\nConnors declined to be interviewed for this story. Brett Connors, a producer with Tennis Channel, said his dad \u2014 \u201cPops\u201d to his son \u2014 wasn\u2019t crazy about some things that were written about him in recent years, so he decided just not to talk publicly anymore. It\u2019s a source of some frustration to Brett, who feels like his father doesn\u2019t get his due in the tennis pantheon, perhaps because he\u2019s not sitting behind a television desk, handing out trophies or glad-handing and working the celebrity appearance circuit.\nAdvertisement\nConnors plans to come to New York with a friend around the final days of this year\u2019s U.S. Open, mostly to visit the city and have some dinners with his son. He plans to fly back on the early side of Sunday, Sept. 7, the day of the men\u2019s singles final.\nWill Pops visit the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center?\n\u201cTruth be told, I wish he would,\u201d Brett said. \u201cI\u2019d like him to get his due.\u201d\nJimmy did do a little television work in retirement. It was fine. He coached Andy Roddick for a little while. He liked that. There were also limited stints with Maria Sharapova and Eugenie Bouchard.\nBrett said his father still loves the game and the life it gave him. But Jimmy also learned early, after a series of losses to his buddy Ilie N\u0103stase, that he couldn\u2019t be friends with guys he needed to beat. So he wasn\u2019t. Not with John McEnroe, not with Bj\u00f6rn Borg and not with Ivan Lendl. Gerulaitis, who uttered the famous \u201cnobody beats Vitas Gerulaitis 17 times in a row\u201d quote after breaking a long losing streak to Connors, was a friend. Eddie Dibbs, a solid pro nowhere near Connors\u2019 level, remains a buddy to this day.\n\u201cThey talk all the time,\u201d Brett said. \u201cHe loves Dibbs.\u201d\nAs for everyone else, they do their thing, lapping up the attention four times a year. Jimmy does his. Until recently, many of his old trophies and other baubles had been in a storage unit in Illinois since his mother died 18 years ago. Brett said that when they retrieved them not so long ago, his father tossed much of it in the trash, especially the runner-up ones.\nKrickstein and Connors, meanwhile, reunited in 2015. Krickstein invited Connors down to his club in Florida for a fundraising exhibition \u2013 a reunion match, so to speak. Given that Krickstein might be best known as the guy who lost to Connors in that epic, he obliged, despite having two artificial hips.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI kept the balls pretty much in the center, but he was still playing well,\u201d Krickstein said. \u201cI was playing well, and obviously in a lot better shape.\u201d\nKrickstein won 8-4. Jimmy Arias, another 1980s hotshot, worked as the chair umpire. About 750 people showed up to watch. Connors stayed until 11 p.m., talking to members, posing for pictures, doing all the things he rarely does.\nKrickstein has moved on plenty, too. For the first five or six years after the loss, Krickstein would catch glimpses of it during those rain delays and turn away. He didn\u2019t want to hear about it, talk about it, or see it.\nWith age, perspectives can change. He\u2019s fine with it now.\n\u201cIt is an iconic match,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who saw it still think of it as one of the best tennis matches of all time, even though it wasn\u2019t the finals and even though it wasn\u2019t one of the greatest tennis matches as far as level of play. It had a little bit of everything.\u201d\nThe New York Court Classics series is presented by Ralph Lauren.\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence.

      "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Aryna Sabalenka had fallen just short of winning a third straight Australian Open title, but it hadn\u2019t affected her standing with the adoring Melbourne crowd.\nWhen the two-time champion took the on-court microphone after losing Saturday\u2019s final to Madison Keys, she was greeted with rapturous applause. Fans laughed along as Sabalenka eschewed the tradition of thanking her team, instead joking about her three-set defeat being their fault. It was a typically entertaining speech, delivered immediately after Sabalenka had smashed her racket in frustration before briefly leaving Rod Laver Arena to compose herself.\nAdvertisement\nSabalenka, 26, has three Grand Slam titles. At the last two majors, she won the U.S. Open and then finished as the losing finalist at Melbourne Park, winning 13 out of 14 matches in the process. She has an engaging, funny personality and a big social media presence, playing an eye-catching brand of ultra-attacking tennis. She is the world No. 1.\nThese are all the metrics that brands and sponsors look for in a sportsperson, but before the Australian Open, Sabalenka split with sports marketing behemoth IMG to join Evolve \u2014 a smaller agency co-founded by four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka \u2014 after running down her deal because of dissatisfaction with her representation.\n\u201cI was looking to build my brand, wanted a little bit more than IMG was doing for me. I wasn\u2019t happy with the service,\u201d she said in a news conference at the Australian Open last week.\n\u201cThere was tension between me and some of the people out there.\u201d\nMax Eisenbud, IMG\u2019s head of tennis clients, said in a statement to The Athletic: \u201cWe mutually parted ways with Sabalenka after a successful four-year partnership and are proud of what we accomplished together.\n\u201cShe is an amazing champion on-court and we wish her the best as she continues her career.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nWhat's it like to face Aryna Sabalenka in full flow?\nTwo sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships within tennis, briefed on Sabalenka\u2019s departure from IMG said Sabalenka grew frustrated with the disconnect between her standing in the sporting world and how potential deals were limited because of her nationality. Belarus is an ally in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and brands have either pulled out of or scaled back deals attached to Russian and Belarusian athletes since the start of the invasion in February 2022.\nJust before joining Evolve, Sabalenka filmed her first solo Nike commercial, adding to deals with Wilson, tech wearable Whoop, tequila brand Dobel, luxury watchmaker Audemars Piguet and Oakberry, the acai franchise run by her partner, Georgios Frangulis \u2014 but she still lags behind her contemporaries in the women\u2019s and men\u2019s games.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Forbes, Sabalenka took home $9million (\u00a37.2m) from endorsements in 2024. Sabalenka\u2019s biggest rival on court, the world No. 2 Iga Swiatek, picked up $15m in the same period. World No. 3 Coco Gauff brought in $25m, while the men\u2019s world No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz made $32m. Daniil Medvedev, who is Russian and ranked No. 7 on the men\u2019s tour, made $13m, helped by an infectious personality and a big interest in gaming that has landed him deals with EA Sports and Ubisoft.\n\u201cAn athlete\u2019s nationality makes a huge difference,\u201d said Tim Crow, the former head of international sports marketing agency Synergy, in a phone interview last week.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re looking to sign up an American player. In that instance, you\u2019re tapping into the giant American economy \u2014 half all the dollars spent on sport in the world by businesses comes out of the American economy,\u201d Crow said.\n\u201cAll things being equal, I don\u2019t think Sabalenka has got anything like the backing that she should have given her performances, especially in the last couple of years.\u201d\nTennis is a sports marketing moneymaker because of its status as one of the biggest truly global individual sports. Fans attach themselves not just to tennis players and their fortunes at tournaments, but to their kits, rackets and personalities off the court. The four majors are the most important shop windows and Grand Slam success is the most direct and lucrative route to sponsorships and endorsements, but the biggest stars in the sport \u2014 and the most marketable players \u2014 transcend tennis. Gauff created a clothing line for American Eagle; Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner model for Louis Vuitton and Gucci; Osaka lit the Olympic flame at the 2021 Tokyo Games.\n\u201cTo stand out beyond the tennis world where the real money is, you have to become a global face and persona,\u201d said sports marketing consultant Nigel Currie in a phone interview last week.\nAdvertisement\nIn the endorsement world, a player\u2019s nationality is their market. Seven spots lower in the rankings and with zero Grand Slam titles to Sabalenka\u2019s three, Zheng Qinwen cannot match her on-court stardom. But in China, Zheng is already an icon \u2014 only more so after winning Olympic gold in Paris in 2024 \u2014 and she recently signed a deal to become one of the faces of Christian Dior. Emma Raducanu signed a similar deal with Dior a month after winning the U.S. Open as a qualifier in 2021.\nWhen Kei Nishikori became the first Asian man to reach a Grand Slam final in 2014, he created a slew of endorsements that, half a decade later, were bringing in $31m every year. They included a Kei Jaguar car, Nissin Nishikori noodles and an alcohol-free beer from Asahi. Osaka\u2019s Japanese heritage and place at the intersection of sport and pop culture in America has monumental appeal for sponsors.\nA timely illustration of Sabalenka\u2019s position in this dynamic came the day after her defeat to Keys, when Belarus\u2019 long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko was elected for the seventh consecutive time in polls that exiled opponents have described as rigged. A few months after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Wimbledon banned Russian and Belarusian players from competing, further reducing their exposure. At the French Open the following year, reporters frequently asked Sabalenka about her stance on the war and her connections with Lukashenko. There are numerous pictures of the two together and Sabalenka skipped two post-match news conferences during the Paris tournament, declaring that she \u201cdid not feel safe\u201d during one of her conferences.\nWhen Sabalenka returned to her media duties a few days later, she was asked directly if she supported Lukashenko. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough question. I mean, I don\u2019t support war, meaning I don\u2019t support Lukashenko right now,\u201d she said.\nIn between those two tournaments, Sabalenka won her first major at the 2023 Australian Open, ticking the top box brands look for. She has only grown in stature since, but her renown outside tennis has yet to catch up to her position at the top of the women\u2019s game. Stuart Duguid, Osaka\u2019s co-founder at Evolve, described Sabalenka as \u201cone of the most marketable athletes in the world today,\u201d adding that her commercial portfolio is \u201clargely untapped\u201d in a statement upon her signing. Osaka and Duguid both left IMG to set up the agency.\nView this post on Instagram\nLike Gauff and Osaka, Sabalenka\u2019s cultural presence is amplified by her use of social media. With its restrictive media rights, fragmented programming and low exposure for WTA tournaments versus their ATP counterparts, tennis\u2019 limited discoverability means that being a Coco Gauff, Naomi Osaka or Aryna Sabalenka fan is much easier than being a tennis fan who likes those players. Sabalenka\u2019s use of TikTok, in which she takes part in dance trends with her rivals and her team, has helped to raise her profile off the court.\nThe social media element is \u201chugely important,\u201d says Crow. \u201cTo modern-day sponsors, particularly newer brands, the amount of social media traction you have, the number of followers you have, all that kind of thing is massively important because it\u2019s where they\u2019re putting most of their marketing dollars.\u201d\nPart of the reason for social media\u2019s importance is consistency. One of the things that makes tennis global is its worldwide schedule, which can often see the best players spread across different tournaments, in different countries or even continents, from week to week. The four majors \u2014 and ATP and WTA 1,000 tournaments, one rung below a major \u2014 are where it all comes together.\nAdvertisement\nThey are the places where the rivalries that go above and beyond tennis are made, and the lack of them on the women\u2019s tour in recent times is another factor in Sabalenka\u2019s relative difficulty with securing big endorsements. Sinner has Alcaraz. Federer, Nadal and Djokovic had each other. Sabalenka most obviously has Swiatek, with the duo embroiled in a battle for world No. 1. They have dominated the WTA Tour for the past three years, but they have met just once at a Grand Slam and never in a major final.\nThey came as close as they ever have Thursday, with Swiatek holding a match point against Keys before eventually losing out in a thrilling match tiebreak.\n\u201cIn individual sports, classic rivalries are like gold dust,\u201d Currie said.\n\u201cGreat rivalries tend to attract a wider audience as it\u2019s an entry point for those who are perhaps interested but not passionate about a particular sport. It gives them knowledge about a sport that otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\nA former WTA executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships in tennis, said: \u201cWomen\u2019s tennis hasn\u2019t had a Grand Slam rivalry really since Steffi Graf and Monica Seles more than 30 years ago and hasn\u2019t had a proper on-court rivalry since Serena Williams vs Justine Henin.\u201d\nWilliams and Henin faced each other in three of the four majors in 2007 and contested an Australian Open final in 2010 (which Williams won in three sets).\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long time between drinks,\u201d the executive added. \u201cThe lack of rivalries is affecting the visibility of the sport.\u201d\nThe presence of Swiatek, along with Gauff, Elena Rybakina (if she can return to her form of early 2024) and players with the ability to run hot at a major (such as Keys), are further blockers to Sabalenka\u2019s other route to transcendence: dominating the sport outright. A single player winning everything in their path is just as powerful a way into a sport as a compelling rivalry.\nAdvertisement\nOne major can make a difference: Wimbledon. Having missed out in 2022 (banned) and 2024 (shoulder injury), Sabalenka\u2019s best result at the All England Club is a semifinal appearance in 2023.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of time before she breaks through at Wimbledon and if she wins a few more majors, people will say she\u2019s the standout player. That\u2019s what needs to happen,\u201d Currie said.\nIf Sabalenka continues to pick up Grand Slam titles, her marketing potential will grow. The response of the Melbourne crowd in defeat shows that she is on the way to achieving the status of her contemporaries. To return to her joking assessment of that loss, whether the endorsements and sponsorships will grow with that status appears to be a question for her team.\n(Top photo: David Gray / AFP via Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open\nWelcome to the U.S. Open briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories on each day of the tournament.\nOn Day 4, Carlos Alcaraz vanquished bad memories, the city\u2019s tennis diasporas turned out and perhaps the best sports photo of the year came to the fore.\nCarlos Alcaraz vanquishes demons of last year\nA year on, Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s second-round U.S. Open loss to Botic van de Zandschulp looks like the most overindexed result in the sport.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same stage of this year\u2019s competition, Alcaraz posted a performance and result Wednesday night far more illustrative of who he is as a player. He destroyed Italy\u2019s Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 to set up a third-round meeting with No. 32 seed Luciano Darderi, delivering a display at odds with the alleged flakiness and inconsistency with which the Van de Zandschulp match has become synonymous.\nIn reality, that defeat last year was an anomaly: the only time in 11 Grand Slams that Alcaraz has failed to reach the quarterfinals, against the backdrop of his mentally and physically exhausting defeat to Novak Djokovic in the Paris Olympics\u2019 gold-medal match three weeks earlier. Alcaraz\u2019s tennis can be volatile during matches, but he is now 31-1 in his last 32.\nAfter routing the world No. 65, he spoke of the impact of last year\u2019s upset on his tournament this year. He admitted that he had thought more about his shock exit to Van de Zandschulp than his U.S. Open title win in 2022, and added: \u201cI thought about last year when I stepped on the court. Some bad thoughts. I was nervous about it, like thinking: \u2018OK, I don\u2019t want to do the same thing as I did last year, losing in the second round.\u2019\n\u201cI wanted just to improve from the experience. I think when I lost in the second round last year, it was one of those moments when I learned a lot how to deal with some situations, how should I have done things much better. I think I\u2019ve just done it this year much, much better.\u201d\nThe confidence and energy that coursed through Alcaraz last night underlined how the win could not have been in starker contrast to that monumental, if overindexed, defeat a year ago.\nCharlie Eccleshare\nRising tennis stars bring their fans from all over New York City\nAfter three wins in the first round, three rising Southeast Asian tennis nations prepared to bring their support to the Billie Jean King Tennis Center from all over New York City once again.\nAdvertisement\nAnd while Wednesday did not extend the runs of Janice Tjen of Indonesia and Alex Eala of the Philippines, the diaspora populations concentrated in the city\u2019s nearby Elmhurst and Woodside neighborhoods respectively once again came out to support the players making history for their countries. Tjen lost handily to Emma Raducanu of Great Britain, who beat her 6-2, 6-1, jumping on anything remotely short and crowding Tjen on her backhand side to stop her from unleashing her heavy inside-out forehand. The 2021 U.S. Open champion was simply too much for Tjen, who upset No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermatova in the first round and has won 100 of her last 113 matches on the third tier of professional tennis. She\u2019s also the first Indonesian player to win a main-draw match at a Grand Slam since 2004.\nThen it was Eala\u2019s turn to carry the torch for the Philippines again, having made tennis history for her archipelago most of the past year. But she ran into Cristina Bus\u00e7a of Spain, who beat her 6-4, 6-3. Eala had some chances to draw even in the second set, but couldn\u2019t find enough consistency. Still, her win in the first round over the No. 14 seed Clara Tauson, a wild match decided by a third-set tiebreak that Eala won 13-11, made her the first Filipino player to win a Grand Slam match in the modern era of tennis, which goes back more than 50 years.\nColeman Wong of Hong Kong is last to go.

      "text": "FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 The red carpet rolled out at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Smoke blew from the cannons. Then Maria Sharapova emerged in a mid-length black dress, its collar reflecting light back into the tennis stratosphere, applauding a crowd that applauded her first.\nSharapova was honored with an official U.S. Open ring Sunday at Arthur Ashe Stadium, following her induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. She accepted her latest hardware in the latest rendition of the tennis dress that changed the sport.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cNew York City, what a special place and special court,\u201d Sharapova said.\n\u201cYou people have made such an incredible impact on my journey and my career. I have had some of the most beautiful moments on this court and some of the most challenging. You\u2019ve witnessed me grow up from being a young girl wearing an Audrey Hepburn-inspired night dress to now 19 years later accepting this beautiful ring and this amazing honor. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for making this event so special.\u201d\nAlways great to have @MariaSharapova back at the US Open!\nTonight she received her ring from the @TennisHalloFame. pic.twitter.com/aaDXrwKvuE\n\u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) August 26, 2025\nAt this same venue 19 years ago, Sharapova seized the women\u2019s singles title in a tennis dress inspired by Hepburn\u2019s little black Givenchy dress in \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201d Sharapova became one of the first to combine fashion and function in the sport. She was also one of the first athletes to engineer her image into income. From 2005 to 2015, despite being ranked No. 1 for only 21 nonconsecutive weeks, Sharapova was the highest-paid female athlete, banking $29.7 million in 2015, per Forbes. She leveraged her own brand into company ambassador and endorsement deals; she signed a long-term deal with Nike in which she had design input.\nSharapova\u2019s legacy is polarizing. She is a Grand Slam champion known for a piercing grunt and an around-the-clock tough exterior. Injuries and a 15-month suspension for unintentional doping, as the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled, further complicated her story. She retired in 2020.\nNone of that disqualifies Sharapova as a first-ballot Hall of Fame entrant, who turned pro at 14 and won Wimbledon three years later. She went on to win the U.S. Open in 2006, the Australian Open in 2008 and the French Open in 2012 and 2014. She captured that Wimbledon title by taking down then-defending champion Serena Williams at just 17 years old, spurring the renowned rivalry that would intertwine Williams and Sharapova\u2019s careers forever.\nBut after more than 15 years of competing against one another, and 22 meetings of which Williams won 20, that rivalry retired with them. At Sharapova\u2019s Hall of Fame induction Saturday, in Newport, R.I., her legendary foe-turned-friend introduced her.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cMaria and I were once the fiercest of rivals. We had our differences. To the world, we were miles and miles apart, but the truth is we weren\u2019t,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe wanted the exact same thing at the exact same time: to be the very best. In our sport, only one person can walk away with the trophy, and what\u2019s really wrong with wanting to be your best? Nothing. In fact, it\u2019s what drove us. That\u2019s what made our rivalry so electric and so iconic.\u201d\nWilliams won 23 Grand Slam titles but lost out on five that Sharapova captured, including that 2004 Wimbledon final.\n\u201cTo this day, she calls it the highlight of her career, and to this day, I call it one of my hardest losses,\u201d Williams said.\nIn her Hall of Fame acceptance speech, Sharapova said her favorite moments \u201cwere always the quiet victories, the small moments,\u201d but added that she wouldn\u2019t be cemented in history without the wins and trophies that shined brighter than her dress.\n(Top photo: John Nacion / Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open\nIn early June, Jannik Sinner suffered the sort of defeat that could cause years of psychological damage. He squandered three match points in the fourth set of the French Open final, before losing a fifth-set tiebreak to his nearest and only rival at the top of tennis, Carlos Alcaraz.\nAdvertisement\nSo he went home. Sinner retreated to Sesto, the tiny Alpine village in northeast Italy where he was raised, seeking the comfort of his family. His parents and his grandfather still live there.\nFive weeks later, Sinner won Wimbledon, beating Alcaraz after dropping a first set that Alcaraz had won with the kind of impossible stolen point that he has used to crush the spirits of opponents, including Sinner. A Wimbledon title is the kind of life-changing triumph that has sent previous winners\u2019 heads and hearts into the clouds. Sinner, a tall and handsome 24-year-old who has already amassed a nine-figure fortune in prize money and endorsement deals, could satisfy nearly any desire with a few taps of his phone.\nHe went home.\nSinner slept in his brother\u2019s old bedroom because his is filled with other stuff now. He went for walks. He played cards and board games with his close relatives and played some golf with his dad, when his father didn\u2019t have to work at the local restaurant where he is a chef. He caught up with some old friends and drove around the picturesque mountain roads.\n\u201cWe take success and defeat the same way,\u201d Sinner said in a rare one-on-one interview at the Cincinnati Open earlier this month. \u201cThe most important thing is that we are healthy, that we are having a nice time together.\u201d\nHe paused for a moment, before noting the obvious.\n\u201cOf course everyone is more happy if I win,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut at the same time, even if I lose, they\u2019re happy that I come back, that I want to see them, that I have a great time with my friends, and people I really, really care about. So it was something very, very nice in both ways.\n\u201cI believe in important moments to come back home to see the people I love.\u201d\nOver the years, the kings and queens of tennis have assumed all sorts of identities. Club-hopping partiers. Celebrity titans who enjoy rubbing shoulders with the royalty of fashion and finance. Sinner appears dead-set on the identity that appears to come naturally to him, at least for now.\nAdvertisement\nHe desperately just wants to remain a simple guy from a simple family, the son of a cook and a waitress and the brother of a firefighting instructor, who more often than not \u2014 and even when he\u2019s let a Grand Slam slip through his fingers \u2014 finds his way toward a kind of amenable stoicism.\n\u201cWe always speak about the champion mentality, you know,\u201d Sinner\u2019s main coach, Simone Vagnozzi, said during a recent interview. \u201cThe champion\u2019s mentality is going out in the difficult situation.\u201d\nLast August, Sinner went out to New York in the most difficult situation of his career. The tennis anti-doping authorities had just announced what appeared to be the conclusion of an anti-doping investigation into Sinner, after he twice tested positive for clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, in March 2024.\nAn independent tribunal convened by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted the explanation that Sinner\u2019s physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi, used a first-aid cream containing the substance on a cut finger, then gave Sinner massages through which he contaminated the player. It ruled that Sinner bore \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d for the two positive tests, as well as finding that he did not intentionally dope.\nThat announcement went public a few hours before Sinner\u2019s plane touched down in New York City. He headed to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center to face players and journalists seeking an explanation of what had been going on in secret during the first five months of Sinner\u2019s reign atop the sport. Sinner continued to play because he quickly and successfully appealed the provisional suspension that he received for each positive test, in line with ITIA protocol.\nA U.S. Open media official tried to shut down questions during his opening news conference. There was uproar. Sinner overruled him and tried to explain what had transpired. Two weeks later, when he won the tournament, he spoke of the dark journey the tournament had been, a struggle more than a triumph. Still, it appeared to be over.\nAdvertisement\nIt was not. The World Anti-Doping Agency appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and sought what would have been a career-derailing ban of two years, arguing that Sinner should bear responsibility for having an illegal substance in his system, even though it agreed that he did not intentionally dope. Sinner\u2019s tennis future remained in jeopardy for six months, even as he won the season-ending ATP Tour Finals, the Davis Cup, and the Australian Open.\nIn the end, WADA reached a case resolution agreement with the Italian. Sinner received a three-month ban, which he did not want to accept, between the end of the Australian Open in January and the start of the Italian Open in May. He returned to a hero\u2019s welcome, met tennis fan Pope Leo just days after his elevation, and got on with winning tennis matches when just about anyone not named Alcaraz stood on the other side of the net.\nThen, five weeks after Alcaraz completed the epic Roland Garros comeback that solidified their rivalry as the apotheosis of men\u2019s tennis, Sinner beat him on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the sport\u2019s grandest stage. He arrives in New York about as far removed from 2024 as he could be.\n\u201cLast year was a much more stressful situation because of the timing before a Grand Slam. It was difficult to handle everything. Also for me, you know, I\u2019m still young, so it was not easy,\u201d he said in a news conference on Friday.\nHe could say he used to dream that his life might be like this, but that would be a lie. In the tiny mountain town of Sesto, Sinner the boy never bothered to dream of something so ridiculous as being a Wimbledon champion. And don\u2019t look for his parents in New York. They\u2019re back home in Italy, at work.\n\u201cToo far, too busy,\u201d he says.\nHe says this in the most commonsensical way, even though the parents of so many other stars always find their way into their children\u2019s courtside boxes and onto television screens. Sinner\u2019s dad, Hanspeter, missed the French Open final. During U.S. Open fortnight, which occupies the last weeks of summer tourist season in the Dolomites, he has many shifts at the restaurant where he works.\nAdvertisement\nHis mother, Siglinde, no longer waits tables but manages a few small apartments his family owns. She was courtside during his run to the finals in Rome, Paris, and, thankfully, London. She has become something of an avatar of the Sinner experience in recent months, watching her son endure the most stressful moments of his on-court career. Sinner is the duck\u2019s back, water sliding off; Siglinde is the feet whirring below the surface, shock and awe etched on her face.\nShe had promised to come if he ever played a final in Europe, though she finds it so stressful that she prefers to watch on television. After he dropped the first set in his semifinal against Tommy Paul at the Italian Open, she had to leave the stadium.\nSinner says he has pleaded with her to maintain her perspective, which is really his. It\u2019s just a tennis match, he tells her. The worst thing that can happen is that he loses. They still get to live this unbelievably fortunate existence the next day.\nIt\u2019s the sort of message the parent is supposed to deliver to the child, not the other way around. In some ways, the French Open loss may have been the exact kind of exposure therapy his mother needed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst thing that happens,\u201d Sinner said. Then a deep breath and a shake of the head. \u201cParents, I guess.\u201d\nOne day, perhaps, they will come around to his way of thinking. \u201cYou cannot live this sport stressfully for 20 years, 15 years. So I always said, we are good, we\u2019re healthy, I\u2019m playing the biggest tennis match in this moment. So even if I lose, sometimes you lose, and sometimes you win.\u201d\nSinner wasn\u2019t always so zen about his results. He did not always possess that tennis poker face, where it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell whether he\u2019s putting on one of his absurd ballstriking clinics or having one of his once-in-a-blue-moon off days. There was a time around his mid-teens, when he was first starting to play professional matches and losing a lot of them, that he took the defeats hard, sometimes losing his temper when his game would unravel.\nAdvertisement\nHe knew why. His parents were spending just about every extra euro they had on his tennis development, and they didn\u2019t have many extra euros. Worse, he knew how hard they worked. Restaurant work is not for the faint of heart: his dad, on his feet in a hot kitchen all day and into the night; his mother on her feet, in and out of that hot kitchen, all day and into the night. On a good day during his childhood, Sinner would see them for a couple of hours.\n\u201cThey were tired, and I had to sleep early because I had school,\u201d he said.\nAll of a sudden, he was traveling around, losing tennis matches and their money. His parents never complained, but he hated what was happening.\nEverything changed, he said, when he was 18. He won enough matches, including the ATP Next Gen Finals, a year-end tournament for the most promising players under 21, to break into the top 100. Now he had his own money to spend on his career.\nThe next year, he made the quarterfinals of the French Open. Money has never been a concern since. Given the lengthy list of blue-chip endorsement deals, with a combined reported value in the hundreds of millions and nearly $50 million in prize money, it should never be again, assuming he doesn\u2019t lose it all on the golf course to his other coach, Darren Cahill.\nThey play often. Cahill is the far superior golfer, so superior that he allows Vagnozzi and Sinner to team up and gives them a stroke on every hole. Sinner and Vagnozzi also get to play scramble style, which means they play both their balls from the better location on each shot, and record the best score on each hole.\nSinner and Vagnozzi recorded a rare win earlier this month in Mason, Ohio, where the Cincinnati Open is held. Cahill said that whatever grace and composure Sinner usually shows on the tennis court went out the window on the final green of the day, as he danced around with his arms in the air like he\u2019d won The Masters.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt was actually funny,\u201d Sinner says. \u201cI never played like this.\u201d\nNeedless to say, he does not rate himself as much of a golfer. Cahill, who has been playing the game for decades, has been trying to teach him. He describes Sinner as eminently coachable and willing to embrace a change, sometimes even in the middle of a match, though it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s had more success on the tennis court than the links. He has convinced his charge to embrace a data-driven approach to improving his game.\nCahill was at the forefront of embracing analytics in tennis. He has said it was his not-very-secret weapon when he was helping Lleyton Hewitt, Andre Agassi, and Simona Halep reach the No. 1 ranking.\nHe, Sinner and Vagnozzi embarked on a long-term process of gaining more power on his serve, more topspin on his forehand, and more variety on his backhand. Sinner used to almost always hit his backhand crosscourt. Opponents knew what was coming.\nDuring the past year, he said, Sinner\u2019s ability to pull the trigger on a backhand down the line has been a complete game-changer. They use the data to study opponents, too, with Cahill combing tendencies the evening before a match, then boiling down his findings to a 10 to 15-minute chat.\nBefore a recent match in Cincinnati against the rising Canadian Gabriel Diallo, they noticed that Diallo struggled when opponents returned his second serve from inside the baseline, even when they attacked his forehand, which is Diallo\u2019s strength. Sinner followed the plan and Diallo made error after error on his stronger side\n\u201cIt\u2019s always in the numbers,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cSometimes they just don\u2019t make sense at the time. You have to trust your gut a little bit as a tennis player. You have to be right in the moment.\u201d\nAfter the famous loss to Alcaraz in Paris, Sinner, Vagnozzi and Cahill spoke about how Sinner could have been slightly more courageous in the big moments, even as he and Alcaraz played at a ridiculously high level through the final set and into the sixth hour of the match. Then they moved on.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s tennis, it is a game and you have to enjoy it,\u201d Vagnozzi said. \u201cTo lose in the final like this, to be part of an unbelievable match, was something good in the end. It was not just bad, and for us, the goal is to give the 100 percent that we have.\n\u201cSo we went away from Paris with, not a smile for sure, but we knew that we gave 100 percent, so it was in peace.\u201d\nAnd then they went back to work, preparing for the grass. They focused heavily on raising the quality of Sinner\u2019s running forehand, something Alcaraz exploited throughout the French Open final.\nThat made sense to Sinner, because the grass rewards a big forehand more than the slow clay, the ball sliding through the slick court as Sinner skis down mountains. It worked. Alcaraz kept trying to break the sideline on Sinner\u2019s forehand side and drag him off the court. Sinner responded with crackerjack balls down the line and on sharp angles.\nEven the point in which he conceded the first set, thanks to the absurdly low backhand slice pickup that Alcaraz has made his trademark on the grass, included a running forehand that would have taken most players out of the rally.\n\u201cWe always have to improve because people, they catch up,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cThey know how I play now.\u201d\nThey know how he lives, too. Win or lose, he will be back in Sesto before too long.\n(Top photo: Claudio Lavenia / GC Images)"

      "text": "I wanted to be a little bit different from anyone else,\u201d Ben Shelton said recently in Madrid.\nHe was actually talking about his decision last year to sign a major deal with the small-but-growing Swiss shoe and apparel manufacturer On, rather than pursuing a certain American behemoth with a famous swoosh. (More on that in a bit.)\nAdvertisement\nThe Floridian was in the early days of a three-month sojourn in Europe that will last as long as he does at Wimbledon, which ends in mid-July. But Shelton, who is 21, could have been talking about anything to do with his budding tennis career, which has been the opposite of cookie-cutter.\nFootball (the American kind), in addition to tennis, until middle school? Different. Regular high school rather than a tennis academy? Different. Zero junior Grand Slam appearances? Different. Major doses of collegiate exuberance: the \u201cYeah!\u201d after big and small shots, the since-retired, hang-up-the-phone exclamation point on his wins? Different.\nAnd now that the clay swing is here, Shelton is once more cutting against the grain, moving on to Rome and the Italian Open as he treats a third-round loss in Spain last week as just another step in tackling something that has beguiled most American men for a good long while.\nThat would be that red clay.\nGO DEEPER\nWho is Ben Shelton? Meet the U.S. Open's new American phenom\nThe easy brutality of Shelton\u2019s tennis, which carried him to the semi-finals of the U.S. Open last year, can be deceiving. He can blast his serve at 150mph (241kph) and rocket forehands like few others, cutting points short at a breath or stealing momentum in a rally. At first glance, that gives him the sort of stereotypical, big American game that won\u2019t easily translate to the dirt.\nOther notable Yanks with those qualities have basically held their noses and endured these months of attritional-style tennis, counting the days until the grass and hard courts of summer.\nWell, that\u2019s not how Shelton rolls.\nHe spent the two weeks leading up to his departure for Spain at a hardcore clay-court boot camp. \u201cI worked on the things that I needed to: on the court, off the court, strength, fitness, moving,\u201d he said. \u201cI just really honed in.\u201d\nRather than enduring the soft stuff, Shelton is embracing it. This is something other American men have traditionally avoided, including his own father and coach, Bryan, a touring pro in the 1980s and 1990s. He often swerved red clay other than the French Open, and the odd other tournament, for most of his career. \u201cI realized too late that my game was pretty well-suited to it,\u201d he said after a practice session with his son last week.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI had this big kick-serve. I could push guys back. It opened up the court.\u201d He shook his head, still annoyed with his younger self, 30 years on.\nHis kid isn\u2019t letting such assumptions take root. He\u2019s taking a different approach. Late last year, Shelton asked Gabriel Echevarria, a veteran trainer, to join his team full-time as a strength and conditioning coach. It was another off-beat but logical move for someone who is as strong as a lumberjack and can run like a deer but remains prone to being wrong-footed or taken off-balance.\nEchevarria, who spent the past dozen years working for the U.S. Tennis Association and Tennis Australia, is Argentinian. He has a reputation for possessing a special knowledge of what it takes to attain proper movement and balance in tennis \u2014 especially on clay, the most common tennis surface in Argentina.\nThe ideal candidate to lead a crash course.\nThe most common mistake for clay-court newbies, Echevarria said, is sliding after the shot, which wastes time, rather than sliding into the shot. Certain shots require fewer steps, or smaller ones, or an extra step.\n\u201cIf we learn the skill, then we can develop the skill, but the first thing is to learn the proper way,\u201d Echevarria explains. \u201cOnce you learn the proper way, the model pattern, then we can develop that skill.\u201d\nShelton perceives Echevarria as a kind of clay whisperer, who has helped him to understand its idiosyncrasies. \u201cThe clay court is just a little bit different than the hard court,\u201d Shelton says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do the same things.\u201d\nSo, before each day of training, not in Monte Carlo or Barcelona where tournaments were happening but back home in Florida, Echevarria and Shelton\u2019s father would talk about what movement to focus on. Sometimes, it was learning how to run diagonally, which happens often on clay because of all the drop shots and slices. Other times, it was how to recover and shift from one shot to the next.\nAdvertisement\nThen, Shelton would head onto the court to try out what he had just learned for two or three hours. After a break and some lunch, afternoons consisted of more time on the court if Bryan felt it was necessary, and/or up to 90 minutes in the gym. It was gruelling, and exposed Shelton to the need to attune himself to what he found under his feet.\n\u201cEvery clay court is just a little bit different,\u201d he says.\n- If you\u2019d like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, please click here.\n\u201cThe bounces are unpredictable, so you can\u2019t always rely on short-hopping a ball \u2014 taking a ball early. You can get too close to the bounce or set your feet too early and the bounce can be unpredictable and go in a direction that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna go,\u201d he explains.\nThis is particularly true in Madrid, where the altitude (2,000ft/650m above sea level) adds speed to the flight of the ball, creating the kind of conditions that left Daniil Medvedev gesturing at his coaching team with impotent rage, frustrated by being in the right place at the wrong time, or maybe the other way around. Rome, softer, slower, at sea level, carries its own quirks.\nShelton? He isn\u2019t bothered. He\u2019s thoughtful, and he\u2019s here for it.\n\u201cYou have a little bit more time to play because, in most places, the clay is a little bit slower than hard courts, but actually here in Madrid, it\u2019s really fast,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut for the most part, the game slows down a bit. So you have more time, which I really like. But at the same time, you gotta learn how to use that time and learn how to defend against guys who also have more time.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nWhy you should be excited about this year's tennis clay court swing\nThese are the words of someone determined not to repeat their father\u2019s sins, someone who wants to be a little different than what a lot of the world might expect of a player with his unique brand of raw power and athleticism.It was not so different from the choice he made a little more than a year ago to roll the dice a bit in that deal with On. He had attended college at the University of Florida, a quintessential Nike school. So many of the biggest figures in American tennis and American sports have become synonymous with the swoosh over the years: John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, LeBron James, and on and on. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be one of 50 Nike guys,\u201d Shelton says. \u201cObviously it was also a big draw with On having probably the biggest icon in the history of tennis \u2014 you know, other than, like, Serena (Williams).\u201d Shelton is referencing Roger Federer, who acquired a significant stake in On five years ago, with the company building and launching a debut tennis apparel collection on the back of his involvement, along with that of Shelton and the women\u2019s world No 1 Iga Swiatek.\nAdvertisement\nHere was Shelton, a dude, a male tennis star no less, kind of, sort of, putting Federer a slot behind Serena Williams in the sport\u2019s pecking order, or at least putting them on the same plane. That doesn\u2019t happen too often.\nOn an unseasonably chilly Saturday evening in Madrid two weeks ago, Shelton took the court for his opening match against Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic. Machac, who is 23, has been tearing through some of the best players in the world this season. He plays a silky, deceptively powerful, all-court game and, like most central European players, largely grew up on clay. He may be ranked 35 spots below Shelton, who is now world No. 14, but he is the sort of player who has proven to be a nightmare for Americans on clay practically forever.\nShelton promptly tore through Machac, 6-0, 6-2. He used his power to push the Czech far behind the baseline, then moved forward himself, sending volleys and drop shots into the open court. He took advantage of that little extra time clay gives \u2014 \u201cI love time on the ball,\u201d he says \u2014 and jumped all over Machac\u2019s second serve, taking it early, claiming the momentum.\nTwo days later, Shelton was a point away from a likely cruise to a straight-set win over Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan. He struggled to handle a couple of Bublik\u2019s notoriously relentless drop shots, scrambling uncomfortably, and that allowed Bublik the crack of light he needed to climb back into the match. The Kazakh would win in three sets, 3-6, 7-6(2), 6-4.\nThis was the live version of the clay tutorial Shelton is seeking from Echevarria. Regardless of the defeat, it was a 180-degree turnaround from when he landed in Europe a year ago for his first red-clay season. \u201cLast year, I just had no idea what to expect,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s not his fault. There just isn\u2019t a lot of red clay in America, where players largely learn the game on hard courts.\nGO DEEPER\n20 years of Grand Slam drought: Which American man has come closest to winning since 2003?\nGrowing up in Florida, Shelton played some on green clay, which is harder to move on and produces far less predictable bounces than the red variety. Sloane Stephens, another Floridian and the 2018 French Open runner-up, calls red clay \u201cthe real stuff\u201d. Still, Shelton barely hit a ball on clay after he turned 16 and his focus shifted to college tennis, which is a hard-court affair.\nAdvertisement\nHis match today, Friday May 10, in Rome against Pavel Kotov will be just his 16th professional contest on clay, and that includes four wins in the U.S. Clay Court Championships in Houston early last month. He won that tournament and, while any ATP Tour title is nothing to sneeze at, Shelton knew he remained well short of being ready to contend at Roland Garros. So, the boot camp. The learning. The discomfort, the embrace of something not quite what he expected. Being, in a word, different.\nSome good tennis players become great by becoming a higher quality version of the player they were when they first broke into the tour. Others go from good to great by opening their mind to new skills.\nWhat\u2019s Shelton?\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a sponge,\u201d Echevarria says.\nShelton emerged from that boot camp believing he could thrive on clay, maybe not today or tomorrow, but eventually.\nClay forces him to become the kind of player he wants to be \u2014 a threat on every surface not simply because his serve is a game-altering cruise missile, but because he can move the ball around the court with spin and height over the net, and come into the net and volley into an open court and grind when the moment requires it.\n\u201cAmericans haven\u2019t had the best success in the clay-court season or at Roland Garros, but it\u2019d be really cool to change that narrative,\u201d he says. He also doesn\u2019t think he has a choice. Clay season lasts two months. It\u2019s not the four-week sprint grass season is. There are simply too many rankings points up for grabs on clay courts for someone with designs on reaching the top of the game to concede anything.\nAmericans aren\u2019t generally known for their patience. They like stuff now \u2014 immediate gratification. Focusing on process over results doesn\u2019t always come naturally. But once more, Shelton is a little different in that area, with some nudging from Echevarria and his father. He is approaching this clay swing as he did the boot camp, as an opportunity to learn, to collect information, to analyze how he has improved, to see if he can execute all those step patterns and all that sliding on the most famous crushed red brick in the world.\nAdvertisement\nIf winning happens, great. If not? Fine. Just like clay calls for, Team Shelton is playing a long game.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get frustrated,\u201d Echevarria says. \u201cWe don\u2019t worry about it because we know that, guess what? The French Open is going to be played on clay next year. It\u2019s going to be played on clay for 100 years.\u201d\n(Top photos: L-R: On; Centre: ATP Tour; design: Dan Goldfarb)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open\nFLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 There comes a time in every tennis player\u2019s career when they have to do something that truly scares them, something that cuts against how they have played the sport for a very long time. They\u2019ve exhausted all the minor tweaks and cosmetic fixes. Now they have to do the hard reset.\nAdvertisement\nJannik Sinner had to give up on playing like a human backboard and lean into crushing the ball. Iga \u015awi\u0105tek had to stop trying to crush every ball and lean back into the patience that first took her to the top.\nMaking adjustments like those in the middle of a Hall-of-Fame career is no small thing. They can involve fundamental changes in how a player holds the racket, swings the racket, or makes contact with a ball on any number of shots.\nFor years now, Coco Gauff has been dancing around a hard reset of the most important and most complex shot of them all.\nEver since she broke out at 15 with her run to the fourth round of Wimbledon, Gauff has had a feast-or-famine serve. When it\u2019s on, it\u2019s a nearly 130 mph weapon that explodes the ball off her racket. It sails past her opponent before she can move for it. When it\u2019s off, the 21-year-old American can give away a set\u2019s worth of points with double faults.\nIt\u2019s been off a lot lately. Gauff is 4-4 since she won the French Open in June, including a first-round exit at Wimbledon. She has hit 311 double faults in 2025, the most on the WTA Tour and 96 more than the next player back.\nAfter several resolutions not to lose matches to her own serve as much as her opponent, Gauff has stopped the tweaks and gradual adjustments. She is performing reconstructive surgery on a service motion that has been with her since the beginning. And she is doing it at the U.S. Open, her most important tournament of the year and the site of her greatest triumph.\n\u201cI needed to make a change, technical change to it, and I don\u2019t want to waste time continuing doing the wrong things,\u201d Gauff said in her pre-tournament news conference.\nDuring her first match at this year\u2019s tournament, against world No. 79 Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107, Gauff focused on form over firepower. She put first serves in with margin at under 100mph; she tossed the ball more accurately on her second serve, avoiding the drift to her right that makes her body collapse and sends the ball into the net.\nAdvertisement\nBut it was the foundations of Gauff\u2019s game \u2014 the athleticism, the ball retrieval, and the ability to produce quality on the run \u2014 that propelled her to a 6-4, 6-7(2), 7-5 win over the Australian, who was uncowed by the 24,000-strong Arthur Ashe stadium faithful and came close to producing the upset.\nGauff tried tweaking her grip under the guidance of Matt Daly during the past year, but the fundamental flaws in the serve remained. It\u2019s a credit to her other skills that she was able to win another Grand Slam as well as the Tour Finals and climb to No. 2 (now No. 3) in the rankings in that time.\nBut Gauff did not want to succeed like that. She did not want to leave her results up to whether or not she happened into a good-enough serving week. It felt like a waste of time. And when the time to stop wasting time on an elite player\u2019s serve arrives, the person to call is Gavin MacMillan.\nMacMillan, 59, is a biomechanics expert who does not dabble in psychological explanations for double faults. Players don\u2019t double-fault because they are under stress, he says. They double-fault because their service motion is not as efficient or as repeatable as it needs to be for them to execute it under pressure.\nThat\u2019s where Aryna Sabalenka was three years ago when she gave in to her mindset and fitness coach, Jason Stacy, and brought MacMillan in to revamp her service motion. Within weeks, she had gone from one of the sport\u2019s punch lines to the U.S. Open semifinals, her double faults dropping into the single digits per match.\n\u201cI was really desperate for changes, and I was ready to change whatever, to change my serve and to get better and to finally get back on track with my serve,\u201d Sabalenka said of her work with MacMillan, which continued on and off the past couple of years.\nBut then Gauff learned that MacMillian, a Canadian educated in America and based in South Africa, was available. And then her team was on the phone with him. And then they were practicing serves in the rain at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center last week.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt was, like, a very sudden decision,\u201d Gauff said.\nThere is no guarantee that Gauff will achieve the same success that Sabalenka did. But Sabalenka said she thinks her improvement happened so quickly because she\u2019d hit rock bottom. That made her willing to do anything and everything that MacMillan told her.\nHe told her that she was tossing the ball completely wrong, her knuckles facing the sky instead of her palm. He told her that she was pointing her racket in the wrong direction, her strings facing the ground and the back fence. The die was cast before she made contact because her left hand was in the wrong position after she released the ball. That prevented her scapula (shoulder blade) from releasing, pulling Sabalenka down instead of helping her rise to meet the ball.\nSabalenka listened to what he told her. Now she is world No. 1 and defending U.S. Open champion.\nMacMillan didn\u2019t set out to be a service wonk. He set out to be a pro. He attended San Jose State University, where he played tennis. Like a lot of people who play tennis, he struggled with his serve. Since the 1990s, he has coached in various disciplines \u2014 weightlifting, combat, rugby \u2014 but he kept coming back to the serve. He spent countless hours studying the motion of the master, Pete Sampras, the ultimate in that lethal combination of consistency, power and placement.\nHis light bulb moment occurred when he read \u201cThe Spinal Engine\u201d by Serge Gracovetsky, a Russian-born engineer and physicist who theorized that the spine can be the primary driver of movement, power, and locomotion if people can figure out how to use it properly.\n\u201cHumans are really limited by joint angles,\u201d MacMillan said in an interview last year. \u201cWe usually have to align them and it\u2019s often at 90 degrees.\u201d\nHe argues that serving a tennis ball involves using the shoulder the same way quarterbacks throw a football and pitchers throw a baseball, but on a different plane. Like them, tennis players need to create a right angle from their elbow to their armpit and down the side of their bodies, while the front side flexes backwards and then snaps forward.\nAdvertisement\nThere\u2019s a jump and an arm rotation that come into play as well, but the serve only works if the body gets into that initial position. Even a slight shift, like forgetting to twist the hand that tosses the ball and face the palm toward the sky, can throw it off.\nIt sounds simple, especially when MacMillan is explaining it, with illustrations of Sampras and Novak Djokovic and their perfect positions. But it can be a lot to take in, especially during a nearly relentless tennis schedule. Gauff will more likely than not need longer than this tournament to figure it out. Sabalenka needed a couple weeks of repetitions before she felt like her new motion belonged to her.\nIf that sounds impossibly fast to learn a new service motion \u2014 golfers can take months, even years, to remake their swings \u2014 it\u2019s because it is for mere mortals. People like Sabalenka and Gauff have built their careers on an elite ability to make their bodies move the way they want them to, or in this case, the way a coach is telling them they should move them.\nWhat really matters is that Gauff\u2019s new motion is not for the U.S. Open. It is for the rest of her career. Gauff could have been satisfied with her year. Before winning the title at Roland Garros in Paris, she made the finals of the Madrid and Italian Opens. But that\u2019s not who she is. Winning isn\u2019t winning when she is dumping serves into the net or sending them flying off the court.\n\u201cI know where I want to see my game in the future,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to waste time playing the way I don\u2019t want to play.\u201d\n(Top photo: Anthony Behar / Sipa via Imagn Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open, and you can follow all the U.S. Open coverage, too.\nWelcome to the U.S. Open briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories on each day of the tournament.\nOn Day 7, a star got back to a long-awaited milestone, the tournament\u2019s five-set heroes hit a wall, and a defending champion escaped adversity.\nNaomi Osaka climbs back after four years away\nHere\u2019s something a little hard to believe. The last time Naomi Osaka was in the second week of a Grand Slam, much of the world remained half-closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdvertisement\nThe second week of the 2021 Australian Open included a snap lockdown. It had Osaka playing matches in nearly empty stadiums before she beat Jennifer Brady to win the fourth of her four Grand Slam titles to date. Osaka had yet to be vulnerable in public about the impact of the sport on her well-being. She hadn\u2019t taken any of her breaks from the tour to manage that impact, nor her 16-month hiatus for pregnancy and childbirth.\nBut with a stirring three-set win over Daria Kasatkina of Australia on Saturday, Osaka set up a fourth-round U.S. Open date with Coco Gauff, a can\u2019t-miss match if ever there was one. It\u2019s where Osaka wished she had been for going on two years, ever since she started her tennis comeback in 2024.\nShe has come close twice. At both the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year, she fell one match short.\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve come back, I kind of wanted everything to happen really quickly,\u201d Osaka said after her 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 win. It took the Wimbledon loss to revert to focusing on process rather than results, as she had been doing through most of last year. Then things turned; now they have turned back.\n\u201cAs a journey, it\u2019s not something that I really pictured, but I\u2019m glad to be living it,\u201d she said.\nThe run is also a victory for Tomasz Wiktorowski, Iga \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s former coach who replaced Patrick Mouratoglou on team Osaka in July. Mouratoglou replaced Wim Fissette last year. Fissette, who helped Osaka to two Grand Slam titles, is now coaching \u015awi\u0105tek and won Wimbledon with her.\n\u2014 Matt Futterman\nJannik Sinner meets a familiar enemy \u2014 and prevails again\nThere are two players who have really pushed Jannik Sinner at the Grand Slams this year \u2014 who are not named Carlos Alcaraz.\nOne is Bulgaria\u2019s Grigor Dimitrov, who led the world No. 1 by two sets before injury cruelly struck at Wimbledon. Saturday at the U.S. Open, Canada\u2019s Denis Shapovalov made his party of one a duet. Shapovalov won the first set, had a point for a double-break lead in the third and another one for a break back in the final game of the fourth before ultimately succumbing to Sinner 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.\nAdvertisement\nThere are some obvious links between the two. Both are flashy shotmakers who play with a single-handed backhand, which is increasingly rare in professional tennis. Both used the backhand slice very effectively to move the Italian out of position before pulling the trigger on both wings into the space he had vacated. Both also served exceptionally well for the period in which they were in the ascendancy.\nThe extent to which this is a repeatable formula outside of serving is limited, as very few players on the tour have as much upside on the backhand slice combined with ball speed to keep Sinner off balance. Saturday was still a reminder that he isn\u2019t invulnerable and can get flustered, especially in the heat of the afternoon.\nAs he said himself with a smile in his post-match news conference: \u201cI\u2019m not a machine, you know. I also struggle sometimes.\u201d\n\u2014 Charlie Eccleshare\nThe U.S. Open\u2019s five-setters hit a wall in New York\nThere was a grim inevitability about Flavio Cobolli\u2019s mid-match retirement against his compatriot Lorenzo Musetti Saturday. Cobolli had 10 sets in his legs, and that tends to be detrimental to a player\u2019s chances in a major these days, if not a death knell against an opponent of the No. 10 seed\u2019s quality. A right arm injury was what did it for Cobolli on this occasion, who retired down 6-3, 6-2, 2-0.\nLater that, Kamil Majchrzak had to retire hurt in the first set of his match against Leandro Reidi. In his previous match, Majchrzak had beaten No. 9 seed Karen Khachanov and saved match points before winning in a fifth-set tiebreak. He won the first three games against Riedi but was visibly hampered from the start and never looked like finishing the first set, let alone reaching the third round. It was little surprise he should succumb to the physical toll that a match longer than 4 1/2 hours puts on a player\u2019s body.\nAdvertisement\nAnd then Daniel Altmaier, who beat Stefanos Tsitsipas in five in the previous round, suffered the same fate as Majchrzak and Cobolli against Alex de Minaur.\nA similar dynamic played out at the Australian Open in January, when there was a sequence of retirements and physical blowouts on the middle weekend from players who couldn\u2019t withstand the rigors of consistent five-set tennis.\nAt first glance, it suggests playing five sets at Grand Slams is not entirely fit for purpose. If match lengths have increased and the depth of talent on the tour has grown to such an extent that a couple of five-set matches put too much of a physical strain on a player, then there is an issue.\nThe sheer volume of tennis played has also increased, however. The rest of the tournaments on the ATP Tour are three sets, but the biggest tournaments below the Grand Slams, the Masters 1000s, have extended from one week to 12 days. It is not that a format played four times per year, with days off between matches, is an outlier so much that five sets is an even more physically taxing cherry on top of an ever-growing cake. That growth then dilutes the quality of the most visible and important product in tennis, with the early rounds wearing down players who are carrying accumulated fatigue from the rest of the calendar.\nThe best players don\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t become embroiled in multiple five-set matches early on, and a seed like Cobolli might feel he only has himself to blame after being taken the distance in matches he should have won a lot more comfortably. However, the ultimate result of matches getting longer and more physical is that on the men\u2019s side, only a few players can be truly competitive at the sharp end of slams. For most, a couple of five-set matches and that\u2019s them pretty much done.\n\u2014 Charlie Eccleshare\nOther notable results on Day 7\n\u2022 Coco Gauff (3) set up the Osaka clash with an ordinary win during what has so far for her been an extraordinary tournament. Gauff beat No. 28 seed Magdalena Fr\u0119ch 6-3, 6-1 in a straightforward match that followed two challenging, surreal and at times emotional wins on Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nAdvertisement\n\u2022 Andrey Rublev (15) survived a scare against Coleman Wong, the qualifier from Hong Kong who this week became its first man to win a Grand Slam match in the Open era. Wong led by a set and came back to force a decider from 2-1 down, but Rublev prevailed 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.\n\u2022 Iga \u015awi\u0105tek (2) produced an even more remarkable comeback to open the night session. Anna Kalinskaya (29) led the Wimbledon champion 5-1 on Arthur Ashe Stadium, but \u015awi\u0105tek fought her way into a tiebreak and took the set and then the match a little while later, 7-6(2), 6-4.\n\u2022 And Tommy Paul (14) almost did the impossible against Alexander Bublik (23) in his second five-setter on Arthur Ashe Stadium in a row. Despite being on the edge physically for at least the last two sets, he ran Bublik close before bowing out as the Kazakh triumphed 7-6(5), 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-1.\nShot of the day\nJannik Sinner and Denis Shapovalov produced one of the points of the tournament.\nUp next\n\ud83c\udfbe Jessica Pegula (4) vs. Ann Li\n11 a.m. ET on ESPN2/ESPN+\nLi, who reached her first WTA Tour final in seven months at the final warm-up tournament before this U.S. Open, gets another crack at Pegula at a Grand Slam in 2025. They met in the first round of the French Open, in which Li, 25, took her more experienced and higher-ranked opponent to a second-set tiebreak before ultimately losing.\n\ud83c\udfbe Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 vs. Taylor Townsend\n2 p.m. ET (estimated) on ESPN2/ESPN+\nTownsend, who has become the star of the tournament the past few days, gets a singles matchup in which most of the intrigue comes from doubles pedigree. Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 has a major singles-court advantage with her two Grand Slam titles, but she and Townsend are both Grand Slam doubles champions. Townsend used her doubles skills to fillet No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva in the previous round; Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 will be able to see them coming.\n\ud83c\udfbe Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mach\u00e1\u010d (21) vs. Taylor Fritz (4)\n4 p.m. ET (estimated) on ESPN2/ESPN+\nAnother match full of intrigue, for very different reasons. Mach\u00e1\u010d, a Czech with all the talent in the world but whose body has a habit of letting him down, last met Fritz, the 2024 U.S. Open finalist, at January\u2019s United Cup. They played the men\u2019s singles rubber in the mixed international team competition, and Mach\u00e1\u010d led 7-6(4), 5-6 \u2014 after Fritz had saved two match points down 5-2 in the second set \u2014 when he abruptly retired with cramp in his legs.\nAdvertisement\n\ud83c\udfbe Elena Rybakina (9) vs. Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1\n9:30 p.m. ET (estimated) on ESPN2/ESPN+\nA fascinating contrast of styles between two Wimbledon champions closes the night session on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Rybakina\u2019s devastating power and linear attack stand against Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1\u2019s trigonometric variety, but both players execute their games with a languid effortlessness that emphasizes their talent. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 will look to keep the ball out of the Kazakh\u2019s strike zone, and Rybakina will look to get her Czech opponent outside the sidelines before it happens to her.\nU.S. Open men\u2019s draw 2025\nU.S. Open women\u2019s draw 2025\nTell us what you noticed on the seventh day \u2026\n(Illustration: Eamonn Dalton / The Athletic / Getty Images)"
