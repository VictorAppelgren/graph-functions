  "title": "Live The Idyllic Greek Vacation Life All At Time At Costa Navarino",
  "description": "A vacation life in the unspoiled, coastal Peloponnese can be yours all the time at Costa Navarino",
  "content": "I had long heard about Costa Navarino, a more than 2,400-acre development in Greece\u2019s Peloponnese that has been a game changer in the country\u2019s hospitality scene ever since its first phase opened in 2010. Actually, calling it a development is something of a misnomer- this is a place that\u2019s a full-scale destination and a sustainable one at that, which respects the surrounding land.\n\nLocated in the Greek region of Messinia in the southwest, Costa Navarino brings an area to the limelight that locals know about but Americans largely don\u2019t. I, for one, hadn\u2019t heard about it until Costa Navarino came into the picture. Until then, I always associated Greece with Athens, Mykonos, and Santorini.\n\nCosta Navarino comprises four hotels: The Romanos, a Luxury Collection Resort, The Westin Resort Costa Navarino, W Costa Navarino, and Mandarin Oriental, Costa Navarino. Then there are four golf courses, multiple spas and gyms, upwards of 40 restaurants- each tastier than the next, boutiques with fantastic shopping, tennis courts, other sports facilities, and the list goes on and on.\n\nFrom my recent visit, I can tell you that there\u2019s so much to see and do in the Peloponnese that you would need a lifetime at least to explore the region to the fullest. The ancient sites are endless, the beaches are uncrowded and spectacular, the local towns are full of visit-worthy restaurants and stores, and taking a scenic drive along the coastline is just one of the many ways to explore.\n\nWith the residences at Costa Navarino, this dreamy Greek life can be yours all the time. The real estate offering here features multiple neighborhoods and home types to meet a variety of tastes, but what makes them special is that they integrate beautifully into the landscape and impart a distinct sense of place. When I walked through the front doors of the villas I toured, it was clear that I was in the Peloponnese.\n\nIn my recent interview with Evgenios Dendrinos, who is the managing director of Costa Navarino\u2019s developer TEMES, I learned more about the appeal of calling this vacation destination \u201chome.\u201d\n\nWhy should someone buy a home in Costa Navarino? What's so special about the development?\n\nThe residential proposition at Costa Navarino presents a rare opportunity to own a home within a sustainably driven destination, in one of the most pristine coastal regions of the Mediterranean.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the few beachfront developments in the Med offering such proximity to the sea, within a fully serviced, gated, and low-density environment, where 90% of the land will remain green forever.\n\nThe properties are integrated into the landscape, and homeowners benefit from privileged resort access, high-quality infrastructure, premium property management, and a multitude of authentic experiences, including four golf courses, various sports, wellness, gastronomy, and recreational activities. Owning a home means becoming part of a growing community that is actively engaged with the local culture and surroundings. It\u2019s a destination designed for long-term living \u2014 with the infrastructure, services, and quality of life to match.\n\nThis exclusive residential offering has garnered strong international interest, with over 85% of the villas within the 130-hectare beachfront Navarino Dunes area, already sold or reserved. This diverse owners\u2019 community includes families from across the world\u2014among them USA, north, central and west Europe, and Greece.\n\nHow many homes are there and what types of properties are available?\n\nCosta Navarino offers a curated range of private residences, featuring bespoke (off-plan) and turn-key villas with 5 to 7 bedrooms, in plots ranging from 1,570 m\u00b2 - 2,200 m\u00b2 and interiors from 470 m\u00b2 to 630 m\u00b2.\n\nCan you describe the different neighborhoods and how each is distinct?\n\nSea Dunes, just 30 meters from the beach, offers large, low-rise 6-bedroom villas, affording sweeping Ionian views, ample space and privacy. They are offered off-plan, with extensive customization options.\n\nOlive Grove has turnkey 5 bedroom villas with extensive customization options. Owners enjoy stunning sea and golf views from garden level, in the privacy of verdant olive groves.\n\nWhat is the price range?\n\nCurrent pricing starts from \u20ac6.5 million for off-plan residences at the Sea Dunes neighborhood and from \u20ac6.4 million for turn-key residences at the Olive Grove neighborhood.\n\nWhat is the design style of the properties? Are there varying styles?\n\nThe architecture blends contemporary luxury with bioclimatic design, using natural local materials, stone facades, and earth tones in perfect harmony with the landscape. Villas are designed with planted roofs, open layouts blending indoor and outdoor living, and extensive customization options. The strict design guidelines ensure full alignment with the region\u2019s traditional architectural patterns.\n\nWhat benefits do homeowners have?\n\nOwners enjoy access to resort facilities (golf, spa, sports, kids\u2019 programs, leisure activities, authentic experiences, etc), concierge and property management, membership at the exclusive Owners\u2019 Club, 24/7 security, and rental management programs, for renting their villa when they\u2019re not using it\n\nWhat about the surrounding infrastructure?\n\nCosta Navarino is located close to Kalamata International Airport (approx. 45 mins), which offers international and domestic connections. The marina in Pylos and the Bay of Navarino in general, provide safe anchorages for private yachts, sailing boats and cruise ships. From Kalamata to Pylos, the surrounding cities and villages offer a variety of experiences, from dining to nightlife, as well as well-equipped hospitals, commercial and shopping districts, including Navarino Agora: a modern marketplace for dining, shopping, and cultural events.\n\nHow safe is Costa Navarino and the wider area?\n\nAll resort areas at Costa Navarino offer a gated, secure community with 24/7 services. The wider Messinia region is known for its low crime rates, warm hospitality, and strong local traditions, making it a safe and welcoming place to live year-round.",

      "text": "The story of Costa Navarino is as old as Greece itself. It was wise King Nestor, legendary ruler of ancient Pylos, who first gave meaning to the word \u201chospitality\u201d when he befriended complete strangers. This is a place where friendship can always be found, where happiness is measured by footsteps in the sand.\nCosta Navarino is located in Messinia in the southwest Peloponnese, in one of the most unspoiled and breathtaking landscapes in the Mediterranean. Its philosophy is driven by a genuine desire to promote Messinia, while protecting and preserving not only its natural beauty but also a remarkable cultural heritage spanning 4,500 years.\nCosta Navarino is currently home to four 5-star premium resorts, Mandarin Oriental Costa Navarino, W Costa Navarino, The Romanos, a Luxury Collection Resort and The Westin Resort Costa Navarino, three spa centres, four signature 18-hole golf courses, over 40 dining venues, a wide range of sports, outdoor and cultural activities, plus an array of 5-star services.

Located in the heart of Navarino Dunes just a few meters from the beach or nestled among verdant olive groves, Navarino Residences offer much more than a residential proposition \u2013 they are a way of life.\nNamed \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Emerging Golf Destination 2022\u201d by World Golf Awards, Costa Navarino offers a world-class golf experience with its four 18-hole signature courses: The Dunes Course, set in diverse natural scenery with spectacular sea and river views, takes its name from the tall dunes that separate several holes from a golden beach, The Bay Course offers panoramic sea and mountain views, with two holes playing along the historic Bay of Navarino while The International Olympic Academy Golf Course and The Hills Course offer players a challenging game and breath taking sunsets.\nSituated near the attractive town of Pylos in Messinia, Costa Navarino upholds the highest standards of environmental and social responsibility through all development stages from construction to operation.
