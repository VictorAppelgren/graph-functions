  "description": "Kraken executive Mark Greenberg says the exchange\u2019s xStocks are \u201cat the forefront\u201d of a market shift, with plans to expand into Europe as the sector nears $392 million in value.",
  "content": "Kraken exec says tokenized stocks will let you \u2018buy coffee with Tesla\u2019 originally appeared on TheStreet.\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Kraken is taking a big swing at the emerging market for tokenized equities, launching a product it calls xStocks \u2014 24/7, permissionless, and non-custodial tokenized stocks available worldwide.\n\n\u201cFirst, so xStocks are tokenized stocks. They're 24-7, non-custodial, permissionless, available anywhere. And we've launched a few months ago the first 60 of them, offering them on the Kraken platform through much of the world and hopefully in Europe soon,\u201d said Mark Greenberg, Vice President and General Manager, Consumer Product and Business at Kraken in a conversation with Scott Melker on The Street Roundtable.\n\nCurrently, the product is available in Kraken\u2019s \u201crest of world\u201d markets, spanning Latin America, most of Asia, and the Middle East. \u201cOver time, we hope to offer them, as I said, in Europe as well. We'll hopefully be able to do that in the next few weeks,\u201d Greenberg said.\n\nJoin the discussion with Scott Melker on Roundtable here.\n\nThe appeal is clear for markets with limited equity access. \u201cEven as a Canadian, I don't have a lot of access to certain equity. So I was trying to buy an equity adjunct in Europe the other day and turns out actually my broker doesn't even allow that. What we're planning to do here with xStocks is allow folks around the world to buy stocks in everything\u2026 not everybody can buy especially fractional components of that if they only have say 10 or 20 dollars that they want to put into something like Tesla.\u201d\n\nThe infrastructure is fully backed. \u201cThe stocks are held one to one backed in a SPV, a special purpose vehicle in Jersey. And then they are\u2026 minted into tokens through a prospectus in Europe and then offered. And so basically every time you mint one of these tokens, a share is bought and then those tokens can be sold, bought or sold on Kraken or on Dex's or on lots of other exchanges.\u201d\n\nGreenberg contrasted Kraken\u2019s approach with more limited tokenized offerings from big institutions. \u201cA lot of these early things, right? Like you could only buy and sell it back to the issuer\u2026 You couldn't even send it to yourself somewhere else\u2026 that's actually what we were trying to avoid\u2026 And for sure, xStocks, I think, is at the forefront of that.\u201d\n\nKraken also plans to integrate tokenized stocks with traditional equities and everyday spending.\n\n\u201cSoon we're going to be launching a card in Europe and the UK\u2026 if you want to hold your\u2026 money in Tesla\u2026 you can absolutely do that. And then you can buy your coffee with it\u2026 you can do that with Tesla or Fartcoin or USDC.\u201d\n\nThe card launch, Greenberg added, is \u201choping just a few weeks away, actually for our launch in Europe.\u201d\n\nAs per RWA.XYZ, a data tracker for tokenized real-world assets, the market for tokenized stocks is showing steady growth.\n\nThe sector\u2019s total value currently stands at $391.70 million, up 0.30% from 30 days ago. Monthly transfer volume has surged 34.01% to $314.69 million, indicating heightened trading activity. The number of monthly active addresses is 53,194, up 1.57%, while the total number of holders has climbed 14.90% to 61,160, signaling expanding adoption across global markets.\n\nThe largest tokenized equity by value is EXOD (Exodus Movement Inc. Class A), issued via Securitize on the Algorand network, with a market value of $281.6 million and an 83.72% share of the tracked total.\n\nOther notable assets include TSLAx (Tesla Inc.) on Solana with $9.93 million in value, up 102.9% over the past month, and MSTRx (MicroStrategy Inc.) at $4.26 million, up 56.53%. Traditional market heavyweights like SPYx (S&P 500 ETF), NVDAx (NVIDIA Corp), and AAPLx (Apple Inc.) also feature prominently, reflecting investor interest in blue-chip tokenized equities.\n\nKraken exec says tokenized stocks will let you \u2018buy coffee with Tesla\u2019 first appeared on TheStreet on Aug 8, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 8, 2025, where it first appeared.",
