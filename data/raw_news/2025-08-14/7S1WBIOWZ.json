  "description": "You should stop using the ESR HaloLock immediately.",
  "content": "\u2022 ESR is recalling the HaloLock power bank over fire concerns.\n\u2022 Affected power banks were sold on Amazon and other retailers.\n\u2022 You can email ESR a photo of your device for a refund.\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nIf you have an ESR HaloLock wireless power bank, you should stop using it immediately and contact the company for a refund.\n\nIn a post Thursday, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission warned that ESR is recalling certain models of the HaloLock wireless power bank because they're at risk of overheating and catching on fire.\n\nAlso: Finally, I found a portable charger that checks all of my boxes for traveling\n\nUsers have reported nine instances of a HaloLock igniting, causing about $20,000 in damage. There are no reported injuries. That's a small number, but the company felt the fires alone were enough to warrant a voluntary recall.\n\nAbout 24,000 units are a part of this recall, plus almost 10,000 more in Canada. ZDNET has reviewed other products in the ESR HaloLock family, and they were all generally well-received.\n\nHow to identify the recalled ESR powerbank\n\nThe ESR Halolock was sold on Amazon.com, Homedepot.com and Esrtech.com from September 2023 through July 2025 for between $32 and $40. Specifically, you're looking for model numbers 2G520, 2G505B and 2G512B. \"ESR\" is printed on the back, the model number is printed on the right side, and there are five circular LED display lights on one side.\n\nWhat to do if you have a recalled ESR HaloLock\n\nIf you have an affected model, first stop using it. Write the word \"Recalled\" in permanent marker on the device and send a photo of it to support@esrtech.com. ESR will review your submission and, if approved, send you a full refund. The USCPSC warns that you shouldn't throw the powerbank in the trash, the general recycling, or even in used battery recycling boxes found at retail stores, like you might a normal lithium-ion battery. Instead, dispose of it through your local household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center.\n\nYou can call the manufacturer at 888-990-0280 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT Monday through Friday for more information.\n\nAlso: The best power banks you can buy in 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nThis announcement comes just after Anker issued a recall for a popular power bank at the end of July and then another about a week later. It also comes as airlines have started to change policies about taking power banks on planes over fire concerns.\n\nProblems aren't happening often, but the National Business Aviation Association said that \"a smoke, fire or extreme heat incident\" involving a lithium-ion battery takes place on a plane more than once per week in the US.\n\nKeep up with my work on Google by adding ZDNET as a preferred source.",

      "text": "Household Hazardous Waste (HHW)\nEPA considers some leftover household products that can catch fire, react, or explode under certain circumstances, or that are corrosive or toxic as household hazardous waste. Products, such as paints, cleaners, oils, batteries, and pesticides can contain hazardous ingredients and require special care when you dispose of them.\nOn this page:\nSafe Management of HHW\nTo avoid the potential risks associated with household hazardous wastes, it is important that people always monitor the use, storage, and disposal of products with potentially hazardous substances in their homes. Improper disposal of HHW can include pouring them down the drain, on the ground, into storm sewers, or in some cases putting them out with the regular trash.\nThe dangers of such disposal methods might not be immediately obvious, but improper disposal of these wastes can pollute the environment and pose a threat to human health. Certain types of HHW have the potential to cause physical injury to sanitation workers, contaminate septic tanks or wastewater treatment systems if poured down drains or toilets. They can also present hazards to children and pets if left around the house.\nSome quick tips for the safe handling of household hazardous wastes include:\n- Follow any instructions for use and storage provided on product labels carefully to prevent any accidents at home.\n- Be sure to read product labels for disposal directions to reduce the risk of products exploding, igniting, leaking, mixing with other chemicals, or posing other hazards on the way to a disposal facility.\n- Never store hazardous products in food containers; keep them in their original containers and never remove labels. Corroding containers, however, require special handling. Call your local hazardous materials official or fire department for instructions.\n- When leftovers remain, never mix HHW with other products. Incompatible products might react, ignite, or explode, and contaminated HHW might become unrecyclable.\n- Check with your local environmental, health or solid waste agency for more information on HHW management options in your area.\n- If your community doesn\u2019t have a year-round collection system for HHW, see if there are any designated days in your area for collecting HHW at a central location to ensure safe management and disposal.\n- If your community has neither a permanent collection site nor a special collection day, you might be able to drop off certain products at local businesses for recycling or proper disposal. Some local garages, for example, may accept used motor oil for recycling. Check around.\n- Remember, even empty containers of HHW can pose hazards because of the residual chemicals that might remain so handle them with care also.\n- Follow these instructions for disposal of consumer e-cigarettes.\nReducing HHW in Your Home\nConsider reducing your purchase of products that contain hazardous ingredients. Learn about the use of alternative methods or products\u2014without hazardous ingredients\u2014for some common household needs. When shopping for items such as multipurpose household cleaners, toilet cleaners, laundry detergent, dish soap, dishwashing machine pods and gels, bug sprays and insect pest control, consider shopping for environmentally friendly, natural products or search online for simple recipes you can use to create your own.\nBelow are some ideas to get you started. Additional information is available from EPA's Safer Choice program.\n| Hazardous Waste Source Reduction around the Home | |\n|---|---|\n| Drain Cleaner | Use a plunger or plumber's snake. |\n| Glass Cleaner | Mix one tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice in one quart of water. Spray on and use newspaper to dry. |\n| Furniture Polish | Mix one teaspoon of lemon juice in one pint of mineral or vegetable oil and wipe furniture. |\n| Rug Deodorizer | Liberally sprinkle carpets with baking soda. Wait at least 15 minutes and vacuum. Repeat if necessary. |\n| Silver Polish | Boil two to three inches of water in a shallow pan with one teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of baking soda and a sheet of aluminum foil. Totally submerge silver and boil for two to three more minutes. Wipe away tarnish and repeat if necessary. |\n| Mothballs | Use cedar chips, lavender flowers, rosemary, mints or white peppercorns. |\nRegulating HHW\nWhile most hazardous wastes that are ignitable, reactive, corrosive or toxic in America are regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Congress developed an exclusion for household waste. Under this exclusion, found in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 261.4, wastes generated by normal household activities (e.g., routine house and yard maintenance) are excluded from the definition of hazardous waste. Specifically, wastes covered by the household hazardous waste exclusion must satisfy two criteria:\n- The waste must be generated by individuals on the premise of a temporary or permanent residence, and\n- The waste stream must be composed primarily of materials found in wastes generated by consumers in their homes.\nEPA interprets this exclusion to include household-like areas, such as bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day-use recreation areas.\nAlthough household hazardous waste is excluded from Subtitle C of RCRA, it is regulated under Subtitle D of this law as a solid waste. In other words, household hazardous waste is regulated on the state and local level."

      "text": "Anker just recalled another 5 power banks - how to get a refund or free replacement\nJust days after recalling its A1263 power bank due to fire concerns, Anker is issuing another recall -- this time for five different devices.\nEarlier this year, Anker found a manufacturing issue in lithium-ion battery cells from a certain vendor. The company says the likelihood of any problem arising from this issue is minimal, but out of an abundance of caution, it's issuing a voluntary recall of several power bank models.\nAlso: I've used this tiny, affordable power bank for over a year now - here's why\nThe Anker Power Bank models A1257 and A1647, the Anker MagGo Power Bank model A1652, and the Anker Zolo Power Bank models A1681 and A1689 all potentially have faulty cells. If you have one, Anker says to stop using it immediately, even if it looks fine, because there's a risk of overheating, melting, smoke, or catching fire.\nIf your device is affected by this recall, you can either request a replacement or a gift card in a comparable amount to use on the Anker website.\nHere's how to tell if your power bank is affected by this recall.\nCheck the model number on the back or side of your power bank. If it's A1257, A1647, A1652, A1681, or A1689, go to the next step. If not, you're safe.\nIf your model number was included, verify your serial number or submit your proof of purchase using the online recall form at http://www.anker.com/rc2506-form. Anker notes that you should check your serial number very carefully, paying attention to similar-looking letters like \"1,\" \"L,\" and \"l,\" \"2\" and \"Z,\" and \"0\" (zero) and \"O\" (the letter O) are easily confused. None of the affected serial numbers will have the letters \"O\" or \"I.\"\nHow to dispose of your recalled power bank\nIf Anker has confirmed that your device is recalled, don't dispose of it until you get confirmation that your device qualifies. Because lithium-ion batteries are prone to fires if they're tossed in the general trash or recycling stream, you'll usually take them to battery drop-off boxes, often found in hardware or retail stores; however, recalled lithium-ion batteries need to be taken to a Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) collection center.\nAlso: The best power banks you can buy: Expert tested and reviewed\nAnker didn't name the third-party battery vendor, but it will be interesting to see if any other companies used cells from this vendor too and end up issuing recalls. Power banks have been in the news lately, with Southwest Airlines instituting a new policy that your charger has to be in sight while using it, and China banning recalled or uncertified power banks from planes entirely.\nAnker currently makes around 30 different devices for charging your equipment, one of which topped our list of the best power banks you can buy.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "Today, nearly every adult and many kids carry a cell phone, tablet or laptop. While their individual tasks differ, these devices have one thing in common: they\u2019re all powered by rechargeable, lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries.\nAt any given time, there could be more than 1,000 Li-ion powered devices on board an airliner, while an international business jet might easily be flying with a few dozen. Despite their popularity, few people realize the dangers posed by Li-ion batteries.\nHazards run the gamut, from overheating, to emitting smoke, to bursting into flames or even exploding \u2013 spewing bits of white hot gel in all directions. In fact, a Li-ion fire can begin as a seemingly harmless overheat and erupt into a serious hazard in a matter of seconds.\nFAA data shows the scope of the threat: In 2023, more than one Li-ion incident occurred aboard an aircraft each week. Specifically, the agency said there were 208 issues with lithium ion battery packs, 111 with e-cigarettes and vaping devices, 68 with cell phones and 60 with laptop computers. (The FAA doesn\u2019t offer incident data by aircraft type.)\nThankfully, the data shows the chances of encountering an unstable mobile device aboard a business aircraft are small. But so is the possibility of a passenger experiencing a heart attack \u2013 yet many business aircraft carry defibrillators.\nThermal Runaway\nThe threat with lithium ion batteries is known as thermal runaway. When a Li-ion battery overheats due to some previous damage that creates a short circuit, the unit continues a catastrophic internal chain reaction until it melts or catches fire.\nWhile thermal runaway incidents are rare, the potential risks inherent in just one such occurrence aboard a business aircraft far outweigh the efforts needed to prevent it.\n\u201cMost instances of thermal runaway are owner induced by dropping or substantially damaging their electronic device,\u201d said John Cox, a retired airline pilot and founder of Safety Operating Systems. Another cause is the use of gray market charging devices. \u201cYou can buy one on the streets of New York for five bucks,\u201d Cox said, \u201cbut the likelihood of that [charger] creating a battery overheat is significantly higher\u201d than when using an OEM charger and cable.\nA Li-ion fire can also emit smoke and fumes. Combustion by-products include \u201chydrogen fluoride, methyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate, carbon monoxide, carbon sulfide and phosphoryl fluoride,\u201d according to toxicologist Dr. Richard Pleus. \u201cThere are two things to consider,\u201d said Pleus. \u201cFirst, the release of combustion by-products during a thermal runaway of the battery (and its container). Second, if a battery fire catches other things on fire, it will produce a lot of additional smoke and fumes. The combination makes poison. I\u2019m concerned about being in an aircraft cabin with a fire causing these gases to reach levels that might incapacitate a person.\u201d\nAny white-hot bits of metal or gel from an exploding battery could cause third-degree burns to anyone they contact. Other fumes like carbon monoxide are odorless and invisible, yet lethal. \u201cThen there are burned particles that could be inhaled,\u201d Pleus said. Importantly, most modern aircraft ventilation systems can very quickly pump fresh air into the cabin to clear most fumes.\n\u201cIf you have someone working in your aircraft\u2019s cabin, for God\u2019s sake, train them. Don\u2019t simply buy a containment bag and equipment, and stick them in a drawer.\u201d\nJulie Kozma, Veteran Business Aviation Flight Attendant and Co-Chair of the NBAA Flight Attendant and Flight Technicians Committee\nJust in Case\nOnce a device enters thermal runaway, the most important topic is how to fight the resulting fire to ensure nearby passengers are not injured. On an aircraft without a flight attendant, one of the two pilots will likely need to leave the flight deck to deal with the chaos.\nFor large cabin airplanes, longtime flight attendant Julie Kozma said mitigation works a bit differently. \u201cWhy do you buckle a seatbelt when you get in a car? Just in case of an accident, right? We talk about a flight attendant on board being like a big seat belt. We\u2019re the big just-in-case.\u201d\nIn fact, a flight attendant is usually the first line of defense during a cabin fire. Kozma moved from commercial to business aviation 19 years ago, spending the last 10 as the lead flight attendant on international trips aboard a Bombardier Global 6000. She\u2019s also co-chair of the NBAA\u2019s Flight Attendant and Flight Technicians Committee and is known to her colleagues as the \u201cLithium Battery Lady,\u201d for her expertise.\n\u201cThe data proves these fires are happening more regularly,\u201d Kozma said. Also, there are many misconceptions about how to fight these fires, and a somewhat laissez faire attitude about Li-ion fires in general, she said. \u201cSome flight crews believe the solution is to hit a burning device with a Halon extinguisher and stick it in that fire bag,\u201d Kozma said.\nOfficially, that bag is referred to as a containment bag \u2013 or case \u2013 and they come in a variety of sizes. Kozma discovered in training \u201chow quickly these [Li-ion] fires can get out of control\u201d and that simply drowning an overheating device with Halon might kill the flames, but accomplish little else.\n\u201cFAA testing has determined that Halon fire extinguishers will extinguish an open flame, but they will not stop thermal runaway,\u201d said Cox.\n\u201cFighting this fire is all about cooling the batteries inside the device, ideally submerging it in liquid, maybe in a sink or a metal trash can,\u201d Kozma said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only chance there is to halt thermal runaway. Consider, too, where the water will come from. This effort will require more than just a bottle or two,\u201d she added. \u201cThese fires can\u2019t be smothered with ice, either.\u201d\nKozma said what worries her and other flight attendants most is that in order to deal with a fire, \u201cWe have to get within arm\u2019s length of an unstable electronic device, many times with little or no protection. That\u2019s not acceptable to us.\u201d\nOther worries include whether the airplane has a containment bag or case. Is the aircraft equipped with fireproof gloves to pick up even a cooling device? A face shield is also inexpensive protection against a unit spitting out white hot metal bits.\n\u201cThe temperature of a unit in thermal runaway can spike upwards to 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit,\u201d Kozma said. \u201cContainment bags are important, but in a thermal runaway situation, those bags are really the last step, not the first. The unit needs to be cooled down first.\u201d Kozma said there are other products available to douse the flames and cool an overheating device, like the specialized extinguishers produced by Tulsa, OK-based SpectrumFX.\nCox said fire prevention can begin by using OEM batteries that \u201ctypically have better internal protection circuitry to prevent an excessive rate of charge and maintain a stable voltage.\u201d\nAwareness of what might cause an event is important, too. \u201cYou see people walking around with cracked phone screens,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitive evidence that the unit and the battery have been subjected to shock, increasing the likelihood of encountering a thermal runaway.\u201d Companies need not spend vast sums on containment systems. \u201cThe airlines are learning that medium priced containment systems are working quite well.\u201d\nA trained flight attendant is not a required crewmember on most Part 91 business aircraft. \u201cBut if there is an employee working in an aircraft cabin, there\u2019s an implication that person is trained, and will be there to help you,\u201d Kozma said. \u201cSo, if you have someone working in your aircraft\u2019s cabin for God\u2019s sake, train them. Don\u2019t simply buy a containment bag and equipment and stick them in a drawer. Think about how you\u2019d actually fight a lithium ion battery fire and train everyone for it regularly.\u201d\nRegular advice offered to pilots fits well here. \u201cTrain as you fly and fly as you train.\u201d\nReview NBAA\u2019s resources for handling Li-ion batteries at nbaa.org/lithium-batteries"

Well, the company has since proved its point: the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable is now available to consumers for an eye-watering $3,300, but packed with premium design elements, solid hardware, and a 120Hz OLED display that extends to almost 17 inches at the press of a button.\nAlso: Lenovo's $3,000 rollable ThinkBook laptop is officially available to buy - know this before you do\nI've been using the ThinkBook Plus for over a week as my main laptop, and I have to admit, I'm enamored by the extendable screen, particularly as a productivity machine for work.\nBut as the first of its kind, it's far from perfect. There are a handful of trade-offs due to the laptop's form, and the sky-high price invites a critical eye to every element of its design. That being said, it is ultimately a well-engineered laptop. Let's take a closer look.\nLike all ThinkBooks, the laptop exudes business, featuring a metallic, two-tone design. It's not my favorite aesthetic, but it's certainly durable and resists fingerprints way better than all the matte black designs out there.\nUpon first glance, the laptop looks like any other. One of the first things to stand out is the thick bezels framing the display, but as your eye draws to the bottom, you notice something strange: there's no bottom bezel -- the screen just continues below the keyboard.\nAlso: How to buy a laptop for school, work, or gaming (and our top picks for each)\nThe rest of the rollable screen is parked underneath, waiting to be unfurled. With the push of a button, the standard-sized display extends upwards, increasing the screen size to 16.7 inches.\nThe result is a large, portrait-style display that goes far beyond any other standard laptop screen size on the market. The glossy, OLED screen delivers a fantastic picture, with no flickering or dimming around the edges, although there is some visible creasing that looks like what you'd see on a foldable phone's display.\nThis is especially true if you rotate the glossy display to reflect the light. It's a little more visible than I expected and certainly something of note (given the price), but ultimately, it doesn't really overshadow the benefit of the large screen.\nFor example, you stop noticing the creasing when your attention is focused on what you're actually doing. It's one of those things that's an inevitable part of its mechanics -- it took foldable phones several years to reduce the creasing on their displays -- and although it doesn't exactly scream \"premium\", it doesn't cancel out the benefits the screen provides.\nAlso: I tried Lenovo's infamous 'rollable' laptop at CES - it's more practical than I thought\nSo what are the said benefits? First off, the extra room is a breath of fresh air. It allows for a spacious workspace that I have to admit, makes for a very nice user experience. Personally, I like running one large, full-screen desktop, but you can also put two windows, one on top of the other, for two 16:9 desktops.\nTo maximize real estate, I set the scale in Windows to 125%, bringing the UI down to a more manageable size that results in a crisp and efficient interface. However, if you want a larger UI, it still feels more roomy than a regular laptop display.\nIf you're a programmer, you'll appreciate the extended portrait orientation, but anyone who works with documents will love being able to see a third more content on the screen at a glance.\nAs an editor, it drastically improves working in Google Docs and my browser-based CMS, both of which benefit from more visibility without having to squint at a UI that's been scaled down to the atomic level.\nEven basic web browsing is improved, with more of the page on the screen at once, and more content visible with less scrolling. In that sense, the display mirrors the mobile layout, which is ultimately more scrollable.\nRolling the screen up can be done by pressing the associated key or with a hand gesture in front of the webcam. While it's extending, the screen defaults to playing an animation (different ones are selectable in settings) with some thematic music, then reloading your desktop once it reaches the desired size. The music can be a little much in a quiet office, so luckily, all of these features can be turned off.\nWhen fully extended, the bottom third of the screen is occupied by the Lenovo widget panel, which shows reminders, your to-do list, and a calendar at a glance. You can pin this to stay permanently on or have it hide behind your other apps.\nThere's actually a lot of content here, including short videos that show how to use gesture controls to raise and lower the display and some suggestions on how to organize the screen more effectively.\nBeyond the display, the rest of the laptop's core components are quite nice. The keyboard is a little shallow, but the keys feel great, with a satisfying click that's crisp and responsive.\nI was also thrilled to find the haptic trackpad to be just as well-engineered, with a uniform click no matter where you press down on the pad, and a sensitive input for swipe gestures. One thing to note, however, is that in cooler temperatures, you might have some trouble with the pad recognizing your fingers, especially if they're cold.\nAlso: The Lenovo ThinkPad streak is over: This model I tested bucks a decade-long trend (for the better)\nAlso note that the laptop's form factor limits its I/O access, with just two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and a headphone jack. All three ports are located on the left side of the device, which might be problematic for some users, but is an expected trade-off for the features.\nAll in all, the laptop's core physical build feels premium (if a little chunky), and even without the rollable display, it would be a solid office laptop. The fingerprint reader on the power key, along with support for Wi-Fi 7 seal the deal as a modern business device.\nUnder the hood, the Intel Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage make for a standard hardware loadout comparable to any number of mid-to-upper range business laptops. The big display is powered by an integrated Intel Arc 140V GPU with 16GB of internal memory, supplying more than enough power for daily use.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable | 563 | 2,732 | 10,701 |\nDell 14 Premium | 732 | 2,626 | 15,462 |\nAcer Swift 16 AI | 518 | 2,743 | 10,932 |\nIf you're looking to game on this laptop, it can handle some mainstream titles, but it's not exactly built for running top-tier gaming content. In \"normal\" laptop mode, you've got a 2000 x 1600 resolution, standard fare for a 14-inch. But if your game supports a 2000 x 2350 resolution, you can play with the screen fully extended, which definitely feels like a unique experience, but because of all the screen space, it isn't exactly optimized for high-APM gaming.\nIf you're playing an older game that doesn't support that resolution, well, the game will simply revert to the traditional resolution, resulting in empty space below the window and negating the whole point of the extended display. The bottom line here: gaming can be a bonus for this laptop, but not what it's made for.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook Pro for\nRegarding battery life, the display expectedly cuts into the 66Whr battery's longevity, although not as much as you might expect. During normal use, you can get a full work day of use out of it with the screen extended, but it's cutting it close. If you add in videoconferencing and more demanding workloads, you might not make it through the day without a power top-up.\nThat being said, the Lunar Lake chip does allow for the battery loss to reduce to a trickle when not in use, and it charges fast: about 80% in an hour. In our video playback test, we got a little over 11 hours at half brightness in balanced mode over Wi-Fi.\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: the price. Lenovo is well aware that this laptop is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably the most niche product I've reviewed all year. Instead, it's more about proving a point.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of ThinkPads: Here's the Lenovo model I keep coming back to\nLenovo wants to project a reputation of innovation, but more importantly, it wants to prove it can deliver said products to market. This device reflects that mission, earning it an important place in Lenovo's portfolio, even if it's not the year's top seller.\nIt's also the first iteration of this rollable concept, and as such, the physical design is not quite as polished as you'd find in Lenovo's other high-end laptops, like the ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition or the X1 Carbon. These laptops come from a product line backed up by decades of design and engineering, with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 having room to improve in subsequent model versions.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 is an impressive product, even considering its trade-offs. The display has visible creases and thick bezels, but when it's fully extended, you forget about them. The battery isn't the best, but it's far from the worst. It's not a stellar gaming rig, but that's not why you buy a ThinkBook, anyway.\nIt's niche, and it's expensive, but it does what it's supposed to: deliver a fantastic user experience in the office, with an expansive, flexible display that looks great, pairs nicely with a premium haptic touchpad, and just the right amount of power under the hood.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for two weeks, and it made my XPS laptop look bad\nAt $3,200, this isn't a mainstream laptop, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're absolutely sold on the extendable display and are committed to the form factor in the long term.\nThe reality is that you can get almost anything for less: a MacBook Pro M4 with 24GB of RAM, or the new brand-new Dell 14 Premium with the same processor and an upgraded Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU for $1,000 less. But if you're in love with the big screen, I can say that it's a productivity game-changer in the office."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nFinally, I found a portable charger that checks all of my boxes for traveling\nVoltme Hypercore 10K power bank\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Voltme's Hypercore 10K power bank is available on Amazon for $23.\n- It's very compact and easy to carry, with both USB-C and USB-A ports to charge two devices simultaneously.\n- Its small but chunky, as some might prefer a flatter charger.\nPower banks are a tradeoff: too big and they're heavy and awkward to carry, too small and they're pretty useless because there's not enough charge power. I've found that the 10,000mAh mark is the sweet spot in terms of weight for general pocket carry.\nBut even at that size, design plays a big part. A blocky, angular power bank just doesn't sit well in a pocket or bag. Occasionally I come across a power bank that has the right blend of power capacity, features, design, and price.\nAlso: The best power banks you can buy in 2025\nThe latest power bank to tick these boxes has been the Voltme Hypercore 10K Pro.\nI think the best way to describe the look of the Hypercore 10K Pro is \"bar of soap, but without the slipperiness.\" The casing is a combination of soft grippy polymer and tough plastic. The plastic is also made extra grippy thanks to the company name and debossed (cut into the material) into the side.\nThe corners are also rounded and soft, so there's nothing on the power bank to dig into your skin or burst a hole in the side of a backpack -- something I've had happen on a multi-day hike. That expensive, waterproof power bank now lies somewhere in the Brecon Beacon hills in South Wales.\nJust keep in mind that it's a little chunkier than some of the larger (and flatter) power banks that can sit flush with your phone.\nAs the name suggests, the Hypercore 10K Pro is a 10,000mAh/37Wh capacity power bank. It has two ports: on one end it has a USB-C that can handle 30W max input and output, and on the other end a USB-A that handles up to 22.5W max output. Using a 30W minimum charger, the pack can be fully recharged in under two hours.\nI particularly like the orientation of the ports -- much better than having them on one end. You can also use both ports simultaneously or be charging the power bank using USB-C while using the USB-A port to charge another device, which is a handy feature.\nAlso: My search for the ultimate car charger is over - and this one has a flexible superpower\nOn the front of the unit is a four-LED power indicator and a button for activating it and turning on low-power mode so you can keep your smartwatch, earbuds, or fitness tracker charged and ready for action.\nThere are no LED screens here, as there are no swarm of buttons or myriad of settings. Just simple portable power.\nIt's also got all the safety features you'd expect from a modern power bank, from overcharge protection, short circuit protection, overvoltage protection, and overcurrent protection -- all things you need, in order to prevent your power bank from transforming into a ball of flames.\nZDNET's buying advice\nI've been carrying the Voltme Hypercore 10K Pro for a few weeks now, and quite honestly I can't fault it. For some, 10,000mAh is too much, others it won't be enough, but for many, this is the sweet spot in terms of capacity, and if this is you, this is a great choice. It's built intelligently, simple to use, reliable and surprisingly robust.\nAnd the price is also right at $23. I've seen no-name power banks that look and feel sketchier for more than this."

I still stand by my assessment that this is the best in-car charger I've tested, by far.\nBut several readers got in touch with me to say that while they could indeed benefit from a wireless charger that offered built-in cooling (because, like me, they would get unreliable charging in hot weather), the vent mount mechanism was a deal-breaker.\nAlso: This car charger doubles as an emergency device\nNow, to be clear, the vent mounting holder that the HaloLock with CryoBoost wireless car charger came with didn't give me any problems at all. Once I took a few seconds to set it up right, it was great. And I gave it many tens of miles of bad road in my truck, and many more miles in a rental car.\nBut I can see why some people have a problem with vent mounting. It can be a bit clumsy, can restrict your options as to where you can fit the mount, might break the vent if you're heavy-handed, or just blocks a vent that you're using.\nThese are good points.\nA couple of readers also wondered if the charger part of the HaloLock with CryoBoost charger was compatible with ESR's HaloLock Dashboard Phone Mount. There was only one way to find out -- I bought one!\nTo cut a short story even shorter, yes, the two fit together just fine! I just needed to loosen the ball mount on both and swap the ends over.\nNow I have the best of all worlds -- a wireless MagSafe charger with a built-in cooling fan that also features a suction mount that sticks onto any windshield or dashboard.\nAlso: Is this the ultimate wireless car charger? My iPhone tells me yes\nThis excellent mount offers a strong suction cup for attaching a smartphone to most surfaces. It also features articulating arms and a swivel ball head so you can perfectly place your smartphone in any vehicle -- and with nothing hanging off the air vent!\nAnd just to make sure that it sticks well and doesn't fall apart, I took in on a trip that included a few dozen miles of bad road, and the suction cup stayed attached to the windshield, and the phone stayed fixed to the charger.\nThe mount did cost me $22, but decent suction cup mounts aren't cheap, and I've spent more on suction cups in the past.\nAnother question I received after my last article was about the strength of the magnet, and whether you needed ESR's MagSafe case to get the best results, or whether any MagSafe case would work, or none at all.\nI tested a few different MagSafe cases, including Apple's own MagSafe case, another ESR case, and a Quad-Lock case, and I found they all worked pretty much the same.\nHowever, without a case, the connection was nowhere near as reliable, especially on rough roads. For the best performance, my advice is to use a MagSafe case with this charger."

Microsoft has stated, forcefully, that it will not revise those requirements. You will also hit roadblocks if your PC doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, or if the TPM is not enabled.\nAlso: Two ways to get free Windows 10 security updates through October 2026\nThat might be the official policy, but -- as with everything Windows-related -- it pays to read the fine print.\nThose pesky restrictions prevent you from automatically upgrading to Windows 11 using Windows Update or the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Yet, as I detail in ZDNET's Windows 11 FAQ, there are documented workarounds for most PCs that were originally built for Windows 10.\nOver the past few years, Microsoft has played a cat-and-mouse game with enthusiasts, adding occasional speed bumps that make it more difficult to bypass these compatibility checks. There are workarounds for most modern PCs, but some older devices, especially those built using AMD processors, might be out of luck. The instructions below take all those developments into account.\nAlso: Can your old PC handle the Windows 11 upgrade? How to find out - before you try\nThese instructions also assume that you have a PC running a retail or OEM edition of Windows 10 (Home or Pro) and that you are signed in as an administrator on the PC you want to upgrade.\nWhich option should you choose?\nPlease don't skip over this section.\nThis article describes two upgrade options. To take advantage of the workaround described in option 1 below, your computer must meet all the other requirements for Windows 11.\n- It must be configured to start up using UEFI, not a legacy BIOS configuration.\n- Secure Boot must be supported, although it does not need to be enabled. (But seriously, folks, you should enable Secure Boot.)\n- A TPM must be enabled; version 1.2 is OK, but a system without any TPM or with the TPM disabled will fail. Any PC that was originally designed for Windows 10 should include a TPM 2.0.\nTo check these details on a PC you're considering upgrading, run the System Information utility, Msinfo32.exe, and look at the System Summary page. Pay special attention to the BIOS Mode value. If it says \"Legacy,\" you'll need to reconfigure your system to UEFI mode (and convert your system disk from MBR to GPT partitioning) before you can install Windows 11 as a normal upgrade.\nAlso: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how to get around it\nTo see whether your PC has a TPM enabled, run the Trusted Platform Module Management tool, Tpm.msc. If your computer includes a TPM and it's turned on, this app will display information about it. Under the TPM Manufacturer Information heading, check the specification version to confirm that it is 2.0. If there's no TPM, or if the TPM is disabled in firmware settings, you'll see a message that says \"Compatible TPM cannot be found.\"\nIf you're unable (or unwilling) to change from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, or if you have an older PC that doesn't have a TPM option at all, you'll need to use the second option, which takes advantage of an undocumented hack that allows you to bypass the compatibility checks and complete the upgrade. Skip to the Option 2 section of this post for details on how to use the free Rufus utility to perform this upgrade.\nAlso: How to install Windows 11 your way (and avoid Microsoft's restrictions)\nFinally, note that Microsoft added a new set of restrictions as part of the Windows 11 version 24H2 update. These changes require a CPU that supports specific instructions -- SSE4.2 and PopCnt. Most PCs with Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will meet this standard. AMD CPUs from 2013 or later should also meet these requirements. But it is impossible to upgrade to Windows 11 version 24H2 on a PC that was built in 2008 or earlier. For details, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that.\"\nIf you plan to perform a clean installation of Windows 11, you can boot from installation media and run Windows Setup. That option skips the CPU compatibility check completely (but still requires a TPM and Secure Boot support). After the installation completes, you'll need to reinstall all your apps, restore your data files, and tweak settings to personalize your system preferences.\nWant to avoid all that hassle? Choose the option that's appropriate for your hardware.\nOption 1: Use this simple registry edit\nWith this registry edit, you can bypass CPU checks and accept any TPM version. Please be aware that this option requires that you run the Setup program from within your current Windows installation. You can't boot from a USB flash drive and install Windows 11 this way.\nThis process requires four steps.\n1. Change one key in the Windows registry\nYou need to make one small change to the Windows registry. For more than three years, this change was documented at Microsoft's support website, but the company removed those instructions in December 2024. (Here's an archived version of that support article.) This change tells the Windows 11 Setup program to skip the check for compatible CPUs and to allow installation on a PC with an older TPM (version 1.2). The usual warnings apply when working with the registry; I recommend you make a complete backup before proceeding.\nOpen Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to the following key:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\MoSetup\nIf the MoSetup key doesn't exist, you need to create it. Right-click the node for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup in the left-hand navigation pane, then choose New > Key. Name it MoSetup and press Enter.\nAlso: Wiping your Windows laptop? Here's the simplest way to erase all personal data\nSelect the MoSetup key and then right-click in any empty space in the pane on the right. Choose the option to create a new DWORD value. (Don't choose the QWORD option!)\nReplace the default name for that key by typing the text AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU and then press Enter. Then double-click the new value and change the \"Value data\" box to 1. The result should look like this:\nCheck for typos before proceeding -- Windows is frustratingly literal about the contents of the registry, and if you misspell the key or value name, your upgrade will fail. Click OK to save your change, and then restart your PC.\n2. Download the Windows 11 ISO\nOn the PC you want to upgrade, go to the Windows 11 Download page (aka.ms/DownloadWindows11) and choose the option at the bottom of the page, \"Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices.\" Save the ISO file in your Downloads folder.\nNote that this is a big file. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, the download could take a while.\nAlso: The ultimate Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything you need to know\nFor those running Windows with English (UK) as the selected language, choose English (United States) when prompted for a product language. Several readers have reported that choosing English International results in an upgrade that does not allow you to keep installed apps and data files.\n3. Mount the ISO file in File Explorer\nAfter the download completes, open File Explorer and double-click the ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Doing so mounts the file as a virtual DVD drive in its own folder, with its own drive letter.\n4. Run Windows Setup\nIn File Explorer, find the Setup.exe file in the virtual drive you opened in the previous step and double-click it to begin the upgrade. You'll see a stern warning about compatibility issues and the possibility that performing an upgrade will mean you are not entitled to future updates. You can safely click Accept to move past this message. (For details on what that warning message really means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\" Spoiler: They are not going to cut off security updates.) After you click OK on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\nIf you're upgrading from the same edition (Home or Pro), you'll have three options: You can keep your apps, settings, and files (Full Upgrade); keep your data files but start fresh with apps and settings (Keep Data Only); or start completely fresh (Clean Install).\nOption 2: Use the free Rufus utility\nOn older PCs without a TPM and on PCs that don't support Secure Boot, you'll need to use an undocumented hack to bypass the compatibility checker. You can do this manually by replacing the Appraiserres.dll file (in the Sources subfolder on the Windows 11 installer drive) with a zero-byte version and then making a series of registry edits. But it's simpler to use the free, open-source Rufus utility to create installation media (on a USB flash) drive that includes these tweaks automatically.\nTo get started, download Rufus version 4.6 or later. Earlier versions won't work, thanks to changes Microsoft made in October 2024 to its compatibility checking tools. For details of how the newer versions work, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This just-released tool can get the job done.\" In addition, be aware that using Rufus will not allow you to bypass the new restrictions on very old PCs that were introduced with Windows 11 version 24H2.\nIf you have a PC with a CPU that lacks support for SSE4.2 and PopCnt instructions, not even Rufus can help. (Of course, any PC that fails that test is nearly 20 years old and probably deserves to be retired.)\nAlso: Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it\nTo get started, you'll need to download the Windows 11 ISO. Be sure to save it to the Downloads folder of your Windows system drive so you can find it easily. You'll also need a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB in size. You will reformat this drive as part of the process, so back up any data on that drive first -- and do not store the Windows 11 ISO here!\n- Download Rufus from the developer's site or from the Microsoft Store and run the app.\n- Choose the USB drive and then choose the \"Disk or ISO image\" option.\n- Click the Select button, choose the Windows 11 ISO you downloaded earlier, and then click Start.\n- In the Windows User Experience dialog, select the first checkbox to remove hardware requirements, as shown in the screenshot below.\n- Click OK to begin creating the drive.\nAfter Rufus successfully creates your installer, open that USB drive in File Explorer, and double-click Setup. Do not try to upgrade by booting from that USB drive and performing a clean install; it won't work.\nAs is the case with the other option, you'll see a warning about compatibility issues.

That's why you'll always catch me testing tech while I travel and even on my daily commute. As a New Jersey native who often travels into the office in NYC, I depend on a MagSafe wallet for quick access to my NJ Transit card during my commute, and as a Gen-Z who is glued to my phone, I love a nifty accessory.\nAlso: 7 MagSafe accessories that I recommend every iPhone user should have\nThat's why I couldn't say no when I got the chance to test ESR's newest Aura MagSafe wallet. The Aura wallet launched in November, and I was immediately struck by how much it reminded me of two other wallets already ZDNET-tested and loved. ESR, in my opinion, has just leveled up on Satechi's flagship wallet, and shares similarities with Journey's Ezmo wallet.\nLike the Satechi wallet, ESR features an ID window, seamless design, and a $40 price point -- but has upped the ante. You can store one more card than Satechi's recommended 4, and ESR's color options are a little trendier and more varied. To compare the two even further, the ESR wallet has a slightly grainy texture, where Satechi's wallet is smooth and slick.\nLike Journey's Ezmo wallet, the ESR Aura has a larger card capacity than most and a strong magnetic hold. Once again, ESR's color options appeal more to me than Journey's quiet luxury-esque neutrals. It's more lightweight and compact than the Journey wallet, and similar in stature to the Satechi wallet, too.\nAlso: The best MagSafe wallets you can buy: Expert tested\nWhat I really like about this ESR wallet is that it's just a tad more functional than Satechi's option and even more affordable than Journey's (and sometimes Satechi's when the ESR is on sale).\nESR Aura Halo-Lock MagSafe Wallet and Stand feature summary\n- Holds up to five cards, features 3 slots\n- MagSafe compatible (not compatible with iPhone 12/13 mini or the iPhone 16e)\n- Adjustable stand\n- Front notch for quick access\n- Clear ID window\n- Portrait and landscape viewing\n- Anti-degaussing lining to protect cards from demagnetization\n- 3,200 g of holding force, according to ESR\n- Available in five colors on the ESR site: Cream Beige, Bright White, Elephant Gray, Lavender, Pink\n- With additional colors in similar ESR models (Vegan Leather Wallet Stand, Grip Wallet Stand, and the Geo Wallet Stand) on Amazon\nWhen I test MagSafe wallets, one of the first things I look for is its ability to store my NJ Transit card up front so I can easily scan it (without dropping it between the tracks). Thankfully, the front notch on the Aura stores it up front and separated from the other cards, making it easy to slide out without dropping it. If you're looking for a commuter-friendly wallet, I highly recommend choosing the front-notch option.\nAlso: I've tested dozens of MagSafe wallets on my iPhone, and this is one you should buy\nThe Aura is also power-packed with storage. With three slots and up to 5 card capacity (which I can confirm is legit), the arrangements inside feel endless.\nThe best part of this wallet, however, is the phone stand. It makes it easy to prop up my phone in portrait or landscape mode at the office or at home, and it's the ultimate sidekick for holiday cooking and baking on the counter. I successfully made the TikTok-viral Tini's Mac and Cheese while using this phone stand to prop up the recipe, so it's a tested winner. It's also great for stabilizing your hand while taking timer pictures.\nAlso: The best MagSafe wallet I've tested is not made by Apple or Anker\nThe magnetic connection, which ESR says is up to 3,200 g of holding force, rivals that of other top-tested picks, like the Satechi wallet. It's secure enough to hold onto my iPhone 14 Pro, and while I don't recommend doing this, it didn't even budge while I held it suspended from its hinged end. Seriously, it didn't even come off when I attempted to whip my phone out of my hand (again, please don't try this at home).\nZDNET's buying advice\nIf you can snag the ESR Aura wallet on sale, it's a no-brainer purchase, in my opinion. It offers a highly competitive balance of features compared to other options on the market for a competitive price. Even if you can't grab it on sale, $40 is still reasonably-priced with other top-tested options, like the Satechi wallet stand.\nIf you want something sleeker, smaller, or more premium, consider cardholders that can store 1-2 cards or other wallet designs. One of my favorite slim options is the Moft MagSafe wallet stand, which comes in over 20 colors, and for larger storage needs or a traditional wallet feel, I like the Journey Ezmo wallet."

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-gpt-5s-coding-skills-and-it-was-so-bad-that-im-sticking-with-gpt-4o-for-now/",
      "text": "I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- OpenAI's new GPT-5 flagship failed half of my programming tests.\n- Previous OpenAI releases have had just about perfect results.\n- Now that OpenAI has enabled fallbacks to other LLMs, there are options.\nSo GPT-5 happened. It's out. It's released. It's the talk of the virtual town. And it's got some problems. I'm not gonna bury the lede. GPT-5 has failed half of my programming tests. That's the worst that OpenAI's flagship LLM has ever done on my carefully designed tests.\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\nBefore I get into the details, let's take a moment to discuss one other little feature that's also a bit wonky. Check out the new Edit button on the top of the code dumps it generates.\nClicking the Edit button takes you into a nice little code editor. Here, I replaced the Author field, right in ChatGPT's results.\nThat seemed nice, but it ultimately proved futile. When I closed the editor, it asked me if I wanted to save. I did. Then this unhelpful message showed up.\nI never did get back to my original session. I had to submit my original prompt again, and let GPT-5 do its work a second time.\nBut wait. There's more. Let's dig into my test results\u2026\n1. Writing a WordPress plugin\nThis was my very first test of coding prowess for any AI. It's what gave me that first \"the world is about to change\" feeling, and it was done using GPT-3.5.\nSubsequent tests, using the same prompt but with different AI models, generated mixed results. Some AIs did great, some didn't. Some AIs, like those from Microsoft and Google, improved over time.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nChatGPT's model has been the gold standard for this test since the very beginning. That makes the results of GPT-5 all that much more curious.\nSo, look, the actual coding with GPT-5 was partially successful. GPT-5 generated a single block of code, which I pasted into a file and was able to run. It provided the requisite UI.\nWhen I pasted in the test names, it dynamically updated the line count, although it described it as \"Line to randomize\" instead of \"Lines to randomize.\"\nBut then, when I clicked Randomize, it didn't. Instead, it redirected me to tools.php. What?? ChatGPT has never had a problem with this test, whether GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or GPT-4o. You mean to tell me that OpenAI's much-anticipated GPT-5 is failing right out of the gate? Ouch.\nAlso: How to use GPT-5 in VS Code with GitHub Copilot\nI then gave GPT-5 this prompt.\nWhen I click randomize, I'm taken to http://testsite.local/wp-admin/tools.php. I do not get a list of randomized results. Can you fix?\nThe result was a line to patch. I'm not thrilled with that approach because it requires the user to dig through code and to make no mistakes replacing a line.\nSo, I asked GPT-5 for a full plugin. It gave me the full text of the plugin to copy and paste. This time, it worked.\nThis time, it did randomize the lines. When it encountered duplicates, it separated them from each other, as it was instructed. Finally.\nAlso: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time\nI'm sorry, OpenAI. I have to fail you on this test. You would have passed if the only error was not using the plural of \"line\" when appropriate. But the fact that it gave me back a non-working plugin on the first try is fail territory, even if the AI did eventually make it work on the second try.\nNo matter how you spin it, this is a step back.\n2. Rewriting a string function\nThis second test is designed to rewrite a string function to better check for dollars and cents. The original code that GPT-5 was asked to rewrite did not allow for cents (it only checked for integers).\nGPT-5 did fine with this test. It did return a minimal result because it didn't do any error checking. It didn't check for non-string input, extra whitespace, thousands separators, or currency symbols.\nBut that's not what I asked for. I told it to rewrite a function, which itself did not have any error checking. GPT-5 did exactly what I asked with no embellishment. I'm kind of glad of that because it doesn't know whether or not code prior to this routine already did that work.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n3. Finding an annoying bug\nThis test came about because I was struggling with a less-than-obvious bug in my code. Without going into the weeds about how the WordPress framework works, the obvious answer is not the right answer.\nYou need some fairly arcane knowledge about how WordPress filters pass their information. This test has been a stumbling block for more than a few AI LLMs.\nAlso: Gen AI disillusionment looms, according to Gartner's 2025 Hype Cycle report\nGPT-5, however, like GPT-4 and GPT-4o before it, did understand the problem. It articulated a clear solution.\nGPT-5 passed this test.\n4. Writing a script\nThis test asks the AI to incorporate a fairly obscure Mac scripting tool called Keyboard Maestro, as well as Apple's scripting language AppleScript, and Chrome scripting behavior.\nIt's really a test of the reach of the AI in terms of knowledge, its understanding of how web pages are constructed, and the ability to write code across three interlinked environments.\nQuite a few AIs have failed this test, but the failure point is usually a lack of knowledge about Keyboard Maestro. GPT-3.5 didn't know about Keyboard Maestro. But ChatGPT has been passing this test since GPT-4. Until now.\nWhere should we start? Well, the good news is that GPT-5 handled the Keyboard Maestro part of the problem just fine. But it got the coding so wrong that it even doubled down on its lack of understanding of how case works in AppleScript.\nIt actually invented a property. This is one of those cases where an AI confidently presents an answer that is completely wrong.\nAlso: ChatGPT comes with personality presets now - and other upgrades you might have missed\nAppleScript is natively case-insensitive. If you want AppleScript to pay attention to case, you need to use a \"considering case\" block. So, this happened.\nThe reason the error message referred to the title of one of my articles is because that was the front window in Chrome. This function checks the front window and does stuff based on the title.\nBut misunderstanding how case works wasn't the only AppleScript error GPT-5 generated. It also referenced a variable named searchTerm without defining it. That's pretty much an error-creating practice in any programming language.\nFail, fail, fail, McFaildypants.\nThe internet hath spoken\nOpenAI seemed to suffer from the same hubris that its AIs do. It confidently moved everyone to GPT-5 and burned the bridges back to GPT-4o. I'm paying $200 a month for a ChatGPT Pro account. On Friday, I couldn't move back to GPT-4o for coding work. Neither could anyone else.\nThere was, however, just a tiny bit of user pushback on the whole bridges burning thing. And by tiny, I mean the entire frickin' internet. So, by Saturday, ChatGPT had a new option.\nTo get to this, go to your ChatGPT settings and turn on \"Show legacy models.\" Then, as it has always been, just drop down the model menu and choose the one you want. Note: this option is only available to those on paid tiers. If you're using ChatGPT for free, you'll take what you're given, and you'll love it.\nEver since the whole generative AI thing kicked off at the beginning of 2023, ChatGPT has been the gold standard of programming tools, at least according to my LLM testing.\nAlso: Microsoft rolls out GPT-5 across its Copilot suite - here's where you'll find it\nNow? I'm really not sure. This is only a day or so after GPT-5 has been released, so its results will probably get better over time. But for now, I'm sticking with GPT-4o for coding, although I do like the deep reasoning capabilities in GPT-5.\nWhat about you? Have you tried GPT-5 for programming tasks yet? Did it perform better or worse than previous versions like GPT-4o or GPT-3.5? Were you able to get working code on the first try, or GPT-4o did you have to guide it through fixes? Are you going to use GPT-5 for coding or stick with older models? Let us know in the comments below.\nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

I compared it with a traditional Wi-Fi router, and here's my advice\nWith the adoption of remote and hybrid working, having a reliable internet connection at home is imperative -- not just for one device, but for several. If you have a family, maybe even dozens. So what's better, one single access point, or a mesh network spread about the home?\nThe answer depends on how your home and office are set up and what kind of connection you need. Wi-Fi routers are so good these days that a single access point is often the most straightforward solution. But if you have a larger home or your office is located far away from your router, a mesh network could be a game-changer, boosting the signal no matter where you are.\nAlso: The best VPN routers of 2025\nIf you're not sure of the difference, that's okay, too. Let's examine both types of connection and consider their pros and cons to determine which one is best for you.\nWhat is a traditional Wi-Fi router?\nA traditional router acts as a central hub for internet connectivity. The router acquires the connection from your internet service provider (ISP), and then allows other devices around the home to connect to it, either via Wi-Fi, or by simply plugging in an Ethernet cable. Typically, routers are password-protected so only your household can connect to it.\nYou should buy a traditional Wi-Fi router if...\n1. You're on a budget\nStandard routers are generally much more affordable than mesh network products. While you can still expect to pay a hundred dollars or more for a premium router, there are many budget-friendly options stable enough to keep your home office running effectively without further input.\n2. You have heavy bandwidth and speed requirements\nMany routers today, such as the TP-Link AXE5400 are designed with the technology needed to meet heavy bandwidth and streaming requirements. Some, like the Asus RT-BE86U, aim to exceed the requirements of most people for the fastest connection possible.\nAlso: Should you upgrade to Wi-Fi 7? Here's my verdict after testing this next-gen router at home\nGamers and live streamers, for example, should generally stick with wired Ethernet connections and traditional routers, as they will likely provide improved speeds and stability over wireless-first products.\n3. You want a plug-and-play product\nA standard router is often less hassle to set up than a mesh network. For something that \"just works,\" a typical router might be the best option. Set it up once, make sure updates are automatically applied, and forget about it.\n4. You want to separate devices and networks\nYou can set up guest Wi-Fi networks on most modern routers, but if you also want to keep all of your devices on a separate home network in the interests of security, most routers will allow you to do this without much hassle.\nWhat is a mesh router?\nWhile traditional routers are singular, centralized access points, mesh networking devices are decentralized.\nInstead of one device connecting to a single gateway to the internet, mesh networks are created from multiple Wi-Fi nodes that all provide web connectivity. For example, you could have a central hub in the kitchen and satellite nodes in the home office, kitchen, and bedroom.\nAlso: This is the fastest and most expensive Wi-Fi router I've ever tested\nWhen you access the internet while in the kitchen, you would automatically connect to the hub, whereas you would jump on a node while you're in your home office, and so on -- and this blanket coverage is why mesh devices are great for larger homes or offices. Most mesh systems will automatically select the best channels and nodes to avoid dead zones and lower the risk of poor connectivity.\nYou should buy a mesh networking system if...\n1. You have spotty coverage in your home\nThe main benefit of a mesh network is extended coverage. Investing in a mesh setup will remove annoyances, such as coverage blackspots or slow connections in larger properties with a lot of square feet. You're far less likely to have dead zones with a mesh system than you are with a single router access point.\nMesh networks can often cover up to 5,000 sq. ft., and more, with enough satellites. That's far more than you can expect from one central router.\n2. You need a reliable connection, no matter where you are\nAs your device will connect to the nearest satellite node rather than a central point of access, this feature helps ensure that -- no matter where you are in a property -- you are less likely to experience connectivity failures or drops.\nAlso: I switched my high-end Wi-Fi 7 router to a more affordable option - and don't regret it\nIn this manner, mesh networks are particularly useful if you have a home office in a garden area separate from your house, for example.\nAnother benefit is that mesh systems and satellites are often designed to look modern, sleek, and may be more discreet than bulky, traditional routers, giving you more options for placement.\n3. You want additional controls\nOnce a mesh network is active, many vendors allow users to control their system through a mobile app. This could include keeping an eye on network traffic, rebooting, or even turning off the internet entirely -- perhaps an appealing prospect for those with children who don't want to mess with a typical router's configuration. In addition, some mesh networks also act as smart hubs and are compatible with voice assistants.\nA note of warning, however: you may need to spend some time tweaking configuration settings when you first set up a mesh network.\nFAQs\nWhat are the disadvantages of using a Wi-Fi router?\nThere are three key disadvantages of using a traditional Wi-Fi router:\nCoverage issues: As internet access is distributed through a single point, this setup can mean that areas far away from your router will have slow or spotty connections that drop. Range extenders can help remove this barrier, and while they can still be cheaper than investing in a mesh network, it's an additional expense.\nOverload: Unless extenders or channel separation features are used, too many connections may result in overloading, bottlenecks, lags, and connectivity drops.\nTweaking: If you want to tweak the more advanced settings on a router, this can often require annoying visits to a platform via desktop, rather than the seamless mobile app connectivity we have learned to enjoy for many of our modern services.\nWhat router system is best for my home office?\nYou need to decide whether the financial outlay for a whole mesh network is worth it. In larger homes with dead spots, mesh networking can provide a way to improve your Wi-Fi signal strength and coverage immediately.\nHowever, it can be expensive to overhaul your existing router setup for a large home. Going for a complete mesh system may be overkill unless you consistently have multiple users and connected devices competing for bandwidth.\nA Wi-Fi extender can be a worthwhile investment instead if you decide to stay with a traditional home router but need to expand coverage.\nSome mesh network systems, such as Google Wifi, Netgear Orbi, and Amazon Eero, are relatively cheap to set up if you don't need too many satellites.\nAlso: The best mesh Wi-Fi routers: Expert recommended\nIf you're the only person using your network and need a stable, powerful internet connection -- such as for resource-hungry work applications or gaming -- a traditional router and an Ethernet cable may be all you need for reliable and rapid internet access. Wired internet speeds should be quicker than wireless if the connection is working properly, and investing in a simple Ethernet cable, easy to find for no more than $10 or $15, could be enough. This could save you the cost of a complete overhaul.\nWi-Fi range extenders, too, could be considered an alternative to mesh if you need to boost coverage and throughput in some areas, and they will likely be less expensive than purchasing individual mesh nodes. Some vendors also offer mesh \"bolt-ons,\" such as Asus' AiMesh, which creates a mesh-like coverage wireless network without ripping everything out and starting again. However, the downside is that you will probably have to spend some time setting these bolt-ons up and tampering with your router's configurations.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better for gaming?\nThe best way to answer this question is to consider latency. Overall, many mesh systems today trade extended coverage for potential downgrades to speed.\nIf your household has gamers using consoles casually, it shouldn't matter what type of router you use. However, professional and dedicated gamers will absolutely notice small lags or latency issues -- and they will want the best speed and stability available. In these cases, a wired, traditional router is likely your best bet.\nI prefer an Ethernet, cabled connection for PC, Internet-based gaming and sessions with friends, and while my mesh network would probably be adequate, I don't want to risk lagging.\nIs mesh Wi-Fi better than an extender?\nWhile both mesh Wi-Fi and extenders will improve the coverage of your home, there are disadvantages to both.\nMesh systems require investment and the cost can add up quickly, but they provide seamless transitions between Wi-Fi access points dotted around your home. Furthermore, you can rapidly change settings or perform updates via mobile apps.\nWi-Fi extenders can't be tweaked so easily. However, they are cheaper and are the best option if you just want to tackle a few dead zones, as you just need to plug one into your main router. Keep in mind that, unlike mesh nodes, Wi-Fi extenders won't improve congestion or eradicate bottlenecks.\nCheck your ISP first\nBefore changing your setup, you should review your ISP package. If you're subscribed to a low-speed offering, or your internet provider throttles your speed at peak times, new equipment is not going to help. Instead, a package upgrade could be a better option.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "Southwest has new rule that changes how you charge your phone mid-flight\nIf you're catching a flight on Southwest Airlines soon, you need to know about an important new rule that affects how you charge your phone.\nIn a statement to Business Insider last week, the airline said passengers are now required to keep any portable chargers fully in sight while in use. You're still able to bring these chargers and keep them in your bag (not in your checked bags, though). You just can't have your phone tucked in your carry-on or overhead bag while plugged into a charger.\nAlso: When is the best time to book your flight? Google just spilled its airfare secrets\nPassengers first started becoming aware of the new rule about two weeks ago when a message appeared in the Southwest app. \"If you use a power bank during your flight,\" it read, \"keep it out of your bag and in plain sight. Do not charge devices in the overhead bin.\"\nWhy is Southwest making this change?\nSeveral other airlines around the world have enacted similar policies, but Southwest is the first American-based carrier to do so.\nThe mindset behind this change is that portable chargers, like laptops and other electronics, run on lithium-ion batteries that can overheat and catch on fire. Making sure the charger is visible doesn't lessen the chance of a fire, but if a charger is always in sight, it's much more likely that someone will spot a potential problem before it becomes a larger issue.\nAlso: This tiny power bank solves the biggest problem I had with charging my phone\nWhile a major problem is rare, the National Business Aviation Association says, \"a smoke, fire or extreme heat incident involving lithium ion batteries takes place aboard an aircraft more than once per week on average in the US.\"\nOne of the more notable incidents was earlier this year when fire spread through the cabin of an Air Busan plane in Seoul shortly before takeoff. Local media said the fire may have been started by a portable battery stored in the overhead bin.\nAlso: The best power banks you can buy: Expert tested and reviewed\nI've reached out to Southwest Airlines since the policy doesn't seem to appear officially anywhere, and will update this article with a response.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

Stop using it now - here's why\nIf you've been keeping up with tech news lately, you'll be aware that Anker, a company with a long track history of making quality gadgets, has issued two separate recalls for a number of power banks over the past few weeks.\nThis has prompted a question from owners of affected power banks to ask whether they should continue using a power bank if it's been recalled. My answer? No.\nAlso: The best power banks you can buy in 2025\nBefore I go into a little more depth than the above one-word answer, here's a little background.\nWhich power banks has Anker recalled?\nBack in mid-June, Anker, along with the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), issued a recall for the Anker A1263 PowerCore 10000 power bank because Anker had received 19 reports of fires and explosions. These reports included two for minor injuries, and 11 for property damage totaling over $60,700.\nThis was a popular power bank, with over a million units sold between June 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022, through retailers such as Amazon, Newegg, and eBay, as well as on Anker's own website.\nThen, at the end of June, Anker recalled a further five power banks -- Anker Power Bank models A1257 and A1647, the Anker MagGo Power Bank model A1652, and the Anker Zolo Power Bank models A1681 and A1689 -- because of faulty batteries. According to Anker, \"the likelihood of malfunction is considered minimal,\" but the recall was issued \"out of an abundance of caution\" because of a \"risk of overheating, melting, smoke, or fire.\"\nAlso: Best MagSafe battery packs 2025: I tested the best options to boost your phone's battery\nIf you've bought an Anker power bank in the past nine years, it's probably a good idea to check it. Details of the first recall can be found here, and the other five power banks here.\nIf you have an affected unit, Anker says to stop using the power bank, get confirmation that it is affected, get your replacement or gift card sorted, and then get rid of the power bank -- but, because of the risk of the power bank overheating or bursting into flames, not in the recycling or general trash. You need to contact your local Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) collection center or consult this EPA web page to find out how to dispose of it.\nAirlines seem to be worried. Chinese aviation regulator has banned passengers from carrying the recalled power banks and those without Chinese \"3C\" certification marking (short for China Compulsory Certification), after power banks were blamed for a fire that broke out on an Air Busan plane in January and a Hong Kong Airlines flight that was forced to make an emergency landing in March.\nAirlines are also banning the use of power banks during flights.\nOK, but some of you still have more questions, so let me address the most popular...\nWhy are Anker products so prone to recalls?\nIn my experience, Anker has been proactive about safety, and carried out regular supply chain audits.\nAlso: Need a power bank you can keep in your pocket? I found one for $22 (and it packs a punch)\nRecalls are a double-edged sword. While they promote safety, they can affect a company's reputation. I think it's a good thing that a company is being open about safety issues, and I don't have any concerns about using Anker products over products from any other company.\nWhat's the problem with Anker's recalled power banks?\nAnker has said that the issue involves \"lithium-ion battery cells from a single vendor,\" but hasn't gone into much more detail. Lumafield put affected power banks into their CT scanner to see inside and concluded that the issue wasn't defective batteries but a design flaw that allowed the positive and negative terminals of the batteries to short circuit when the power bank is knocked about in day-to-day use.\nIs it safe to continue to use a recalled power bank?\nWhile the risks are low, I wouldn't chance it. Get a replacement or a gift card, get rid of the old one, and move on.\nIf you've never seen how fast a lithium-ion battery can go from calm to chaotic, how ferociously hot it can burn, how tricky it can be to extinguish even with the right equipment, and how quickly a burning battery can fill a room with noxious, choking fumes, you might be forgiven for thinking that it's an easily manageable situation.\nAlso: If you're a hiker, this is the lightweight power bank I recommend packing\nI'm here to tell you that it isn't. I've encountered accidental runaway lithium-ion batteries twice, and both times I ended up being lightly scorched and had to sit outside for a bit to clear my lungs afterwards.\nAnd both times it could have been a lot worse.\nIf these power banks are dangerous, how should I store them?\nA very good question, because you don't want a dangerous power bank in a drawer or on your nightstand. Despite the low risk, my advice would be to keep the affected power bank in a metal tin -- a biscuit tin or some such container -- and possibly in a garage or outbuilding, away from flammable items, until it can be handed over for disposal.\nThe serial number on my power bank has worn out. What do I do?\nThis is annoying. Try to clean the area with a soft cloth to see if the numbers will show up. Also, you can try the macro mode on your smartphone's camera.\nAlso: This Anker Nano has become my everyday power bank - here's why\nIf this doesn't work, contact Anker with the information you have.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

But my extensive testing suggests that these are false economy, and you're very likely buying something that at best won't last long, or at worse could even be dangerous.\nThis is why I recommend buying power banks from reputable brands. Don't worry -- I still work to keep those brands honest by extensively testing every power bank using an array of gadgets to make sure that they do what they say they do on the box. If the power bank claims water resistance, I test that, and if there a durability claim, rest assured that is also tested to a high level, too.\nWhat is the best portable charger right now?\nI've rigorously tested hundreds -- yes, literally hundreds -- of portable chargers in recent years, putting me in the perfect position to identify which ones truly deserve your hard-earned money. It takes a long time to test a power bank, testing that involves power meters to measure capacity and power output, testing durability claims in real world tests, followed by a chunk of time using the item on a day to day basis. But at the end of this, I know just how good a particular power bank is.\nAlso: Best MagSafe battery packs of 2025: Expert tested\nMy pick for the best power bank overall goes to the Anker Nano 10,000 mAh for its portability, quality construction (this power bank has been knocked about by me in a handful of countries), the fact that it has USB-C and USB-A ports which means it caters to both old and new devices. And to top it all off, it comes with a super handy built-in USB-C cable. And you get all that for $30.\nWhile the Anker Nano is my favorite, there are plenty of other options with different price points, features, and brands in mind. For example, if you're looking for a power bank with sheer power, the Cuktech P-series 25,000 mAh can give you several recharges of a smartphone or close to a full recharge of a MacBook Pro, or there's the nearly indestructible Dark Energy Poseidon Pro, which can take a hammering.\nAlso: Anker just recalled another 5 power banks - how to get a refund or free replacement\nAnd fear not, I'm testing handfuls of power banks every month from big brands, looking for the best of the best portable chargers. Right now I'm testing a a few different power banks, and there's at least one that could be making it to this list soon. For now, these are my favorites.\nThe best power banks of 2025\nWhy we like it: It's just everything that most power bank owners want from their power bank, and it really just continues to be the one I recommend to people who say they \"just want a good power bank.\".

And if you're the sort of person who forgets their cable (or you know someone who does this) then this is the power bank for them!\nWho should look elsewhere: This is a bit small for powering a tablet or laptop, and it doesn't make any claims regarding durability, so those looking for something bigger, more powerful, or more rugged should look elsewhere.\nAnker Nano 10,000 mAh tech specs: Capacity: 10,000mAh | Ports: 1 x USB-C cable, 1 x USB-C, 1 x USB-A | Max output: 30W\nWhy we like it: It's tough!

When in Marrakesh, Morocco, I dropped mine onto cobbled streets twice from about one meter, and the power bank was totally unscathed.\nReview: Sharge CarbonMag 5K\nWho's it for: The adventurers out there who want to keep their smartphone topped up throughout the day.\nWho should look elsewhere: 5,000mAh is fine for a day (or two at a push) of keeping your smartphone going, but if you have multiple devices to charge, you're going to need something with 10,000mAh or above capacity.\nSharge CarbonMag 5K tech specs: Capacity: 5,000mAh | Ports: 1 x USB-C, 15W MagSafe | Max output: 20W\nWhy we like it: The Ugreen Nexode 20,000mAh power bank is a powerhouse of functionality.

Additionally, users who only need a power bank for occasional smartphone charging may find this model overkill. Those on a tight budget might also want to explore more affordable options!\nCuktech P-series tech specs: Capacity: 25,000mAh | Ports: 2 x USB-C, 1 x USB-A | Max output: 210W\nWhy we like it: The Nitecore NW5000 is a power bank built for adventure, from its IPX5 water-resistance rating to the carbon fiber-clad design is not only ultra-durable but also keeps it ultralight and ultra-thin.

Its waterproof, rugged, and the lightweight and slim profile means it's easy to carry for days on end, making it a great choice for travelers and adventurers looking for a reliable, durable power source -- as long as they have the ability to recharge it every day or so.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you need a power bank with higher capacity for charging multiple large devices or sustaining power over several days, the NW5000's 5,000mAh capacity isn't going to be enough.\nNitecore NW5000 tech specs: Capacity: 5,000mAh | Ports: 1 x USB-C, 1 x Qi2 wireless charging, | Max output: 20W\nTop portable chargers compared\nWhich is the best power bank really depends on what you want from a power bank -- for some, portability is the main feature, for others it might be having the maximum possible output power.

I particularly like the rounded corners that won't dig through my rucksack or rainjacker. This is perfect for use when camping, hiking, or working outdoors. |\nFactors to consider when choosing a power bank\nA variety of factors impact the quality and usability of power banks. Here are some things to take into consideration before buying one:\n- Battery size: Power banks range from giving your device a single charge to several charges, and may increase in size and price accordingly. I think of anything below 7,500 mAh as a small power bank that perfect for topping up a smartphone, 7,500 to 20,000 mAh as a medium power bank good for a few recharges, and maybe an emergency top-up of a laptop, and 20,000 and above as a big power bank better suited to those wanting to charge laptops and such or who are going to be away from a power outlet for a few days.\n- Portability: Some people want giant power banks for multi-day adventures, while others want something small they can hold in their pocket or purse for daily charging or emergencies.\n- Design: Some want something stylish and sleek, while others want something more like a charging computer than a simple power bank.\n- Weight: Big power banks can really pull on your pocket or bag, so choose wisely if you intend to carry it around with you.\n- Ports: Do you want one or two or more ports? Do you need USB-A or will USB-C be fine? These are points to consider before making a purchase.\n- Passthrough: Do you want to be able to charge the power bank while it is charging other devices? I find this a handy feature when traveling because I can use the power bank as a charger for multiple devices so I only need a small wall charger.\nHow we test power banks\nI test and review a lot of power banks, and this allows me to filter through hundreds of units to find the best of the best. On top of that, I use power banks a lot when traveling or going off-grid for hiking and camping. This allows me to get real-world, hands-on experience of the product for extended periods of time. Finally, every product that I use, test, or review is thoroughly safety tested to make sure that you'll be buying a reliable, safe product.\nHere are the key factors I consider when testing power banks:\n- Capacity: I've seen plenty of companies make exaggerated claims about their power bank's capacity. I charge and discharge each power bank several times to test the rated capacity to make sure that this corresponds with the capacity stated on the box.\n- Power output: A lot of cheaper power banks might be able to hit the rated power output for short periods, but this can take a dive under heavy load or when the power bank gets warm. I test every power bank under heavy load to make sure that it can output the maximum stated output power for extended periods.\n- Safety: If the power bank overheats in use or when charging, it doesn't make this list. Plain and simple.\n- Robustness: How does the power bank stand up to regular use? Does the shell resist scratches and knocks? Are the ports high quality and durable? If it's going to make this list, it must be tough enough to put up with heavy use.\nLatest info on power banks in 2025\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nAlso: Tariff war has tech buyers wondering what's next. Here's what we know\nAccessories such as power banks are predominantly manufactured in these regions, are now subject to tariffs as high as 54% on Chinese imports and 46% on Vietnamese goods. As a result, consumers may see price increases of approximately 20% on these items.\nManufacturers are exploring options like relocating production to countries with lower tariffs, but such shifts are complex and may not provide immediate relief. In the short term, shoppers should anticipate higher costs for accessories due to these trade policies.\nRight now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.\nFAQs on power banks\nAre power banks and portable chargers safe?\nThis is a huge question.\nOn the whole, yes. I've tested hundreds of power banks and portable chargers from a myriad of companies, and as long as you steer clear of the cheap no-name junk that you might find in dollar stores and gas stations you should be safe.\nYou no doubt noticed I said \"should\" there. Let me explain what I mean.\nFirst, even the best power bank makers can and do suffer from manufacturing issues, and these can result in recalls. There were a few last year, and a good reason to buy your power banks from Amazon is that this company sends out emails to customers when this happens.\nAnother issue is that power banks can get damaged, and damaged power banks can be unpredictable. While modern lithium batteries have a number of built in safety features to prevent anything catastrophic from happening, sometimes things can still go wrong. One of the worst things that you can expose a power bank to is moisture, as this can cause short circuits, which in turn can cause fires.\nBut remember, there are hundreds of millions of power banks out there, and incidences are very rare. On the grand scheme of things, lithium batteries are incredibly safe.\nIs there a limit of the size of power bank I can take on an airline?\nThere is, but fear not, because it's actually quite a generous limit.\nFAA rules (and this rule is mirrored by most aviation authorities) allow you to take a power bank with a capacity up to 100Wh or 27,000mAh without declaring it. Beyond this, you must check with the airline and declare the power bank.\nNote that all power banks and anything with a lithium battery must be taken as carry and NOT put in the hold.\nCan you simultaneously use and charge a power bank?\nMost modern power banks have a feature called pass-through charging that allows you to charge it and use it to charge other devices simultaneously. This is a handy feature if you have limited number of power outlets and what to charge multiple devices -- for example, when traveling.\nHow long do power banks last?\nLithium-ion batteries -- the batteries found in most power banks -- are good for about 800 recharge cycles. This means if you used a power bank daily, and each day you ran it empty before recharging it for the next day, you'd get more than two years of life.\nIn reality, people easily get 5 years from a power bank, and normally, it's technology moving forward and making the power bank obsolete that kills it, not usage.\nHow long does charging time vary across power capacity levels?\nThe bigger the power bank's capacity, the longer it will normally take to charge. However, this depends on a lot of factors -- from whether it charges using USB-A or USB-C, to the power output of the charger doing the charging.\nOther power banks to consider\nHere are a couple of alternative power banks to consider -- all from reputable manufacturers and all offering safe, reliable charging.\nLatest Updates:\n- In the latest April update, we tested Dark Energy's Poseidon Pro rugged power bank, adding it as the perfect choice for those looking for a rugged power bank that can survive pretty much everything that Mother Nature can throw at it."
