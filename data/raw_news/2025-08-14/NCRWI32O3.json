  "content": "Bonitto, who is entering the final year of his rookie contract, could return to the field next week. His recent procedure left him with three stitches in his foot, coach Sean Payton said after practice on a sweltering day at the Broncos' team facility.\n\n\u201cIt just made a lot of sense,\u201d Payton said of taking care of the bone spur now rather than trying to manage it through the regular season.\n\nBonitto appears to be next in line for a new contract after the Broncos finalized deals for receiver Courtland Sutton and defensive lineman Zach Allen. Asked if his star pass rusher's absence had anything to do with his contract, Payton opened up about Bonitto's bone-spur issue \u2014 and his own.\n\n\u201cI had two spurs removed on my big toe, and that hurt like you know what,\u201d Payton said. \"I\u2019m still recovering. It\u2019s better. His is something that we just had done, and we knew that he was going to miss this week.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be up and at it next week. He\u2019s been fantastic. The days he\u2019s missed has been this simple bone spur in a unique spot on the top of the foot. It\u2019s not weight bearing.\u201d\n\nBonitto is coming off a season in which he was named second-team All-Pro after leading the team with 13 1/2 sacks.\n\nIt's the second straight week the Broncos have taken part in a joint practice. That's why Payton said he's going to sit most of the starters in Saturday's preseason game against the Cardinals, including quarterback Bo Nix.\n\nHis plan is to play the starters for roughly 10 plays in the final preseason game on Aug. 23 at New Orleans.\n\nNotes: Payton said tight end Nate Adkins will miss some time in the regular season after undergoing a procedure on his ankle. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any other things that they noticed,\u201d Payton said. \u201cIt was a smart decision.\u201d",
