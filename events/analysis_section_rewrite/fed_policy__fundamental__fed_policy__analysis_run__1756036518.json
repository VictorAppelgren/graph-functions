      "feedback": "Your draft has the right macro narrative and cross-asset flavor, but to reach world-class quality it needs a tighter, first-principles regime framework, a fuller multi-year transmission map, and tighter use of the sources. Actionable edits in one compact paragraph: build a four-part structure anchored in invariant anchors (state the horizon as multi-year structural; define real-rate differentials, terms-of-trade, productivity/BOP, and a basic policy-reaction function as the steady-state lens); replace the current narrative with a regime map (e.g., Regime 1: US easing starts with a Sep move and paths lower policy rates here and across peers; Regime 2: policy earnestly tightens or resumes normalization if inflation/performance surprises; Regime 3: policy missteps or geopolitics reset risk premia) with explicit transition triggers (Powell’s Jackson Hole stance, a dovish/hawkish shift signal, BoJ policy shift, sanctions developments in DRC/China, etc.); quantify the expected price-paths using the cited numbers from the sources (e.g., Bessent’s call for 50bp next month amid markets pricing in a Sep cut; 10-year yield around 4.23% in the MEA piece; Tencent AI spend up ~150%; “oil market on track for record oversupply”); map each regime to cross-asset outcomes (USD direction, front- vs long-end yields, equities, and commodities) with concrete but source-grounded implications; deepen the causal chain from policy stance to prices to equity multiples and commodity vol; explicitly acknowledge and reconcile conflicting signals (hawkish Powell vs aggressive easing pricing; China macro caution vs AI upside; gold/dollar reactions); broaden source density beyond GX057ADL7 and 37UZC9X8I to include relevant items from C3ODMIQKZ, TN66GHPAT, H7Q52FKDH, etc., and cite IDs consistently; add a concise “what to watch” and “invalidation/alternative-path” section with non‑ambiguous triggers; ensure the base-case, risks, and confidence levels are clearly demarcated and that every assertion with a numerical implication is tied to an in-source data point (avoiding generic platitudes); finally, clean up formatting so the citations appear as GX057ADL7 and 37UZC9X8I (and the other IDs you actually quote) in a single, coherent reference list rather than parentheses scatter.",
