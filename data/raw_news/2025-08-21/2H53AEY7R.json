  "content": "Erin is starting to turn away from the United States but don\u2019t breathe a sigh of relief just yet: The massive hurricane is still churning up the Atlantic Ocean, keeping dangerous conditions in place for more than 1,000 miles of the East Coast.\n\nHurricane Erin has been a major disruption for coastal communities this week \u2013 especially North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks \u2013 even without making landfall. It\u2019s stirred up life-threatening rip currents and rough surf for days and Erin could keep pushing the ocean onto coastlines through at least Friday.\n\nThe hurricane made its closest approach to US soil Wednesday night as it skirted just 200 miles from the Outer Banks. It brought serious coastal flooding that has eroded beaches and shut down parts of the highway linking the barrier islands.\n\nErin\u2019s northeast turn away from the US began early Thursday and it\u2019s forecast to find its gas pedal soon and accelerate away from the coast.\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect from Erin next and what mark it\u2019s already made.\n\nErin is a Category 2 hurricane and is tracking north-northeast, away from the East Coast, but was still generally paralleling it Thursday.\n\nIts tropical storm-force winds reached nearly 575 miles from end to end Thursday morning, making Erin larger than 90% of tropical systems that have roamed the same part of the Atlantic at a similar strength, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nA myriad of marine warnings from the National Weather Service stretch from Florida to Maine Thursday as Erin\u2019s huge reach roughs up seas.\n\nTropical storm warnings are still in effect for parts of North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland. Erin delivered tropical storm-force wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph to much of the Outer Banks early Thursday morning and some 45 mph gusts to coastal Virginia and Maryland.\n\nFlood threats aren\u2019t over in the Outer Banks. Some of the area\u2019s worst coastal flooding will not arrive until Thursday evening\u2019s high tide cycle, according to the National Weather Service in Morehead City, North Carolina.\n\nAs Erin moves farther north throughout the day, the hurricane will ramp up coastal flooding risks for other parts of the mid-Atlantic as well as the Northeast by driving water levels higher than they should be, especially at high tide. Parts of far southern New Jersey and southern Delaware, for example, could experience major coastal flooding Thursday, according to the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey.\n\nThe rip current risk also remains high today and tomorrow for most of the East Coast. An elevated risk will likely persist at least through the weekend.\n\nMore than 70 people were rescued from rip currents in North Carolina this week, before Erin\u2019s closest pass. \u201cSome of these rips are pulling six to eight people out at a time,\u201d Wrightsville Beach ocean rescue director Sam Proffitt told CNN, describing the conditions as \u201cvery strong\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d Proffitt noted the volume of water moving and funneling out is so intense, it \u201creally doesn\u2019t matter how good of a swimmer you are.\u201d\n\nMany popular beaches up and down the East Coast \u2013 including in North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, New York and New Jersey \u2013 have restricted swimming this week as a result.\n\nErin will lose steam as it heads for the northern Atlantic and enters more hostile atmospheric conditions this weekend and could be a tropical storm by Sunday \u2013 a far cry from the violent Category 5 hurricane it was for a time last weekend.\n\nNorth Carolina remains under a state of emergency after Erin sent large waves crashing into the coastline \u2014 impacting seaside homes and businesses \u2014 and spurred significant coastal flooding in its Outer Banks Wednesday.\n\nEvacuations were ordered ahead of the hurricane for parts of the Outer Banks, including the Hatteras and Ocracoke islands. The North Carolina Ferry System evacuated over 2,200 people and 1,100 cars from Ocracoke Island on Wednesday alone.\n\nOfficials had warned earlier in the week that the region\u2019s Highway 12 \u2013 the slim, scenic stretch of road connecting the barrier islands \u2013 could become completely inaccessible. They were correct.\n\nHighway 12 was closed as of Thursday morning after sand, water and debris covered sections of the roadway overnight. The force of the hurricane-whipped ocean breached and flattened sand dunes designed to protect the roadway in parts of Hatteras and Ocracoke, according to the North Carolina Department of Transportation.\n\nCrews are working to clear the highway, but the transportation department had no estimate Thursday morning on when it would reopen.",

      "text": "Erin is a Category 4 hurricane again, the National Hurricane Center said in its 11 p.m. ET update Sunday, with sustained winds of 130 mph and tropical storm-force winds reaching out 230 miles. The storm was just under a thousand miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina as of Sunday evening.\nErin is expected to continue to strengthen and could double or even triple in size as it moves north and west, causing rough, dangerous ocean conditions across much of the western Atlantic, the Hurricane Center said.\nThe powerful storm has undergone astonishingly rapid changes \u2014 a phenomenon that has become far more common in recent years as the planet warms. It quickly became a rare Category 5 for a time Saturday, before weakening and becoming a larger system on Sunday as it churns through the Atlantic Ocean north of the Caribbean.\nErin went from a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph winds at 11 a.m. Friday to a Category 5 with near 160 mph winds just over 24 hours later. It put Erin in the history books as one of the fastest-strengthening Atlantic hurricanes on record, and potentially the fastest intensification rate for any storm earlier than September 1.\nHurricane Erin is still expected to avoid a direct hit on any land mass, passing north of Puerto Rico, then curving north-northeast into the open Atlantic between the East Coast and Bermuda. As it does so, it is expected to double or even triple in size.\nEven though the hurricane is not anticipated to reach the US mainland, forecasters say rip currents will be a factor beginning Monday across Southern beaches and up to Northeast coastal areas later in the week.\nThe rip current threat will increase before higher surf is evident, so the Weather Service is cautioning people to not base the risk level off whether they see large waves.\n\u201cWhen assessing how people in the US lost their lives from the last 10 years due to tropical storms and hurricanes, about 12% of them were due to rip currents,\u201d according to Cassandra Mora, meteorologist at the Hurricane Center.\nAs a precaution, Dare County in North Carolina \u2014 where the Outer Banks are located \u2014 on Sunday issued a local state of emergency, which includes a mandatory evacuation order for Hatteras Island.\n\u201cCoastal flooding and ocean overwash are expected to begin as early as Tuesday, August 19, 2025 and continue through Thursday, August 21, 2025. Portions of N.C. Highway 12 on Hatteras Island will likely be impassable for several days,\u201d according to a news release.\nThe outer bands of Erin continue to produce heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico, with additional rainfall of 2 to 4 inches expected across the island through Monday, according to the Hurricane Center.\nAdditional rainfall of up to 6 inches is forecast over the Turks and Caicos and the eastern Bahamas through Tuesday. Flash flooding, landslides and mudslides are possible, it added. There are tropical storm warnings in effect in Turks and Caicos Islands and southeast Bahamas.\nSo far, the storm has left 100,000 people without power in Puerto Rico, Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n said in an update Sunday.\nExtremely rapid intensification\nRapid intensification is when a hurricane gains at least 35 mph of wind speed in at least 24 hours. Extreme rapid intensification historically tends to happen in September and October.\nEven more hurricanes are rapidly intensifying in the Atlantic as the oceans and atmosphere warm in response to fossil fuel pollution and the global warming it causes. This likely makes Erin another example of the increasing extremes of a warming world.\nFurthermore, Hurricane Erin is now one of only 43 Category 5 hurricanes on record in the Atlantic \u2014 which makes it rare, though not as rare in the context of recent hurricane seasons \u2014 as peak strength is becoming easier for storms to achieve. It is the 11th Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic since 2016, an unusually high number.\nIt\u2019s also unusual to see a Category 5 storm form so early in the season, particularly outside of the Gulf of Mexico. Mid-August is around the time of peak hurricane activity, but the strongest storms tend to occur later in the season.\nThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is now the fourth straight season to feature a Category 5 storm, with two occurring last year, hurricanes Beryl and Milton.\nThere\u2019s plenty of fuel in the region for Erin to tap into as sea surface temperatures are much warmer than normal. They aren\u2019t quite as warm as the record levels reached in 2023 and 2024, but are still far warmer than they\u2019d be in a world that wasn\u2019t heating up.\nErin is the Atlantic\u2019s first major hurricane of the season. Four other systems roamed the Atlantic basin before Erin \u2014 Andrea, Barry, Chantal and Dexter \u2014 but none were stronger than a tropical storm.\nThe first hurricane of the season typically forms around August 11, so Erin was slightly behind schedule, particularly compared to early arrivals in recent seasons. There had already been three hurricanes \u2014 Beryl, Debby and Ernesto \u2014 by August 15 last year.\nThere will be more chances for tropical systems to develop this month. Longer term forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center highlight the same part of the Atlantic Erin developed in as a place to watch for new storms into at least early September.\nAugust is when the tropics usually come alive: The busiest stretch of the season typically spans from mid-August to mid-October. Forecasters expect above-average tropical activity this year.\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\nCNN\u2019s Ivonne Valdes and Dianne Gallagher contributed reporting."

  "argos_summary": "Hurricane Erin, a rapidly intensifying storm that reached Category\u202f5 strength earlier this week, has skirted the U.S. East Coast, producing dangerous rip currents, rough surf, and coastal flooding\u2014especially on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks\u2014while prompting beach closures and evacuation orders from New York to Maryland. Despite moving north\u2011northeast and likely weakening to a tropical storm by Sunday, Erin\u2019s vast reach continues to pose marine hazards, with rip current risks expected to linger through the weekend. The National Hurricane Center notes the storm\u2019s size and wind field are larger than 90% of similar Atlantic systems, and it remains a significant threat to coastal communities and maritime activities. The rapid intensification of Erin underscores the growing frequency of extreme Atlantic hurricanes linked to warming oceans, and forecasters warn that the storm will likely expand further as it heads into the open Atlantic. Overall, Erin\u2019s passage has caused widespread beach closures, disrupted transportation, and highlighted the ongoing danger of rip currents and storm surge along the eastern seaboard.",
