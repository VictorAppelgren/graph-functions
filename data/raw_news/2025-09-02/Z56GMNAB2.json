  "content": "DELRAY BEACH, Fla., Sept. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- According to MarketsandMarkets\u2122, The nematicides market is projected to reach USD 3.06 billion by 2030 from USD 2.25 billion in 2025, at a CAGR of 6.4% from 2025 to 2030.\n\nThe nematicides market is driven by increasing crop losses caused by plant-parasitic nematodes, rising demand for high-value crops such as fruits, vegetables, and plantation crops, and the growing need to improve yields on limited arable land. Advances in seed-applied treatments, precision agriculture, and integrated pest management (IPM) have enhanced the effectiveness of nematode control, while stricter regulations on chemical fumigants are accelerating the adoption of bio-based alternatives. Additionally, continuous product innovations, supportive government policies, and strategic investments by agrochemical companies are further contributing to market growth.\n\nBy mode of application, soil dressing segment to hold significant market share\n\nBy mode of application, the soil dressing segment is estimated to hold a significant share of the nematicides market, owing to its effectiveness in directly targeting nematodes present in the soil where crop damage begins. This method allows uniform distribution of nematicides, ensuring better penetration into the root zone and providing prolonged protection against nematode infestations. Farmers across major agricultural regions prefer soil dressing because it enhances root establishment, improves nutrient uptake, and ultimately supports higher yields in crops such as vegetables, cereals, and pulses. The technique is particularly effective in intensive farming systems, where nematode pressure is high and consistent crop protection is critical. Additionally, advancements in formulation technologies, including granular and liquid soil-applied products, have made application easier, safer, and more efficient. As demand for sustainable crop protection grows, soil dressing continues to play a pivotal role by enabling precise application, reducing wastage, and maintaining its strong position in the nematicides market.\n\nBy crop type, the fruits & vegetables segment is estimated to hold the largest share of the nematicides market, supported by the high economic value of these crops and their greater susceptibility to nematode infestations. Root-knot and cyst nematodes are particularly damaging to crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, carrots, and citrus, causing significant yield and quality losses. As consumer demand for fresh and residue-free produce continues to grow, farmers are increasingly adopting both chemical and biological nematicides to safeguard productivity and maintain market standards. The intensive cultivation practices and year-round production cycles in horticulture further amplify nematode pressure, making effective management critical. In regions such as Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific, large-scale fruit and vegetable production under protected cultivation systems has accelerated the use of advanced nematicide formulations, including seed-applied and bio-based products. This has reinforced the dominance of the fruits & vegetables segment in the nematicides market.\n\nBy region, North America to hold the largest market share\n\nNorth America is estimated to account for the largest share of the global nematicides market, primarily due to the extensive cultivation of high-value crops such as soybeans, corn, cotton, and vegetables, which are highly vulnerable to nematode infestations. Plant-parasitic nematodes, particularly root-knot, soybean cyst, and lesion nematodes, cause substantial yield losses across the region, driving strong demand for effective management solutions. The large-scale, mechanized farming systems widely adopted in the US and Canada further support the use of nematicides, as farmers seek to maximize productivity and protect profitability on shrinking arable land.\n\nThe region's dominance is also reinforced by the rapid adoption of seed-applied nematicides and the integration of nematode control into precision agriculture practices. Farmers are increasingly relying on seed treatments that provide targeted, cost-effective, and season-long protection against nematodes, aligning with modern sustainable farming practices. Additionally, continuous innovation and product launches by leading agrochemical companies, coupled with strong research support from land-grant universities and government-backed extension programs, have ensured widespread awareness and adoption of advanced nematicide solutions across North America.\n\nFurthermore, North America benefits from a favorable regulatory environment that encourages the introduction of biological and bio-based nematicides, complementing traditional chemical solutions. Growing consumer demand for residue-free produce and rising pressure to comply with environmental safety standards have further accelerated the shift toward sustainable products.\n\nThe report profiles key players such as BASF SE (Germany), Bayer AG (Germany), UPL (India), Corteva (US), Novonesis Group (Denmark), FMC Corporation (US), Nufarm (Australia), Syngenta (Switzerland), American Vanguard Corporation (US), and Sumitomo Chemicals (Japan).\n\nGet 10% Free Customization on this Report: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestCustomizationNew.asp?id=193252005\n\nAgricultural Biologicals Market by Type (Biocontrol, Biostimulants, Biofertilizers), Source (Microbials, Macrobials, Semiochemicals, Natural Products), Mode of Application (Foliar Spray, Seed Treatment, Soil Treatment) - Global Forecast to 2029\n\nAgricultural Microbials Market by Function (Soil Amendment and Crop Protection), Crop Type (Cereals & Grains, Oilseeds & Pulses, Fruits & Vegetables), Type (Bacteria, Fungi, Virus, Protozoa), Application, and Region - Global Forecast to 2030\n\nMarketsandMarkets\u2122 has been recognized as one of America's Best Management Consulting Firms by Forbes, as per their recent report.\n\nMarketsandMarkets\u2122 is a blue ocean alternative in growth consulting and program management, leveraging a man-machine offering to drive supernormal growth for progressive organizations in the B2B space.

      "text": "Agricultural Fumigants Market by Product Type (Methyl Bromide, Phosphine, Chloropicrin), Crop Type (Cereals, Oilseeds, Fruits), Application (Soil, Warehouse), Pest Control Method (Tarpaulin, Non-Tarp, Vacuum), and Region - Global Forecast to 2026\nThe global agricultural fumigants market was valued from $2.2 billion in 2021 to reach $2.7 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 4.2%. The rise in the popularity of agricultural fumigants can be attributed to the increasing infestation of pests & insects in warehouses and other crop storage rooms due to biotic and abiotic factors, awareness about crop protection chemicals, and urbanization in developing markets. Markets such as China and India are among the key markets targeted by agricultural fumigants service providers due to occurrence of the post-harvest losses every year, causing loss to the farmers and other stakeholders involved. These factors are leading to the adoption of agricultural fumigants services in the region.\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study, Request for Free Sample Report\nSeveral drivers such as growing usage of fumigants for the production and storage of cereals, increase in focus on the reduction of post-harvest losses, advancements in storage technology and change in farming practices, and shift in focus on increasing agricultural production will drive the agricultural fumigants market.\nThe demand for food is estimated to rise in Eastern Europe, South America, and Asia. The rise in population and the subsequent increase in demand for food drives the need for increasing agricultural productivity. Increase in agricultural production can be obtained by controlling agricultural losses and with the adoption of technologies, such as fumigation. Agricultural fumigants help improve crop quality by preventing crop losses due to pest attacks. Hence, the global focus on increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural output is expected to increase the demand for agricultural fumigants.\nAgricultural Fumigants Market Growth Dynamics\nDrivers: Increase in focus on the reduction of post-harvest losses\nReduction of post-harvest food losses is a critical component for ensuring food security. Post-harvest losses arise from freshly harvested agricultural produce undergoing changes during handling. Post-harvest losses can be avoided by undertaking fumigation for pest prevention. For example, the decay of citrus post-harvest is controlled by ammonia gas fumigation. Post-harvest green mold and blue mold, caused by Penicillium digitatum and Penicillium italicum, respectively, are effectively controlled by ammonia gas fumigation of lemons and oranges. Thus, fumigation technology helps in preventing post-harvest losses to maintain the quality of agricultural commodities. In addition, fumigation helps in the thorough cleaning of storage areas, silos, or warehouses. This is employed as a further preventative method in pre-harvest cleaning for the storage of grains.\nRestraints: Accumulation of residue during fumigation\nThe amount of residue that remains in the materials treated with fumigants is determined by the conditions existing during fumigation and by the treatment of the material thereon. In some cases, residue levels may be held to a minimum if various factors that lead to residue accumulation are considered before the treatment. Fumigants with high boiling points remain present as residues for a longer time than the more volatile compounds. For example, acrylonitrile was found to remain in wheat for several days, whereas methyl bromide dissipates in a few hours. Fumigants that react with plant or animal constituents may also leave a considerable residue.\nOpportunities: New product launches as alternatives for methyl bromide fumigation\nIncreasing tolerance of pests toward methyl bromide fumigation, followed by its phasing out, has resulted in the adoption of suitable alternatives for methyl bromide for the management of stored products and to quarantine pests. The alternatives for methyl bromide fumigant include phosphine, sulfuryl fluoride, carbonyl sulfide, ethyl formate, hydrogen cyanide, carbon disulfide, methyl iodide, and methyl isothiocyanate. Hence, manufacturers are focusing on new product developments by investing in R&D activities for active ingredients that can inhibit resistant insects by using these alternative fumigants.\nChallenges: Increasing labor costs and other expenses\nSoil fumigation with volatile chemical content is regulated by various governing bodies. It is necessary to find the appropriate fumigant for the varied application base. Further, high labor costs are involved in applying these fumigants with handheld or manual injectors. The main costs associated with fumigation are the costs required for equipment and labor. Only pest control experts that are certified fumigators are permitted to provide fumigation treatment. Fumigation is a highly technical procedure that requires skilled operators using special materials and gas measurement devices.\nMarket Ecosystem\nAgricultural Fumigants Market Segmentation\nBy application, the structural fumigation segment is the fastest growing segment in the market during the forecast period\nStructural fumigation is an effective solution as it seals the entire area to ensure the proper action of fumigants. It is usually used to control pests in soil, grains, and also during the processing of goods to be imported or exported to eliminate the transfer of any exotic organisms. Although it is expensive, it is gaining popularity due to its efficiency in function.\nBy application, the warehouse segment is the fastest growing segment in the market during the forecast period\nWarehouses are important as the agricultural produce can be stored there as long as the farmers is not willing to sell his produce. In warehouses, the efficient use of fumigants results in maintaining crop quality and productivity, which leads to market competitiveness. Various methods of pest control are deployed to kill, repel, or suppress insects, nematodes, and other pests that damage infrastructure, stored food in warehouses. The agricultural fumigants market is gaining traction due to the severe pest infestation caused in warehouses.\nAgricultural Fumigants Market Trends\nAsia Pacific is projected to account for the largest market size during the forecast period\nThe Asia Pacific agricultural fumigants market is projected to be the largest between 2021 and 2026, while the Asia Pacific market is projected to grow at the highest CAGR. Asia Pacific was the largest consumer of agricultural fumigants in 2020, mainly because of the conducive climatic conditions, there is high outbreak of pest and insects witnessed in warehouses and other storage places.

If this happens, farmers may need to use more toxic chemicals or turn to alternative pest control methods, which could reduce demand for soil fumigants.\n4. Alternative technologies: There are several emerging technologies that offer alternatives to soil fumigants, such as biofumigation and cover cropping. If these technologies prove to be effective and cost-competitive, they could reduce demand for soil fumigants.\n5. Cost and availability: Soil fumigants can be expensive, and their availability can be limited in some regions. If the cost of soil fumigants continues to rise, or if they become less available due to regulations or other factors, farmers may need to seek out alternative pest control methods.\nOverall, the soil fumigants market may face several hypothetical challenges in the future, including stricter environmental regulations, public perception concerns, resistance development, emerging alternative technologies, and cost and availability issues. As a result, the market may need to adapt to these challenges by developing more sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives or by investing in emerging technologies that can reduce reliance on soil fumigants.\nMarket Scope of Soil Solarization Market\nSoil solarization is a process that uses solar energy to control soil-borne pests and diseases in agriculture. This technique involves covering the soil with a transparent plastic sheet, which traps solar energy and raises the temperature of the soil, killing pests, weed seeds, and disease-causing microorganisms. Here are some key factors that are driving the market scope of the soil solarization market:\n1. Growing demand for sustainable pest control methods: There is increasing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly pest control methods in agriculture, driven by concerns about the negative impacts of chemical pesticides on human health and the environment. Soil solarization is a preferred method for many farmers because it is a natural, chemical-free way to control pests and diseases.\n2.

In the future, the fumigation industry is expected to impact several sectors, including agriculture, food processing, and construction. Here are some specific examples:\n1. Agriculture: Fumigation is essential in agriculture to control pests that can damage crops and reduce yields. For example, the strawberry industry heavily relies on fumigation to control soil-borne pests such as nematodes. Fumigation is also used in citrus and vegetable production to control pests and diseases.\n2. Stored products: Fumigation is used to control pests that infest stored products such as grain, seeds, and dried fruits. For example, the cocoa industry uses fumigation to control pests such as the cocoa moth, which can damage cocoa beans during storage.\n3. Construction: Fumigation is used in construction to control pests such as termites and wood borers that can damage wooden structures. For example, the construction industry in many countries requires fumigation of wooden packaging materials used in international trade to prevent the introduction of invasive pests.\nIn conclusion, the fumigation industry is expected to play a significant role in several sectors in the future, including agriculture, stored products, and construction.\nTypes of Crop Fumigants\nThere are different types of crop fumigants used in agriculture, including:\n1. Chloropicrin: This is a broad-spectrum fumigant used to control soil-borne pests such as nematodes, fungi, and bacteria. It is often used in combination with other fumigants to enhance efficacy.\n2. Methyl bromide: This is a highly effective fumigant used to control a wide range of pests in soil, stored products, and buildings. However, it is also a potent ozone-depleting substance and has been phased out in many countries.\n3. 1,3-Dichloropropene: This is a soil fumigant used to control nematodes, weeds, and soil-borne diseases. It is often used in combination with other fumigants to enhance efficacy.\n4. Metam sodium/potassium: This is a soil fumigant used to control soil-borne pests such as nematodes, fungi, and bacteria. It is often used in high-value crops such as strawberries, tomatoes, and peppers.\n5. Sulfuryl fluoride: This is a fumigant used to control pests in stored products, such as grain, dried fruits, and nuts.\nThe use of fumigants in agriculture is regulated and subject to strict guidelines to ensure human and environmental safety. In recent years, there has been a shift towards the use of non-fumigant alternatives, such as biological control and crop rotation, to reduce the dependence on chemical fumigants. However, the most commonly used crop fumigant worldwide is metam sodium/potassium.\nAgricultural Fumigants Market Size Estimation\nBoth top-down and bottom-up approaches were used to estimate and validate the total size of the market.

      "text": "According to a research report \"Nematicide Market by Type (Chemical, Biological), Nematode Type (Root-knot, Cyst, Lesion), Mode of Application (Drenching, Soil Dressing, Seed Treatment, Fumigation), Formulation, Crop Type and Region - Global Forecast to 2030\" published by MarketsandMarkets, the nematicides market is projected to reach USD 3.06 billion by 2030 from USD 2.25 billion in 2025, at a CAGR of 6.4% from 2025 to 2030.\nBrowse 150 market data Tables and 80 Figures spread through 310 Pages and in-depth TOC on \"Nematicide Market by Type (Chemical, Biological), Nematode Type (Root-knot, Cyst, Lesion), Mode of Application (Drenching, Soil Dressing, Seed Treatment, Fumigation), Formulation, Crop Type and Region - Global Forecast to 2030\"\nView detailed Table of Content here - https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/nematicides-market-193252005.html\nThe nematicides market is driven by increasing crop losses caused by plant-parasitic nematodes, rising demand for high-value crops such as fruits, vegetables, and plantation crops, and the growing need to improve yields on limited arable land. Advances in seed-applied treatments, precision agriculture, and integrated pest management (IPM) have enhanced the effectiveness of nematode control, while stricter regulations on chemical fumigants are accelerating the adoption of bio-based alternatives. Additionally, continuous product innovations, supportive government policies, and strategic investments by agrochemical companies are further contributing to market growth.\nBy mode of application, soil dressing segment to hold significant market share\nBy mode of application, the soil dressing segment is estimated to hold a significant share of the nematicides market, owing to its effectiveness in directly targeting nematodes present in the soil where crop damage begins. This method allows uniform distribution of nematicides, ensuring better penetration into the root zone and providing prolonged protection against nematode infestations. Farmers across major agricultural regions prefer soil dressing because it enhances root establishment, improves nutrient uptake, and ultimately supports higher yields in crops such as vegetables, cereals, and pulses. The technique is particularly effective in intensive farming systems, where nematode pressure is high and consistent crop protection is critical. Additionally, advancements in formulation technologies, including granular and liquid soil-applied products, have made application easier, safer, and more efficient. As demand for sustainable crop protection grows, soil dressing continues to play a pivotal role by enabling precise application, reducing wastage, and maintaining its strong position in the nematicides market.\nBy crop type, fruits & vegetables segment to hold largest market share\nBy crop type, the fruits & vegetables segment is estimated to hold the largest share of the nematicides market, supported by the high economic value of these crops and their greater susceptibility to nematode infestations. Root-knot and cyst nematodes are particularly damaging to crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, carrots, and citrus, causing significant yield and quality losses. As consumer demand for fresh and residue-free produce continues to grow, farmers are increasingly adopting both chemical and biological nematicides to safeguard productivity and maintain market standards. The intensive cultivation practices and year-round production cycles in horticulture further amplify nematode pressure, making effective management critical. In regions such as Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific, large-scale fruit and vegetable production under protected cultivation systems has accelerated the use of advanced nematicide formulations, including seed-applied and bio-based products. This has reinforced the dominance of the fruits & vegetables segment in the nematicides market.\nBy region, North America to hold the largest market share\nNorth America is estimated to account for the largest share of the global nematicides market, primarily due to the extensive cultivation of high-value crops such as soybeans, corn, cotton, and vegetables, which are highly vulnerable to nematode infestations. Plant-parasitic nematodes, particularly root-knot, soybean cyst, and lesion nematodes, cause substantial yield losses across the region, driving strong demand for effective management solutions. The large-scale, mechanized farming systems widely adopted in the US and Canada further support the use of nematicides, as farmers seek to maximize productivity and protect profitability on shrinking arable land.\nThe region\u2019s dominance is also reinforced by the rapid adoption of seed-applied nematicides and the integration of nematode control into precision agriculture practices. Farmers are increasingly relying on seed treatments that provide targeted, cost-effective, and season-long protection against nematodes, aligning with modern sustainable farming practices. Additionally, continuous innovation and product launches by leading agrochemical companies, coupled with strong research support from land-grant universities and government-backed extension programs, have ensured widespread awareness and adoption of advanced nematicide solutions across North America.\nFurthermore, North America benefits from a favorable regulatory environment that encourages the introduction of biological and bio-based nematicides, complementing traditional chemical solutions. Growing consumer demand for residue-free produce and rising pressure to comply with environmental safety standards have further accelerated the shift toward sustainable products.\nThe report profiles key players such as BASF SE (Germany), Bayer AG (Germany), UPL (India), Corteva (US), Novonesis Group (Denmark), FMC Corporation (US), Nufarm (Australia), Syngenta (Switzerland), American Vanguard Corporation (US), and Sumitomo Chemicals (Japan).\nAbout MarketsandMarkets\u2122\nMarketsandMarkets\u2122 has been recognized as one of America's Best Management Consulting Firms by Forbes, as per their recent report.\nMarketsandMarkets\u2122 is a blue ocean alternative in growth consulting and program management, leveraging a man-machine offering to drive supernormal growth for progressive organizations in the B2B space.
