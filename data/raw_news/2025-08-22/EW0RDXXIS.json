Choose topics from a staggeringly comprehensive list, and suddenly you\u2019re getting just the stories that truly matter to you. It makes the challenge of keeping up with the world almost manageable.\nGo Forward or Backward\nSorry but the previous version was better than this latest revision. Now there is so much news available but not properly categorised or is out of date, you can be forgiven to miss something important. It also wastes time - reviewing old items that certainly should not appear on \u201cMy News\u201d. It may have a categorised place though.... How about a category for \u201cold news\u201d or \u201c Updates\u201d\nTo help with all of this, it would be good if at the end of each item, both in picture format or detailed text, you add the date and time the item was first broadcast. You can also add an update date / time, but keep you first broadcast date / time as well. The date / time of your informative news incidents is important to everyone so this is a very worthy consideration.\nThank you for reading and considering this.\nNot all updates are improvements\nI have had to downgrade this latest version 7.0.0 It\u2019s really not doing it for me, I preferred the old version where you had swipe right to different topics, this scrolling one is terrible, and doesn\u2019t seem to show as many topics, and fresh news is less than it was, The only thing I find I want to scroll is back to the previous Version, still I suppose these app developers have to keep themselves looking busy 2 / 5 and that\u2019s being generous.\nUpdate: Further downgrade to 1 Star, seems the app has a Share function, so you can share news on Facebook etc\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t actually work, you press Share, and select Facebook, it appears to perform a curtsy and that\u2019s it, so it is awkward to use and lacks functionality, don\u2019t know why they did this, the previous version was much better. Pointless\nUpdated Update, well the latest version seems to have fixed the curtsy and I can now share news as a post on Facebook, but sadly the layout is still not improving any, but back up to 2 Stars, I wish they\u2019d go back to the previous sideways scroll, I really can\u2019t find any interest in the vertical scroll.\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, BBC Media Applications Technologies Limited, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.
