  "title": "Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy vows to \u2018push Russia to peace\u2019 as Ukrainians mark independence day",
  "description": "Ukrainian president insists summit with Putin is best way to achieve deal as JD Vance claims Moscow has made new concessions. What we know on day 1,279",
  "content": "\u2022 Volodymyr Zelenskyy insisted that a meeting with Vladimir Putin remained \u201cthe most effective way forward\u201d as the two sides exchanged prisoners and Ukraine marked 34 years since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union. Peace hopes dimmed on Friday when Russia ruled out any immediate meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents but Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the \u201cformat of talks between leaders is the most effective way forward\u201d, renewing calls for a bilateral summit, as sought by US president Donald Trump. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov earlier criticised Zelenskyy for \u201cdemanding an immediate meeting at all costs\u201d but the Ukrainian president, speaking at a ceremony attended by western officials including US envoy Keith Kellogg, vowed \u201cto push Russia to peace\u201d.\n\u2022 US vice-president JD Vance claimed Putin had made \u201csignificant concessions\u201d towards a negotiated settlement, expressing confidence that progress was being made despite the lack of clear signs. Vance told NBC the Russian concessions included that Ukraine would receive security guarantees protecting against future Russian aggression. \u201cThey\u2019ve recognised that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And importantly, they\u2019ve acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d\n\u2022 Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has told Zelenskyy he backs Ukraine\u2019s calls for robust security guarantees as part of any peace deal, saying Canada would not rule out sending troops under such a framework. Carney backed Ukraine\u2019s calls for potential international participation, telling a joint press conference in Kyiv on Sunday: \u201cIn Canada\u2019s judgment, it is not realistic that the only security guarantee could be the strength of the Ukrainian armed forces ... that needs to be buttressed and reinforced.\u201d The two leaders also signed an agreement on drone co-production.\n\u2022 Zelenskyy was asked at the press conference about a Wall Street Journal report that said the Pentagon had for months been quietly blocking Ukraine\u2019s use of the US-supplied Atacms missiles to hit targets deep inside in Russia. In response he said Kyiv had of late been using its own domestically produced long-range weapons to hit targets inside Russia, which are not cleared with Washington. \u201cLately we have not been discussing this issue with the United States.\u201d\n\u2022 Russia said on Sunday that its forces had captured a new settlement in Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region but Ukraine\u2019s top commander said Kyiv\u2019s troops had made gains elsewhere, recapturing three villages in eastern Donetsk region. The Russian defence ministry said it had taken Filia village in Dnipropetrovsk, while Ukraine made no acknowledgement that Filia had changed hands. Moscow says it has been making inroads into Dnipropetrovsk while Ukrainian forces have been pressing to recapture villages in the Donetsk region \u2013 the focal point of the Russian advance \u2013 and to prevent any further movement into Dnipropetrovsk. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s top commander, said on Telegram that Kyiv\u2019s forces had retaken the Donetsk villages of Mykhailivka, Zelenyi Hai and Volodymyrivka. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified.\n\u2022 Moscow has accused Kyiv of launching dozens of drone attacks \u2013 including one that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant \u2013 as Ukrainians marked independence day, reports Angelique Chrisafis. The drone attack on the Kursk plant in western Russia, 37 miles (60km) from the Ukraine border, caused damage to an auxiliary transformer and forced a 50% reduction in the operating capacity of a reactor, Russian authorities said. Ukraine did not immediately comment on the alleged attack. The fire sparked by the drone, which was shot down, had been extinguished and there were no casualties or increased radiation levels, the plant said on Sunday.\n\u2022 Ukraine and Russia said on Sunday they had each sent back 146 prisoners of war and civilians in the latest of a series of swaps. Press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) welcomed the release of two Ukrainian journalists, Dmytro Khyliuk and Mark Kaliush, denouncing \u201ctheir abductions and the abuse they suffered in detention\u201d.",

      "text": "Donald Trump renewed a threat to impose sanctions on Russia if there was no progress toward a peaceful settlement in Ukraine, as Moscow said there remained \u201cno meeting planned\u201d between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make a decision as to what we do and it\u2019s going to be a very important decision, and that\u2019s whether or not it\u2019s massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both, or we do nothing and say it\u2019s your fight,\u201d Trump said, showing apparent frustration at Moscow a week after his meeting with Putin in Alaska.\nThe president said he was unhappy about a Russian strike on an American factory in Ukraine this week, which caused a fire that injured some of the facility\u2019s employees.\nThe Ukrainian president said on Friday that Russia was doing everything it could to prevent a meeting between him and Putin.\nTrump had said he had begun the arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskty meeting after a call with the Russian leader on Monday that followed their Alaska meeting, while Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for Putin to meet him, saying it is the only way to negotiate an end to the war.\nRussia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told NBC there was no meeting planned, but Putin was \u201cready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda would be ready for a summit. And this agenda is not ready at all.\u201d\nThe statement, echoing Moscow\u2019s rhetoric about a leaders\u2019 meeting being impossible unless certain conditions were met, was a setback for Trump, who had spent the week declaring a diplomatic breakthrough in his bid to bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to peace.\nEven as Trump voiced frustration with the slow progress on a potential peace deal, he showed White House reporters a photograph of his meeting with Putin on the red carpet in Alaska, and said Putin wanted to attend the World Cup 2026 football tournament in the US.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to sign this for him. But I was sent one, and I thought you would like to see it, it\u2019s a man named Vladimir Putin, who I believe will be coming, depending on what happens. He may be coming, and he may not, depending on what happens,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump\u2019s comments did not address the fact that Russia was banned from international competitions such as the World Cup after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and has not taken part in qualification for the 2026 tournament, which will be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico.\nDuring a visit to a nuclear research centre on Friday, Putin said there was \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d for a restoration of US-Russia relations.\n\u201cWe had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska,\u201d Putin said, adding \u201cthe next steps now depend on the leadership of the United States, but I am confident that the leadership qualities of the current president.\u201d\nHis comments signalled Russia\u2019s optimism that it can mend relations with the US and strike business deals, despite the lack of clear progress towards ending the Ukraine conflict.\nThousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Russia launched in 2022. Analysts estimate that more than a million soldiers on both sides have been killed or wounded and fighting is continuing unabated, with both sides also attacking energy facilities.\nRussia has maintained its longstanding demand for Ukraine to give up land it still holds in two eastern regions while proposing to freeze the frontline in two more southerly regions Moscow claims fully as its own and possibly hand back small pieces of other Ukrainian territory it controls.\nZelenskyy meanwhile has dropped his demand for a lengthy ceasefire as a prerequisite for a leaders\u2019 meeting, although he has previously said Ukraine cannot negotiate under the barrel of a gun.\nOn Thursday, Zelenskyy had accused Russia of \u201ctrying to wriggle out of holding a meeting\u201d, adding that Moscow wanted to continue the offensive.\nThe question of eventual security guarantees for Ukraine has been front and centre of the US-led diplomatic push to broker a peace deal to end the conflict.\nTrump \u2013 who hosted Zelenskyy and top European leaders at the White House on Monday before making a call to Putin \u2013 said Russia had agreed to some western security guarantees for Kyiv.\nBut Moscow later cast doubt on any such arrangement, Lavrov saying on Wednesday that discussing them without Russia was \u201ca road to nowhere.\u201d\n\u201cWhen Russia raises the issue of security guarantees, I honestly do not yet know who is threatening them,\u201d said Zelenskyy, who wants foreign troops in Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the future.\nWith Reuters, Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press"

Ukraine did not immediately comment on the alleged attack.\nThe fire sparked by the drone, which was shot down, had been extinguished and there were no casualties or increased radiation levels, the plant said on Sunday.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, reported that radiation levels were \u201cnormal\u201d near the Kursk plant. The IAEA has repeatedly warned of the risks of fighting near nuclear plants after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said at least 95 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted across more than a dozen Russian regions on Sunday, when Ukraine celebrated its 1991 declaration of independence.\nUkrainian drones were also shot down over areas far from the frontline, including St Petersburg in the north-west. Firefighters responded to a blaze at the port of Ust-Luga in Russia\u2019s Leningrad region, home to a large fuel export terminal. The regional governor said approximately 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down, and debris had ignited the fire.\nUkraine\u2019s outgunned army has relied heavily on drones to respond to Russia\u2019s invasion, notably targeting oil infrastructure to hit one of the main sources of Moscow\u2019s revenues for funding the war.\nUkraine, meanwhile, said Russia had attacked with a ballistic missile and 72 Iranian-made Shahed attack drones, 48 of which the air force said had been shot down.\nA Russian drone strike killed a 47-year-old woman in Dnipropetrovsk, the eastern region\u2019s governor said.\nRussia has recently claimed new advances in the war, including taking two villages in the eastern Donetsk region on Saturday.\nThe Ukrainian commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Sunday that Kyiv\u2019s forces had reclaimed three other villages in Donetsk, which has emerged as the focal point for peace talks.\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said at a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the country\u2019s independence: \u201cThis is how Ukraine strikes when its calls for peace are ignored.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cToday, both the US and Europe agree: Ukraine has not yet fully won, but it will certainly not lose. Ukraine has secured its independence. Ukraine is not a victim; it is a fighter.\u201d\nZelenskyy said that meeting his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, would be \u201cthe most effective way forward\u201d amid stalled diplomatic attempts to end the war.\nHe said the presence of foreign troops in Ukraine once the war ended would be \u201cimportant\u201d as Kyiv sought to work on potential security guarantees with its allies.\nThe Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, on a visit to Kyiv on Sunday, said it was not \u201cthe choice of Russia how the future sovereignty, independence, liberty of Ukraine is guaranteed\u201d.\nThe US special envoy Keith Kellogg also attended the independence day celebrations, during which the Ukrainian president awarded him the country\u2019s order of merit.\nZelenskyy, asked about reports that the US had revoked permission for strikes deep in Russia while Donald Trump sought to mediate a peace deal with Putin, said Ukraine had lately been using its own weapons to hit Russia and did not consult Washington over this.\nAlso on Sunday, Ukraine and Russia said they had each sent back 146 prisoners of war and civilians in the latest of a series of swaps that remain one of the few areas of cooperation between the countries.\nRussia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.\nPutin has repeatedly rebuffed calls from Ukraine and the west for an immediate ceasefire.\nThe fighting has forced millions of people to flee their homes and destroyed cities and villages across eastern and southern Ukraine.\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this report"

      "text": "US defense officials have blocked Ukraine from using US-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia since late spring as part of a Trump administration effort to get Vladimir Putin to engage in peace talks , according to a report on Saturday.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the Pentagon has blocked Ukraine from using US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems, or Atacms.\nTwo US officials told the outlet that on at least one occasion, Ukraine had sought to use Atacms against a target but was denied under a \u201creview mechanism\u201d developed by Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon\u2019s undersecretary for policy, that governs how US long-range weapons or those provided by European allies that rely on American intelligence and components can be used.\nThe review process also applies to Britain\u2019s Storm Shadow cruise missile because it depends on US targeting data, according to two US officials and a British official, the Journal said.\nThe review system reportedly gives US defense secretary Pete Hegseth approval over the use of the Atacms, which have a range of nearly 190 miles (305km). Ukraine was previously given authority by the Biden administration to use the missile system against targets inside Russia in November after North Korean troops entered the war.\nBefore the inauguration in January, Trump told Time magazine that the decision to allow Ukraine to use US weapons systems to attack targets inside Russia had been a mistake.\n\u201cI disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that? We\u2019re just escalating this war and making it worse. That should not have been allowed to be done,\u201d he said.\nIt is unclear whether the US defense department\u2019s review process amounts to a formal policy change. But it comes alongside increasing control of munitions to Ukraine as US stocks are themselves depleted.\nIn a statement to the Journal, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump \u201chas been very clear that the war in Ukraine needs to end. There has been no change in military posture in Russia-Ukraine at this time.\u201d\nBut last week, amid efforts to broker talks between the Russian president and Voldomyr Zelenskyy, Trump said that Ukraine couldn\u2019t defeat Russia unless it could \u201cplay offense\u201d in the war.\n\u201cIt is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader\u2019s country,\u201d Trump wrote on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning.\u201d\nLast month, the US agreed to supply Ukraine with new weapons systems but only if European nations paid for them. While Trump has said that the US is \u201cnot looking\u201d to provide longer-range weapons that could reach Moscow, US officials told the Journal that the administration has approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition air-launched missiles, or Erams, which have a range of 280 miles (400km)."

      "text": "European leaders have been holding a virtual conference call to discuss what security guarantees they could give to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia. The discussion follows Monday\u2019s unprecedented get-together in the White House hosted by Donald Trump. The US president met Volodymyr Zelenskyy and held talks with Britain\u2019s Keir Starmer, as well as the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato. The main topic was how to end the war in Ukraine, the continent\u2019s biggest since 1945, and how Europe might stop Russia from attacking again.\nWhat security guarantees might Ukraine get? Zelenskyy has said that the details will be worked out and \u201cformalised on paper\u201d within a week to 10 days. As many as 30 countries \u2013 called the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2013 are likely to be involved, with some help from the US, although what that might mean is unclear. Speaking after his meeting on Monday with Donald Trump and European leaders in the White House, Zelenskyy said their support could take many forms.\nRecent Russian advances One of those could be prysutnist (the Ukrainian word for presence), meaning they would provide troops. And it might include intelligence, as well as providing security in the air and on the Black Sea, or simply funds, he said.\nThe key question is, which European governments are willing to take part in a peacekeeping mission inside Ukraine? The UK and France have indicated they are ready to send soldiers as part of a \u201creassurance force\u201d. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed: \u201cWe have to help Ukraine on the ground.\u201d Germany is more sceptical. Many details have yet to be worked out. Would western troops be stationed along a ceasefire line or provide a more limited training role in big cities such as Kyiv and Lviv? And what rules of engagement would they have if they came under Russian fire?\nHow might the US contribute? Trump has promised to coordinate a Europe-led peacekeeping operation in Ukraine. \u201cWhen it comes to security, there\u2019s going to be a lot of help,\u201d he said on Monday, sitting next to Zelenskyy in the Oval Office. The US president made clear European countries would be expected to carry most of the burden. \u201cThey are a first line of defence because they\u2019re there. But we\u2019ll help them out,\u201d he said.\nUkraine wants to buy $90bn worth of US weapons and says they could form part of the security guarantee. Overall, however, Trump has been vague about how much the US would contribute. He has ruled out Ukraine\u2019s membership of Nato, which Kyiv believes would be the best deterrent against a future Russian onslaught. There seems no prospect the US would send its own troops to take part in a peace-keeping mission. One more realistic option would be for the Pentagon to provide logistical support to a proposed \u201csky shield\u201d. The plan envisages an air protection zone in the west and the centre of Ukraine, including over the capital Kyiv, enforced by European fighter jets.\nGraphic Ukraine What does Russia say? According to Trump, Vladimir Putin agreed during their summit in Alaska that Ukraine required security guarantees. Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff has said that these would be outside the auspices of Nato, but would be the equivalent of article 5, Nato\u2019s self-defence pact in which an attack on one is considered an attack on all. Russia\u2019s interpretation of guarantees, however, seems different from Witkoff\u2019s version. The Kremlin says it is categorically opposed to western troops in Ukraine. It is unlikely to accept a peacekeeping force as part of any deal.\nPutin\u2019s war goals, meanwhile, are unchanged and framed in terms of Russia\u2019s own existential security needs. He is demanding the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces, including territory Russia has been unable since 2014 to capture. Putin also wants Ukraine\u2019s \u201cdemilitarisation and denazification\u201d \u2013 meaning severe limits on the size of Kyiv\u2019s army, as well as Zelenskyy\u2019s removal. The intense diplomacy of the past few days may seem like progress. But Russia\u2019s basic position hasn\u2019t changed. Putin has shown no sign he respects Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty or that he wants to stop the war. While Russia\u2019s bombing continues discussion of security guarantees seems moot.\nWhat does history tell us? We have been here before. In 1994 Kyiv agreed to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for international security assurances. Under the terms of the Budapest memorandum the US, Russia, the UK, China and France said they would ensure Ukraine\u2019s \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d and \u201cpolitical independence\u201d. And to \u201crefrain from the use and threat of force\u201d.\nAt the time Ukrainian politicians thought giving up the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal left it open to Russian attack. The Clinton administration was insistent. In May 1997 Russia\u2019s president Boris Yeltsin signed a friendship treaty with his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid Kuchma. Russia recognised Ukraine\u2019s post-Soviet borders. As part of the deal, Kyiv gave Moscow most of its navy, and leased the Crimean port of Sevastopol to the Russians for 20 years.\nNeither agreement stopped Russian aggression. In 2014 the Kremlin used its troops stationed in Crimea to seize and annex the peninsula. Putin now says the whole of Ukraine is \u201chistorical Russia\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s experience of betrayal \u2013 with late 20th-century pledges proving to be worthless \u2013 means it will want better guarantees this time."

President\u202fDonald\u202fTrump has threatened new sanctions on Russia if no progress is made, citing a recent Russian strike on a U.S. factory in Ukraine, and has called for a U.S.\u2011led peacekeeping force, though Russia remains opposed to foreign troops on its soil.  Meanwhile, both sides have exchanged 146 prisoners of war and civilians, and the release of two Ukrainian journalists has been welcomed by Reporters Without Borders.",
