  "description": "The left\u2019s favorite utopian scheme is hitting a wall of reality.",
  "content": "The left\u2019s favorite utopian scheme is hitting a wall of reality. Universal Basic Income (UBI) programs, long promoted by progressives and Silicon Valley billionaires as a silver-bullet solution to poverty, are failing spectacularly, and even their own supporters are being forced to admit it.\n\nPut simply: studies consistently show if government pays people to do nothing, they end up choosing to then do nothing, and the free money does not increase their quality of life.\n\nAccording to reporting by Kelsey Piper highlighted by The Argument and summarized on Substack by S. T. Karnick, multiple gold-standard scientific studies, randomized, controlled, and large enough to remove doubt, show that UBI simply does not work.\n\nPiper argues, \u201cHomeless people, new mothers and low-income Americans all over the country received thousands of dollars. And it\u2019s practically invisible in the data. On so many important metrics, these people are statistically indistinguishable from those who did not receive this aid.\u201d\n\nThe Political Push for UBI\n\n The idea of simply cutting everyone a government check has been pushed into the mainstream over the last decade. Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang made UBI the centerpiece of his 2020 campaign, calling it the \u201cFreedom Dividend\u201d and promising $1,000 per month for every American adult. Members of the progressive wing of Congress, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib, have floated pilot programs or endorsed the idea in principle.\n\nOn the tech side, billionaires Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jack Dorsey have all spoken favorably of UBI as a way to deal with automation or as a supposed social safety net of the future. Their backing gave the movement a cultural megaphone.\n\nMusk has said that the technological benefits of the \u201cA.I. revolution\u201d will guarantee the public \u201cuniversal high income.\u201d\n\nOther than small, local, pilot programs testing UBI, most governments have not yet adopted it on a wider basis. The ruling party in South Africa, the Communist-linked African National Congress or \u201cANC,\u201d which is alleged to be pushing an ongoing genocide against the white minority in the country, is proposing to convert its COVID social relief grants into a full UBI within two years. If successful, it could mark the first national-scale adoption of UBI.\n\nVox has said UBI is \u2018not radical\u2019 and, despite what the science shows, says people would be \u2018better off\u2019 and the only consequence would be \u2018less poverty and higher taxes.\u2019 Vox discusses this left-wing fantasy as a permanent solution to poverty simply held up by privileged rich people who don\u2019t want to pay higher taxes.\n\nLeft-wing groups have said efforts to ban UBI payments \u2018undermine American values\u2019 and falsely claim every study validates their conclusion that handing out money to the poor with no strings attached, results in better policy outcomes.\n\nFar-left political figures like former President Barack Obama, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, have complained about the potential cost of UBI policies, saying that they do not solve enough of the problem to justify their costs.\n\nNoted Economist Thomas Sowell, in interviews, has also warned that UBI programs that promise to replace the onerous costs of administering the welfare state, will, in fact, never be removed. Instead, he warns, UBI will simply end up as another program in addition to all the others.\n\nYet the Results as Studied: Failure Across the Board\n\n In trials and studies, recipients were given thousands of dollars in U.S. trials. The hope was that this free money would cause their lives to improve and their measurable life\u2019s quality to increase. But the data is crystal clear that it did not work:\n\u2022 No improvements in mental health or stress levels\n\u2022 No gains in physical health or sleep\n\u2022 No better education, jobs, or child development outcomes\n\u2022 No increase in overall life satisfaction\n\nAt best, participants worked a little less, but that did not make them any happier. Early stress relief from the cash vanished quickly.\n\nStudies from last year have also shown, in Western countries, that such programs even when well-administered, lead to a reduction in the labor force participation rate. The reduction in work typically correlated with the amount they were being given by the government, meaning that when participants were given $500 from the government, they reduced their working hours so that they typically earned $400 less, netting an average of $100 in greater net wealth.\n\nMedia Cover-Up\n\n The most shocking part is not just the failure of UBI, but the media\u2019s coordinated effort to hide its failures. As Karnick notes, these damning results are consistently obscured by journalists and activist researchers desperate to salvage their ideological dream. Press releases spin \u201ctiny positives\u201d while ignoring the overwhelming null results.\n\nTake Denver\u2019s Basic Income Project. Reports boasted of \u201csignificant improvements in housing outcomes.\u201d In reality, homeless people receiving $1,000 a month were barely more likely to find housing than the control group.\n\nA Noble Lie\n\n Karnick quotes study author Sarah Miller, who admitted that when the results are disappointing, reporters are not eager to cover them. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t interested in reading null results,\u201d she said. This leads to what Piper, the analyst cited in the piece, calls \u201cnoble lies,\u201d a culture where the media deliberately conceals reality to protect progressive narratives.\n\nDefenders of UBI are now trying to shift the proposals away from wide-implementation, and, instead, focus on smaller societal segments such as pregnant women, domestic violence survivors, or people recently released from prison.\n\nUBI proponents are also now trying to say that the policy works in poor countries, but that rich countries have \u2018complex\u2019 problems that money alone cannot solve.\n\nThe evidence shows UBI does not deliver on its promises. It does not improve lives, it does not fix poverty, and it does not justify the trillions of dollars in redistributive spending that Democrats and their allies in Big Tech dream of funneling into such schemes.\n\nAs Karnick concludes, the honest approach is to let the truth come out, however uncomfortable it may be: simply giving money to the poor will not make them rich.",

      "text": "More than 100 guaranteed income pilots have launched in the United States since 2018, and almost all have been unrestricted programs, meaning they place no limitations on recipients. Unlike other in-kind public benefits programs, unrestricted guaranteed income pilots assume recipients can better choose how to allocate resources than government programs can\u2014an assumption that rigorous research has proven accurate. Findings from historic and current guaranteed income experiments demonstrate excellent outcomes for children, and strong gains in adult mental health, physical health, and parenting, as well as large increases in household food security and housing stability.\nDespite these clear results, policymakers in 10 states have prohibited or are seeking to prohibit tests of guaranteed income that use public funds, suggesting they are ineffective and \u201csocialist.\u201d Not only are guaranteed income programs often more effective than existing government programs, they also embody core American values, such as liberty and efficiency. In fact, these deeply American characteristics may explain why outcomes for recipients are often so positive.\nGuaranteed income programs can increase freedom for Americans with low incomes\nWhen the founding fathers spoke of liberty, they meant the freedom of citizens to tend to their households free of government interference. Liberty was also top of mind for Nobel laureate and free-market economist Milton Friedman when he championed the negative income tax (NIT), a form of basic income, as an alternative to the traditional American safety net in the 1970s. Friedman argued that America\u2019s programs for aiding people in poverty involve an \u201c\u2018intolerable degree of paternalism,\u201d transforming social workers into \u201cpolice officers and spies.\u201d By contrast, he said, the NIT would leave financially strapped households with their dignity and privacy intact.\nThe preservation of liberty for people with low incomes is not simply an ideological concern. Studies demonstrate that guaranteed income recipients often show great ingenuity in improving job prospects and children\u2019s well-being; ingenuity that typically would not be possible under the restrictions imposed by current safety net laws and regulations.\nResearch on other social policies shows that restricting freedom of choice, intentionally or not, often has negative consequences. Studies on subsidized housing vouchers, for instance, have shown that many landlords, especially those in higher-income neighborhoods, choose not to accept vouchers. As a result, voucher holders are often forced to rent in neighborhoods that are less safe and offer weak access to good schools, good jobs, transportation, and retail necessities like well-stocked grocery stores, which can have negative effects on child development and adult economic mobility.\nGuaranteed income programs are more efficient than traditional government programs\nUnlike traditional government safety net programs that require reams of red tape and stipulations around the use of funds, guaranteed income initiatives produce good results without wasting much material, time, effort, or energy. As Friedman knew, direct cash has an instant impact on recipients\u2019 income and the administrative costs are low. In contrast, programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families are woefully inefficient, often wasteful of taxpayer dollars, and counterproductive for the families who use them, as well as being rooted in racism.\nIn late 2021, a simple tax rule change in the American Rescue Plan Act expanded the Child Tax Credit for millions of families with low incomes, immediately cutting child poverty in the US by 43 percent. Extensive and rigorous research shows a strong and positive causal impact between household income and children\u2019s cognitive and social-emotional development and health. These outcomes are, in turn, solidly associated with academic and employment success later in children\u2019s lives.\nAdults who receive guaranteed income also make productivity gains. Contrary to the common trope that guaranteed income will discourage recipients from working, data from the long-running Alaska Permanent Fund (PDF) and some other recent randomized controlled trials of guaranteed income pilots show modest increases in adult hours worked. These combined gains for parents and their children offer far more societal value than the weak outputs produced by inefficient social engineering schemes designed to \u201cfix\u201d the work behaviors of people with low incomes.\nAmericans favor guaranteed income programs as a solution to poverty\nAlmost all of today\u2019s guaranteed income projects are experiments designed to look at the role direct cash might play in a modernized American safety net. And a clear majority of the American public is in favor of enacting guaranteed income programs for adult citizens who make below their community\u2019s median income. Policymakers who want to ban tests of guaranteed income should think twice. They may be forgoing insights on the most popular, effective\u2014and American\u2014solution to poverty ever advanced in the US.\nLet\u2019s build a future where everyone, everywhere has the opportunity and power to thrive\nUrban is more determined than ever to partner with changemakers to unlock opportunities that give people across the country a fair shot at reaching their fullest potential. Invest in Urban to power this type of work."

      "text": "Universal basic income (UBI) provides regular payments to all individuals in a community, regardless of their employment status or financial need.

However, Musk thinks that the ramifications will be terrible for humanity.\nHere\u2019s a look at why Musk thinks UBI is inevitable and what he forecasts will be the ultimate result. Next, find out where you could get guaranteed income now, if you qualify.\nMusk Says AI Will Change Everything\nAlthough Musk certainly says a lot of controversial things, there\u2019s no escaping the fact that he is one of the foremost tech entrepreneurs in history. He particularly has the pulse on the development of artificial intelligence.\nIn Musk\u2019s eyes, advances in AI will change the world to the point that eventually, hardly anyone will even have a job. This will require governments to pay out a universal basic income, as most people won\u2019t even be drawing a paycheck.\nIn 2024, Musk took his views a step further, telling the VivaTech conference in Paris that not just a basic income but a high universal income will be the future of the world. As Musk put it, \u201cIn a benign scenario \u2026 probably none of us will have a job. \u2026 But in that benign scenario, there will be universal high income \u2014 not universal basic income, universal high income. There will be no shortage of goods or services.\u201d\nCheck Out: Elon Musk Asks for Reason US Can\u2019t Afford Healthcare \u2014 Mark Cuban Gives 7 (and a Solution)\nWhat Musk Feels Will Be the Consequences\nFor some people, the thought of a future without work and a universal high income may sound like heaven. But the truth is that most people derive value and purpose out of working, and that is the fear that Musk has about the future.\nIf we\u2019re all ultimately replaced by artificial intelligence and don\u2019t need to work, society could become fragmented, and individuals could suffer from depression as they no longer feel a meaning or purpose in their lives.\nAs Musk said at the VivaTech conference, \u201cThe question will really be one of meaning. \u2026 If the computer can do, and the robots can do, everything better than you, then does your life have meaning?\u201d\nFortunately, even Musk sees the future as being more benign than this. Instead of living aimless lives without purpose, Musk believes that there\u2019s another option: \u201cLong term \u2026 any job that somebody does will be optional. \u2026 If you want to do a job as kinda like a hobby, you can do a job, but otherwise, the AI and robots will provide any goods and services that you want.\u201d\nIn this way, the future could end up being the best of both possible worlds. Musk\u2019s vision has AI handling many jobs instead of humans, but that work will always be available for those who want it. Meantime, AI will make the world a more efficient, productive and abundant place. However, for better or worse, Musk does see that universal high income \u2014 not even universal basic income \u2014 will be necessary.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n- 5 Types of Vehicles Retirees Should Stay Away From Buying\n- 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n- 4 Things You Should Do if You Want To Retire Early\n- 7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Elon Musk Says Universal Income Is Inevitable: Why He Thinks That\u2019s a Bad Thing\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

      "text": "Giving people money helped less than I thought it would\nEnding the war on poverty will take more than cash transfers\nJust give people money. It's the simple, brute-force solution to so many problems. In low-income countries, charities are sometimes measured against whether their interventions are better than simply giving people cash. Even in high-income countries like the U.S., when disaster strikes, often the best thing you can do is get money into the hands of affected people immediately. They know whether they should use it to buy gas, rent an Airbnb or fly to their cousin's house one state over.\nSo it wasn't that crazy to assume \u2014 particularly once promising pilots were released \u2014 that the same should be true for addressing chronic poverty in high-income countries. If you give a new mom a few hundred dollars a month or a homeless man one thousand dollars a month, that's gotta show up in the data, right?\nAlas.\nA few years back we got really serious about studying cash transfers, and rigorous research began in cities all across America. Some programs targeted the homeless, some new mothers and some families living beneath the poverty line. The goal was to figure out whether sizable monthly payments help people lead better lives, get better educations and jobs, care more for their children and achieve better health outcomes.\nMany of the studies are still ongoing, but, at this point, the results aren\u2019t \u201cuncertain.\u201d They\u2019re pretty consistent and very weird. Multiple large, high-quality randomized studies are finding that guaranteed income transfers do not appear to produce sustained improvements in mental health, stress levels, physical health, child development outcomes or employment. Treated participants do work a little less, but shockingly, this doesn\u2019t correspond with either lower stress levels or higher overall reported life satisfaction.\nHomeless people, new mothers and low-income Americans all over the country received thousands of dollars. And it's practically invisible in the data. On so many important metrics, these people are statistically indistinguishable from those who did not receive this aid.\nI cannot stress how shocking I find this and I want to be clear that this is not \u201cwe got some weak counterevidence.\u201d These are careful, well-conducted studies. They are large enough to rule out even small positive effects and they are all very similar. This is an amount of evidence that in almost any other context we\u2019d consider definitive. And yet, you'd be hard-pressed to hear about it in the media:\n\u201cOverall, the larger and more credible studies in this space have tended to find worse effects, and yet the press seems to prefer to cover the small pilots that show positive impacts,\u201d Eva Vivalt, a co-author of one recent OpenResearch study on guaranteed income in the U.S., told me.\nThe war on poverty is the unfinished business of American liberalism. No randomized controlled trial is really going to convince me that money does not improve people's lives. But I do think cash as an intervention is best used in emergencies, for pregnant women, domestic violence victims or in other, narrower, contexts where study is still ongoing. It is not going to deliver significant changes for chronic poverty. Winning the war on poverty will require more than just transfers, it will require building and improving institutions that provide education, health care and housing. It's harder this way, but in the words of John Maynard Keynes, \u201cAnything we can do, we can afford.\"\nThe evidence: What do the basic income studies really show?\nFirst, some good news: Poor Americans do not fritter away the cash on \"vice goods,\" like drugs, alcohol or gambling, and the best piece of news is that in qualitative interviews \u2014 when you ask people how they\u2019re doing and what they did with the money \u2014 the recipients give very moving accounts. The money brought comfort, security, hope and steps toward a better future \u2014 just like you\u2019d expect.\nBut if you were hoping that monthly transfers of a few hundred to a thousand dollars could transform the war on poverty, then I think the results are fairly clear at this point: Cash isn't king.\nThe gold standard for a guaranteed income experiment goes something like this: Researchers recruit a large population \u2014 thousands of people, often across multiple cities \u2014 and split them into experimental and control groups. (Sometimes the control group gets a smaller sum of money, $20 or $50 a month, rather than getting nothing.) Researchers arrange to protect other benefits, so no one loses eligibility for Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or other programs. (Losing eligibility for other benefits would make it much harder to usefully test the effects of cash.) Well-designed studies typically preregister what they\u2019ll study so that they can\u2019t p-hack their way to results after the fact.1\nThe team behind Baby\u2019s First Years, one study of a guaranteed income program for new mothers with an emphasis on the effects it would have on mothers and on child development, gave their control group $20 per month and their experimental group $333 per month. They recruited low-income mothers at the hospitals where they gave birth, running the study in Omaha, Nebraska; New York; New Orleans and the Twin Cities. The experimental group had more money (as you would expect) and worked a little less (but it\u2019s probably good if mothers of young babies can cut back on hours slightly). They also spent slightly more money on stuff for their kids.\nBut there was not much else. The cash transfers did not improve maternal health outcomes or child health outcomes. They had no effect on stress, depression, body mass index, how often children got sick or the children\u2019s overall health. They did not improve mothers\u2019 self-reported relationship quality or measures of psychological distress. There was no effect on child development.\n\u201cI was very surprised \u2014 we were all very surprised,\u201d UC Irvine economist Greg Duncan, one of the study authors, told The New York Times. \u201cThe money did not make a difference.\u201d\nBut maybe, it just takes a lot more cash. \u201c$333 a month in a time of inflation, a historic pandemic \u2026 that's just not going to go very far,\u201d Amy Castro, faculty director of the University of Pennsylvania Center for Guaranteed Income Research, observed to me.\nOn some level, she has to be right. As an area gets richer, people\u2019s life outcomes get systematically better. But it matters quite a lot how much money it takes to see meaningful improvements.\nA Compton, California, RCT tried $500 per month for two years. They found \u201cno significant effects of the transfers on labor supply; assets; psychological well-being; financial security; or food insecurity.\u201d The biggest effect they found was on other income sources: The groups receiving transfers worked fewer hours or got paid less than people in the control group. The lost nontransfer income averaged $333 a month.\nNow, I think the working poor having more free time is a good outcome. Except that the participants were asked to rate their own psychological well-being \u2026 and nothing changed.\nOK, well let's double it.\nThe OpenResearch unconditional income study tried $1,000 per month for three years, while the control group got $50 per month. They found that participants worked less \u2014 but nothing else improved. Not their health, not their sleep, not their jobs, not their education, and not even time spent with their children. They did experience a reduction in stress at the start of the study, but it quickly went away.\n\u201cI was surprised at how little we found that looked great,\u201d Sarah Miller, one of the study authors, told me.\nI want to pause for a moment and note how weird this is. Most studies on the relationship between income and well-being in the U.S. find that increases in income predict increases in well-being. Research from the earned income tax expansion in 1993 found that the extra cash improved stress and maternal health. Direct cash payments not making people better off is a surprising finding \u2014 and while Baby\u2019s First Years and Compton are relatively small sums of money, OpenResearch is larger.2\nNone of the researchers I spoke with believed that giving people money actually makes them no better off. \u201cI can't really believe that more income is worse,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cThat would mean that recessions are good. We know their consumption went up. A lot of times that\u2019s a fundamental measure of well-being.\u201d\nBut then, what\u2019s going on?\nI scoured these reports for answers. Where was the money going? People weren't blowing it all on \u201cvices\u201d like gambling, tobacco or alcohol. It\u2019s generally proportionate to overall spending, so: lots on housing and transportation, some on food and child care. The Compton study found that people paid down their debt some. There\u2019s no obvious single pain point for these families.\nMaybe this isn\u2019t as confusing as it initially feels. If you gave me an extra 10% of my income to spend, it would absolutely make me better off \u2014 just not necessarily in ways you could measure.\nI might give some to friends going through a time of need, which makes my community stronger even if it doesn\u2019t show up in a study looking at my habits. I might take the kids across the country to visit my aging grandparents \u2014 stressful, but worth it in a way that probably doesn\u2019t show up on a mental health inventory.\n\u201cIt's very hard to evaluate something like cash,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cYou might spend it on a new car and I might spend it on a vacation and someone else might spend it on their kids and when you average that all together it's hard to find anything.\u201d No study with this setup can demonstrate conclusively that money didn\u2019t help someone.\nBut they can \u2014 and did \u2014 demonstrate that giving low-income people money in this format does not advance other policy priorities. It will not (at any detectable scale) make them measurably healthier or happier, or get them better jobs, or improve their children\u2019s intellectual development. Certainly not if it\u2019s a big \u201cgive everyone cash\u201d program \u2014 researchers did point out to me that some much more narrowly targeted cash programs that are currently underway were pulling their weight.\nThe basic income cover-up: death by a thousand press releases\nThese latest small-to-null results largely weren\u2019t surprising to people who watch this issue closely. Many of them had realized years ago, when the first such studies came out, that the effects of cash weren\u2019t going to be transformative.\nWhile exciting big results from pilots tend to make headlines and travel quickly on social media, sobering results from RCTs generally don\u2019t.\nThe depressing facts I've recounted for you are largely missing, obscured or glossed over in the public communications about these studies. Articles focus on tiny positives or, at best, will note the evidence is uncertain. Very few articles or press releases put the big picture together even if they cover one disappointing result.\nPerhaps the most egregious offender is the Denver Basic Income Project \u2014 the most bizarre set of findings I reviewed. This is what a prominent part of the report section of their website looks like:\n\"All payment groups showed significant improvements in housing outcomes, including a remarkable increase in home rent and ownership, and decrease in nights spent unsheltered.\u201d\nI guess I can't call this a lie per se, but in reality they gave $1,000 a month to homeless people and they were barely more likely than the control group to get housing.3\nTime for some media criticism; It's not just the researchers' fault. Even when researchers don\u2019t understate a null or negative result, they told me that journalists are often less eager to go to press with it. \u201c[Researchers have] written a dozen null effect papers, they\u2019re trying to get the result out there,\u201d Miller told me. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t interested in reading [them].\u201d\nOne researcher said that the university press office seemed to lose interest in a press release about their paper once they learned it was a null result, saying that publication could affect support for public assistance programs. (The researcher was unimpressed. The press release did eventually go out.)\nIt's easy to say a bunch of true things, yet leave your reader less informed. And even if a study gets covered, there are several different ways to write the same take. When covering Baby\u2019s First Years, you can highlight the fact that mothers felt more confident about parenting, or you can show the disappointing results on child development metrics.\nIn some ways, the way that we identify promising anti-poverty programs is itself setting us up for failure. Local governments, multiple researchers told me, will often only really get excited about a program if they\u2019ve seen eye-popping results from a pilot program elsewhere. They want a silver bullet.\nMany of the people working on guaranteed income chafe at the fact that their programs can be criticized for not measuring up, precisely because they conducted high-quality studies in the first place! \u201cWhen we look at every other anti-poverty regulation, we don't test it with this level of rigor,\u201d Castro pointed out to me.\nIt is true that it would have been impossible for me to write an article about whether high-quality randomized studies found SNAP had benefits for food insecurity even if I wanted to, because we didn\u2019t do RCTs when we introduced SNAP.4\nThe standards are higher for guaranteed income than they were for most anti-poverty measures when they were introduced. But increasing rigor is a good thing. It can allow us to shift focus from programs that don\u2019t seem to move the needle toward ones that do.\n\u201cThere is a menu of cash options we should be looking at,\u201d Stacia West, director of the Center for Guaranteed Income Research, told me. \u201cThere's cash writ large, and then there are targeted life events.\u201d\nAmong the many studies still underway, there are much more specific and targeted cash programs \u2014 say, aimed at pregnant women, people just leaving prison or those recovering from a major negative life shock \u2014 that look promising. If we hesitate to say what works and what doesn\u2019t, money will be wasted on things that don\u2019t work: money that could have gone where it would make a difference.\nI am excited to see whether BIG:LEAP\u2019s finding that cash can help victims of domestic violence is reproduced in upcoming work. I\u2019m excited to see the results of cash for pregnant women to improve pregnancy outcomes, cash for parolees to prevent recidivism and cash in response to major shocks and life events.\nI hope that some of those deliver on their early promise and help us advance the project of addressing poverty. But whatever the results are, we should not bury or exaggerate them.\nWe're in a dangerous epistemic environment. One where widespread agreement on basic facts is scarce and noble lies have permeated the halls of truth-seeking organizations like the media. Those of us who care about ending poverty have to choose the integrity of our work over trying to play 5D chess and hoping no one else knows the rules.\nIf you look through a hundred outcomes, you\u2019ll definitely find some that improved just by chance. Cherry picking these is a bad scientific practice known as \u201cp-hacking\u201d \u2014 and with basic income, there are far more than a hundred possible outcomes to check.\nNot every large RCT has found only null results. BIG:LEAP, in Los Angeles, gave out $1,000 a month for one year and found a reduction in intimate partner violence at the 18 month endpoint among those who had experienced it in the past. But the overall population of BIG:LEAP recipients weren\u2019t overall better off \u2014 measures of psychological distress were actually worse in the treatment group at 12 and at 18 months.\n43% of the control group (that got $50 per month) found housing by the end of the study, 44% of the experimental group (that got $1000 per month) found housing by the end of the study and 48% of the other experimental group (that got a $6,500 lump sum and then $500 per month) found housing by the end of the study. So basically, people found housing at the same rate regardless of whether they were given $50, $1000 or $500 (plus a massive lump sum).\nWhat you can do, of course, is look at the effects of SNAP expansions or cutbacks \u2014 which make it clear the program does have direct and immediate impacts on its target policy metrics.\nA lack of money is the definition of being poor, but it isn't the cause of being poor. The causes lie elsewhere -- skills, intelligence, impulsiveness, criminality, addiction.\nInstead of giving out money, it appears the better path will prove to be (1) education to provide skills, (2) treatment to curb bad behavior and (3) more law enforcement when incentives don't work.\nKelsey, thanks for putting this article together! I\u2019m curious if you reviewed or discussed with researchers the studies on the impact of the expanded/2021 Child Tax Credit? I gather that those are not RCTs, but is there anything to gain from the observational data on that large scale policy intervention (and withdrawal from it)?"

      "text": "I\u2019ve been following debates on guaranteed income for almost a decade, and one thing that\u2019s stood out is that universal basic income (UBI), a regular cash payment to all citizens with no strings attached, is like a Rorschach test.\nBasic income is less radical than you think\nA world with basic income is one of less poverty and higher taxes, not utopia or collapse.\nSome people see UBI as a \u201ccapitalist road to communism\u201d or a world free of work. Others see everything from a means of unleashing the population\u2019s creative potential to a policy that would undermine human agency and erode \u201cpsychological capital.\u201d Some see it as a way to shore up the welfare state. Others, a way to bulldoze it.\nIn part, that\u2019s because unless you pin down the details, basic income is too vague to mean anything politically concrete. Like the Rorschach inkblot, you can interpret and design UBI in an endless variety of ways. A program that provides $250 per month is a different ballgame than one providing $1,200 per month. The same goes for one that replaces all other welfare, like food aid (sometimes referred to as a \u201cpure UBI,\u201d which would actually leave the most disadvantaged worse off, and is a bad idea), compared with one that complements existing programs.\nUltimately, the effects of any income guarantee hinge on the details. How much does it pay? Who gets it? How\u2019s it financed? How does it relate to the rest of the welfare state? But most of the real proposals that have made their way through the policy world share a noteworthy trait: When the dust settles, they just wouldn\u2019t be that radical, in either direction.\nGenerally, most people at the bottom of the income ladder would be better off, those in the middle would break even as they pay about as much in higher taxes as they\u2019d receive from the basic income, and those at the top would be a little worse off. Society would neither ascend into utopian communism nor collapse into bleak idleness. There would just be less poverty and higher taxes.\nI see this as good news. If basic income won\u2019t be the silver bullet that changes \u2014 or destroys \u2014 society, it becomes something far more politically tractable: a moderately effective policy, albeit one with trade-offs, that is well worth considering.\nThe many faces of basic income\nAmong actual basic income proposals, some definitely have more of a radical edge than others. But not in terms of their economic effects. What\u2019s radical about imagining a $1,000 per month UBI isn\u2019t so much how it\u2019d affect the economy \u2014 again, some would be better off, others would break even, others would be worse off. It\u2019s how to get a program with a $3 trillion price tag through a Congress that couldn\u2019t even solidify an incredibly successful basic income for children \u2014 the temporarily expanded child tax credit \u2014 that only cost about $100 billion.\nEven if the $3 trillion version were to pass, perhaps by effectively communicating how taxing some of the benefits back would lower the program\u2019s net cost, the result would land US federal spending as a percentage of GDP right around where France and Scandinavian countries already sit. Which is to say, from the perspective of other social democracies, that level of spending would be normal.\nOne way to blunt the more radical politics of UBI is to style the income guarantee as a negative income tax (NIT) instead. The main difference is that NIT\u2019s are means-tested, phasing out their benefit levels as earned income rises. Doing so could lower the sticker price while achieving basically the same economic effects as a UBI considered together with higher taxes, which claw back the benefits to achieve a similar effect as the NIT means-test phasing them out.\nFor example, one 2021 proposal outlined an NIT-style basic income that guaranteed $12,500 to all adults (plus an additional $4,500 per child). The benefit would begin phasing out when household income (calculated for two-adult households) reaches $15,000, and would zero out at a household income of $70,000. It was estimated to cost $876 billion per year. Compare that to the $3-or-so trillion of high-end UBI proposals that guarantee a similar amount.\nSince NIT can be made equivalent in distribution to UBI, but the politics lean in favor of the former, there\u2019s an argument to be made that NIT is the realistic path forward. \u201cA leading task for the left is to legitimize the notion of a new NIT,\u201d writes the economist Max Sawicky in an excellent overview piece. \u201cThere are genuine ways to attenuate the power of Capital \u2026 The na\u00efve version of UBI isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\nThere are, of course, other trade-offs to consider. NIT imposes a hefty administrative burden, where monthly payments would have to be tuned to fluctuating incomes. There may also be a psychological difference between phasing out benefits and paying higher taxes.\nBut if you put that whole debate aside and keep poking at the economic effects of UBI, its radical mystique continues to dissipate.\nThe general pattern of basic income\u2019s economic impact\nAs my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote, \u201cwhether or not basic income is a good idea depends entirely on how you pay for it.\u201d In addition, when you look at UBI together with however you propose to pay for it, you begin to see through the radical veil.\nConsider one of the most common pairings: paying for UBI with a value-added tax (VAT \u2014 sorry, another acronym), a type of consumption tax used across 170 countries worldwide, including all of Europe, leveled on all purchases, including goods and services.\nThe economist William Gale ran the numbers on coupling a 10 percent VAT with a UBI payout that would range from $2,500 for individuals to about $5,200 for a family of four. The results look like this:\nThe poorest 20 percent of Americans would see their after-tax income rise about 17 percent \u2014 a significant anti-poverty gain. The next 20 percent of Americans would see only a modest gain, roughly 5 percent. The middle 20 percent would experience basically no change. The gains from their UBI would almost perfectly cancel out the higher tax rates they\u2019d pay. And the remaining upper classes would see modest decreases in income, with the tax costs outstripping their UBI benefits.\nWhile the numbers will vary based on the details of the proposal, the trend is general: broad-based taxation coupled with a universal payout, the basic formula of most realistic UBI proposals, tends to leave those at the bottom better off, those in the middle about even, and those at the top a little worse off. It\u2019s not incredibly radical \u2014 it\u2019s just an effective anti-poverty policy.\nTurning to the macroeconometric models that economists use to predict how various policy changes might affect the economy, you\u2019ll find a similar story. Whether predicting the effects of a tax-funded UBI with the progressive-leaning Levy Institute model or the more centered Penn Wharton Budget Model, GDP and employment rates neither balloon nor crater. Neither model foretells an upheaval in the economic order of things, just a few percentage points in one direction or the other.\nWe also have suggestive empirical evidence from 2021, the year we had that UBI for kids. The results were as follows: struggling families found it easier to feed their children, pay their utility bills, invest in education, and pay the rent. Employment rates hardly budged, moving us no closer \u2014 or farther away, depending on your tastes \u2014 to a world without work. (Though, to be fair, a program everyone knows is temporary likely has less impact on employment than if it were permanent.)\nRadical ideas have their place. They can stretch our collective imagination, and keep us from falling victim to the belief that there are no fundamental alternatives to the present arrangement of our world. But basic income doesn\u2019t have to be one of them, and shedding that association offers at least two payoffs.\nIt could bring basic income further into the realm of pragmatic policy analysis, where wonks of all stripes present their views on whether or not the programs\u2019 tradeoffs are worth it. Second, for those who want to elevate their sights on radical possibilities that might exceed political realities, why not dream bigger?"

      "text": "Universal basic income\n| Part of a series on |\n| Universalism |\n|---|\n| Category |\nUniversal basic income (UBI)[note 1] is a social welfare proposal in which all citizens of a given population regularly receive a minimum income in the form of an unconditional transfer payment, i.e., without a means test or need to perform work.[2][3][4] In contrast, a guaranteed minimum income is paid only to those who do not already receive an income that is enough to live on. A UBI would be received independently of any other income. If the level is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (i.e., at or above the poverty line), it is considered a full basic income; if it is less than that amount, it is called a partial basic income.[5] As of 2025, no country has implemented a full UBI system, but two countries\u2014Mongolia and Iran\u2014have had a partial UBI in the past.[6] There have been numerous pilot projects,[7] and the idea is discussed in many countries. Some have labelled UBI as utopian due to its historical origin.[8][9][10]\nThere are several welfare arrangements that can be considered similar to basic income, although they are not unconditional. Many countries have a system of child benefit, which is essentially a basic income for guardians of children. A pension may be a basic income for retired persons. There are also quasi-basic income programs that are limited to certain population groups or time periods, like Bolsa Familia in Brazil, which is concentrated on the poor, or the Thamarat Program in Sudan, which was introduced by the transitional government to ease the effects of the economic crisis inherited from the Bashir regime.[11] Likewise, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted some countries to send direct payments to its citizens. The Alaska Permanent Fund is a fund for all residents of the U.S. state of Alaska which averages $1,600 annually (in 2019 currency), and is sometimes described as the only example of a real basic income in practice. A negative income tax (NIT) can be viewed as a basic income for certain income groups in which citizens receive less and less money until this effect is reversed the more a person earns.[12]\nCritics claim that a basic income at an appropriate level for all citizens is not financially feasible, fear that the introduction of a basic income would lead to fewer people working, and consider it socially unjust that everyone should receive the same amount of money regardless of their individual needs. Proponents say it is indeed financeable, arguing that such a system, instead of many individual means-tested social benefits, would eliminate more expensive social administration and bureaucratic efforts, and expect that unattractive jobs would have to be better paid and their working conditions improved because there would have to be an incentive to do them when already receiving an income, which would increase the willingness to work. Advocates also argue that a basic income is fair because it ensures that everyone has a sufficient financial basis to build on and less financial pressure, thus allowing people to find work that suits their interests and strengths.[13]\nEarly examples of unconditional payments to citizens date back to antiquity, and the first proposals to introduce a regular unconditionally paid income for all citizens were developed and disseminated between the 16th and 18th centuries. After the Industrial Revolution, public awareness and support for the concept increased. At least since the mid-20th century, basic income has repeatedly been the subject of political debates. In the 21st century, several discussions are related to the debate about basic income, including those concerning the automation of large parts of the human workforce through artificial intelligence (AI), and associated questions regarding the future of the necessity of work. A key issue in these debates is whether automation and AI will significantly reduce the number of available jobs and whether a basic income could help prevent or alleviate such problems by allowing everyone to benefit from a society's wealth, as well as whether a UBI could be a stepping stone to a resource-based or post-scarcity economy.\nHistory\n[edit]Antiquity\n[edit]Ancient Egypt had a strong, unified theocratic state that owned key parts of the Egyptian economy, including granaries that dispensed grain to the public during hard times.[14]\nIn a 46 BC triumph, Roman general and dictator Julius Caesar gave each common Roman citizen 100 denarii. Following his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar's will left 300 sestertii (or 75 denarii) to each citizen.[15] Trajan, emperor of Rome from 98 to 117 AD, personally gave 650 denarii (equivalent to perhaps US$430 in 2023) to all common Roman citizens who applied.[16]\n16th century\n[edit]In his Utopia (1516), English statesman and philosopher Thomas More depicts a society in which every person receives a guaranteed income.[17] In this book, basic income is proposed as an answer to the statement \"No penalty on earth will stop people from stealing, if it's their only way of getting food\", stating:[18]\ninstead of inflicting these horrible punishments, it would be far more to the point to provide everyone with some means of livelihood, so that nobody's under the frightful necessity of becoming first a thief, and then a corpse.\nSpanish scholar Johannes Ludovicus Vives (1492\u20131540) proposed that the municipal government should be responsible for securing a subsistence minimum to all its residents \"not on the grounds of justice but for the sake of a more effective exercise of morally required charity.\" Vives also argued that to qualify for poor relief, the recipient must \"deserve the help he or she gets by proving his or her willingness to work.\"[19]\n18th century\n[edit]English-born American philosopher Thomas Paine authored Common Sense (1776) and The American Crisis (1776\u20131783), the two most influential pamphlets at the start of the American Revolution. His essay, Agrarian Justice,[20] was published in 1797. In it, he proposed concrete reforms to abolish poverty. In particular, he proposed a universal social insurance system comprising old-age pensions and disability support, and universal stakeholder grants for young adults, funded by a 10% inheritance tax focused on land, it is also considered one of the earliest proposals for a social security system. Thomas Paine summarized his view by stating that \"Men did not make the earth. It is the value of the improvements only, and not the earth itself, that is individual property. Every proprietor owes to the community a ground rent for the land which he holds.\" Paine saw inheritance as being partly a common fund and wanted to supplement the citizen's dividend in a tax on inheritance transfers.\nIn 1797, English Radical Thomas Spence published The Rights of Infants[21] as a response to Thomas Paine's Agrarian Justice. In this essay Spence proposes the introduction of an unconditional basic income to all members of the community. Such allowance would be financed through the socialization of land and the benefits of the rents received by each municipality. A part of everyone's earnings would be seized by the State, and given to others.\n19th century\n[edit]Henry George proposed to create a pension and disability system, and a broad social support system from a single tax on land and natural resource value. Social support would be distributed to residents \"as a right\" instead of as charity. George mentioned, but did not stress, the possibility of direct cash distribution of land rent. His ideas gave rise to the economic philosophy now known as Georgism or the \"single tax movement\", which is an economic ideology holding that, although people should own the value they produce themselves, the economic rent derived from land\u2014including from all natural resources, the commons, and urban locations\u2014should belong equally to all members of society.[22][23][24] Some Georgists refer to unconditional basic income funded by the single tax as a citizen's dividend in reference to Thomas Paine's proposal from the 19th century.\nEarly 20th century\n[edit]Around 1920, support for basic income started growing, primarily in England.\nBertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) argued for a new social model that combined the advantages of socialism and anarchism, and that basic income should be a vital component in that new society. In his 1918 book Roads to Freedom, Russell wrote \"... the plan we are advocating amounts essentially to this: that a certain small income, sufficient for necessaries, should be secured to all, whether they work or not, and that a larger income \u2013 as much larger as might be warranted by the total amount of commodities produced \u2013 should be given to those who are willing to engage in some work which the community recognizes as useful...\"[25]\nIn the United Kingdom at the end of World War I, Dennis and Mabel Milner, a Quaker married couple of the Labour Party, published a short pamphlet entitled \"Scheme for a State Bonus\" (1918) that argued for the \"introduction of an income paid unconditionally on a weekly basis to all citizens of the United Kingdom.\" They considered it a moral right for everyone to have the means to subsistence, and thus it should not be conditional on work or willingness to work.[26][27]\nC. H. Douglas was an engineer who became concerned that most British citizens could not afford to buy the goods that were produced, despite the rising productivity in British industry. His solution to this paradox was a new social system he called social credit, a combination of monetary reform and basic income.\nIn 1944 and 1945, the Beveridge Committee, led by the British economist William Beveridge, developed a proposal for a comprehensive new welfare system of social insurance, means-tested benefits, and unconditional allowances for children. Committee member Lady Rhys-Williams argued that the incomes for adults should be more like a basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model.[28][29] Her son Sir Brandon Rhys-Williams proposed a basic income to a parliamentary committee in 1982, and soon after that in 1984, the Basic Income Research Group, now the Citizen's Basic Income Trust, began to conduct and disseminate research on basic income.[30]\nLate 20th century\n[edit]Milton Friedman proposed a negative income tax (NIT), which effectively sanctioned a basic income for all, in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom.[26] In his 1964 State of the Union address, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson declared an \"unconditional war on poverty,\" implemented in coming years with sweeping legislation.[31] Johnson broadened the agenda to the Great Society, including education, civil rights, health care, and support for the arts.[32] In this political climate, the idea of a guaranteed income for every American also took root.[33] Notably, a 1968 document, signed by 1200 economists, called for a guaranteed income for every American.[34] Four ambitious basic income experiments started on the related concept of negative income tax.[35] President Richard Nixon explained the Family Assistance Plan's purpose as to provide both a safety net for the poor and a financial incentive for welfare recipients to work.[36] Congress eventually approved a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly and the disabled.[36]\nIn the mid-1970s, the main competitor to basic income and negative income tax, the Earned income tax credit (EITC) and its advocates won over enough legislators for the US Congress to pass laws on that policy.[37] In 1986, the Basic Income European Network (later renamed the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN)) was founded, with academic conferences every second year.[38] Other advocates included the green political movement, other activists, and some groups of unemployed people.[39]\nIn the late 20th century, discussions were held around automatization and jobless growth,[40] the possibility of combining economic growth with ecologically sustainable development, and how to reform the welfare state bureaucracy.[41] Basic income was interwoven in these and many other debates.[42] During the BIEN academic conferences, scholars published papers about basic income from a wide variety of perspectives.[43]\n21st century\n[edit]In recent years, the idea has come to the forefront more than before. The Swiss referendum about basic income in 2016 was covered in media worldwide, despite its rejection.[44] Famous business people like Elon Musk,[45] Pierre Omidyar,[46] and Andrew Yang have lent their support, as have high-profile politicians like Jeremy Corbyn[47] and Tulsi Gabbard.[48] The Institute for Public Policy Research predicted that 59% of tasks currently done by humans could be affected by AI in the next three to five years. Universal basic Income could help fill the gap left by this \"jobs apocalypse.\"[49]\nIn 2019, in California, then-Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs initiated an 18-month pilot program of guaranteed income for 125 residents as part of the privately funded S.E.E.D. project there.[50]\nIn the 2020 Democratic Party primaries, political newcomer Andrew Yang touted basic income as his core policy. His policy, referred to as a \"Freedom Dividend\", would have provided adult American citizens US$1,000 a month independent of employment status.[51]\nOn 21 January 2021, in California, the two-year donor-funded Compton Pledge[50] began distributing monthly guaranteed income payments to a \"pre-verified\" pool of low-income residents,[50] in a program gauged for a maximum of 800 recipients, at which point it would be one of the larger among 25 U.S. cities exploring this approach to community economics.\nBeginning in December 2021, Tacoma, Washington, piloted \"Growing Resilience in Tacoma\" (GRIT), a guaranteed income initiative that provided $500 a month to 110 families. GRIT is part of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Guaranteed Income Research larger study. A report on the results of the GRIT experiment was published in 2024.[52]\nResponse to COVID-19\n[edit]As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact, universal basic income and similar proposals such as helicopter money and cash transfers were increasingly discussed across the world.[53] Most countries implemented forms of partial unemployment schemes, which effectively subsidized workers' incomes without a work requirement. Around ninety countries and regions including the United States, Spain, Hong Kong, and Japan introduced temporary direct cash transfer programs to their citizens.[54][55]\nIn Europe, a petition calling for an \"emergency basic income\" gathered more than 200,000 signatures,[56] and polls suggested widespread support in public opinion for it.[57][58] Unlike the various stimulus packages of the US administration, the EU's stimulus plans did not include any form of income-support policies.[59]\nBasic income vs negative income tax\n[edit]This section needs editing to comply with Wikipedia's Manual of Style. (January 2024) |\nThe diagram at right shows a basic income/negative tax system combined with flat income tax (the same percentage in tax for every income level). Y is here the pre-tax salary given by the employer and y' is the net income.\nNegative income tax\nFor low earnings, there is no income tax in the negative income tax system. They receive money, in the form of a negative income tax, but they do not pay any tax. Then, as their labour income increases, this benefit, this money from the state, gradually decreases. That decrease is to be seen as a mechanism for the poor, instead of the poor paying tax.\nBasic income\nThat is, however, not the case in the corresponding basic income system in the diagram at right. There, everyone typically pays income taxes. But on the other hand, everyone also gets the same amount of basic income.\nBut the net income is the same\nBut, as the orange line in the diagram shows, the net income is anyway the same. No matter how much or how little one earns, the amount of money received is the same, regardless of which of these two systems are used.\nBasic income and negative income tax are generally seen to be similar in economic net effects, but there are some differences:\n- Psychological. Philip Harvey accepts that \"both systems would have the same redistributive effect and tax earned income at the same marginal rate\" but does not agree that \"the two systems would be perceived by taxpayers as costing the same\".[60]: 15, 13\n- Tax profile. Tony Atkinson made a distinction based on whether the tax profile was flat (for basic income) or variable (for NIT).[61]\n- Timing. Philippe Van Parijs states that \"the economic equivalence between the two programs should not hide the fact that they have different effects on recipients because of the different timing of payments: ex-ante in Basic Income, ex-post in Negative Income Tax\".[62]\nPerspectives and arguments\n[edit]Automation\n[edit]There is a prevailing opinion that we are in an era of technological unemployment \u2013 that technology is increasingly making skilled workers obsolete.\nOne central rationale for basic income is the belief that automation and robotisation could result in technological unemployment, leading to a world with fewer paid jobs. A key question in this context is whether a basic income could help prevent or alleviate such problems by allowing everyone to benefit from a society's wealth, as well as whether a UBI could be a stepping stone to a resource-based or post-scarcity economy.[45][64][65][66]\nU.S. presidential candidate and nonprofit founder Andrew Yang has stated that automation caused the loss of 4 million manufacturing jobs and advocated for a UBI (which he calls a Freedom Dividend) of $1,000/month rather than worker retraining programs.[67] Yang has stated that he is influenced by Martin Ford. Ford believes that the emerging technologies will fail to deliver much employment; on the contrary, because the new industries will \"rarely, if ever, be highly labor-intensive\".[68] Similar ideas have been debated before in history\u2014that \"the machines will take the jobs\". What is new is the existence of several academic studies that forecast a future with substantially less employment, in the decades to come.[69][70][71] Additionally, US President Barack Obama stated that he believes that the growth of artificial intelligence will lead to an increased discussion around the idea of \"unconditional free money for everyone\".[72]\nEconomics and costs\n[edit]Some proponents of UBI have argued that basic income could increase economic growth because it would sustain people while they invest in education to get higher-skilled and well-paid jobs.[73][74] However, there is also a discussion of basic income within the degrowth movement, which argues against economic growth.[75]\nAdvocates contend that the guaranteed financial security of a UBI will increase the population's willingness to take risks,[76] which would create a culture of inventiveness and strengthen entrepreneurial spirit.[77]\nThe cost of a basic income is one of the biggest questions in the public debate as well as in the research and depends on many things. It first and foremost depends on the level of the basic income as such, and it also depends on many technical points regarding exactly how it is constructed.\nWhile opponents claim that a basic income at an adequate level for all citizens cannot be financed, their supporters propose that it could indeed be financed, with some advocating a strong redistribution and restructuring of bureaucracy and administration for this purpose.[78]\nAccording to statements of American Enterprise Institute-affiliated Libertarian/conservative scholar Charles Murray, recalled and sanctioned in 2016 by the George Gibbs Chair in Political Economy and Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and nationally syndicated columnist[79][80] Veronique de Rugy, as of 2014, the annual cost of a UBI in the US would have been about $200 billion less expensive than the US social safety-net system put in place at that date.[81] By 2020, it would have been nearly a trillion dollars less expensive.[82]\nAmerican economist Karl Widerquist argues that simply multiplying the amount of the grant by the population would be a naive calculation, as this is the gross costs of UBI and does not take into account that UBI is a system where people pay taxes on a regular basis and receive the grant at the same time.[83]\nAccording to Swiss economist Thomas Straubhaar, the concept of UBI is basically financeable without any problems. He describes it as \"at its core, nothing more than a fundamental tax reform\" that \"bundles all social policy measures into a single instrument, the basic income paid out unconditionally.\"[84] He also considers a universal basic income to be socially just, arguing that although all citizens would receive the same amount in the form of the basic income at the beginning of the month, the rich would have lost significantly more money through taxes at the end of the month than they would have received through the basic income, while the opposite is the case for poorer people, similar to the concept of a negative income tax.[84]\nRecent theoretical work has introduced alternative mathematical approaches to the allocation of basic income. One such example is the Boltzmann fair division model, which applies the Boltzmann distribution from statistical mechanics to resource or income allocation.[85] In this framework, each individual's share is assigned probabilistically according to an exponential function of a specified attribute (such as need or contribution), providing a flexible mechanism to balance fairness and efficiency in basic income distribution.\nInflation of labor and rental costs\n[edit]One of the most common arguments against UBI stems from the upward pressure on prices, in particular for labor and housing rents, which would likely cause inflation.[86] Public policy choices such as rent controls or land value taxation would likely affect the inflationary potential of universal basic income.[86]\nWork\n[edit]Many critics of basic income argue that people, in general, will work less, which in turn means less tax revenue and less money for the state and local governments.[87][88][89][90] Studies include:\n- In negative income tax experiments in the United States in 1970, there was a five percent decline in the hours worked. The work reduction was largest for second earners in two-earner households and weakest for primary earners. The reduction in hours was higher when the benefit was higher.[88]\n- In the Mincome experiment in rural Dauphin, Manitoba, also in the 1970s, there were slight reductions in hours worked during the experiment. However, the only two groups who worked significantly less were new mothers, and teenagers working to support their families. New mothers spent this time with their infant children, and working teenagers put significant additional time into their schooling.[91]\n- A 2024 study investigated the impact of $1,000/month UBI over a period of 3 years for 1,000 randomized low-income participants in two U.S. states, which represented an around 40% increase in household income. The study found an income effect with a decrease of non-UBI income by $1,500/year, a decrease in non-UBI household income by 21% of the UBI transfer, a 2% decrease in labor market participation, no significant change in time spent on childcare, no self-reported decrease in barriers to employment, a null result for changes in job quality, an increase in entrepreneurial orientation but no significant change in entrepreneurial activity, while enrollment in tertiary education showed a slight increase for participants below 30 years of age.[92]\nAlthough it is difficult to know for sure what will happen if a whole country introduces basic income, there are nevertheless some studies that have attempted to look at this question:\n- A study from 2017 showed no evidence that people worked less because of the Iranian subsidy reform (a basic income reform).[93]\nRegarding the question of basic income vs jobs, there is also the aspect of so-called welfare traps. Proponents of basic income often argue that with a basic income, unattractive jobs would necessarily have to be better paid and their working conditions improved, so that people still do them without need, reducing these traps.[94]\nPhilosophy and morality\n[edit]By definition, universal basic income does not make a distinction between \"deserving\" and \"undeserving\" individuals when making payments. Opponents argue that this lack of discrimination is unfair: \"Those who genuinely choose idleness or unproductive activities cannot expect those who have committed to doing productive work to subsidize their livelihood. Responsibility is central to fairness.\"[95]\nProponents usually view UBI as a fundamental human right that enables an adequate standard of living which every citizen should have access to in modern society.[96] It would be a kind of foundation guaranteed for everyone, on which one could build and never fall below that subsistence level.\nIt is also argued that this lack of discrimination between those who supposedly deserve it and those who do not is a way to reduce social stigma.[95]\nIn addition, proponents of UBI may argue that the \"deserving\" and \"undeserving\" categories are a superficial classification, as people who are not in regular gainful employment also contribute to society, e.g. by raising children, caring for people, or doing other value-creating activities which are not institutionalized. UBI would provide a balance here and thus overcomes a concept of work that is reduced to pure gainful employment and disregards sideline activities too much.[97]\nHealth and poverty\n[edit]The first comprehensive systematic review of the health impact of basic income (or rather unconditional cash transfers in general) in low- and middle-income countries, a study that included 21 studies of which 16 were randomized controlled trials, found a clinically meaningful reduction in the likelihood of being sick by an estimated 27%. Unconditional cash transfers, according to the study, may also improve food security and dietary diversity. Children in recipient families are also more likely to attend school and the cash transfers may increase money spent on health care.[98] A 2022 update of this review confirmed these findings based on a body of evidence (35 studies, the majority being large randomized controlled trials) and additionally found that unconditional cash transfers also reduce the likelihood of living in extreme poverty.[99]\nThe Canadian Medical Association passed a motion in 2015 in support of basic income and for basic income trials in Canada.[100]\nAdvocates\n[edit]Pilot programs and experiments\n[edit]Since the 1960s, but in particular since the late 2000s, several pilot programs and experiments on basic income have been conducted around the world. Some examples include:\n1960s\u22121970s\n[edit]- Experiments with negative income tax in the United States and Canada in the 1960s and 1970s.\n- The province of Manitoba, Canada experimented with Mincome, a basic guaranteed income, in the 1970s. In the town of Dauphin, Manitoba, labor decreased by 13%, less than expected. This program was ended after issues with the cost becoming unsustainable started to arise.[101][102]\n2000\u22122009\n[edit]- The basic income grant in Namibia launched in 2008 and ended in 2009.[103]\n- An independent pilot implemented in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil launched in 2009.[104]\n2010\u22122019\n[edit]- Basic income trials ran in 2011\u20132012 in several villages in India,[105] whose government has proposed a guaranteed basic income for all citizens.[106] It was found that basic income in the region raised the education rate of young people by 25%.[107]\n- Iran became the first country to introduce a system of UBI in December 2010.[108][109] It was paid to all citizens and replaced the gasoline subsidies, electricity, and some food,[110] that the country applied for years to reduce inequalities and poverty. The sum corresponded in 2012 to approximately US$40 per person per month, US$480 per year for a single person, and US$2,300 for a family of five people.[111][112]\n- In Spain, the ingreso m\u00ednimo vital, the income guarantee system, is an economic benefit guaranteed by the social security in Spain, but in 2016 was considered in need of reform.[113]\n- In South Korea the Youth Allowance Program was started in 2016 in the City of Seongnam, which would give every 24-year-old citizen 250,000 won (~US$215) every quarter in the form of a \"local currency\" that could only be used in local businesses. This program was later expanded to the entire province of Gyeonggi in 2018.[114][115]\n- The GiveDirectly experiment in a disadvantaged village of Nairobi, Kenya, benefitting over 20,000 people living in rural Kenya, was the longest-running basic income pilot as of November 2017, which is set to run for 12 years.[116][117][118]\n- A project called Eight in a village in Fort Portal, Uganda, was launched by a nonprofit organization in January 2017, providing income for 56 adults and 88 children through mobile money.[119]\n- A two-year pilot the Finnish government began in January 2017 involved 2,000 subjects.[120][121] In April 2018, the Finnish government rejected a request for funds to extend and expand the program from Kela (Finland's social security agency).[122]\n- An experiment in the city of Utrecht, Netherlands launched in early 2017, that is testing different rates of aid.[106]\n- A three-year basic income pilot that the Ontario provincial government, Canada, launched in the cities of Hamilton, Thunder Bay and Lindsay in July 2017.[123] Although called basic income, it was only made available to those with a low income and funding would be removed if they obtained employment,[124] making it more related to the current welfare system than true basic income. The pilot project was canceled on 31 July 2018 by the newly elected Progressive Conservative government under Ontario Premier Doug Ford.\n- In Israel, in 2018 a non-profit initiative GoodDollar started with an objective to build a global economic framework for providing universal, sustainable, and scalable basic income through the new digital asset technology of blockchain. The non-profit aims to launch a peer-to-peer money transfer network in which money can be distributed to those most in need, regardless of their location, based on the principles of UBI. The project raised US$1 million from a financial company.[125][126]\n- The Rythu Bandhu scheme is a welfare scheme started in the state of Telangana, India, in May 2018, aimed at helping farmers. Each farm owner receives 4,000 INR per acre twice a year for rabi and kharif harvests. To finance the program a budget allocation of 120 billion INR (US$1.55 Billion as of May 2022) was made in the 2018\u20132019 state budget.[127]\n2020\u2212present\n[edit]- Swiss non-profit Social Income started paying out basic incomes in the form of mobile money in 2020 to people in need in Sierra Leone. Contributions finance the international initiative from people worldwide, who donate 1% of their monthly paychecks.[128]\n- In May 2020, Spain introduced a minimum basic income, reaching about 2% of the population, in response to COVID-19 in order to \"fight a spike in poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic\". It was expected to cost state coffers three billion euros ($3.5 billion) a year.\"[129]\n- In August 2020, a project in Germany started that gives a \u20ac1,200 monthly basic income in a lottery system to citizens who applied online. The crowdsourced project lasted three years and be compared against 1,380 people who do not receive basic income.[130] When the project was finished in August 2023, Mein Grundeinkommen calculated that a tax-financed universal basic income of \u20ac1,200 per month could be financed for every adult in Germany that would make 80% of adults better off.[131]\n- In October 2020, HudsonUP[132] was launched in Hudson, New York, by The Spark of Hudson[133] and Humanity Forward Foundation[134] to give $500 monthly basic income to 25 residents. It will last five years and be compared against 50 people who are not receiving basic income.\n- In May 2021, the government of Wales, which has devolved powers in matters of Social Welfare within the UK, announced the trialling of a universal basic income scheme to \"see whether the promises that basic income holds out are genuinely delivered\".[135] From July 2022 over 500 people leaving care in Wales were offered \u00a31600 per month in a 3-year \u00a320 million pilot scheme, to evaluate the effect on the lives of those involved in the hope of providing independence and security to people.[136]\n- In July 2022, Chicago began a year-long guaranteed income program by sending $500 a month to 5,000 households for one year in a lottery system to citizens who applied online.[137] A similar program was launched in late 2022 by Cook County, Illinois (which encompasses the entirety of Chicago as well as several suburbs) which sent monthly $500 payments to 3,250 residents with a household income at or below 250% of the federal poverty level for two years.[138]\n- In June 2023, The Guardian reported that a universal basic income of \u00a31,600 a month is to be trialled in two places in England \u2013 Jarrow and East Finchley.[139]\nPayments with similarities\n[edit]Alaska Permanent Fund\n[edit]The Permanent Fund of Alaska in the United States provides a kind of yearly basic income based on the oil and gas revenues of the state to nearly all state residents. More precisely the fund resembles a sovereign wealth fund, investing resource revenues into bonds, stocks, and other conservative investment options with the intent to generate renewable revenue for future generations. The fund has had a noticeable yet diminishing effect on reducing poverty among rural Alaska Indigenous people, notably in the elderly population.[140] However, the payment is not high enough to cover basic expenses, averaging $1,600 annually per resident in 2019 currency[141] (As of 2019[update] it has never exceeded $2,100), and is not a fixed, guaranteed amount. For these reasons, it is not always considered a basic income. However, some consider it to be the only example of a real basic income.[142][143]\nWealth Partaking Scheme\n[edit]Macau's Wealth Partaking Scheme provides some annual basic income to permanent residents, funded by revenues from the city's casinos. However, the amount disbursed is not sufficient to cover basic living expenses, so it is not considered a basic income.[144]\nBolsa Fam\u00edlia\n[edit]Bolsa Fam\u00edlia is a large social welfare program in Brazil that provides money to many low-income families in the country. The system is related to basic income, but has more conditions, like asking the recipients to keep their children in school until graduation. As of March 2020, the program covers 13.8 million families, and pays an average of $34 per month, in a country where the minimum wage is $190 per month.[145]\nOther welfare programs\n[edit]- Pension: A payment that in some countries is guaranteed to all citizens above a certain age. The difference from true basic income is that it is restricted to people over a certain age.\n- Child benefit: A program similar to pensions but restricted to parents of children, usually allocated based on the number of children.\n- Conditional cash transfer: A regular payment given to families, but only to the poor. It is usually dependent on basic conditions such as sending their children to school or having them vaccinated. Programs include Bolsa Fam\u00edlia in Brazil and Programa Prospera in Mexico.\n- Guaranteed minimum income differs from a basic income in that it is restricted to those in search of work and possibly other restrictions, such as savings being below a certain level. Example programs are unemployment benefits in the UK, the revenu de solidarit\u00e9 active in France, and citizens' income in Italy.\nPetitions, polls and referendums\n[edit]- 2008: An official petition for basic income was launched in Germany by Susanne Wiest.[146] The petition was accepted, and Susanne Wiest was invited for a hearing at the German parliament's Commission of Petitions. After the hearing, the petition was closed as \"unrealizable\".[147]\n- 2013\u20132014: A European Citizens' Initiative collected 280,000 signatures demanding that the European Commission study the concept of an unconditional basic income.[148]\n- 2015: A citizen's initiative in Spain received 185,000 signatures, short of the required number to mandate that the Spanish parliament discuss the proposal.[149]\n- 2016: The world's first universal basic income referendum in Switzerland on 5 June 2016 was rejected with a 76.9% majority.[150][151] Also in 2016, a poll showed that 58% of the EU's population is aware of basic income, and 64% would vote in favour of the idea.[152]\n- 2017: Politico/Morning Consult asked 1,994 Americans about their opinions on several political issues including national basic income; 43% either \"strongly supported\" or \"somewhat supported\" the idea.[153]\n- 2018: The results of a poll by Gallup conducted last year between September and October were published. 48% of respondents supported universal basic income.[154]\n- 2019: In November, an Austrian initiative received approximately 70,000 signatures but failed to reach the 100,000 signatures needed for a parliamentary discussion. The initiative was started by Peter Hofer. His proposal suggested a basic income sourced from a financial transaction tax, of \u20ac1,200, for every Austrian citizen.[155]\n- 2020: A study by Oxford University found that 71% of Europeans are now in favour of basic income. The study was conducted in March, with 12,000 respondents and in 27 EU-member states and the UK.[156] A YouGov poll likewise found a majority for universal basic income in United Kingdom[157] and a poll by University of Chicago found that 51% of Americans aged 18\u201336 support a monthly basic income of $1,000.[158] In the UK there was also a letter, signed by over 170 MPs and Lords from multiple political parties, calling on the government to introduce a universal basic income during the COVID-19 pandemic.[159]\n- 2020: A Pew Research Center survey, conducted online in August 2020, of 11,000 U.S. adults found that a majority (54%) oppose the federal government providing a guaranteed income of $1,000 per month to all adults, while 45% support it.[160]\n- 2020: In a poll by Hill-HarrisX, 55% of Americans voted in favour of UBI in August, up from 49% in September 2019 and 43% in February 2019.[161]\n- 2020: The results of an online survey of 2,031 participants conducted in 2018 in Germany were published: 51% were either \"very much in favor\" or \"in favor\" of UBI being introduced.[162]\n- 2020: An October survey of 1,026 Australians by YouGov found a 58% support for universal basic income.[163]\n- 2021: A Change.org petition calling for monthly stimulus checks in the amount of $2,000 per adult and $1,000 per child for the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic had received almost 3 million signatures.[164]\nSee also\n[edit]- 2021\u20132023 inflation surge\n- Citizen's dividend\n- Disability benefits\n- Economic, social and cultural rights\n- Equality of outcome\n- Estovers\n- FairTax \u00a7 monthly tax rebate\n- Geolibertarianism\n- Global basic income\n- Happiness economics\n- Humanistic economics\n- Involuntary unemployment\n- Job guarantee\n- Left-libertarianism\n- Lifelong wage\n- Limitarianism (ethical)\n- List of basic income models\n- Living wage\n- Moral universalism\n- New Cuban economy\n- Old Age Security\n- Participation income\n- Post-work society\n- Quatinga Velho\n- Rationing\n- Real freedom\n- Right to an adequate standard of living\n- Social dividend\n- Social safety net\n- Social security\n- Speenhamland system\n- The Triple Revolution\n- Universal inheritance\n- Universal value\n- Universalism\n- Wage subsidy\n- Welfare capitalism\n- Working time\nNotes\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper\".

      "text": "Poor, Poor, Pitiful UBI Performance\nThere is one thing that is universal about universal basic income programs: gold-standard scientific studies all show that they do not work.\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) payments do not improve recipients\u2019 lives, a proponent of such plans has reluctantly concluded with laudable honesty. Gold-standard studies show that UBI does not work, writes Kelsey Piper at The Argument:\nJust give people money. It\u2019s the simple, brute-force solution to so many problems. In low-income countries, charities are sometimes measured against whether their interventions are better than simply giving people cash. Even in high-income countries like the U.S., when disaster strikes, often the best thing you can do is get money into the hands of affected people immediately. They know whether they should use it to buy gas, rent an Airbnb or fly to their cousin\u2019s house one state over.\nSo it wasn\u2019t that crazy to assume\u2014particularly once promising pilots were released\u2014that the same should be true for addressing chronic poverty in high-income countries. If you give a new mom a few hundred dollars a month or a homeless man one thousand dollars a month, that\u2019s gotta show up in the data, right?\nAlthough it \u201cwasn\u2019t that crazy to assume\u201d that money makes people better off regardless of how it is obtained, it is untrue, Piper writes:\nAlas.\nA few years back we got really serious about studying cash transfers, and rigorous research began in cities all across America. Some programs targeted the homeless, some new mothers and some families living beneath the poverty line. The goal was to figure out whether sizable monthly payments help people lead better lives, get better educations and jobs, care more for their children and achieve better health outcomes.\nMany of the studies are still ongoing, but, at this point, the results aren\u2019t \u201cuncertain.\u201d They\u2019re pretty consistent and very weird. Multiple large, high-quality randomized studies are finding that guaranteed income transfers do not appear to produce sustained improvements in mental health, stress levels, physical health, child development outcomes or employment. Treated participants do work a little less, but shockingly, this doesn\u2019t correspond with either lower stress levels or higher overall reported life satisfaction.\nHomeless people, new mothers and low-income Americans all over the country received thousands of dollars. And it\u2019s practically invisible in the data. On so many important metrics, these people are statistically indistinguishable from those who did not receive this aid.\nPiper recounts gold-standard (randomized controlled trial) studies that consistently and uniformly show the extra money has little to no effect on the recipients\u2019 overall well-being even though they are not \u201cblowing it all on \u2018vices\u2019 like gambling, tobacco or alcohol.\u201d The payments do not improve \u201ctheir health, not their sleep, not their jobs, not their education, and not even time spent with their children,\u201d Piper writes. \u201cThey did experience a reduction in stress at the start of the study, but it quickly went away.\u201d\nThe studies are comprehensive, accurate, and true, Piper writes:\nI cannot stress how shocking I find this and I want to be clear that this is not \u201cwe got some weak counterevidence.\u201d These are careful, well-conducted studies. They are large enough to rule out even small positive effects and they are all very similar. This is an amount of evidence that in almost any other context we\u2019d consider definitive. And yet, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to hear about it in the media.\u201d\nThe American press consistently mislead the public about this research, as do the authors of less-reliable studies, through \u201cdeath by a thousand press releases,\u201d Piper notes:\nThe depressing facts I\u2019ve recounted for you are largely missing, obscured or glossed over in the public communications about these studies. Articles focus on tiny positives or, at best, will note the evidence is uncertain. Very few articles or press releases put the big picture together even if they cover one disappointing result.\nPerhaps the most egregious offender is the Denver Basic Income Project\u2014the most bizarre set of findings I reviewed. This is what a prominent part of the report section of their website looks like:\n\u201cAll payment groups showed significant improvements in housing outcomes, including a remarkable increase in home rent and ownership, and decrease in nights spent unsheltered.\u201d\nI guess I can\u2019t call this a lie per se, but in reality they gave $1,000 a month to homeless people and they were barely more likely than the control group to get housing.\nThe American press has been mendacious in covering this issue, consistently concealing the failure of studies to indicate that UBI works. Piper writes,\nIt\u2019s not just the researchers\u2019 fault. Even when researchers don\u2019t understate a null or negative result, they told me that journalists are often less eager to go to press with it. \u201c[Researchers have] written a dozen null effect papers, they\u2019re trying to get the result out there,\u201d [study author Sarah] Miller told me. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t interested in reading [them].\u201d\nPiper rightly laments this mass denial of reality in which \u201cwidespread agreement on basic facts is scarce and noble lies have permeated the halls of truth-seeking organizations like the media.\u201d (The media are not \u201ctruth-seeking organizations,\u201d unfortunately.) Piper\u2019s solution is to let the truth come out, whatever it is, and act accordingly. That is the position of a real scientist, policy analyst, policymaker, or decent human being.\nCreate a niche and it will be filled .\nIf you pay people to be idle, more people will be idle? Who would have expected that?"

  "argos_summary": "The article argues that rigorous randomized studies show universal basic income (UBI) fails to improve recipients\u2019 health, employment, or well\u2011being, with only short\u2011term stress relief and minimal work reduction. It highlights that media coverage often downplays these null results, creating a \u201cnoble lie\u201d that masks UBI\u2019s ineffectiveness. The piece notes that while some pilots claim modest benefits, the evidence consistently indicates UBI does not lift poverty or increase productivity, calling for a more realistic assessment of cash transfer policies.",
