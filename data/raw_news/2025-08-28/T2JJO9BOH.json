  "title": "Battlefield 6 won't actually boot stomp Black Ops 7, analyst says, because Call of Duty fans on \"autopilot\" will \"buy it even if they complain about it\"",
  "description": "\"Breaking it requires more than one awesome Battlefield release\"",
  "content": "Battlefield 6 has more hype behind it than the series has seen in years, and its beta's Steam numbers even stomped Call of Duty, but one analyst reckons the game still won't easily outsell Black Ops 6. And it's all because Call of Duty, even at its lowest point, is still a stronger brand than Battlefield at its top form - for now, at least.\n\nThat comes courtesy of Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliot, who reports Battlefield 6 is doing more-than-healthy numbers on Steam with over 2.7 million wishlists and around $35 million worth of pre-orders ahead of its October 10 release date.\n\nIt's a welcome change of pace for the series after Battlefield 5 and 2042 somewhat muddied the water, and all the success has mainly been fuelled by Battlefield 6's impressive open beta period, which even prompted former Blizzard Entertainment boss Mike Ybarra to predict \"Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year.\"\n\nBut Alinea Analytics' report suggests those predictions aren't airtight. \"Tens of millions of players, many of them casual gamers, buy the newest CoD every year without hesitation,\" the report states. \"This 'autopilot purchasing' habit is decades deep, and breaking it requires more than one awesome Battlefield release.\"\n\n\"CoD's muscle memory in the market is so strong that players will buy it even if they complain about it,\" the report continues. Part of Call of Duty's advantage over other shooters is Warzone, the report explains, because it basically advertises the newest mainline game to millions of people for months. Battlefield lacks such a free-to-play, cross-promotion opportunity.\n\nHistorically, there's also never really been an instance where Battlefield has won out over Call of Duty - the former's \"sales ceiling\" peaked with Battlefield 1, which still reportedly sold millions less than that year's middling CoD: Infinite Warfare, for example. We'll see who ends up on top later this year.\n\nBattlefield 6 beta beat Counter-Strike 2, Peak, Marvel Rivals, and Helldivers 2 to be the biggest game on Steam in North America, but it couldn't top Call of Duty on console",

      "text": "Battlefield 6 beta beat Counter-Strike 2, Peak, Marvel Rivals, and Helldivers 2 to be the biggest game on Steam in North America, but it couldn't top Call of Duty on console\nBattlefield 6 has some massive early interest\nThe Battlefield 6 beta has come and gone, and by all accounts it was absolutely massive. New stats suggest it was the biggest Steam game in North America for a time, and one of the biggest games on console, too \u2013 though it seems a whole lot of Call of Duty loyalists on PlayStation and Xbox were unwilling to tear themselves away from COD to try it out.\nFor the week ending August 16, the Battlefield 6 beta was the top game on Steam across the US, Canada, and Mexico, as Mat Piscatella of industry analysis group Circana reports on Bluesky. It's beating out titles like Counter-Strike 2, Peak, Marvel Rivals, and Helldivers 2 for that top spot, as measured by weekly active users.\nNotably, that picture is somewhat different than the one we get from Steam's official concurrent player numbers, where titles like CS2, Dota 2, and PUBG all stayed ahead of the BF6 beta. But concurrents and weekly active players are very different stats \u2013 with the latter typically seen as far more valuable to industry observers \u2013 and many of Steam's top games enjoy much of their popularity outside North America, where Circana's analysis does not cover.\nCircana Player Engagement Tracker - Top 15 Titles by Total Weekly Active Users (Not Concurrent) - W/E Aug 16, 2025 - The Battlefield 6 beta ranked 1st on Steam across the US, Mexico and Canada, while also ranking 4th on both PlayStation and Xbox in the US.\n\u2014 @matpiscatella.bsky.social (@matpiscatella.bsky.social.bsky.social) 2025-08-25T16:49:01.463Z\nBut this is all just talking about Steam users on PC. On console Circana says that Battlefield 6 hit the number four spot by weekly active users in the US across both PlayStation and Xbox, just behind Fortnite, Call of Duty, and Roblox.\nThe Call of Duty client, of course, encompasses pretty much every modern COD title from Warzone to Black Ops 6, so perhaps the comparison to Battliefield is a little unfair, but honestly seeing a beta even come close to rivaling the live-service juggernauts on console is impressive in itself.\nThe other detail worth noting here is that, on Steam, Call of Duty didn't even make Circana's top 15 charts for the week ending August 16. Maybe there's something to infer about console players preferring COD while Battlefield remains a PC-first franchise, or there really are that many COD fans sticking to Battle.net or the Windows store, but I'll leave that debate to the platform warriors among you.\nIf you need help sorting through the Battlefield 6 classes ahead of launch, we've got you covered.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nDustin Bailey joined the GamesRadar team as a Staff Writer in May 2022, and is currently based in Missouri.

      "text": "Battlefield 6 stomps Call of Duty's Steam record with 520,000 concurrent players, but EA promises it's still working on those long \"entry times\"\nWe're so back?\nBattlefield 6 isn't just the biggest Battlefield game ever based on concurrent players, it's even stomped its biggest rival and arguably the biggest shooter series on the planet: Call of Duty. Thank goodness for some competition, eh?\nDuring the Battlefield 6 Open Beta's peak time on Saturday night, the shooter pulled in a whopping 520,000 or so Steam players at the same time. That made it the weekend's fourth biggest game on the platform, behind only Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and PUBG, and the 22nd biggest game on the storefront of all time based on concurrent players.\nWhat's more notable is that the Call of Duty launcher's all-time peak hit a 491,000 record almost three years ago. The gulf between CoD and Battlefield had widened so much in recent years, these numbers are a more than welcome sign that Call of Duty does, in fact, still have some competition in the FPS space, as Blizzard's former exec predicted it would.\n\"This is Battlefield's biggest Open Beta ever,\" EA announced on social media. But with droves of players flocking to the beta, the publisher also warned that \"peak time is approaching and queues will be expected.\" Still, it's \"working on entry times to the game, but appreciate your patience as you wait for your time to arrive.\"\n\"We want everyone to experience a smooth and fair Open Beta, including those currently within the game too. Thank you for your continued excitement for Battlefield 6's Open Beta,\" it noted.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nKaan freelances for various websites including Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and this one, Gamesradar.

Unlike its predecessor, Battlefield 6 will come equipped with a single-player campaign and a returning focus on squad-centric chaos.\n\"The Battlefield franchise has endured a challenging few years, following the rejection of Battlefield 2042 by the wider FPS community. In a sense, Battlefield 6 is going back to basics in response. This new game for 2025 is returning to a more conventional modern warfare setting, with Battlefield Studios (which includes DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect) pushing for key refinements to its squad-based action, destruction, and the scale of this all-out warfare.\"\nLatest Battlefield 6 videos\nNew Battlefield 6 screenshots\nBattlefield 6 in detail\nBattlefield 6 beta\nThe Battlefield 6 beta is now live, meaning that you can get an early hands-on with the upcoming FPS.

There are some changes to the Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon setups though, so check our guide on the Battlefield 6 classes.\nBattlefield 6 preview\nGamesRadar+ got early access to Battlefield 6 before the beta kicked into gear.

      "text": "\"CoD won't be lazy anymore\": Ex Blizzard boss predicts a beating for Call of Duty at the hands of Battlefield 6, says Activision's FPS \"has gone downhill for years\"\n\"We'll all get better FPS games for it,\" says Mike Ybarra\nFormer Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra thinks Battlefield 6 \"will boot stomp\" Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year, which he reckons will be a great outcome for FPS games as a whole.\nBattlefield 6's open beta kicked off yesterday, opening its doors to a peak of 334,549 concurrent players on Steam, and promptly becoming the most popular Battlefield game on the platform by an enormous margin. Needless to say, the full game is already shaping up to be a major hit, two months before its launch, and the ex-Blizzard president thinks it's going to blow Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 out of the water.\n\"Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year,\" Ybarra declares on Twitter. \"But the real win here is CoD won't be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it.\"\nElaborating on this further down in his thread, Ybarra says that \"CoD has gone downhill for years\" since 2016's Infinite Warfare. He continues: \"Cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors. People are sick of it. Luckily BF will force them to change it.\"\nBattlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won\u2019t be lazy anymore, and we\u2019ll all get better FPS games for it.August 8, 2025\nWhether this will actually happen remains to be seen, but we already know a couple of ways in which Battlefield 6 has addressed the concerns Ybarra mentions. It has a surprisingly compact file size, with Steam listing 55GB as the minimum amount of storage required to install it (seemingly helped by the option to install components like single-player and multiplayer separately).\nAs for cosmetics, the devs have stressed that it was \"really important\" to the team for skins to \"feel grounded\" and \"authentic to the franchise.\" That means that \u2013 unless any exceptions are made later down the line \u2013 we can expect Battlefield 6 to avoid following in the footsteps of CoD with its wild crossovers and brightly colored outfits.\nWhile Battlefield 6 is set to launch on October 10, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 still has a vague 2025 release window. We'll just have to wait and see how the two compare in the coming months.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nBe sure to check out our guide on how to access the Battlefield 6 beta while you're here.\nI'm GamesRadar+'s Deputy News Editor, working alongside the rest of the news team to deliver cool gaming stories that we love.

      "text": "Battlefield 6 has already sold over 600 K copies on Steam (and has 2.7M wishlists!)\nWe\u2019ve got a chunky Battlefield 6 deep dive this week. Plus, an analysis of last week\u2019s top Steam games by copies sold and a look at Alinea\u2019s margin-of-error data \ud83c\udfaf\nBattlefield 6 is a much-needed return to form for the franchise\nWith 2.7 million wishlists and pre-order revenues of $35 million on Steam alone, Battlefield 6\u2019s pre-release Steam metrics have blown through the roof, which is something you can literally do in the game too (sorry).\nThese early success signals are well timed, as the Battlefield IP has been struggling. There\u2019s no way to sugarcoat it. The franchise was once an FPS juggernaut \u2013 one of the best. But over the years the BF IP has fallen from grace, thanks to poorly received releases like Battlefield 2042 and Battlefield 5.\nHowever, Battlefield\u2019s community has stayed active, despite being much negative sentiment around the direction of recent BF games. Battlefield has had huge franchise cache and revenue-generating power. And EA always knew it.\nAmid the \u2026 tepid launch of Battlefield 2042 back in 2021, EA put the franchise under the stewardship of Vince Zampella, a legend in the shooter world. Zampella is the FPS maestro who:\nHeralded Call of Duty\u2019s glory days, including the original Modern Warfare game, whose influence changed the entire FPS genre\nOversaw Titanfall 2, which is the best campaign of all time according to many folks (myself included)\nLed Apex Legends, one of the few non-Fortnite, non-PUBG battle royale games to stand the test of time, Apex Legends.\nIn other words, Zampella is a legend, so there has been a lot of cautious optimism around Battlefield 6 (his first BF game).\nNeedless to say, there\u2019s a lot riding on this one for EA, as the FC (formally FIFA) game franchise faltered slightly revenue-wise this year for the first time.\nOur data shows that things are trending well for Zampella and his team:\nOur Steam estimates show that Battlefield 6 \u2013 despite not launching until October 10 \u2013 has already pulled in 605 K Steam preorders.\nThis amounts to revenues of around $35 million on Steam alone. Battlefield 6 was even last week\u2019s #2 Steam game by revenues and #3 game by copies sold (more on that later).\nThe jury is still out of course, but so far, so good.\nOn a personal note, I spent the entire weekend playing the beta. It\u2019s awesome. If it sticks the landing, it\u2019s going to be on my GOTY list for sure.\nThe marketing department also executed its strategy well, having a huge influence on Battlefield 6\u2019s early success signals.\nBattlefield\u2019s wishlists have shot through the roof\nZampella\u2019s involvement, and early interviews name-dropping Battlefield 3 and 4 (two of the franchise\u2019s greats), meant that hype for Battlefield 6 was higher than usual out of the gate.\nSo when the game\u2019s page was added to Steam in late July, wishlist numbers shot past the 500K mark in just a few days:\nYet, as you can see above, Battlefield 6\u2019s wishlists have since blown up to 2.7 million following an excellent beta and a marketing campaign that ticked all the right boxes for fans.\nFrom July 25 to July 30, Battlefield 6 was already building momentum, adding ~95K to 150K wishlists per day on average. This is strong for a AAA title pre-hype cycle, but not unprecedented.\nThen, two critical events spiked Battlefield 6\u2019s wishlists:\nThe multiplayer trailer dropped on July 31, leading to an immediate wishlist spike from ~754K to 1.23M (+62% in one day)\nThe first beta weekend kicked off on August 7, resulting in another spike from ~2.20M to 2.44M in just 24 hours\nPost-trailer, EA continued its marketing assault with a blast of trailers and hype videos on its socials, an expensive preview event for influencers, and press interviews galore.\nWishlist growth continued at ~300K/day until the beta weekend (Aug 7), which drove a new engagement high.\nUnlike many betas where interest peaks then drops sharply, Battlefield 6 maintained positive momentum through Aug 11.\nBattlefield 6 has another beta happening this weekend, and that beta\u2019s performance will be a strong indicator of the game\u2019s success going forward.\nWe\u2019ll give you data update on that in next week\u2019s newsletter, so hit subscribe below (for free) if you want that analysis in your inbox as soon as it\u2019s ready.\nIs Battlefield 6 going to be a CoD killer?\n\u2018\u2019Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year,\u2019\u2019 said former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra on X last week.\nChill out, son.\nYes, Battlefield 6 brings all the things fans love about the series back: sprawling maps back-to-basics classes, and destructibility. And yes, it also borrows many of the right features from Call of Duty, and in some cases improves on them.\nInfantry-friendly lanes and terrain breaks keep players in meaningful firefights rather than trading shots across barren fields, and there\u2019s also infantry-only CoD-like smaller-scale modes to ease the CoD heads over.\nThis is crucial, as over 60% of the beta wishlisters have played a CoD game via Steam\u2019s Call of Duty HQ launchable (including free-to-play mode Warzone).\nSimply put, Battlefield 6 retains that large-scale feel of Battlefield but prioritizes playability \u2013 a balance BF2042 failed to strike.\nBut while Battlefield 6 has the potential to perform better than any Battlefield game ever has \u2013 financially and critically \u2013 it almost certainly won\u2019t outsell Call of Duty.\nCall of Duty is entering something of a stagnation phase right now in industry circles. Sure. And releasing a direct sequel to Black Ops for the third year in a row is certainly a choice.\nCoD has also been the butt of many jokes (including from yours truly) regarding its Fortnite-like crossovers \u2013 including Beavis and Butthead and Nikki Minaj (!?)\nBut CoD is still dominant despite all this. Its core audience still loves the game and buys it every damn year. And that isn\u2019t going to change just because Battlefield 6 is rad and tracking incredibly well.\nFor many gamers, Call of Duty is an annual ritual. Tens of millions of players, many of them casual gamers, buy the newest CoD every year without hesitation. This \u201cautopilot purchasing\u201d habit is decades deep, and breaking it requires more than one awesome Battlefield release.\nEven if Battlefield 6 wins over the hardcore FPS crowd \u2013 and it looks like it very much will \u2013 the sheer volume of CoD\u2019s day-one casual buyers is always something to behold.\nCoD\u2019s muscle memory in the market is so strong that players will buy it even if they complain about it. And while Battlefield\u2019s battle royale mode could be a hit, Warzone is still an active funnel feeding players into the CoD ecosystem.\nEven if Warzone engagement is down, its massive install base means Black Ops 7 will get free advertising just by existing inside Warzone menus and seasonal events.\nBattlefield simply doesn\u2019t have that scale of cross-promotion.\nCoD\u2019s seasonal model is also a relentless content treadmill: new operators, skins, battle passes, and other buzzwords every few weeks. This constant churn keeps it in social feeds, Twitch streams, and YouTube recommendations year-round.\nThe jury is still out on whether Battlefield can keep up with that kind of cadence.\nThe \u201cthis is the Battlefield that will beat CoD\u201d conversation is nothing new. We saw it with BF3, BF4, BF1, and the pre-launch hype of BF2042. Each time, Battlefield gained attention and sold well but never outsold CoD globally.\nThe reality is that CoD\u2019s sales floor is higher than Battlefield\u2019s sales ceiling so far, for the year anyway. Battlefield 5 is obviously a longer-term thing and not a yearly release.\nStill, even in Battlefield\u2019s highest highs (BF1 in 2016), Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare \u2013 a widely disliked entry \u2013 still outsold it by millions of copies. That\u2019s brand inertia at work. And that\u2019s why Battlefield 6 won\u2019t \u2018\u2019boot stomp CoD\u2019\u2019 \u2013 this year, at least.\nLast week was another eventful one on Steam, with indies, AA, DLC, and yes, Battlefield 5\nBattlefield aside, indies ruled the copies sold ranking for week 33 (August 3 to 10):\nMage Arena (#1) sold 624 K copies last week, bringing its total copies sold to 1.8 million. The voice-controlled spell-casting PvP game is continuing to land with games, thanks to its viral gameplay and cheap price point. We flagged this one as one to watch back in July, when it had only sold 119 K copies. We even interviewed the game\u2019s creator. Read that here\nPEAK (#2) ascended to 551 K copies sold last week, helping it shoot past 8 million sold. The budget co-op climbing game got a 38% price cut from $8 to $4.95 yesterday, so expect it to chart well again next week\nBattlefield 5 (#3) sold 361 K copies last week thanks to its fantastically received beta, but we\u2019ve already covered that to death above\nTitan Quest 2 (#4) launched in early access on August 1 and sold 204 K copies on Steam alone last week. It\u2019s continued to sell well, now at 465 K on Steam. It was also the #5 game by revenues on Steam, with $4.1 million. Overall revenues have since ballooned to almost $10 million. Titan Quest 2 is an ARPG and comes and comes two decades after the original. China is its biggest market on Steam (27% of its players). The title was originally greenlit back at THQ years ago, but it was axed due the marketing team. Whoops\nCastle Crashers\u2019 Painter Boss Paradise DLC (#5) sold 190 K copies last week, in other game-revival news. It marks Castle Crashers\u2019 first DLC in over a decade, and clearly fans are chuffed. It has since crossed 200 K copies sold, netting about $600 K in revenue due to its under-$3 price point\nYes we have DLC data! Want a demo and trial of our platform? Reach out here, and it\u2019s yours!\nHere\u2019s our latest margin-of-error data\nAs Alinea Insight subscribers, you\u2019re aware that we\u2019re not afraid to post our estimates publicly and show people our platform with free trials. But we\u2019re also not afraid to publish our margin-of-error data.\nMarket intelligence helps businesses make informed, high-stakes decisions, and avoid costly mistakes. But inaccurate data means badly informed decisions.\nSome companies don\u2019t even publicly post their data! Could you imagine!?\ud83d\udc9a\nAnyway, decision-makers need to fully understand the accuracy of the data they rely on. We reckon the only real way to do this is via accuracy tests that reflect results from the estimation model itself.

Our platform has over 25,000 curated public announcement entries, each with full source traceability.\nThis gives clients a rigorous, reliable estimation framework AND a rich curated milestone database, supporting informed decisions at every step.

  "argos_summary": "Battlefield 6\u2019s open\u2011beta has generated record Steam activity, with 2.7\u202fmillion wish\u2011lists and $35\u202fmillion in pre\u2011orders, and it topped North American Steam charts for a week. Analysts say the surge shows strong interest but argue that Call of Duty\u2019s entrenched brand and cross\u2011promotion via Warzone will keep it ahead in sales. The beta also saw 520\u202fk concurrent Steam players, the highest for a Battlefield title, yet it still lagged behind COD on console. Overall, Battlefield 6 is poised for a strong launch but is unlikely to eclipse Call of Duty in the near term.",
