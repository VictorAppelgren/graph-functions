  "description": "Planning a trip to Vietnam for 2026? Our curated itinerary covers the best of Hanoi, Halong Bay, Hoi An, and Ho Chi Minh City with a focus on luxury and culture.",
  "content": "Where are you planning to go in 2026? One destination is quietly \u2013 yet powerfully \u2013 rising to the forefront: Vietnam. This isn\u2019t just about a visit; it\u2019s about embarking on a multifaceted journey blending vibrant culture, a profound history and breathtaking natural sights. And, Vietnam represents an opportunity for a truly holistic experience, where every detail is curated to ensure comfort without ever sacrificing authenticity. Also, the food!\n\nThe luxury travel sector in Vietnam is currently experiencing incredible growth, with new, high-end properties emerging and bespoke experiences becoming more accessible. It\u2019s a perfect time to discover (or rediscover) a country that is equal parts sensory engagement and cultural enrichment. So, prepare for an adventure, where Vietnam unfolds itself one unforgettable moment at a time.\n\nLeg 1: Hanoi \u2013 The Elegant Heart of History and Culture \ud83c\udf07\n\nStart in Hanoi, the captivating and cosmopolitan capital where ancient tradition and a dynamic modernist sensibility intermix. This is a loacation that offers rewards to those who are willing to immerse themselves in its vibrant street-level culture, which often presents itself as a controlled chaos \u2013 it also quickly becomes mesmerizing.\n\nFor an elevated stay, the luxury hotel scene delivers and is continuing to do so. Specifically, the anticipated opening of the new Four Seasons Hotel in Hanoi in late 2026 will create a new luxury travel homebase, contrasting the city\u2019s energy.\n\nHanoi\u2019s street food scene is a true culinary adventure waiting to happen. Instead of trying to navigate the bustling stalls willy-nilly, elevate the experience with a private street food tour led by a knowledgeable local guide who knows all the best spots. This removes any guesswork, allowing you to sample the best pho, bun cha, and egg coffee (c\u00e0 ph\u00ea tr\u1ee9ng) while also learning the stories behind each dish. While you\u2019re in a foodie mood, consider a private cooking class to bring the flavors of Vietnam home with you.\n\nBeyond the food, immerse yourself in traditional arts at a captivating Water Puppet Theater performance, a purely unique Vietnamese art form, or take a leisurely guided stroll through the Hanoi Old Quarter, absorbing the charming architecture and artisan shops.\n\nLeg 2: Halong Bay \u2013 Take in Natural Wonder Without the Crowds \ud83d\udee5\ufe0f\n\nFrom the vibrant intensity of Hanoi, the next stop blends seamlessly into the ethereal beauty of Halong Bay. This UNESCO World Heritage site, with dramatic limestone cliffs bursting headlong out from emerald water, is a must-see. But it\u2019s how you experience it makes all the difference.\n\nTo truly appreciate the grandeur, avoid the larger and more bustling cruise ships. Instead, book passage a private cruise or a small luxury yacht. Several outfits offer bespoke itineraries designed for couples or small groups, ensuring an intimate and uncrowded experience to offer more of a connection with the incredible sights and less time trying to get the right vantage point.\n\nImagine gliding through tranquil waters, launching in a kayak to explore hidden caves, swimming in secluded coves or watching the sunset from the private deck of a yacht with a cool beverage in hand. The pace is intentionally slow to contrast the first stop, allowing to fully absorb the breathtaking landscape and the quiet majesty of nature. This is Halong Bay on untimed terms \u2013 making for a truly profound natural escape.\n\nCentral Vietnam offers a captivating blend of rich history, cultural charm and coastal beauty, bringing travelers on a journey back in time. This allows for exploration of two quite distinct but equally enchanting cities: Hoi An and Hue.\n\nHoi An is a true gem, another UNESCO World Heritage site famous for an incredibly well-preserved Ancient Town. Its lantern-lit streets, centuries-old architecture, and vibrant riverside market espouse timeless charm. And, for the visitor to truly indulge: custom tailoring. The town is renowned for its skilled tailors who craft garments in a matter of days \u2013 if one stays long enough, there\u2019s a chance to get a personalized memento that is both practical and luxurious. While waiting, explore ancient temples, enjoy a hands-on cooking class to master the region\u2019s cuisine, or simply stroll the car-free streets to soak in the easy-going ambiance.\n\nA short journey from Hoi An is Hue, yet another UNESCO World Heritage Site and Vietnam\u2019s former imperial capital. Here, delve deeper into Vietnam\u2019s royal past. A private, guided tour of the sprawling Imperial City, a fortress-within-a-fortress, reveals Nguyen Dynasty\u2019s penchant for grand design. Visiting the elaborate tombs of the emperors, each a masterpiece of architecture and landscaping, offers fascinating insights into Vietnamese history. After learning a bit, hit the sand: beautiful beaches near Hoi An are perfect for seaside relaxation and rejuvenation.\n\nA Vietnamese journey culminates in the vibrantly energetic metropolis of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon). This bustling hub offers a thrilling contrast to the serenity of Halong Bay and the historical charm of Central Vietnam. It\u2019s a city that pulses with life, offering a dynamic blend of history, modernity, and incredible culinary experiences.\n\nStart out at a top-tier hotel in the city center \u2013 this is a perfect jumping of point, and many offer rooftop bars that provide stunning panoramic views of the glittering skyline \u2013 a perfect spot for an evening cocktail after arrival\n\nFor those interested in a deeper understanding of the country\u2019s past, a private and guided tour of the Cu Chi Tunnels offers a sobering-yet-fascinating look at the country\u2019s wartime past and how the conflict affected the city and the nation as a whole. Similarly, the War Remnants Museum provides a powerful, unvarnished perspectives into battles, imperialism and how the nation has changed and recovered in its new postmodern era.\n\nOf course, any journey to Vietnam should be food-focused, so a send off with a final, high-end meal at one of Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s celebrated restaurants, perhaps savoring modern Vietnamese cuisine that creatively reinterprets traditional flavors, is essential.\n\nThis bespoke journey through Vietnam in 2026 is an adventure in the waiting. The a country is waiting to reveal its magic, one unforgettable, curated moment at a time.",

      "text": "The Art of the \u2018Coolcation\u2019: Shoulder-Season Travel is a Best Bet for 2025\n- Share via\nIt\u2019s a familiar feeling. The last gasp of a long, hot summer has you dreaming of a quick getaway: but you\u2019ve found yourself tired of heat and crowds - natch!\nIt\u2019s okay to be ready to trade bustling beaches and packed sidewalks for something a bit more serene and a bit more elegant. Its the high seasons for a \u201ccoolcation,\u201d the new vacation trend that speaks directly to the discerning traveler in all of us.\nTRAVEL NEWSLETTER\nSign up for our bi-weekly newsletter for expert travel advice in luxury destinations.\nThis cool new idea for an escape speaks to a new way to approach travel overall. It begins an intentional choice to seek out a destination in a cooler climate and follows, more importantly, as a choice to travel during the \u201cshoulder season\u201d of fall and early winter. Luxury in this instance isn\u2019t represented in the price tag; it\u2019s in the peace of mind that comes from a less-crowded itinerary, a more authentic experience, and the pure joy of discovering a world-class destination at a much more natural and human pace.\nSo, as the heat lingers here at home, consider the calendar with a new perspective. Your perfect \u201ccoolcation\u201d awaits.\nReimagine Timelessness in Rome\nRome in July and August is a marvel, but it\u2019s a sweaty, crowded and overwhelming. Imagine a different experience: Rome in October or November. The weather is pleasant \u2013 perfect for walking \u2013 the light is a soft, golden dream for those jealousy-inducing vacation photos, and, maybe most importantly, the massive summer throngs have finally thinned. This is a city that rewards those who linger, and a \u201ccoolcation\u201d gives you opportunity and permission to do just that.\nInstead of fighting the crowds at the Colosseum, consider a private tour with underground or arena floor access. This gives you an exclusive feel and a deeper immersion into the ancient history without lines or jostling crowds. Then, meander to a quiet walk through the ancient Baths of Caracalla or a relaxing day trip to Ostia Antica, a perfectly preserved Roman port town that offers a fascinating glimpse into just what daily Roman life was like \u2013 and instead of reading about it, you\u2019re actually experiencing it.\nIf taking in art at a casual pace is for you, the Borghese Gallery is an absolute must. You\u2019ll find yourself in a space of breathtaking masterpieces, from Bernini to Caravaggio, in a truly unhurried and intimate setting. After a morning of cultural immersion, escape to the lively but less-touristy neighborhood of Trastevere. Settle into a cafe on a quiet cobblestone street then enjoy a long and leisurely lunch to simply savor the atmosphere. Do you feel that? It\u2019s the true luxury of a \u201ccoolcation.\u201d\nThe Soul of Andalusia in a Serene Seville\nFor those who want a touch of Spanish warmth, not intense summer heat, a trip to Seville in the fall can be revalatory. Spanish summer is famously hot, with temperatures that can make simply existing uncomfortable. By October, the heat has broken, and the city is a joy. The weather is still wonderfully warm at around 70\u00b0F, but it\u2019s perfect for strolling, exploring and truly experiencing Andalusia.\nSeville is a city of passion, and this \u201ccoolcation\u201d destination allows you to fully immerse yourself in its rich traditions without the distraction of tourist throngs. You can experience the genuine magic of a flamenco performance in a historic venue like Casa de la Memoria, where every stomp and strum resonates in the intimate space. A private, guided tour of the Royal Alc\u00e1zar or the magnificent Seville Cathedral will give you a deeper understanding of the timeless history and beauty of Spain. This isn\u2019t simply a glance, its a chance to really dig in and have a memorable experience.\nMoreover, injecting yourself into Spanish rhythm of life is infectious, and you can truly embrace it in the fall. This is where you\u2019ll take long, lingering lunches, an afternoon siesta, and an evening that begins with wandering from one small, local tavern to the next for a truly authentic tapas experience into the lateness of the evening. The pace is relaxed and revelatory. Stroll through the winding cobblestone streets of the Santa Cruz quarter until you\u2019re at a rooftop bar with a view, raising a glass to the golden Spanish light and wondering why you\u2019d ever be doing anything else.\nChasing the Golden Light in Lisbon\nLisbon has quickly become one of Europe\u2019s most beloved destinations, and with great reason \u2013 but its popularity means its charming streets can be quite crowded in the summer. Fall and early winter bring a more manageable number of visitors, and a completely different kind of beauty. The golden hour light in Lisbon during this time is beautiful, making it a photographer\u2019s dream.\nAnother European destination that rewards the wanderer, its famous \u201cseven hills\u201d are best navigated when the temperatures are mild. This is a trip that rewards you for slowing down the pace and taking a moment to sit and reflect at a cafe, people watch and truly embrace the city\u2019s soul. Don\u2019t over-plan here: spend your days exploring the historic neighborhoods, riding the famous trams and enjoying the incredible food wherever you may find yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the fresh seafood or that perfect, warm pastel de nata in a small, family-run cafe, savor and enjoy.\nOf course, \u201ccoolcating\u201d doesn\u2019t imply roughing it. You can stay at a top luxury hotel like the Four Seasons Hotel Ritz Lisbon or the Bairro Alto Hotel, which offer impeccable service and beautiful views.\nThese three destinations are a testament to the fact that travel isn\u2019t just about where you go \u2013 it\u2019s about how you\u2019re vacationing once you\u2019re there. By opting for this style of travel, you\u2019re making a conscious decision to choose peace and deep, authentic connection with a destination. Take the time, get into the pace, and chill - it\u2019s the \u201ccool\u201d thing to do."

      "text": "Two Nearby Destinations for Your Final Summer Escape\n- Share via\nAs the days begin to shorten, there\u2019s that inevitable feeling: the end of summer. Maybe the kids are back in school, and while the heat continues here in Southern California, those carefree days feel like they\u2019re drawing to a close \u2013 the pace of fall is coming.\nYou need one last restorative escape before that happens. Now, this isn\u2019t a trip involving grand, months-long planning or some kind of multi-week journey \u2013 this is a moment to press pause, to jump to a nearby destination with minimal travel time and to give yourself one final dose of sunshine, adventure and relaxation.\nFor those of us here in SoCal, we are fortunate to have a world of possibilities right at our doorstep. While our local coast is always tempting, there\u2019s a magic escapism in crossing a border or a state line \u2013 seeing a new horizon just a few hours from home.\nHere, find two distinct, yet equally perfect options for that last summer hurrah. Take a trip that feels less like a vacation and more like a delightful exhale.\nLos Cabos, Mexico \u2013 For an Oceanfront Treat\nThe traveler who wants to end the season with sand between the toes and a margarita glass stem between the fingers. For that, there\u2019s no better choice than Cabo. While it\u2019s often typecast as a spring break destination, the cities on the tip of Baja California Sur have their own flavor \u2013 in short, they\u2019re the \u201cRiviera\u201d of Mexico, an elegant and sophisticated escape that is just a quick two-and-a-half-hour flight away. This makes it an effortless journey that drops you into a different world with breathtaking ocean vistas coupled with world-class service.\nThe beauty of a trip to Cabo in late summer is the feeling of having the place to yourself. The peak season crowds have thinned, the weather is warm but not scorching, and the pace of life feels wonderfully unhurried. This is a trip designed for pure, unadulterated relaxation; this is the the kind of chill that involves 100% pool time and 0% screen time.\nChoose wisely \u2013 Your hotel is the key to the vibe.\nThis is not the time for a big, bustling resort. Instead, opt for a property that prioritizes privacy, stunning design, and a serene ambiance. Look for places like the One & Only Palmilla or Esperanza, both of which are famous for their impeccable service and exclusive feel. Many resorts are nestled into secluded coves, offering private beaches, magnificent infinity pools that seem to spill into the sea, and spa treatments that blend traditional Mexican healing rituals with modern luxury.\nTake some time off the sand.\nWhile days spent lounging by the pool are mandatory, Cabo offers a wealth of sophisticated activities. For a touch of romance and grandeur, book a private sunset sailing cruise. You\u2019ll glide past the iconic El Arco, a natural rock arch at the very Southern tip of the Baja Peninsula, as the sky erupts in vibrant colors of orange and pink. Many of these luxury yachts are catered with cocktails and canap\u00e9s, making for an unforgettable evening.\nFor the more active traveler, consider a snorkeling or diving trip in the Sea of Cortez. Jacques Cousteau famously dubbed it \u201cthe world\u2019s aquarium\u201d for a reason. The warm, crystal-clear waters teem with life. From schools of tropical fish to playful sea lions, you can book a tour on a catamaran that takes you to the , where you can spend the afternoon swimming and paddle boarding before enjoying a gourmet lunch on board.\nFor a taste of local culture, take a short drive to the quieter San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo, the artistic and historic heart of the region. Wander the cobblestone streets, browse the charming art galleries, and plan your visit for a Thursday evening to experience the famous Art Walk, where galleries open their doors and the town comes alive with music and community. It\u2019s the perfect way to spend a low-key, culturally-rich evening.\nSedona, Arizona \u2013 A High-Desert Sanctuary\nIf your soul is craving a different kind of scenery \u2013 one that swaps ocean mist for dry desert air and rolling waves for towering red rocks \u2013 a road trip to Sedona is the answer. The drive from Southern California is a scenic adventure in itself and clocks in at a very digestible six hours \u2013 just a few podcast episodes away. This is a journey that takes you from the bustling freeway to the wide-open expanse of the Arizona desert, a visual and spiritual transition that is a perfect way to clear your head.\nSedona is a place of profound natural beauty and spiritual energy known for its famous \u201cvortexes.\u201d But beyond the mystique, it\u2019s a destination that offers a truly elevated and restorative experience for those who appreciate the crux of art, nature and the finest food.\nYour stay is your connection to the desert.\nIn Sedona, your hotel is your base camp for exploration and relaxation. Look for luxury resorts that are built to blend seamlessly with the landscape. Many offer stunning views of the famous red rock formations and feature world-class spas that incorporate local rejuvenating ingredients and traditional healing practices. This is where you can treat yourself to an ancient massage or simply find a quiet spot to meditate and soak in the powerful energy of the landscape.\nIf you want to unlock the magic here, experiences are key.\nThe beauty of Sedona is that you don\u2019t have to be a seasoned hiker to experience its magic \u2013 you might not even have to hike at all. The famed Pink Jeep tours are a fantastic way to see the most iconic landscapes and get a thrilling guided tour of the backcountry without breaking a sweat. Your guide will rumble you along on a journey over rugged trails, providing fascinating insights into the area\u2019s geology and history.\nFor more relaxed exploration, take a scenic drive along the Red Rock Scenic Byway, where you\u2019ll see the famous Bell Rock and Chapel of the Holy Cross. You can also explore the eclectic arts and shopping village of Tlaquepaque, which feels like an old-world Mexican village, with its winding cobblestone paths, fountains and beautiful galleries. It\u2019s a wonderful place to find a one-of-a-kind piece of art for friends back home.\nAnd for the varietal connoisseurs among us, the Verde Valley is a hidden gem. Just a short drive from Sedona, this area is home to a growing number of vineyards that are producing exceptional wine. You can spend the entire afternoon bouncing between tasting rooms, enjoying a glass of local Syrah while taking in the stunning desert views. It\u2019s the kind of unhurried-yet-sophisticated activity that makes for a perfect end to your trip.\nChoose Your Own End-of-Summer Adventure\nWhether you choose the beauteous beaches of Cabo or the soul-stirring landscapes of Sedona (or anywhere else you decide to go!) This last trip of the summer should be a special one to mark the change of the season and reset before the fall and, yeesh \u2013 the holidays \u2013 come barreling at us.\nIt\u2019s a journey to be savored, a final moment of freedom and beauty before we turn the page to a new season. So pack a light bag, leave any complexities behind and go find your perfect exhale!"

      "text": "An Alaskan Extension \u2013 Have a Post-Cruise Adventure\n- Share via\nIt\u2019s well known that there\u2019s a certain magic to an Alaskan cruise. The ship glides through the serene, glassy waters of the state\u2019s coastal Inside Passage, massive chunks of glacier calve with a thunderous roar, and you can spy a humpback whale breach from the comfort of a heated deck. It\u2019s a wonderful and generally effortless way to experience one of the world\u2019s last great unspoiled wildernesses.\nBut for those who believe the true magic of a journey happens when divert from the plan or beaten path, that standard cruise can feel like simply an appetizer. The most profound Alaskan experience isn\u2019t just seen from a ship; it\u2019s lived on the land. For the discerning traveler or those seeking that bit of extra meat from their journey, that\u2019s where the true adventure begins. We\u2019re talking about what\u2019s known as a \u201ccruisetour\u201d \u2013 a seamlessly planned land-and-sea adventure that takes you deep into the heart of Alaska\u2019s interior. It\u2019s an immersive escape \u2013 and it\u2019s also total game-changer.\nWhy Fall is a \u201cMust Travel\u201d to Alaska\nThe summer months in Alaska are beautiful, but they come with a side of bustling crowds and peak season prices. The real savvy traveler knows that the fall shoulder season, particularly September, is the sweet spot. This is the time to go.\nThe huge summer influx has thinned out, which means fewer crowds. This means that those charming port towns like Juneau and Skagway feel less like tourist traps and more like the authentic Alaskan communities they are. You won\u2019t be fighting for a good view or a quiet meal, and you\u2019ll have a chance to exhale\nFall is a fantastic time for prime wildlife viewing \u2013 and isn\u2019t that major reason you visited? Bears, moose, and other animals are incredibly active as they fatten up for the coming winter. The search results highlight that this is prime time to see brown bears during their famous salmon run, a spectacular display of nature\u2019s raw power.\nWhile perhaps not the fiery reds of New England, Alaska offers its own unique and stunning fall display. The tundra transforms into a beautiful mix of golds, crimsons and browns. Against the dramatic backdrop of snow-dusted mountains, it\u2019s a visual feast that few get to experience.\nAnd, as the days shorten and the skies darken, your chances of seeing the awe-inspiring Aurora Borealis increase dramatically, especially if you venture inland. Imagine: after a day of adventure, you\u2019re watching the sky dance in ribbons of green and purple from the comfort of a remote (and warm) lodge. It\u2019s a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience.\nThe Main Event: Making the Trip to Denali\nThe heart of the extended Alaskan adventure is, without question, Denali National Park. While a cruise gives you the rugged coastline, a land tour gives you the heart of the wild. This is where you go to see the mountain.\nThe journey itself is part of the experience. Many of the Cruisetours start with a scenic train ride inland on the Alaska Railroad. It\u2019s an elegant, unhurried way to travel, allowing you to watch the scenery transform from coastal rainforests to vast, open tundra.\nOnce in Denali, you\u2019ll stay at a comfortable wilderness lodge just outside the park gates. The real adventure is the bus tour deep into the park\u2019s interior, where personal vehicles are not allowed. This is where you\u2019ll truly experience the vastness of the Alaskan wilderness. You\u2019ll be on the lookout for magnificent grizzly bears digging for roots, moose wading in lakes, and caribou roaming the tundra. And, if skies are clear, there it is: Mount Denali, the tallest mountain peak in North America, in all its breathtaking glory. The sense of scale and majesty is enthralling \u2013 you simply cannot appreciate the size and breadth of Alaska from the coast.\nRounding Out The Journey\nThe magic of a cruisetour is how seamlessly it all comes together. Many cruise lines handle the logistics of your train ticket, your lodging and your tour schedule, so you can spend your time focused on the adventure. And, bonus! The extensions don\u2019t have to stop at Denali. Here are two more amazing destinations you can book out after debarking\n- Anchorage & The Kenai Peninsula: Many land tours use Anchorage as a hub. It\u2019s a great base to extend your stay and take day cruises on smaller vessels into Kenai Fjords National Park or Prince William Sound for more intimate and close-up glacier views and wildlife sightings. This is where you have an opportunity to mix it up with seals, puffins, and whales in a way a large cruise ship cannot.\n- Fairbanks & The Northern Lights: For those who are chasing that Northern Lights experience, a trip to Fairbanks is a must. Head north to remote spots like Borealis Basecamp, where you can watch the sky from a comfortable and private geodesic igloo. End your Alaskan adventure with an unforgettable celestial show.\nThe Luxe Factor: The Comfort of an Intentionally Planned Trip\nDespite the frontier-style surroundings, this trip isn\u2019t about roughing it. Instead, it\u2019s about combining the thrill of adventure with the peace of mind that and knowing every detail is handled. This new-look style of Alaskan travel lends credence to the idea that you can be an explorer and still have that amazing gourmet meal, a glass of great wine and, most importantly, a cozy bed all there for you at the end of the day.\nChoosing this extended land-and-sea adventure in the fall \u2013 and booking it all as an amazing cruisetour trip \u2013 is a way to elevate the journey from \u201cboating\u201d to \u201cboast\u201d thing. choice to go deeper, to see more, and to do it all in a curated and bespoke manner \u2013 it\u2019s a journey that will stay with you long after the ship has returned to port."
