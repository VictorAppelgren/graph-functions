  "title": "Strathberry Set To Surpass \u00a3100 Million Within The Next 3 Years",
  "description": "What do Pamela Anderson, Meghan Markle, and Lady Gaga have in common? A love of Edinburgh\u2019s leather accessories brand Strathberry, which is bucking the global downturn.",
  "content": "Leanne Hundleby is in a fine mood. One half of the power duo behind the leather accessories company Strathberry, she sits, smiling \u2014 on a surprisingly sunny day in Edinburgh \u2014 before a stunning floral backdrop, a wallpaper of vibrant blooms and patterns. I admire it. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d she says. \u201cGuy\u201d \u2014 her husband and Strathberry co-founder \u2014 \u201chates it.\u201d It is perhaps a rare, and humorous, disagreement in a partnership that has brought the brand from strength to strength since it launched 12 years ago.\n\nHundleby has good cause to be upbeat. Strathberry is now on a trajectory to surpass \u00a3100 million revenue within the next 3 years, a lofty ambition at a time of unprecedented economic challenges and slumps in earnings. Well, not everywhere. Some brands are bucking the trend. Strathberry is one of them.\n\nCAGR stats from FY22 to FY25 show a 54% increase with an even faster expansion in certain emerging regions such as the Middle East. As of April 2025, the brand represents a \u00a336.4 million business that is continuing on a \u201cvery strong trajectory in the current year,\u201d as per official data. For this fiscal year, online accounts for 70% with retail and wholesale taking an even split of the remaining 30% of a market dominated by North America (50%), the UK (30%) and the ROW\u2014it ships to over 100 countries\u2014 making up the remaining 20%.\n\nA strategy of international expansion has been led by DTC channels and a well-curated list of 146 doors worldwide (including online). Wholesale partners like Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's are supplemented with ones further afield such as Galeries Lafayette Dubai. In the UK, there are stores in the Burlington Arcade (opened in 2018) and Covent Garden (2024) as well as Edinburgh\u2019s Multrees Walk (2020) and Victoria Street, which launched earlier this year. A summer pop-up in Selfridges featuring two giant-sized handbags (a Mosaic and Tote, made in the UK from the same leather as the commercial products) state the brand\u2019s USP: high-quality minimalist accessories. The label now counts A-list stars \u2014 like Lady Gaga, Margot Robbie, Pamela Anderson and Anna Kendrick as well as HRH The Princess of Wales \u2014 as fans.\n\nThe heart of the business is the couple themselves, who are that rare thing in fashion: a duo who genuinely care about their products and customers. Even today, Leanne Hundleby loves nothing more than chatting to customers (incognito, of course) on the shop floor, observing how they interact with the accessories. \u201cI never say who I am. I just say I'm down from head office, and I love doing it,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI think the minute you remove yourself and sit in a bubble, I feel you've kind of lost it. That engagement, that connection with the customer is so important for any brand founder.\u201d\n\nStrathberry has worked hard to gain global recognition from its Scottish roots, and this passion has been key to its success. Both founders are intimately involved in the business, advising on design aspects, silhouettes, new seasonal collections and more; they organise finance and assist in strategic planning. Leanne heads up campaigns, imagery and branding alongside retail and the overall running of the company, while Guy steers production, wholesale partnerships and generally oversees the finished products.\n\nIt\u2019s these that set Strathberry apart. Every bag is crafted by artisans in the Spanish workshops of Andaluc\u00eda, which is renowned for some of the finest luxury leather craftsmanship in the world (houses like Loewe reportedly also use them). Using only the highest-quality Spanish and Italian leathers, each requires up to 85 pattern pieces and an average of 2,000 stitches. This attention to detail can be seen first-hand in the inhouse atelier which opened in March at the Edinburgh townhouse. This workroom also allows for shorter timeframes and greater flexibility in the sampling process, as well as the ability to offer a repair service to valued customers.\n\nThe internet personality known as Tanner Leatherstein has featured a number of Strathberry\u2019s bags in his viral \u201cleather teardowns,\u201d which see him dissect bags to show their true craftsmanship (and cost). All of the brand\u2019s designs have passed with flying colours. A review of the Nano Tote said it was the first time seeing that level of quality at that price point on the dissection table. \u201cIt checked all the boxes you\u2019d expect from a high-end luxury bag, just without the astronomical price tag,\u201d he explains in a correspondence.\n\nConsidered pricing is a big part of Strathberry\u2019s allure. The tote retails for between \u00a3375 to \u00a3695, while other styles such as the Crescent sells for \u00a3455, and the Mosaic for \u00a3485. \u201cI think Strathberry offers one of the most well-balanced combinations of high-level design decisions and craftsmanship, all at very accessible price points. They\u2019re making leather luxury more widely available, and that unique value proposition has clearly resonated in the market,\u201d he says.\n\nStrathberry\u2019s balanced market distribution has included expansion in the APAC region. In China, it held its first ever pop-up at Reel Shanghai in 2019. Since then, it has had placements with celebrities like Teresa Cheung, Yang Mi and Michelle Wai as well as early collaborations with Mr. Bags, China\u2019s foremost handbag expert and influencer. The brand has been ramping up its efforts in Japan, too \u2014 where the Mosaic is a bestseller \u2014 over the last couple of years. Since entering in 2015, it has had organic fast-growing sales and now sells through more than 30 doors.\n\nPlans for 2025 include a significant increase in brick-and-mortar: this January saw it launch a partnership with United Arrows and with Tomorrowland in July. Two key department store pop-ups in Ginza Mitsuskoshi and Hankyu Umeda, along with influencer activity, are planned for October around a visit of the co-founders \u2014 and those giant bags. Hundleby is excited for the opportunity: \u201cThe Japanese shopper wants to see and feel the products, so I think having a stronger presence over there will be good to get the brand name out there more,\u201d she says.\n\nGlobal expansion hasn\u2019t meant neglecting its roots. Back home in Edinburgh, Strathberry opened a new store on Victoria Street this March and launched an innovative Borrow a Bag launch scheme in June with the Kimpton hotel (ideal for visiting tourists). Community is one of the pillars of the brand\u2019s ethos, seen in diverse projects such as its work with the Scottish capital\u2019s university, the promotion of local craftspeople, its large network of engaged influencers and even the cross-generational aspects of its products. Mother and daughter pairs often shop together. \u201cI see it in my own family, too, with my child and her grandmother. Different styles, of course,\u201d she says, going on to argue that the appeal is from the fact that these are bags that are made to last \u2014 that are carried for life.\n\n\u201cWe use the phrase \u2018cherished for generations to come,\u2019\u201d Hundleby explains. \u201cFrom the generations of the artisans that make the bags to, hopefully, the generations of the same family today that a bag can be passed down through.\u201d She acknowledges, too, that tastes change and the market is cyclical. Even with customers making more considered purchases, Strathberry shows it can adapt. The brand has recently moved away from the structured, architectural silhouettes it is known for to include more slouchy styles such as Charlotte and Kite. That said, the Tote \u2014 its first ever design \u2014is always in the top three of its sales. Colors have evolved with customers buying more neutral shades (taupe, tan, oat, mushroom) with \u201clonger lasting appeal\u201d for today\u2019s wardrobes. Such shifts are the result of Strathberry\u2019s ability to listen.\n\nAs we wind down, I ask about the future. The \u00a3100m revenue roadmap is clear. \u201cThe U.S. continues to be a growth market for us. So does the Middle East, where we're doing super well. And the UK too, it\u2019s also a growing market for us. We're in a lovely position at the minute.\u201d",

      "text": "In 1991, a friend of Stefano Ricci told the fashion mogul, \u201cIt is time to think about China.\u201d The pair set off on a trip to gauge firsthand the untapped potential of the mainland: after nearly 20 years in business with his eponymous brand, Ricci looked east.\nCreative Director Fillipo Ricci, Stefano\u2019s son\u2014who now runs the company with his brother CEO Niccol\u00f2\u2014tells me this on location in Agra, the first stop on the Explorer Project. The twice-yearly campaign seeks to reimagine how luxury fashion intersects with cultural heritage, sustainability, and the human connection. But more than that it is, as the name suggests, an expression of the brand\u2019s pioneering spirit: this time, as it charts a course on the Indian subcontinent.\n\u201cExploration is curiosity acted upon,\u201d said the oceanographer Don Walsh, and the Ricci\u2019s have curiosity in spades. The initial departure into China was a brave and almost unprecedented move. Back then, Louis Vuitton was one of the few global fashion companies operating in the country. Ricci, inspired by what he saw, followed suit, opening his first Shanghai store in 1993. It would put him at the vanguard of international luxury groups dipping their toes into the country. A Dior store went up in \u201894; Prada entered the market the next year, followed by Herm\u00e8s in \u201896 and Gucci in \u201897. Chanel opened a fragrance and beauty store in Shanghai in \u201893 but its fashion counterpart didn\u2019t arrive until \u201899.\nFillipo recounts his first trip to China aged 9. An inquisitive young boy, he soaked up the sights, from the barracks and fortresses along the Great Wall to the imposing Forbidden City that has been home to 2 dynasties of imperial rule. More than these, he was witness to change: \u201cBack then it was all bicycles. Now China has some of the fastest drones in the world and the highest skyscrapers. Everything is moving at a speed that is really incredible.\u201d\nIt is a pace the brand has kept up with. China today represents Stefano Ricci\u2019s most expensive retail footprint in the world and, from that first boutique selling shirts and ties to Chinese businessmen, the company operates 33 mono-brand boutiques out of its global tally of 80. All this in spite of a broader luxury sector slowdown\u2014and increasingly competitive local market.\nThe house maintains its allure to the country\u2019s elite group of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) through a strong tradition of craftsmanship and a distinct approach to consumer relations. There\u2019s a Shanghai outpost of its discreet Stefano Ricci club for its community of top-spending clients who spend around \u20ac50K-\u20ac5 million a year; another is earmarked to open soon in Beijing. A Huamao Centre flagship in the city, opened in 2023, and a boutique within the Ritz-Carlton (a year later) represent other key strategic investments.\nThese are paying dividends. While it doesn\u2019t divulge individual regions, overall it closed 2024 with a healthy \u20ac233 million revenue. During 2024-25, the company achieved a notable accomplishment: a 3% year-on-year sales increase in China.\nIndia\u2019s emergence, then\u2014as a new luxury hub and a site for investment\u2014is nothing new for the Riccis, and in the 2010s they opened stores in Mumbai and New Delhi. And, while the clientele there has been \u201cvery close\u201d for over 20 years, its work in the country has reached a new level following, according to Filippo, a significant increase since COVID-19. Sales there now account for 4% of total revenue with much scope to expand. 20% of respondents in the BoF McKinsey State of Fashion 2025 executive survey cited India as a focus market for 2025, while the Knight Frank Wealth Report of March 2024 states that India\u2019s population of UHNWIs, with over $30 million in assets, is expected to grow 50% from 2023 to 2028. This would make it the fastest-growing UHNWI population in the world.\nTheir history is celebrated in the latest biannual Explorer Project, \u201cMission Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh\u2014The Land of Kings and Maharajas.\u201d From Agra, it takes in breathtaking landmarks and locations along the journey to its end destination of Udaipur. On the way there's the Taj Mahal and Fatehpur Sikri, the fortress was built between 1570 and 1573 by King Akbar. Then to Jaipur\u2019s City Palace\u2014home to Maharajas\u2014 featuring a room entirely encrusted in jewels as well as one in striking blue-and-white. Elephants wander through the Rajput architecture of the Pink City\u2019s Amer Fort. The Sardar market of Jodhpur\u2014India's blue city\u2014bustles beneath its iconic clock tower Ghanta Ghar. The majestic City Palace is one of the final stops, with a fa\u00e7ade that stretches over 240 meters to dominate Udaipur's skyline.\nIt is a setting like few others and makes for a striking backdrop to the 64 looks that make up the collection: a modern, refined wardrobe defined by the defining qualities and characteristics of the house of Stefano Ricci. Think sophisticated tailoring, ultra-fine knitwear, safari jackets and cargo trousers, duffle bags, ultralight sole sneakers\u2014but it\u2019s also a collection that embraces color and print. It feels both vibrant and refined. Produced entirely in Italy, over 140 tailors and artisans work to create these designs through heritage crafts like Florentine leatherwork, tailoring, hand engraving, shoemaking, and silver chiseling. This is slow fashion. And on this point, Fillipo Ricci is steadfast: \u201cTime is the new definition of luxury.\u201d\nEven the campaign takes its time. Early morning calls, long transfers by car and often very late finishes, the Explorer Project is a grueling undertaking. It\u2019s shot by the acclaimed photographer Steve McCurry, an iconic Magnum correspondent better known for work that captures conflicts, culture, and traditions than contemporary fashion. Still, he treats it with the same rigor he would his other work, shooting the Taj Mahal from a boat on the banks of the river Yamuna (only permissible with government approval). There\u2019s another photography team headed by Alessandro Moggi as well as videographers, hair and make-up, talent: it\u2019s a tight-knit crew of 22.\nIt\u2019s not McCurry\u2019s first time behind the lens for the brand but this trip has a special resonance. As a young boy, he was struck by a photo story on the Indian monsoon in Life magazine by the photographer Brian Brake; it has stayed with him. His own work on the monsoons decades later in the 1980s would establish his reputation as a reportage photographer. Since then, he has traveled the Subcontinent several times. On a recce of Johphur\u2019s Blue City during the shoot, he bumps into a man who rushes off excitedly only to return minutes later. He\u2019s holding a photograph of him as a young boy taken by McCurry 20 years earlier. It is a remarkable piece of work but he remains humble: \u201cYou know, sometimes you recognize the shapes and the possibilities of a situation. And that's what I did there.\u201d\nIt is this eye for a great image that fascinated consultant Terry Garcia\u2014chief science and exploration officer at the National Geographic Society for 17 years\u2014and led him to bring McCurry on board. Garcia heads up a mainstay of the Explorer project: conservation. As part of its ongoing commitment to supporting local communities, Stefano Ricci reached an agreement with the Centre for Wildlife Studies as part of this instalment, focusing on the conservation of tigers in their natural habitat. This model is rooted in science and local action will \u201chelp support studies on human-wildlife conflict in local communities,\u201d according to Niccol\u00f2.\nFor the Riccis, the ability to offer such systemic support is part of the benefit of being a 100% privately-owned business. Filipo tells me that yes, it means they must \u201cfight against the conglomerates and giants of luxury,\u201d but it affords them authenticity. \u201cIt\u2019s the beauty of being a family.\u201d"

      "text": "Penhaligon's has quickly become one of the most well-known brands in China\u2019s niche fragrance category. Now it\u2019s showcasing its 155-year history to its Chinese fanbase.\nPenhaligon\u2019s is a global fragrance brand with a 40-strong portfolio. Its immersive retrospective exhibition \u2018Eau so British\u2019 opened in Shanghai\u2014the first stop in a series of global outings ensuring the brand is as relevant today as it was in 1870.\nRunning from March 28 to April 4, the event opened during Shanghai Fashion Week at the former residence of the comprador He Dong. In a unique partnership with Chinese artist He Xian, Penhaligon\u2019s narrative was brought to life through traditional Chinese shadow puppetry, which acted as a backdrop to the retrospective. He Xian drew inspiration from Penhaligon\u2019s very first scent Hammam Boutique to create The Birth of an English Legend\u20146 acts of light and shadow that portrayed how the original Mr. Penhaligon captured jasmine, lavender, and rose, essentially embarking on the brand\u2019s 155 year journey. Penhaligon\u2019s\nA considered curation puts the fragrances at the heart of this first consumer-facing event in China. Woven around these, the story is told by 30 items of archival ephemera, including original bottles, heritage products, packaging, and artworks. Across multiple rooms, these document over a century of perfumery, social history, and branding. An audio guide enhances images from Penhaligon\u2019s past and present.\nChina is a key location for fashion curation. Gucci\u2014a regular exhibitor in China\u2014also launched Bamboo at the same time: Decoding in March at the historical Sunke Villa. Alongside archive pieces, it features artworks from Sybil Montet and Yanran Chen. And \u2018Eau so British\u2019 was not the only China-first show opening at the time; Loro Piana\u2019s \u2018If You Know You Know\u2019 at the Museum of Art Pudong was the house\u2019s debut China exhibit also opened in March (coincidentally, the brand is celebrating 100 years.)\n\u2018Eau so British\u2019 coincided with Notes Shanghai, the perfume trade show recently added to the official Shanghai Fashion Week tradeshow schedule. It attracted over 10,000 industry professionals and enthusiasts from all over the world including the fragrance KOL and influencer Scarlett Pan @\u5b9d\u85cf\u5973\u5b69\u963f\u82b1.\nPan, who attended the exhibition opening, says Penhaligon\u2019s reputation in China has been built on the Portraits collection, a line of quirky, humorous characters\u2014what she describes as \u201cfancy animal-head bottles with melodramatic backstories and British aristocratic vibes.\u201d To cement their appeal among this new generation of fragrance enthusiasts, the exhibition introduced April's release, Fortuitous Finley, which has been added to the Portraits collection. With notes of salted pistachio and the unique violet leaf, it joins other characters from the series such as Duchess Rose, Terrible Teddy, and Arthur\u2014all among the best sellers in China.\n\u201cYoung customers [here] really eat this up, and it makes the brand\u2019s UK heritage, especially the connections with royalty, feel more tangible,\u201d Pan explains. These nods to a long association with the British monarchy started in 1903 when Penhaligon\u2019s was awarded its first Royal Warrant by the Queen Consort to King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra.\nDespite only entering the market in 2021, Penhaligon\u2019s has been quickly advancing in the Chinese market. It now has 24 stores in locations like Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao, Kunming, Chengdu, and Shenzhen. And while 2025 is an important marker for the historic brand globally, 2024 was a key year for the Puig-owned label in the mainland. That year saw the opening of four doors: Wuhan SKP in July; SLT in Beijing and Plaza 66 in Shanghai\u2014both in August\u2014and Taikoo Hui also in Shanghai in December.\nFor 2025\u2019s Lunar New Year, the aptly titled fragrance Luna, among the brand\u2019s most popular fragrances in the country, was given a chic, snake-inspired visual rebrand for the festival. Pan, for one, finds these classic collections, especially Sartorial, Blenheim Bouquet, and Halfeti, more appealing. \u201cThese vintage-style scents with old-school elegance and understated, gentle profiles better reflect the British culture I\u2019m more familiar with, say, in period dramas and films,\u201d she explains.\nA pre-eminent voices in the sector, Pan complimented the \u201cvisual flair\u201d of the display. \u201cI think Chinese fragrance lovers probably showed up here today with love and curiosity: a full-on appreciation of British culture,\u201d she said at the event.\nFew have a heritage quite like Penhaligon\u2019s. The exhibition, which has been causing a stir on platforms like Weibo and Red Note, is now moving on to Wuhan followed by stop-offs in London (in May) as well as Dubai and Sydney in Q4.\nMORE ON FORBES"

      "text": "Moynat\u2019s campaign for this year\u2019s 520 festival in China is certainly a case of the tail wagging the dog. The Parisian trunk maker has unveiled a collection of pet accessories for the country\u2019s I Love You Day, which falls on May 20, and the campaign featuring lovable dogs is going viral.\nIt may look like a series full of cute images, but the leather goods house has taken it very seriously. According to a brand spokesperson, it applied the same rigor it would for any high-profile campaign, even though this only featured pets\u2014albeit with a very famous owner.\n\u201cWe followed the same principles as we would with any campaign, such as insisting on a well-known photographer,\u201d they explained on a call. He is Julian Song, a photographer and artist whose work has been featured in respected titles such as T Magazine, L\u2019Officiel, Modern Weekly, and V China.\nSecondly, the dogs were treated like \u201csuperstars\u201d during the shoot. The \u201cexact same level of care\u201d was taken with the scenography and visuals for the China-first launch (more editions and pets, to follow). \u201cI think this sincerity is the reason why it\u2019s being so well received,\u201d they continued.\nThat and the two furry leads.\nCollectively known as DAI ball ball, the dogs are owned by Chinese celebrity, actor, and singer Tan Jianci. The 34-year-old idol is a massive draw at home. An actor since 2007, he made his musical debut in the C-pop band M.I.C. in 2010. He was catapulted to superstardom in the 2022 iQiyi and Tencent drama Under the Skin. No stranger to fashion, Tan acted as a face for Prada and in February was made the spokesperson for another LVMH house Fendi, appearing in its men\u2019s Spring Summer \u201825 campaign (shot by local photographer Oliver June).\nArriving in the China market relatively late \u20142015 \u2014Moynat currently has 8 standalone boutiques in the country. While the company declined to share turnover or revenue, it is gaining online traction for the playful series that channels the tongue-in-cheek spirit of Juergen Teller\u2019s shoot for Marc Jacobs in 2008 which ultimately repositioned Victoria Beckham in the fashion industry.\nAnd it\u2019s not only Song\u2019s striking imagery that is resonating. In recent years, pets have become important members of Chinese households, according to Shelly Yan, the founder of Closet Showroom. This phase has come in tandem with an improvement in living standards and the increase in emotional needs\u2014especially during and after the pandemic. A 2025 China Pet Industry White Paper released by the platform PetData, found that China\u2019s pet industry is proving resilient. The urban consumption for pet dogs and cats surpassed $41 billion, up 7.5% year-on-year. It cited an increasingly young demographic as one of the drivers for this growth.\nGiven this, it's natural to wrap in a variety of verticals, including China\u2019s high fashion scene. Shanghai-based brand Jacques Wei launched a pet line in 2023 with Vitale Barberis Canonico\u2014one of the world's oldest woolen mills. Another independent designer, Je Cai, debuted an urban pet collaboration with the local producer PIP; this saw dogs take to Shanghai Fashion Week\u2019s runway during Spring Summer \u201825. \u201cNow, pet owners are willing to purchase high-quality products and services for their pets to show their affection. Moynat's pet-themed campaign is precisely aimed at meeting this emotional need,\u201d Yan continued.\nChina commentators agree that the country\u2019s declining birth rate also indicates that many young Chinese are \u201copting for pets\u201d instead of starting families. This is opening up a substantial luxury opportunity. But, brands need to be careful, Vicky Jin, marketing operations manager at retailer SND, advised. \u201cIn today\u2019s media environment, where nothing is context-free, even something cute can spark ethical discussion if viewed through a critical lens\u201d she said.\nMoynat\u2019s tone, on the other hand, manages to combine being \u201crespectful\u201d with artistic merit. \u201cThis is down to a clever balance of luxury and emotion,\u201d she pointed out, noting the \u201ccare and sincerity\u201d taken by the brand in its portrayal of the dogs as part of a luxury lifestyle.\nIn a depressed environment, where every effort is scrutinised, Moynat\u2019s outing for 520 plays on the simple bond between pets and their owners, landing well. \u201cIn a world often drawn to cool and abstract visuals, this warm and playful approach stands out. As universally loved symbols, dogs bring instant charm and, of course, shareability,\u201d added Jin.\nThe first-ever pet accessories in the M Collection featuring collars, leashes, and charms and a \u2018Hobo\u2019 shoulder bag which are now available in all Moynat boutiques worldwide."
