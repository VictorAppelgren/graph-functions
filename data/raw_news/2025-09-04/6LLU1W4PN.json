  "description": "Health and Humans Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday amid controversy over his firing of CDC director Susan Monarez.",
  "content": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday, a week after turmoil engulfed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nLawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the HHS, will hear from Kennedy on President Donald Trump\u2019s health care agenda, dubbed by the secretary as the Make America Healthy Again movement.\n\nWhile the committee does not directly oversee the CDC, the recent firing of former CDC director Susan Monarez, the wave of high-level officials departing and other moves at the agency taken under Kennedy\u2019s tenure are expected to dominate the line of questioning from both Republicans and Democratic lawmakers on the panel.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, who is a member of the panel, told reporters that Kennedy would face \"hard questions\" from committee members, particularly over frustrations over Monarez, who was confirmed by the Senate less than a month before her ouster.\n\n\"He's gotta take responsibility\u2026 we confirm these people,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"We go through a lot of work to get them confirmed. And they\u2019re in office a month?\"\n\nSpeculation has swirled over the reason behind Monarez\u2019s firing given her differing stance on vaccines compared to Kennedy, who spent much of his presidential campaign and tenure as secretary going after the efficacy and safety of vaccination, particularly those for COVID-19.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who chairs the Senate health committee and was the deciding vote that propelled Kennedy to a role in the Trump administration, is also set to question the secretary.\n\nLast week, he demanded that the federal government\u2019s vaccine advisory panel, which was filled with Kennedy\u2019s handpicked replacements after he recently booted the original panel members, postpone its scheduled meeting in September until \"significant oversight\" was carried out by his committee, and charged that any recommendations made by the advisory panel should be rejected until then.\n\nRFK JR. DETAILS HOW HE PLANS ON RESTORING PUBLIC TRUST IN THE CDC IN NEW OP-ED\n\nCassidy told Fox News Digital that he was working on just what the oversight measures would look like, and expected to announce his plans soon. In the meantime, he noted that he was supportive of Kennedy and Trump\u2019s commitment to \"radical transparency,\" but noted that his main concerns were about children\u2019s health.\n\n\"It isn't about R versus D. It isn't about, you know, internecine fights within the Republican Party. It is about children and grandchildren, and will they die or be at risk of dying from vaccine-preventable disease,\" Cassidy said. \"Now we've got to get to the truth of this.\"\n\nHe also argued that members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are supposed to receive materials to review before making vaccine recommendations and decisions, but questioned where the information would be coming from in the wake of several senior members of the CDC making their exit after Monarez\u2019s firing.\n\n\"We've got to have some sort of radical transparency into what scientific justification is being used for that,\" he said. \"Is it a political appointee? Well, to say a political appointee is making scientific recommendations. Who's a political appointee? I mean, are they a doctor, a PhD, or are they a political appointee? Our concern is they might just be political appointees, but we're going to find that out.\"\n\nPREVIOUS CDC DIRECTORS ACCUSE RFK JR. OF ENDANGERING ALL AMERICANS IN NY TIMES ESSAY\n\nSen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., another member of the Senate Finance Committee, told Fox News Digital that his line of questioning would focus on the abortion drug Mifepristone and its safety, but added that it was \"fair\" for lawmakers to have debate over Kennedy\u2019s leadership of the CDC and HHS.\n\n\"It's typical for any secretary that comes up, but I'm sure many of these issues that have been raised are related to some concerns. These questions are going to be asked, and I\u2019m grateful that the Secretary will be there to explain what he sees going on and the path forward,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy defended his moves at the CDC in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Tuesday, and contended that \"President Trump has asked me to restore that trust and return the CDC to its core mission.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe wrote that steps have already been taken to \"eliminate conflicts of interest and bureaucratic complacency\" at the agency, and that leaders who \"resisted reform\" had already been replaced.\n\n\"Most CDC rank-and-file staff are honest public servants,\" Kennedy said. \"Under this renewed mission, they can do their jobs as scientists without bowing to politics. The agency will again become the world authority on infectious-disease policy.\"\n\n\"First, the CDC must restore public trust \u2014 and that restoration has begun,\" he continued. \"It won\u2019t stop until America\u2019s public-health institutions again serve the people with transparency, honesty and integrity.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the HHS for comment but did not hear back immediately.",

      "text": "Bipartisan anger is brewing over the drama that unfolded at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), with the top members of the Senate\u2019s healthcare panel forming a united front in the midst of the turmoil.\nSenate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, R-La., and the panel's ranking member, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., dove head first into the issues stemming from the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, which spurred a string of departures from the agency.\nRFK JR. WARNS CDC 'IN TROUBLE,' PROMISES FIXES AS DIRECTOR REFUSES TO STEP DOWN\nMonarez was abruptly fired from her position by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), less than a month after being confirmed by the Senate. Her removal, which her lawyers rejected, appeared to stem from disagreements over vaccines with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a vaccine skeptic.\nCassidy was the deciding vote during Kennedy\u2019s confirmation hearing earlier this year.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president and Kennedy were \"committed to restoring trust and transparency and credibility to the CDC.\"\n\"We're going to make sure that folks that are in positions of leadership there are aligned with that mission,\" she said.\nCassidy agreed with that sentiment.\n\"The president and secretary are right,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"We need radical transparency. We need to protect the health of our children. The two go together. I am committed to the president\u2019s vision, which is why the HELP Committee will conduct oversight.\"\nMonarez has since refused to leave the post, with her lawyers arguing that she had neither resigned nor been fired and had not received notification from the president of her removal.\nCDC DIRECTOR SUSAN MONAREZ REFUSES TO BE FIRED AS OTHER OFFICIALS CALL IT QUITS\nFollowing news of her ouster, a string of top officials at the CDC announced their resignations, too, including National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Daniel Jernigan, Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Demetre Daskalakis and Director of Public Health Data, Science, Technology Jennifer Layden.\nIn response to their resignations, Cassidy demanded that the federal government\u2019s vaccine advisory panel, which was filled with Kennedy\u2019s handpicked replacements after he recently booted the original panel members, postpone its scheduled meeting in September.\nHis demand marks the second time this year that Cassidy called on the panel to halt its meeting.\nTRUMP'S CDC PICK CONFIRMED\u2014BUT HER PRO-VACCINE STANCE MAY CLASH WITH RFK JR.'S AGENDA\nCassidy argued Thursday that there were \"serious allegations made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] meeting.\"\n\"These decisions directly impact children\u2019s health, and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\" Cassidy said in a statement. \"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership.\"\nDaskalakis posted his reason for resigning on X, where he charged that he was \"unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public\u2019s health.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nMeanwhile, Sanders demanded a congressional investigation be opened into the Trump administration\u2019s decision to fire Monarez.\n\"We need leaders at the CDC and HHS who are committed to improving public health and have the courage to stand up for science, not officials who have a history of spreading bogus conspiracy theories and disinformation,\" Sanders said Thursday.\nHHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story."

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday that the American public has lost faith in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and outlined his plan to rebuild trust in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal.\nKennedy blamed decades of bureaucracy, politicized science and \"mission creep\" for eroding the CDC\u2019s core role of protecting Americans from infectious disease and squandering public confidence.\nKennedy pointed to the CDC\u2019s response to COVID-19 as an example of dysfunction that \"produced irrational policy\" and further eroded trust in the agency.\n\"Cloth masks on toddlers, arbitrary 6-foot distancing, boosters for healthy children, prolonged school closings, economy-crushing lockdowns, and the suppression of low-cost therapeutics in favor of experimental and ineffective drugs,\" he wrote. \"The toll was devastating.\"\nMORE THAN 1,000 HHS WORKERS DEMAND KENNEDY RESIGNATION OVER CDC DIRECTOR FIRING AND AGENCY CHANGES\nAlthough some may see the agency's missteps during the pandemic as a one-off mistake, Kennedy asserted that this failure was \"no anomaly,\" citing declining life expectancy and declining trust from the public as evidence.\n\"Trust has collapsed: Only one-third of health care workers participated in the 2023-24 fall COVID booster program, and fewer than 10% of children under 12 received boosters in 2024-25. The American people no longer believe the CDC has their best interests at heart,\" he wrote.\nOn an operational level, the HHS secretary was critical of the CDC's budget allocation and staffing. He ripped the agency for having only half of its total budget support its infectious-disease mission, and for the fact that fewer than 1 in 10 employees are epidemiologists\u2014which he blames for the CDC's \"disastrous\" pandemic response.\nDespite his sharp criticisms, Kennedy expressed hope that the agency could be restored to its former effectiveness. He noted that the CDC's response to a measles outbreak this year showed how the agency can \"act swiftly with precision when guided by science and freed from ideology.\"\nKennedy highlighted some of the actions already taken by the Trump administration to tackle the issues impacting the CDC, such as replacing leaders who've resisted reform and eliminating conflicts of interests and bureaucratic complacency.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\"First, the CDC must restore public trust\u2014and that restoration has begun.

They also accused Kennedy of appointing \"political ideologues\" to positions of authority.\nThat followed nine former directors and former acting CDC directors who wrote Monday in The New York Times that Kennedy's leadership was endangering all Americans, accusing him of downplaying vaccines and focusing on unproven treatments.\nHHS didn't respond to a request for comment."

She reportedly refused Kennedy's directives to adopt new limitations on the availability of some vaccines, including approvals for COVID-19 shots.\nFour other senior CDC officials resigned, pointing to Monarez\u2019s removal, as well as Kennedy\u2019s vaccine policies, as the reasons for their exit. Additionally, hundreds of workers at the agency also walked out of the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta last month in support of their former colleagues.\nThe Times guest essay's authors \u2013 William Foege, William Roper, David Satcher, Jeffrey Koplan, Richard Besser, Tom Frieden, Anne Schuchat, Rochelle P. Walensky and Mandy K.

He replaced experts on federal health advisory committees with unqualified individuals who share his dangerous and unscientific views.\"\nThey also blasted the secretary for ending U.S. support of global vaccination programs and justifying the move with \"flawed research\" and \"inaccurate statements.\" Additionally, they said he supported federal legislation that would cause \"millions of people with health insurance through Medicaid to lose their coverage.\"\nThe collection of former directors said that, because of these actions, rural Americans and people with disabilities will have less access to health care, lower-income Americans will have less access to treatment, and children could lose access to \"lifesaving vaccines.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nIn his own New York Times guest essay published on Saturday, Sen.
