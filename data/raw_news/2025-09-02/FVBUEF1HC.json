  "content": "ATLANTA, Sept. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- CENTEGIX\u00ae is honored to announce that Moore Public Schools (OK) has chosen to implement the full CENTEGIX Safety Platform\u00ae, including CrisisAlert\u2122, Safety Blueprint\u00ae, and Enhanced Visitor Management. The district's selection underscores its commitment to championing Alyssa's Law and leading the way in strengthening safety and security across all campuses.\n\nMoore Public Schools' decision to implement the CENTEGIX Safety Platform is part of a comprehensive strategy to increase safety for its students, staff, and community.\n\n\"Our responsibility is to ensure real safety, not just check a compliance box. During our evaluation, it became clear that a simple wearable wasn't enough. We chose CENTEGIX because they are the only solution that provides precise, room-level location data\u2014which is critical for responders\u2014and pairs it with visual strobes in every classroom and across campus.\"\n\n\"In a crisis, that visual alert cuts through the noise and ensures the message is received by everyone, instantly. That's a level of reliability and effectiveness we couldn't find anywhere else,\" said Moore Public Schools Director of Safety and Security Dustin Hortstkoetter . \"As an Alyssa's Law-approved provider by the Oklahoma State Department of Education, CENTEGIX brings proven expertise as the leader in wearable panic buttons.\"\n\nWhy CENTEGIX is the best choice for Oklahoma School Districts\n\nCrisisAlert equips every staff member with a wearable badge that empowers them to quickly and discreetly get help during emergencies ranging from medical situations to campus-wide threats. The badge is easy to use under stress and works indoors and outdoors. CrisisAlert provides responders with precise, room-level location details on dynamic digital maps and delivers critical alert information directly to 911. Full audio and visual notifications\u2014flashing strobes, intercom announcements, and screen takeovers\u2014instantly alert everyone to activate safety protocols. Strobes are an essential component and are included in every installation \u2013 in every room, hallway, and common area, providing an immediate visual notice of the emergency.\n\nCENTEGIX Visitor Management empowers campuses to quickly and efficiently check in and authenticate visitors. Enhanced Visitor Management leverages a highly visible CENTEGIX visitor badge with built-in real-time locating capabilities so administrators can assign and locate volunteers, contractors, parents, and guests using a live campus map.\n\nSafety Blueprint provides interactive, dynamic digital maps of each campus. Customers increasingly choose Safety Blueprint because:\n\u2022 Customers own their mapping data. CENTEGIX has no licensing restrictions.\n\u2022 Frictionless updates. Customers can update, print, export, and share maps anytime without additional cost, including with PSAP/911 agencies.\n\u2022 Mapping data is dynamic, Not Static. When a change is made, updates are instantly published and available to all users of Safety Blueprint maps. There is no need to distribute printed maps or digital files.\n\u2022 Maps Are an Integral Part of Real-Time Alerting via CrisisAlert. Maps are part of the emergency alert response that provides real-time map views, asset overlays, and location information. Mapping data is \"served\" to responders in real-time.\n\n\"Time is the single most critical factor in an emergency,\" said Brent Cobb, CEO of CENTEGIX . \"With our Safety Platform, districts like Moore Public Schools (OK) can compress the response timeline so that help arrives as quickly as possible. Alyssa's Law underscores the importance of equipping schools with panic alert systems, and by also adopting Enhanced Visitor Management and Safety Blueprint, Moore is setting a new standard in comprehensive school safety.\"\n\nMoore Public Schools joins a growing number of districts nationwide that trust CENTEGIX as the center of their layered school safety strategy.\n\nFor over 100 years, Moore Public Schools has remained a leader in academic excellence.

It\u2019s why more organizations nationwide trust our platform and the most-used wearable panic button to protect their people every day.\nIn an Emergency, EVERY. SECOND. MATTERS.\u00ae\nYou carry the weight of every second. We built the technology to help you carry it confidently. Our rapid response safety platform and solutions compress precious time in emergencies and empower your staff to act calmly, confidently, and clearly when it matters most.\nNo confusion. No hesitation. Just life-saving action. It\u2019s why more organizations nationwide trust our platform and the most-used wearable panic button to protect their people every day.\n15M+\npeople protected\n700K+\nalerts delivered\n15K+\nlocations covered\nBuilt by People Who\u2019ve Been in Your Shoes\nWe understand the weight of protecting others\u2014the students, the patients, the public\u2014because we\u2019ve been there. The pressure is constant and the stakes are high.\nOur team includes former educators, law enforcement, and caregivers who\u2019ve lived that urgency firsthand. That\u2019s why we obsess over the critical seconds that define an emergency.\nFor every leader responsible for a campus, facility, or workplace, our Safety Platform is singularly focused on compressing your emergency response timeline. It leverages dynamic digital mapping, real-time locating capabilities, an easy-to-use wearable panic button, and visitor management and reunification capabilities to plan for and respond faster to any safety situation.\nThe ability to have that additional sense of safety and security\u2026 it gives our staff such a sense of safety, protection, and consideration.\nOur District is adding a layer of safety with the CENTEGIX CrisisAlert wearable badge for Alyssa\u2019s Law, gaining the on-site notifications\u2014strobes, computer screen takeovers, intercom announcements\u2014that initiate our emergency protocols and direct everyone on campus to follow their safety training.\nWhether it is a whole campus situation\u2014the unthinkable\u2014or these different medical emergencies, I cannot think of anything that\u2019s going to speed up a response the way the Safety Platform does, or enable as many employees to be able to get help and initiate a response.\nI had a student have a diabetic seizure in my classroom today. Right in the middle of class he stood up, called my name\u2026 and seconds later he collapsed. It scared me to death.\nIt was only by the grace of God I was close enough when it happened to catch his head before it hit the ground. We both went down together, knocked over a table, shattered a coffee mug, and sent about 150 highlighters in a basket flying across the room. I\u2019m sure my lack of grace was largely responsible for that part.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve prayed that hard in a long time. Kids were scared and crying. A few ran for help. It was terrifying.\nThe nurse was there within 2 minutes which was honestly incredible given the distance she had to run across campus to get to my room. Gadsden City is MASSIVE. I have no idea how she did it, but nurses are heroes and they always do.\nToday I realized what a blessing the panic button on my Centegix badge truly is without it the response time would\u2019ve probably doubled, if not tripled.\nJust imagine if it had been worse. A press of that button instantly notifies administration, campus police, and the nurse that there\u2019s an emergency. It tracks the location of the person who\u2019s wearing it in live time and within two minutes I had an administrator, two police officers, and a nurse at my door. TWO minutes. 120 SECONDS.\nTHAT is how you spend money to protect and support teachers and students and today I\u2019m very thankful to be in a place that prioritizes safety over everything else.\nWorkplace safety [is the] number one issue not only for the schools but also throughout the nation, so this gives an extra level of security for our staff members.\nDifferent Missions. One Goal: Safety Without Delay\nHealthcare\nEmpower healthcare workers to get help during instances of workplace violence and other emergencies, anywhere on campus.\nGovernment\nKeep public servants and staff safe where they do critical work on behalf of constituents and communities.\nHigher Education\nTechnology to create a safe campus culture for your trade school, college or university.\nCommercial\nEasy-to-use safety solutions create safer workplaces by protecting all employees, customer-facing and behind the scenes.\nSolutions Powered by the Safety Platform\nEmpower your staff to get help instantly anywhere on your campus with a push of a button\u2013giving them, and you, critical peace of mind. Ninety-eight percent of CrisisAlert users feel safer and more supported at work.\nSeconds save lives. Use digital critical incident maps you control to direct responders to an emergency with precision, down to the floor and room level. You own your maps and can update them anytime. Adding safety assets to your maps provides everyone from your facility manager to first responders with the location of the nearest AEDs, video cameras, bleed control and first aid.\nWhen seconds matter, location-aware video gives you the power to act with clarity and confidence. The moment a CrisisAlert badge activates an alert, live feeds from the nearest cameras put you inside the scene, so your team arrives prepared, informed, and ready to protect what matters most.\nNo longer worry if unauthorized personnel are on your campus. Efficiently authenticate, manage, and locate visitors on your campus with versatile check-in options, comprehensive visitor screening, real-time visitor locating, and discreet issue detection and notification to keep schools, facilities, and workplaces safe.\nIn the News\nCENTEGIX Safety Platform\u00ae Selected by Moore Public Schools to Champion Alyssa\u2019s Law and Protect Students, Staff, and Visitors\nAtlanta, GA \u2013 September 2, 2025 \u2014 CENTEGIX\u00ae is honored to announce that Moore Public Schools (OK) has chosen to implement the full CENTEGIX Safety Platform\u00ae, including CrisisAlert\u2122, Safety Blueprint\u00ae, and Enhanced Visitor Management.

It takes a unified team to turn a safety plan into a safety culture.\nThat\u2019s where our Safety Platform becomes your essential solution. It equips everyone with a simple, consistent way to act and respond to an emergency\u2014from an everyday incident to an extreme crisis. The result is a proactive culture of safety, where your people are empowered to act and respond with confidence, clarity, and calm in the seconds that matter most.\nWhy Leaders Trust CENTEGIX\nCrisisAlert is the solution we\u2019ve been looking for. Knowing that in healthcare, if there\u2019s a problem, you just hit that badge\u2026This is an outstanding solution to a long-standing problem.\nThe immediate response is something I love\u2026it\u2019s not even a second after I hit my button. It\u2019s that comfort and reassurance that my team is here for me and will help protect me and the clinic.\nWhen we evaluated dozens of solutions to comply with the panic button mandates in different states, we were impressed with CENTEGIX\u2019s unique ability to cover every square foot of a property. That\u2014along with the ease of installation and their responsive approach to customer support\u2014led to our decision that CENTEGIX is the best solution for our properties.\nThe idea that anybody can call a lockdown is huge. And not only that, 911 is notified immediately, and they know who activated the lockdown and where they were located\u2026That\u2019s good knowledge, especially for law enforcement.\nSafety and security is everyone\u2019s responsibility, so if we\u2019re going to make that everyone\u2019s responsibility, then everyone needs to be empowered to have a voice. These are public schools and parents entrust their children to us every day.\nOur previous mobile app didn\u2019t work because there were simply too many places on campus where the service was unavailable. We switched to CENTEGIX because there was nothing else that compared in terms of complete campus coverage and ease of use.\nThe Award-Winning Trusted Safety Partner for\nThousands of Organizations Nationwide\nReady to Transform Your Emergency Response?\nSOLUTIONS\nINDUSTRIES\nRESOURCES\nCOMPANY\nPARTNERS\nCONTACT\nEVERY.
