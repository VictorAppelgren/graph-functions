I co-do it with my executives. It's a lot of work, but it's necessary,\" he added.\n\nThe Airbnb CEO said that founder-mode companies are more likely to \"thrive or even survive the age of AI\" because the technology is forcing companies to reinvent.\n\nAirbnb did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChesky's management style became etched in Silicon Valley zeitgeist last year when , a writer and founding partner of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, published an essay titled \" \" about Chesky's argument that conventional advice on scaling up a startup is broken.\n\nAt a YC event mentioned in the essay, the Airbnb exec said, as he has before , that investors and outside managers just don't have the insights that founders do.

      "text": "- Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn said he adapted his leadership as the company grew in size.\n- Von Ahn said he shifted from micromanagement to focusing on company culture and tough decisions.\n- Duolingo has 46 million daily users and saw its stock shoot up 205% in the past year.\nDuolingo's CEO, Luis von Ahn, said that his leadership style changed as the language learning app grew from a couple of dozen staffers to over 800 employees.\n\"If you're starting a company, you should be a micromanager up until about employee 30,\" von Ahn said in a talk at Stanford University published last week. \"I took it too far, I went to about 50.\"\nVon Ahn, who cofounded Duolingo in 2011, added that he no longer leads this way \u2014 not because he doesn't want to, but because it's impossible to micromanage that many people.\n\"At this point, I also have learned that most of my job is culture carrier, mascot, and just making some of the kind of tough philosophical decisions,\" von Ahn said.\nThe CEO said that he learned to let go of tasks that he isn't good at or that he doesn't enjoy.\n\"Two of my executive team are sitting here \u2014 head of people and head of finance. I am neither good at those things nor do I get energy from them, so they have all the freedom in the world,\" he said. \"But our poor head of product does not have a lot of freedom.\"\nThe edtech company has become an investor darling. It hit over 46 million daily active users this year, and its stock is up 205% in the past year. Duolingo has expanded its offerings from languages to math, music, and recently, chess.\nDuolingo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDifferent take on 'founder mode'\nThe Duolingo CEO's approach differs from some top tech bosses' leadership styles. Jensen Huang, for one, is known for having up to 60 direct reports, and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky, reorganized the company post-pandemic to swap out a divisional structure for one that let him have input in many more decisions.\nChesky's management style became etched in Silicon Valley zeitgeist last year when Paul Graham, a writer and founding partner of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, published an essay titled \"Founder Mode\" about Chesky's argument that conventional advice on scaling up a startup is broken.\nAt a Y Combinator event mentioned in the essay, the Airbnb exec said, as he has before, that investors and outside managers just don't have the insights that founders do. He said that splitting a company into organizational tiers \u2014 isolating founders from anyone but their direct reports \u2014 often kills the business.\nDuolingo's von Ahn, too, has said that he is in founder mode \u2014 but he sees it a little differently.\nIn an interview with The Verge last year, he said that while he has a \"view of everything\" at the company, other executives, such as the vice president of product management and chief design officer, also have that view.\nHe added that at Duolingo, data calls the shots more than he or other execs.\n\"If we run an A/B test and the metrics say something, my opinion doesn't matter all that much unless it's something that we think is really like a dark pattern or something,\" he said at the time."

      "text": "- Paul Graham's essay on \"founder mode\" versus \"manager mode\" sparked conversation, memes, and merch.\n- Graham's essay, inspired by Airbnb's CEO, Brian Chesky, critiques traditional startup advice.\n- Graham argues that instead of delegating, founders should stay involved as their startups scale.\nAs the internet puts brat summer to bed, founder mode is taking center stage.\nOn Sunday, Paul Graham, a writer and founding partner of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, published a 1,050-word essay that took tech and business communities by storm.\nHe asked: Why are startup founders directed to run their large companies like managers, delegating to their direct reports, rather than getting involved as they did in earlier stages of their companies?\nGraham argued that operating in \"manager mode\" over \"founder mode\" is anathema to companies.\n\"What this often turns out to mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground,\" he wrote.\nA prime example of a tech titan embracing founder mode is Jensen Huang, Nvidia's cofounder and CEO, who has 60 direct reports and still eats in the company cafeteria.\nGraham credited Brian Chesky, Airbnb's cofounder and CEO, with sparking the idea and most of the arguments in the blog. At a recent Y Combinator event, Chesky argued that conventional advice on building and scaling up a startup is broken. He said, as he has before, that investors and outside managers just don't have the insights that founders do. He said that splitting a company into organizational tiers \u2014 isolating founders from anyone but their direct reports \u2014 often kills the business.\nWhile belittling manager mode might shock management consultants, Graham's post tracks with Silicon Valley's modus operandi. Tech culture has always venerated founders and lean teams. Venture capitalists try to outdo each other in funding rounds to appear the most \"founder friendly\" \u2014 investors who won't meddle much. Would-be founders dream of the day they can peel away from drab Big Tech and start their own Next Big Thing, unconstrained by bureaucracy.\nAnd it's a long weekend with little else going on online. The internet craves buzzy nomenclature and the chance to rake in the likes with a viral follow-on post.\n'Gaslit' founders\nChesky's talk hit another nerve with the founders in the room and then with Graham's readers. The Airbnb exec said founders were constantly being \"gaslit\" \u2014 first by outside voices asking them to run the company as managers, and then by employees who don't like the manager's way.\nChesky is the only remaining Airbnb cofounder at the company, and while much of his leadership has been praised \u2014 he led a major round of pandemic-era layoffs with empathy and has tried to refocus the hospitality giant \u2014 the stock has fallen by more than 15% since its 2020 initial public offering.\nThere are also notable exceptions to positive founder mode: Sam Bankman-Fried and Elizabeth Holmes were both founders who operated with autonomy, then ignominy.\nOn the other hand, Satya Nadella and Tim Cook are both outside managers touted as turning their companies around \u2014 in both cases building on the legacies of strong founders.\nThinkfluencers' time to shine\nGraham's essay brought Chesky's speech outside the YC room and into the rest of the world. Now, investors, wannabe thinkfluencers, comedians, and founders are weighing in.\nBaron Davis, a basketball star turned investor, likened being a founder to being an athlete.\nThe best athletes have been on that \u2018founder mode\u2019 from day one. Every season, we\u2019re out here building our game, helping the team, our brand, our legacy, adapting and staying resilient.\n\u2014 Baron Davis (@BaronDavis) September 3, 2024\nStartup founders are more like athletes than they think. It\u2019s all about that grind, staying\u2026\nAnother investor gave one of the tastiest examples of founder mode: Costco's deal of the century, which has withstood inflation thanks to one cofounder's clear instructions to his CEO: If you raise the price of \"the effing hot dog, I will kill you.\"\nfounder mode is keeping the hot dog at $1.50 no matter what\n\u2014 Turner Novak \ud83c\udf4c\ud83e\udde2 (@TurnerNovak) September 2, 2024\nA tech-newsletter writer depicted what dating a tech bro might look like this week.\nit\u2019s called \u201cfounder mode\u201d it\u2019s about how to run your company as a founder and how that often goes against traditional management practices. it\u2019s basically what i already do but paul graham created a cool name for it in his latest essay. you know who paul graham is? y combinator? pic.twitter.com/rMKo9iGk6P\n\u2014 sophie (@netcapgirl) September 2, 2024\nSome rang warning bells about what's next for Tech Discourse now that founder mode is officially a hit.\nfounder mode is starting to make it to linkedin, this week will be hell\n\u2014 arsham (@arshamg_) September 3, 2024\nSaying a prayer for everyone going to work after Labor Day weekend after the Paul Graham Founder's Mode post\n\u2014 Bessie \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@bessiec) September 3, 2024\nCustom domains have been purchased.\nAnd of course, unofficial merch has already dropped.\nDamn !

      "text": "- Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham said you should work for startups, not big companies.\n- Even when they fail, you'll be surrounded by future founders, he said.\n- The two career routes are often debated in terms of money, mental health, and upward mobility.\nFamed entrepreneur and Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham says it's wise to work for startups over big companies \u2014 even if they're more likely to fail.\nWorking for big companies might be \"safer,\" the investor shared on X, but the connections forged with startup colleagues can cue up future success.\n\"In ten years they'll be running everything,\" Graham wrote of startup employees, \"even if the startup tanks.\"\nWhile Graham's position isn't exactly surprising from a cofounder of a famed startup incubator, the two career routes are hotly debated. In terms of salary, there are tradeoffs between generous Big Tech salaries and potentially lucrative startup stock options.\nOthers have noted the unique pressures of working for startups can lead to mental health issues, with corporate jobs often furnishing a better work-life balance. Long hours are the norm at startups, although they can also be a part of corporate life too, depending on the industry and role.\nStill, Graham's advice resonated with users on X. \"You need people willing to jump in and build the future, and startups inherently self-select for this,\" one wrote.\nAnother argued that working with big companies helped inform their eventual startup journey: \"I learned professionalism, humility, and was surrounded by incredible mentors.\"\nGraham often sounds off on career advice on X \u2014 including his personal indicator for when an email pitch might have been composed by ChatGPT and evolving attitudes toward remote work.\nHe did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider ahead of publication."

      "text": "- Silicon Valley is split over the best way to run a company.\n- An essay called \"Founder Mode,\" inspired by Airbnb's Brian Chesky, says leaders need to be more hands-on.\n- While many leaders agree, some think managers play a vital role within tech firms.\nSeptember has started with some navel-gazing in Silicon Valley as tech operators have been forced to confront an awkward question: are they running their companies the right way?\nThere are a few good reasons this question has surfaced. For one, industry veteran Paul Graham \u2014 a cofounder of startup accelerator Y Combinator \u2014 published an essay titled \"Founder Mode\" at the start of the month that either resonated or struck a nerve with leaders.\nFor the uninitiated, Graham has established a reputation in tech circles as a shrewd and erudite thinker. Over the past two decades, he's regularly weighed in on topics that both would-be entrepreneurs and more established leaders often fret over.\nEssays on generating \"superlinear returns\" and becoming \"ramen profitable\" have found viral acclaim among startup founders. So, too, have broader ruminations on being stubborn, the art market, and having kids. Famously, Graham was also an early mentor to Sam Altman.\nIn his latest essay, Graham argues that there are two ways of operating a growing company \u2014 \"founder mode and manager mode\" \u2014 with those falling into the latter category at risk of seeing their company being driven into the ground.\nHis rationale is pretty straightforward. Manager mode, he claims, involves a more hands-off approach to operations by delegating tasks to direct reports who are left to figure out details alone. Founder mode, he says, is about doing the exact opposite.\nAirbnb's cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky, the inspiration behind Graham's essay, sees leaders like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jony Ive, and Hiroki Asai, his global head of marketing, as exemplars of founder mode.\nA slowdown in capital flowing into tech businesses has made leaders more sensitive to Graham's question. Economic uncertainty has pushed them to think hard about their operations.\nBut as a fierce debate has raged through social media in recent days, it's become clear that the tech world is split on what, exactly, is the best way to run a tech company.\nFounder mode versus manager mode\nFilip Dames is one tech figure who has found plenty that resonates with him in the founder mode philosophy.\nAs a founding partner at investment firm Cherry Ventures and part of the founding team of online retail firm Zalando, Dames has seen \"efficiency go out the window\" for startup leaders who bring in, say, a \"super senior sales guy\" to solve problems as they grow in size.\n\"They will never be as dedicated, they will never have as much skin in the game,\" Dames told Business Insider. \"For them it's a job, and for you as a founder, it's basically your life.\"\nThe idea gets to the heart of what the pro-founder mode camp prizes. In a podcast, Airbnb's Chesky argued that founders differ from managers by being the \"biological parent\" of the company they oversee.\n\"You can love something, but when you're the biological parent of something, like, it came from you, it is you, there's a deep passion and love,\" he said.\nOf course, tech leaders do become encumbered with a growing list of responsibilities as their companies grow. Big Tech firms like Meta and Google went on a huge hiring binge during the pandemic to meet the growing demand for digital services, but they have since laid off layers of middle managers.\nFor Dames, growth doesn't necessarily mean companies and founders must switch to manager mode.\nIn his view, many large companies where the CEO is the founder \"manage to run things with the founder DNA\" by ensuring the full organization works with the same clear \"values\" in mind. \"I think eventually as the company grows the only way to do it is through values,\" he said.\nA value-led approach has been key for tech founders who have managed to maintain success at their companies years after they raised their initial round of seed money. Jeff Bezos, for instance, has famously retained Amazon's \"Day 1\" culture, first established in 1997.\nOthers see a risk in sticking to a single operating mode. According to Hussein Kanji, a founder and partner at venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures, it's easy to end up down the wrong track \"if you live just in one mode.\"\n\"People love making things black and white when the world runs in a lot of different shades of truth,\" he said. \"People have lost their ability to engage with seemingly contradictory ideas at the same time.\" In his view, the best leaders are the ones who \"know when it's time to be binary.\"\nIt's a view that tallies with Dames, though he sees founder mode leaders having more of an edge during times that call for a shift in approach.\n\"If you have more of the manager mindset and you're used to just calm waters, that makes things really difficult if you're in a fast-change environment and you need adaptability,\" he said. \"The reality just changes.\"\nThat said, some of the most successful tech companies right now are overseen by leaders who weren't their founders. Satya Nadella at Microsoft is one such leader, as is Dara Khosrowshahi at Uber.\nIt is unclear how Silicon Valley will resolve this debate. In an X post on Tuesday, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya weighed in by dismissing Graham's categories and suggesting instead that there is \"first principles management and stupid management.\"\n\"When your company isn't working, the only solution is to take the time, as laborious as it sounds, to break your business down to its core essentials and rebuild it from the ground up with zero nostalgia or loyalty to people or technology,\" he wrote.\nExpect divides on the leadership merits of founders and managers to continue for some time."

His approach, dubbed \"founder mode\", was highlighted in a viral Paul Graham essay that argues founders should stay involved rather than delegating to managers. Chesky believes this model helps companies survive the AI era and has inspired other tech leaders, such as Duolingo\u2019s Luis von\u202fAhn, who also keep a tight grip on early\u2011stage growth.
