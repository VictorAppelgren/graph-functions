  "description": "The Long Melford brewery is given planning permission to expand its site.",
  "content": "A brewery has said it hopes to unveil its expanded and revamped site in time for Christmas 2026. Nethergate Brewery based in Long Melford, near Sudbury in Suffolk, was given planning permission for its project by Babergh District Council earlier this month. It means the brewery will introduce a new taproom, shop, cafe, warehouse, children's playground and more. James Holberry, sales and marketing director, said there would be spades in the ground soon.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that might disrupt that, weather being a big one of them, but we're hopeful now that planning has been granted we can get under way,\" he said. Mr Holberry said the brewery was \"bursting at the seams\" and ready for the expansion.\n\nThe brewery, which also has a taproom in Bury St Edmunds, submitted its plans last year for its expansion. They were given approval on 8 August. Between 15 to 30 part time and full time jobs will be created from the expansion, the brewery says. There will also be new car park with electric vehicle spaces, a new outside seating area, footpaths linking to the nearby country park and some land will be used for growing hops. Managing director Rob Crawford said the development would improve access to the neighbouring country park, making it a \"better place to visit with friends and family\".",
