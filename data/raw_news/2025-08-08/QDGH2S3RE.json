  "content": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Detroit safety Morice Norris was attended to for about 20 minutes and taken off the field in an ambulance during the Lions\u2019 preseason game Friday night against Atlanta, with the game ending with 6:31 to go after the players let the clock run.\n\nNorris was hurt with 14:50 to go trying to tackle Nathan Carter. There was no immediate report on the injury.\n\nWhen play resumed, Falcons quarterback Emory Jones took a snap and then held the ball as players from both teams stood at the line of scrimmage and the clock continued to run. Finally, with 6:31 left, an official announced the game had been suspended \u201cper New York.\u201d\n\nThe Lions led 17-10 when played was stopped.\n\nEarlier, Hendon Hooker lost two fumbles in a start that did not last as long as expected, hurting his hopes to win Detroit\u2019s backup quarterback job as Kyle Allen threw two touchdown passes to lead the Lions.\n\nHooker started and was expected to play the full first half. Instead, he lost a fumble on Detroit\u2019s opening drive and then lost another fumble in the second quarter. Detroit coach Dan Campbell immediately turned to Allen.\n\nAllen responded by completing a 68-yard pass to Jackson Meeks before throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to Isaac TeSlaa, a rookie from Arkansas who took advantage of his 6-foot-4 frame to make the leaping catch over Atlanta nickel back Dee Alford.\n\nThe Falcons held out starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and backup Kirk Cousins. Easton Stick made a strong bid to win the No. 3 job by completing 15 of 18 passes for 159 yards, including a 13-yard scoring pass to Chris Blair late in the first half.\n\nEmory Jones played the second half for Atlanta.\n\nTop draft picks get in the game\n\nFalcons rookie edge rusher Jalon Walker, who returned to practice on Monday after missing much of the opening week of training camp with a minor hamstring injury, started. Atlanta\u2019s other first-round pick, edge rusher James Pearce Jr., also started.\n\nWalker, Pearce and veteran Leonard Floyd are expected to boost a pass rush that finished 31st in sacks last season.\n\nDetroit\u2019s top two draft picks, defensive lineman Tyleik Williams and right guard Tate Rutledge, also played.\n\nThe Lions\u2019 defense is adjusting after second-year cornerback Ennis Rakestraw Jr. was placed on injured reserve on Thursday with a season-ending shoulder injury.\n\nLions: Return to Detroit to host Miami in the Lions\u2019 third preseason game on Saturday, Aug. 16.\n\nFalcons: Play another home game next Friday against Tennessee following joint practices with the Titans at the Falcons\u2019 complex next week.",

      "text": "Lions strengthen their pass defense by drafting two cornerbacks\nLions strengthen their pass defense by drafting two cornerbacks\nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The NFL draft enabled the Detroit Lions to turn a potential weakness into a strength by selecting cornerbacks with their first two picks.\nThe Lions traded up five spots in Thursday\u2019s first round to select Terrion Arnold from Alabama and followed it up by taking Ennis Rakestraw from Missouri with their second-round pick Friday.\nDetroit, which made it to the NFC championship game last season, finished 27th against the pass overall and allowed the second-most passing yards per game in the playoffs.\nThe Lions\u2019 additions in the draft \u2014 along with trading for Carlton Davis, re-signing Emmanuel Moseley and Khalil Dorsey and signing free agent Amik Robertson \u2014 are expected to lead to intense battles in training camp.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a bloodbath in there now,\u201d Lions general manager Brad Holmes said of his team\u2019s cornerback room. \u201cIt is, and that\u2019s what makes everything better. It makes the room better, it makes the defense better, it makes the team better. Competition just brings the best out of everybody.\u201d\nNOTHING PROMISED\nHolmes believes Detroit\u2019s roster is improved, but it\u2019s up to the six drafted players to prove him right.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling to be in the spot where we feel good about the depth we have, to feel good about the future we have,\u201d Holmes said Saturday. \u201cBut those guys got to compete and win spots. But I know that we\u2019re a better football team.\n\u201cNow to take that step like what you were talking about, it\u2019s going to be really up to them. Now we\u2019re going to do our part and make sure that they\u2019re surrounded with the resources to be set up for success with their development. But those guys got to compete.\u201d\nCANADIAN FIRST\nFor the first time in team history, the Lions drafted a player from a Canadian college. They chose offensive tackle Giovanni Manu from the University of British Columbia in the fourth round.\nThe Lions traded their 2025 third-round pick Saturday to the New York Jets to select the 6-foot-7, 352-pound Manu, who did not begin playing football until he was in the 10th grade and was raised on the south Pacific island of Tonga before moving to British Columbia at the age 11.\nDetroit is hoping Manu develops into a player similar to his now-teammate, tackle Penei Sewell. Manu remembers Sewell saying that any Polynesian kids who want to make it to the NFL can do so if they put their minds to it.\n\u201cI was in my second year of college when he said that and I remember that it really motivated me,\u2019\u2019 Manu said. \u201cI told myself if one of my Polynesian brothers can make it, there\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t do it either. He\u2019s a true inspiration to Samoa and the whole Polynesian community. It (will be) great to play with a guy to soak up as much information and technique from him.\u2019\u2019\nMOVING ON UP\nDetroit traded up a second time on the third day of the draft to take Sione Vaki of Utah in the fourth round.\nThe Lions swapped picks with Philadelphia to choose Vaki, who was 2023 first-team All-Pac 12 Conference and a finalist for Polynesian College Football Player of the Year and the Paul Hornung Award, which honors the most versatile player. Vaki rushed 42 times for 317 yards and two touchdowns while also playing last season as a safety and on special teams.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to be a resource,\u201d Vaki said. \u201cMy biggest thing is being available. So wherever the organization needs me, I\u2019m going to be. If they need me passing out waters to the vets, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do.\u201d\nHolmes said Vaki\u2019s pro day was one of the best he saw this year.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a football player that plays football how we like it,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing about him that he doesn\u2019t have the ability to play safety because he can do that, too.\u201d\nThe trade with the Eagles also yielded a sixth-round pick, which the Lions used to select guard Christian Mahogany of Boston College.\nIn their final trade Saturday with Houston, the Lions moved up in the sixth round to choose LSU defensive tackle Mekhi Wingo.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"

(AP) \u2014 Tom Brady\u2019s statue weighs six tons and rises 17 feet off the ground, from the bottom of the six-sided base \u2014 one for each of the New England Patriots\u2019 Super Bowl victories \u2014 to the tip of the bronze fist raised in celebration.\nFor a player who was too slow and immobile coming out of college to merit more than a No. 199 draft pick, that seems just about right.\n\u201cWhen I was drafted, I just hoped to make the team. I never dreamed I\u2019ll be standing here two and a half decades later, made of bronze and frozen in time,\u201d Brady said Friday night at a ceremony to unveil the statue before the Patriots\u2019 exhibition opener against the Washington Commanders. \u201cBut actually, it actually feels pretty appropriate given my 40-yard dash time.\u201d\nA three-time NFL Most Valuable Player, five-time Super Bowl MVP and seven-time NFL champion \u2014 he won one after defecting to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers \u2014 Brady retired in 2023 as the league\u2019s most-decorated player ever, holding records in dozens of categories that include most wins, yards passing, and passing touchdowns \u2014 for both the regular season and playoffs.\nThe Patriots inducted him into their Hall of Fame last year, waiving the usual four-year waiting period, and retired his No. 12. At the ceremony, owner Robert Kraft said Brady would be the first player in franchise history to have a bronze statue outside the stadium.\nThe work by sculptor lifelong Patriots fan Jeff Buccacio unveiled Friday on the plaza outside the team\u2019s Pro Shop and Hall of Fame features a hexagonal granite base and a 12-foot Brady, honoring Brady\u2019s uniform number and making good on Kraft\u2019s wish for it to be larger than life. It is 17 feet in all, representing the 17 AFC East titles the Patriots won in Brady\u2019s 19 seasons.\nIn his remarks, Brady pretended to be interrupted by a call from former coach Bill Belichick giving his opinion of the statue.\n\u201cHe said there\u2019s still room for improvement,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI know that feeling.\u201d\nFans crowded the plaza, lined a nearby stairway and leaned over railings inside the stadium to watch the ceremony, interrupting Brady by chanting his name.\nAmong those in the crowd were Brady\u2019s parents and children, current coach Mike Vrabel and former teammates Devin and Jason McCourty, David Andrews, Wes Welker and Brian Hoyer. Several members of the Commanders entourage also came by, including general manager Adam Peters and ex-Patriot and current Washington defensive end Deatrich Wise.\nIn addition to the self-deprecating comments and the shot at Belichick, Brady said he didn\u2019t think a statue was appropriate until he was \u201creally old,\u201d like Vrabel.\nBut he saved his best for the rival New York Jets.\n\u201cThis statue isn\u2019t just for Pats fans. It\u2019ll also give all the Jets fans something to throw their beers at as they leave the stadium every year,\u201d Brady said. \u201cProbably in the second quarter.\u201d\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"

(AP) \u2014 After missing much of the first week of training camp with a minor hamstring injury, Atlanta Falcons first-round pick Jalon Walker returned to practice on Monday.\nWalker said he hopes to play in Friday night\u2019s first preseason game against the Detroit Lions.\n\u201cI feel good,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling so happy to be back out here. Happy for the week. It\u2019s a big week of this first preseason game and excited to get things going.\u201d\nThe Falcons selected Walker from Georgia with the No. 15 overall pick in the draft. Walker won the 2024 Butkus Award as the nation\u2019s best linebacker and has the potential to play a hybrid role in the NFL as a linebacker and edge rusher.\nFor now, the Falcons want Walker to focus on edge rusher but plan to utilize his versatility. Coach Raheem Morris said Monday the opportunities at linebacker will come \u201cpretty quickly, you know, as soon as he gets more comfortable out there moving around.\u201d\nMorris said Walker (6-2, 245) is \u201calready starting to pick some of those things up, cross training on some of those things already. He\u2019s very smart, very sharp, very detailed guy. So nothing you worry about from that standpoint. But I just want to give him a chance to be comfortable doing something first, see that happen, come to life.\u201d\nMorris said the Falcons were careful to protect Walker from aggravating the injury last week even though the rookie was impatient to join his teammates. The caution continued on Monday as Walker\u2019s exposure to practice was limited.\nAfter drafting Walker, the Falcons traded with the Los Angeles Rams to add Tennessee edge rusher James Pearce Jr. at No. 26.\nPenix, Cousins to sit out preseason opener\nMorris said starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and backup Kirk Cousins will not play in the preseason opener against Detroit. Easton Stick and Emory Jones will share the snaps.\nPenix said he might be considered for preseason games if not for his starts in the final three games of his 2024 rookie season.\n\u201cHe feels confident in what I can do on game day,\u201d said Penix of Morris. \u201cSo he didn\u2019t feel like I needed to play this week. I\u2019m going to be ready Week 1.\u201d\nMorris said other decisions will be made following the team\u2019s scrimmage on Wednesday.\nMorris takes a tumble\nMorris lined up as a defensive back against wide receiver Drake London during practice. The coach didn\u2019t fare well, as he was pushed back and landed on his backside.\nPenix, who threw the pass to London on the play, paused when asked about Morris as a player.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a coach now,\u201d Penix said with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s got to leave the DB stuff back from when he was playing.\u201d\nPearce lands in another scuffle\nPearce continued to build on his reputation for aggressive play by landing in another practice scuffle, this time with offensive lineman Tyrone Wheatley Jr. The rookie had encounters with right tackle Kaleb McGary and right guard Matthew Bergeron last week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the competitor in him,\u201d said Walker of Pearce. \u201cYou get after it. And like I said, we\u2019ve got that one speed and once we click it on, it\u2019s on.\u201d\nAsked about Pearce\u2019s early impact in practice, Penix said \u201cI notice his love for the game. He works extremely hard each and every day. ... Whatever happens after the play, we definitely want to clean that stuff up. But at the same time he\u2019s a competitor and he wants to compete at a high level. That\u2019s what he does each and every day and that\u2019s what we appreciate and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to love come game day.\u201d\nContract extension for McGary\nMcGary agreed to a two-year, $30 million extension, according to his agent, Collin Roberts. The deal was first reported by ESPN.\nMcGary, a first-round pick in 2019, has started 92 of 93 games in six seasons.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"

(AP) \u2014 The Tennessee Titans practiced in Music City on Wednesday morning and then headed out for their longest preseason road trip since the franchise left Texas in 1997.\nSecond-year coach Brian Callahan scheduled not one, but two sets of joint practices around back-to-back road games starting Thursday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He sees nine nights away from Nashville as a way to create more of an old training camp vibe for a young team.\n\u201cThat\u2019s sort of the intent of the whole trip,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cSpend some time, get a chance to grow together, and then get to go play against some other teams.\u201d\nCallahan also wants to hear the reviews from the Buccaneers, then the Atlanta Falcons on what they think of how the Titans compete. He sees this as a chance for a starting point of what the Titans can be this year.\n\u201cAnd get a change to do some things as a team on the road, some events together, things like that,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m really looking forward to. Can\u2019t wait.\u201d\nThe Titans, who went 3-14 in Callahan\u2019s debut season, will be away from Nashville for nine straight nights. They won\u2019t practice again in Nashville until Aug. 19 before wrapping up the preseason by hosting Minnesota on Aug. 22.\nAfter opening this preseason Saturday night against Tampa Bay, the Titans go to Atlanta for two joint practices and a game Aug. 15.\nLeft tackle Dan Moore has had only one joint practice with Pittsburgh, and that was last year. This will be a bit of a new experience, though Moore is familiar to going away to camp with the Steelers a regular at Latrobe, Pennsylvania.\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re on a business trip, but we\u2019ll have some free time, some downtime,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in the hotel. Guys can hang out, do stuff together and go places, go eat, whatever. And I think that\u2019s a good time for us to just bond as team and build chemistry.\u201d\nBonding can only help a franchise that has added 37 free agents, nine drafted rookies and five more players added off waivers through Sunday \u2014 a total of 51 players in training camp.\nSafety Quandre Diggs isn\u2019t new after playing eight games for Tennessee last season before going on injured reserve. He signed Tuesday, and the Titans are easing him back into the mix. He recognizes a lot of faces on the roster, including his cousin, rookie quarterback Cam Ward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different when you walk in the locker room and you see your family, like real family,\u201d the three-time Pro Bowl safety said of Ward. \u201cAnd so it was cool.\u201d\nTitans defensive coordinator Dennard Wilson has been trying to throw every look possible at Ward to help prep the No. 1 draft pick overall for the season opener Sept. 7 at Denver. Now the Titans will get a glimpse of how other NFL defenses might challenge the rookie.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a grown man to me,\u201d wide receiver Calvin Ridley said of Ward. \u201cHe\u2019s a confident guy, he\u2019s a guy that wants to be good.\u201d\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"

(AP) \u2014 The Raiders tackled \u2014 or, at least, attempted to tackle \u2014 for the first time Thursday night.\nAnd it showed.\nLas Vegas had a number of missed tackles in its 23-23 tie with Seattle, especially earlier in the game when more of its front-line defenders were on the field.\nThe question is whether that was more of a long-term cause for concern or typically what\u2019s expected in the first preseason game.\n\u201cI\u2019m chalking it up to it\u2019s the first preseason game,\u201d Raiders coach Pete Carroll said Friday. \u201cI\u2019m concerned, yeah. That way we tackled stunk, and it was all open-field stuff for the most part. ... That\u2019s why you play these games.\u201d\nMaking matters worse for the Raiders, they went against the Seahawks\u2019 backups. But it\u2019s not as if Las Vegas played all its starters for an entire first half, either.\nThe Raiders emptied their bench fairly quickly, and by the second half, the field was populated on both sides by players fairly far down the depth chart.\n\u201cProgress was made in the second half,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cWe were playing a lot cleaner and guys just got used to running and hitting. But we need to continue to emphasize it like we have been, but that\u2019s the first shot. It could have been better. I thought we worked on it hard enough to show better than that, but we\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d\nThe Raiders will have a much better idea of where they stand this upcoming week from a tackling standpoint as well as the other issues that face the team. They will have a joint practice with San Francisco on Thursday and then will face the 49ers in a preseason game two days later.\nThe joint practice will be especially telling because both teams will want to see how their starters perform. But, at least from the Raiders\u2019 perspective, the preseason meeting also should provide some clarity because Carroll said the starters will receive more playing time than they got in Seattle.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be tackling in the practice, but that\u2019ll be a good part of the preparation to get to the game,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cOur guys just need to see the tempo and the speed of really good clubs. You\u2019ve got to play good teams if you want to get good and so this is a great opportunity for us.\u201d\nJeanty\u2019s first playing opportunity\nAshton Jeanty, drafted sixth overall this year, played the first series and had minus-1 yard on three carries.\nThe Raiders gained 104 yards on the ground, with Chris Collier rushing for a team-high 42 yards on nine carries.\n\u201cWe ran the most fundamental plays you could run in our format of going through the preseason,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cIt will continue to be pretty basic just to keep our edge for the opener and the first three or four games. The teams don\u2019t know who we are and so they\u2019re going to have to find out as we go.\n\u201cSo we were real basic, and we didn\u2019t get the kind of movement that we wanted. Like, Ashton didn\u2019t get a chance. We picked up a little bit of an edge later in the game, and you saw us hitting the line of scrimmage pretty well.\u201d\nInterior linemen get extra work\nOne of the main storylines in training camp was how Jordan Meredith surprisingly took over at center, with Jackson Powers-Johnson moving to right guard. Powers-Johnson, drafted in the second round in 2024, came out of minicamp as the expected starter at center.\nPowers-Johnson did play both positions as a rookie, but he was thought to be a more natural center. Meredith, a third-year pro, hadn\u2019t played that spot in the NFL.\nBoth players were in the game well into the third quarter against the Seahawks.\n\u201cWe wanted to really have a lot of film on them, and so it\u2019s a good first step,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI thought Jordan was in command of what was going on in a difficult situation. We wanted to see how far he could go with handling the noise and the silent counts and all that kind of stuff, and he really did a good job of that. But we\u2019re not ready to make any declaration on anything. We\u2019ve just got to keep on working.\u201d\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"

(AP) \u2014 Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith and defensive end Maxx Crosby were captured on videos making obscene gestures toward Seattle Seahawks fans as they entered the field before their preseason game Thursday night.\nDetroit Lions safety Brian Branch was fined $10,128 for making a similar gesture to Green Bay Packers fans last November, according to Pro Football Talk.\nSeveral videos of the actions by Smith and Crosby made the rounds on social media Friday.\nOne video showed the team gathered as it was ready to enter the field. Crosby is seen bouncing on his feet and appears to be talking to fans and tries to grab a sign. Then Smith joins Crosby in jumping up and down and looks in the direction of those fans. As the team begins to run onto the field, Smith makes an obscene gesture to the fans with Crosby immediately following with his own.\nAt least one fan appeared to be taunting the players before the gestures were made.\nOne sign read: \u201cBigger Bust \u2014 Geno Or JaMarcus Russell?\u201d\nThe then-Oakland Raiders drafted Russell first overall in 2007, but he went 7-18 as the starting quarterback played only three seasons.\nSmith was the Seahawks\u2019 starter the past three seasons before failing to come to terms on a new deal. He followed his former coach, Pete Carroll, when the Raiders traded for him.\nThursday\u2019s game ended 23-23.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl"
