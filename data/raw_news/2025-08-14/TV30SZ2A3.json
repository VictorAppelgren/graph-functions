  "description": "The aim is to cover all of the gigafactory's exterior walls in different artwork.",
  "content": "In 2023, soon after Tesla opened the Berlin Gigafactory in Germany, Tesla chief Elon Musk announced a plan to \u201ccover all the concrete with art.\u201d\n\nAnd this week, the automaker has shared a video (top) showing off its efforts to emblazon the factory\u2019s exterior with graffiti, with much of the work done using a robot painter.\n\nVincent Krause, the workplace design lead at Gigafactory Berlin, said the ambitious project began with local graffiti artists setting to work on the factory\u2019s concrete surfaces.\n\nBut Krause also wanted to reflect Tesla\u2019s high-tech approach to production, so he called on the services of a \u201crobot muralist\u201d to continue the work.\n\nThe kit comprises a powerful computer, software capable of transforming artists\u2019 ideas into digital designs ready for printing, and a massive graffiti printer that essentially crawls up and down walls to create the final artwork.\n\nThe robot muralist is the creation of Mihkel Joala. In the video, Joala explains that the contraption consists of two parts \u2014 the print head with up to 12 cans of paint on board, and the lifting mechanism, which uses kevlar cables. The robot also uses a couple of small propellors to give it a little bit of push toward the wall as it shoots millions of dots of paint onto the surface.\n\nKrause said they used various designs from artists around the world while also creating some of them in-house. \u201cWe get a lot of inspiration from Berlin, but also from Tesla\u2019s product and the factory itself,\u201d Krause said. \u201cAll of the artworks take different aspects from the local spirit, and there\u2019s still so much left to do. We\u2019re far from done.\u201d\n\nThe Berlin Gigafactory is Tesla\u2019s first full-scale manufacturing facility in Europe. When it opened three years ago, it marked a significant milestone for the automaker\u2019s expansion into the European market.\n\nThe factory, which produces Model Y vehicles, had faced delays due to administrative and environmental approvals, but it eventually received final approval in March 2022 before opening later that month.",

      "text": "Tesla chief Elon Musk has tweeted a drone video showing the nearly finished Giga Berlin factory, the electric car company\u2019s first such facility in Europe.\nThe video (below), shot recently in snowy conditions, reveals the huge scale of the plant on the 92-hectare site. In another tweet, Musk said that the factory\u2019s large footprint may give it a \u201cflat\u201d appearance in the aerial footage, but in reality, the building is up to five stories high in places.\nSnow falling on Giga Berlin pic.twitter.com/eTXMtYp8hG\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 4, 2021\nSituated 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of the German capital, the factory will employ around 10,000 people and produce the Model Y crossover for the European market, as well as batteries, battery packs, and powertrains for Tesla vehicles. It might also include a \u201cmega rave cave,\u201d if Musk follows through on one of his earlier suggestions.\nTesla wants to fire up the production line later this year, but it could be delayed after a court last month forced it to suspend building work in response to claims by environmental protesters that it could damage the habitat of nearby smooth snakes and sand lizards, both of which are protected species. However, a more recent report suggested Tesla may soon receive the permission it needs to complete the building work and get the facility up and running.\nTesla faced similar protests in early 2020 as it began to clear the site ahead of construction work. Environmentalists persuaded judges to order a suspension of the work to allow time for the proper assessment of potential damage to nearby wildlife and water reserves. The court rejected the protesters\u2019 claims and allowed the clearance work to continue, though last month\u2019s court decision shows that the protestors remain keen to protect parts of the site that are yet to be developed.\nTesla considered various locations for its first European Gigafactory before Musk announced Berlin, Germany, as the preferred choice.\n\u201cEveryone knows that German engineering is outstanding, for sure \u2014 that\u2019s part of the reason why we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany,\u201d Musk said at the time, adding, \u201cWe are also going to create an engineering and design center in Berlin because Berlin has some of the best art in the world.\u201d\nTesla currently has three Gigafactory factories in operation \u2014 two in the U.S. and one in Shanghai, China. Another one currently under construction in Austin, Texas, will produce Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck and semi-truck, as well as the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, when it comes online toward the end of this year."

      "text": "Tesla has shared a time-lapse video showing one of its vehicles in Full Self-driving mode traveling some 360 miles from San Francisco to LA seemingly without any human intervention.\nThe drive (below), which ordinarily takes up to seven hours, also included a stop at a Supercharger station to replenish the car\u2019s battery.\nTo keep within the law, someone is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat the entire way, hands-on-lap and ready to take over control of the car at a moment\u2019s notice if required. Tesla\u2019s setup includes the deployment of a driver-facing camera that checks the person in the driving seat is attentive and looking at the road ahead while the car is in motion.\nThe recent trip demonstrates Tesla\u2019s confidence in FSD\u2019s ability to handle long-distance, complex driving without human intervention, from pulling away to parking up.\nBut despite the progress, FSD remains controversial in some quarters and is not considered fully autonomous by regulatory standards. In California, for example, Tesla\u2019s FSD is still classified as a Level 2 driver assistance system \u2014 where Level 5 is full automation \u2014 that requires driver supervision and readiness to intervene.\nTesla chief Elon Musk revealed last week that the automaker is currently training a a much-improved FSD model that could get a public release by the end of September if testing goes well.\nThe recent supervised drive down the West Coast comes nearly two months after Tesla debuted its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. In those vehicles, no one is sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, though they\u2019re using a version of FSD that\u2019s not yet available to regular Tesla owners.\nTesla also launched a ride-hailing service in San Francisco at the end of July, though the absence of the required permits means it\u2019s unable to call it a \u201crobotaxi\u201d service, and therefore someone needs to be in the driver\u2019s seat during the FSD-powered ride."
