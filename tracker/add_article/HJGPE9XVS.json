      "summary": "Gujarat’s diamond cutting and polishing sector is in an employment crisis after the U.S. raised import tariffs from 10% to 50%, causing nearly 100,000 workers in small units to lose jobs and canceling many export orders. The tariff hike has hit both traditional diamond work and the emerging lab‑grown diamond market, which also faces a 50% tariff. Industry leaders are urging the Indian government to accelerate trade talks, offer export incentives, and seek quicker GST refunds while exploring new markets to offset the loss of U.S. demand. Rajasthan’s gem and jewellery trade is also bracing for similar losses, and even Surat’s large diamond hub may eventually face job cuts if U.S. orders do not resume.",
