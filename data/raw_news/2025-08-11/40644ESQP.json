  "description": "Emma Stone shared a rare update about raising daughter Louise Jean and how motherhood has changed her life and acting career",
  "content": "Emma Stone is an Oscar-winning actress, but her role as mom to daughter Louise Jean is her favorite gig yet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I feel luckier about,\u201d Stone, 36, told Vogue in an interview published on Monday, August 11, of raising her 4-year-old daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s the greatest gift of my life, for sure.\u201d\n\nThe Bugonia actress explained that after welcoming her little girl with husband Dave McCary in March 2021, her approach to acting has changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s streamlined everything,\u201d Stone said, noting that she now has to weigh whether a job will take her away from Louise Jean for a prolonged timeframe. \u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9d thing to say, but it changes everything. And simplifies everything.\u201d\n\nThe La La Land actress also got real about how motherhood has strengthened her skills on camera \u2014 if at all.\n\n\u201cI do think it unlocks different things,\u201d she shared. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s specifically that, but I feel everything I could possibly feel, because everything has exploded.\u201d\n\nStone and McCary, 40, have kept much of their relationship private since they were first linked in 2017 after working together on Saturday Night Live one year prior. The pair\u2019s paths crossed in December 2016 when the actress hosted SNL for the third time and McCary directed one of her sketches.\n\nThe Easy A actress announced their engagement in December 2019, sharing a sweet selfie that highlighted her ring.\n\nLess than one year later, Stone and McCary sparked speculation that they secretly tied the knot earlier in 2020 after they were both seen wearing rings on their left hand.\n\nAs the couple remained quiet about their marital status, Us Weekly confirmed in January 2021 that they were expecting their first baby.\n\n\u201cShe seems very happy and very excited about becoming a mother \u2014 she\u2019s constantly oohing and cooing,\u201d a source exclusively told Us of Stone at the time. \u201cShe looks great, she looks healthy, she\u2019s glowing. She\u2019s been keeping up with friends and work lately, she\u2019s always staying active and gets her daily exercise in.\u201d\n\nNews broke in March 2021 that Stone and McCary had welcomed their little girl, but the pair continued to keep their home life out of the limelight.\n\nHowever, when Stone won her second Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role in 2024 for her part in Poor Things, she gave a shout-out to her daughter.\n\n\u201cI know I have to wrap up, but I really just want to thank my family,\u201d Stone said in March 2024. \u201cMy mom, my brother Spencer, my dad, my husband, Dave, I love you so much. And most importantly, my daughter who is going to be 3 in three days and has turned our lives technicolor. I love you bigger than the whole sky, my girl.\u201d",

      "text": "A pandemic couldn\u2019t stop them from solidifying their love! Emma Stone and her fianc\u00e9, Dave McCary, reportedly tied the knot, according to People.\nThe couple were initially set to exchange vows earlier this year. However, the coronavirus pandemic forced them to postpone their nuptials.\nStone, 31, prompted wedding speculation in May when she made a virtual appearance on Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Hello Sunshine series. In addition to wearing a gold band on her left hand, she gave an interesting reply after her fellow guest, psychiatrist Dr. Harold Koplewicz, mentioned what it is like to \u201cmarry an anxious man.\u201d She responded, \u201cThankfully, I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nEarlier this month, the twosome were spotted wearing gold wedding bands while out for a walk in Los Angeles.\nStone and McCary, 35, announced their engagement in December 2019. The former Saturday Night Live writer shared the happy news by posting an Instagram photo of himself and the Oscar winner showing off her engagement ring. He captioned the shot with a simple pink heart emoji.\nThe couple celebrated their relationship milestone with Amy Schumer, her husband, Chris Fischer, and more friends in New York City in December 2019. \u201cThese people love Times Square year round,\u201d the Trainwreck star, 39, wrote of the group pic, in which the newly engaged pair beamed.\nStone and McCary were first linked in June 2017. Their romance was confirmed by Page Six in October 2017.\nThe Easy A star and the director have kept their relationship relatively private for three years. However, a few instances of PDA cropped up during their outings together.\nThe duo were \u201cattached at the hip\u201d while attending a roller-skating party in Los Angeles in December 2018, according to a source. \u201cThey stood right next to the stage in their skates for all of Haim\u2019s set, dancing together and singing along,\u201d an eyewitness told Us at the time. \u201cAt one point, they slow-danced to a somewhat upbeat song. He initiated and she excitedly followed. They held hands [with] his other hand around her waist and hers around his shoulders.\u201d\nMcCary and the Crazy, Stupid, Love actress were just as flirty while sharing a table with her pal Taylor Swift and the 30-year-old singer\u2019s boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, at a Golden Globes afterparty in January 2019. \u201cEmma and Dave were super touchy-feely and affectionate, which seemed to make Taylor more comfortable doing the same with Joe,\u201d an onlooker revealed. \u201cIt seemed like a very fun and light-hearted date night.\u201d\nStone previously dated her Amazing Spider-Man costar Andrew Garfield on and off from 2011 to 2015. The exes have remained friends since their split."

      "text": "Billy Joel\u2019s ex-wife Elizabeth Weber is opening up about where she stands with the famed singer after their infamous affair and nearly decade-long marriage.\n\u201cIf I wanna talk to him or if I have something to say, I am able to contact him whenever I want to,\u201d Weber exclusively told Us Weekly on Friday, August 8. \u201cBut he has a wife and he has children and right now, he\u2019s struggling with something that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\nIn May, Joel, 76, canceled the remaining dates of his 2025 tour after revealing he had been diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain condition in which an abnormal amount of cerebrospinal fluid builds up, causing walking, memory, balance and bladder control problems.\n\u201cSo, [our relationship] is as close as it needs to be for two people who decided to divorce 40 years ago,\u201d Weber continued, adding that \u201cof course\u201d she reaches out to her ex amid his health diagnosis.\nWeber first met Joel when she was married to his best friend and former bandmate, Jon Small. The pair engaged in a subsequent affair, which led to the band breaking up and Joel battling a severe depression that included two suicide attempts. (The affair and its aftermath were discussed in the two-part HBO documentary Billy Joel: And So It Goes, which premiered in July.)\nThe pair later reconnected after Weber\u2019s divorce and married in 1973, going on to spend nearly 10 years together before ending their marriage in 1982. Joel went on to marry Christie Brinkley in 1985, welcoming daughter Alexa Ray Joel before calling it quits in 1994. Joel then married cookbook author Katie Lee in 2004 \u2014 the pair divorced five years later in 2009. In 2015, Joel married Alex Roderick. The pair share two children, Della Rose Joel and Remy Anne Joel.\nWeber, for her part, shares a son, Sean Weber-Small, with her first husband.\nWhile speaking with Us, Weber said that her son and her grandchildren also know and are even somewhat close to Joel.\n\u201cI have my grandchildren that he knows and they know him,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy granddaughter Ella taught Bill what TikTok was and showed him what was happening. And his relationship with Sean is important to both of them.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cSo, we\u2019re not distant but we\u2019re, you know, and he lives in Florida and I live in California. But it\u2019s all good. \u201c\nWeber said that her son Sean and Joel \u201cwere very close,\u201d adding that during their marriage the three \u201clived on top of the mountain.\u201d\n\u201cWe entertained each other,\u201d she explained. \u201cBill and I worked all day long and the whole writing process was never done \u2014 in the years that Bill and I were together \u2014 was never done remotely or in [a] studio. It happened in our living room, and Sean was an integral part.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org."

      "text": "Game of Thrones wrapped up its eight-season run in 2019, and there have been a few contenders to be the next GoT, including the prequel series House of the Dragon.\nHowever, Amazon Prime Video\u2018s upcoming miniseries King & Conqueror is giving off some serious Game of Thrones vibes, and there isn\u2019t a dragon in sight.\nThis story is based on the conflict between Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror in 1066 for the throne of England.\nWhile only a few previews have been released so far, Watch With Us is sharing three reasons to watch King & Conqueror when it debuts on Prime Video later this year.\nThe \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Connection\nIf you thought William the Conqueror looked familiar in the trailer, you\u2019re not wrong. Game of Thrones\u2018 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau \u2014 who portrayed Jaime Lannister on the series \u2014 is playing William on this show. William is a vastly different character from the one that Coster-Waldau played for eight seasons, but the actor just seems to fit in well within a medieval setting.\nJames Norton is also leading the cast as William\u2019s rival, Harold Godwinson. The rest of the performers include several veteran British actors, including Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy, Emily Beecham, Luther Ford and Eddie Marsan. They may not be household names in America, but that\u2019s a solid cast by any standard.\n\u2018King & Conqueror\u2019 Looks Like It Has High Production Values\nAdmittedly, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of trailers from King & Conqueror yet, so our impressions may change. But even from the early look at the show, it looks like a big budget was spent to bring this show to life in a convincing way.\nEverything from the costumes to the battle scenes suggests that King & Conqueror is going all-out with its production. It may not hit on the same level as last year\u2019s incredible Shogun adaptation, but it seems very promising for now.\nThe Series Will Tackle One of the Most Famous Battles in History\nUnless you\u2019re a student of history, you may not be familiar with the Battle of Hastings. Nearly a thousand years later, that battle is still considered to be one of the bloodiest encounters in English history. William and Harold\u2019s forces met on the battlefield, and the winner went on to rule the country and consolidate their power.\nHistorical details about what happened at the Battle of Hastings are incomplete, and there are also conflicting accounts. So there will probably be some creative liberties taken with it. But we do know how it ends, and it should be entertaining to see this fight play out.\nKing & Conqueror will premiere on Prime Video later this year."

The actress is pregnant with her and Dave McCary\u2019s first child, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.\n\u201cShe seems very happy and very excited about becoming a mother \u2014 she\u2019s constantly oohing and cooing. She looks great, she looks healthy, she\u2019s glowing,\u201d a source tells Us. \u201cShe\u2019s been keeping up with friends and work lately, she\u2019s always staying active and gets her daily exercise in.\u201d\nIn photos obtained by the DailyMail, Stone was spotted cradling her growing baby bump on a walk with a friend in Los Angeles on December 30. She sported all black and a white mask during the outing.\nThe La La Land star, 31, started dating the Saturday Night Live writer and segment director, 35, in October 2017. The couple got engaged two years later.\nMcCary announced the news with an Instagram selfie in December 2019. In the social media upload, the Oscar winner grinned showing off her engagement ring.\nThe couple sparked speculation in May that they had tied the knot when the Arizona native swapped her diamond out for a gold band during an appearance on Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Hello Sunshine series. Four months later, she and McCary were spotted out in L.A. both wearing matching bands. They reportedly tied the knot in September.\nIn August 2018, Stone spoke to Elle about her and the California native\u2019s future family plans. \u201cMy perspective about kids has changed as I\u2019ve gotten older,\u201d the Golden Globe winner told Jennifer Lawrence at the time. \u201cI never babysat or anything. As a teenager, I was, like, \u2018I\u2019m never getting married, I\u2019m never having kids.\u2019 And then I got older and I was, like, \u2018I really want to get married, I really want to have kids.\u2019\u201d\nThe Battle of the Sexes star explained that she changed her mind because of her age, noting, \u201cIt\u2019s the turning 30 thing where you\u2019re, like, \u2018I\u2019m not that young. I\u2019m young, but I\u2019m not that young.\u2019\u201d\nBefore her relationship with McCary, Stone dated her Amazing Spider-Man costar Adam Garfield. The former couple were together from 2010 to 2015.\nThe actor, 37, told Vanity Fair in 2016 that he and his ex-girlfriend still \u201ccare[d] about each other.\u201d The Los Angeles native explained, \u201cThat\u2019s given, that\u2019s kind of an unconditional thing. There\u2019s so much love between us and so much respect. I\u2019m her biggest fan as an artist. So for me, it\u2019s been bliss to be able to watch her success and watch her bloom into the actress that she is. And it\u2019s been wonderful to have that kind of support for each other. It\u2019s nothing but a beautiful thing.\u201d\nHear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!"

That\u2019s just not her,\u201d a source exclusively shares in the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now. \u201cActing is as vital to her as breathing, it\u2019s a part of who she is \u2014 and Dave\u2019s 100 percent behind her.\u201d\nStone, 34, and McCary, 38, met in December 2016 during her stint as a host on Saturday Night Live. (The Easy A actress starred in a sketch that the comedian wrote). They got engaged three years later and secretly tied the knot in 2020.\nLater that year, Stone opened up to Entertainment Tonight about creating a family with McCary. \u201cI feel pretty good about starting my own pack. Although I don\u2019t think that my pack would be quite as physically capable as the Croods are,\u201d she said, referring to her animated movie Croods. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty rough and tumble and I don\u2019t know if my pack would be as rough and tumble.\u201d\nAfter Stone gave birth months later, an insider told Us exclusively that having a baby \u201cbrought them closer in a way they never expected.\u201d The insider added that McCary was very \u201chands-on and helping with their daughter.\u201d\nNow that Stone\u2019s gone back to work, \u201cshe and Dave are happy as a couple and one of the reasons why is they respect each other as artists,\u201d the source tells Us, noting that while being a working mom does have its challenges, Stone has got \u201ca great set-up.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s able to bring Louise to the set with her and that makes a huge difference,\u201d the source continues.

      "text": "New details surrounding the drowning death of Emilie and Brady Kiser\u2019s son Trigg, 3, have emerged following the release of the redacted police report.\nThe documents, obtained by Us Weekly on Friday, August 8, detail the events that led up to Trigg\u2019s death on May 18 after he was pulled unconscious from a pool at the influencer\u2019s home in Arizona.\nAlthough details of the security footage were redacted, the Chandler Police Report noted there were discrepancies between what the footage showed and Brady\u2019s initial recollection of events. The report also noted that the pool was unsecured at the time of the incident and that the toddler was not adequately supervised while outside playing near the uncovered pool and did not know how to swim.\nThe police report noted that Trigg had exited the home without being accompanied by a supervising adult and Brady was \u201caware\u201d that his son was playing outside alone.\nAccording to the report, Brady, 28, told officers at the scene who arrived after he called 911 that Trigg had been out of his sight for around \u201cthree minutes\u201d or \u201cfive minutes\u201d before he saw him in the pool and immediately jumped in to pull him out.\nPer Brady\u2019s statement, he told an officer, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a clock, obviously, I don\u2019t know the exact time, but it was moments, it wasn\u2019t minutes, it was moments, it wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d been out of sight for long.\u201d\nHowever, the police report also noted that the security footage did not appear to line up with Brady\u2019s versions of events. Discrepancies included how long Trigg was outside before Brady checked on him and Brady reporting instances that did not occur on the surveillance camera such as saying he saw Trigg \u201cplaying on the grass.\u201d Due to this, a second interview with Brady was undertaken.\nFollowing the second interview with Brady, the report concluded, \u201cThis tragic incident was the result of [Trigg] being in the backyard unsupervised while playing around the unsecured pool and unable to swim. It is clear from the video that he did not go into the water intentionally, rather he tripped and fell in while playing with an inflatable chair.\u201d\nThe Chandler Police Department conclusion continued: \u201c[Redacted] was in the backyard from 18:29:42 hours until Brady found him in the pool at 18:39:00 hours. He was in the water from 18:32:15 until 18:39:07. It is clear Brady\u2019s attention was divided, and he was not watching at all during the critical times mentioned. During two interviews he did not know what was doing before he fell in and did not see [redacted] struggling to swim.\u201d\nIn other statements to the Chandler Police Department, both Brady and Emilie, 26, noted that Trigg had limited swimming skills.\nBrady told police that Trigg had taken some lessons and \u201cknows how to kick his feet and swing his arms\u2026but he\u2019s not proficient.\u201d He added that his son \u201cknows not to go in the water without us.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Emilie also confirmed Trigg had taken some lessons but \u201cdidn\u2019t fully know how to swim.\u201d She added he knew \u201chow to swim to us and he knew how to climb the wall, but where he fell in there was no wall.\u201d\nThe documents also noted that there was no cover securing the pool at the time of the incident. Brady and Emilie both noted they usually use a \u201cKatchakid\u201d safety net, but this was not in place at the time of the incident. In addition, the documents noted there were four access doors to the backyard and the alarm systems did not sound on any of them, none were self-closing and one appeared to be malfunctioning.\nThe Chandler Police Department also included its reasons for submitting the case to Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office for a review into child abuse with criminal negligence claims.\n\u201cThis conclusion is based on several factors. Brady knew the pool net was not on the pool. He knew [redacted] was in the backyard and didn\u2019t know how to swim. According to video evidence, [redacted] was in the backyard unsupervised for more than nine minutes, and in the water for about seven of those minutes,\u201d the report read. \u201cBrady\u2019s statements do not match what is seen on the video; he did not accurately describe one thing did after he went outside. This leads to the conclusion that Brady was not aware of what was doing and was not watching him. The combination of these factors led to drowning, and a remedy to any of the contributing circumstances could have prevented the outcome.\u201d\nThe Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office released a statement on July 25, announcing Brady will not face child abuse charges due to there being \u201cno likelihood of conviction\u201d following review of the evidence.\n\u201cEvery case submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney\u2019s Office is evaluated using the same standard: whether there is a \u2018reasonable likelihood of conviction,\u2019\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAfter careful review of the evidence submitted by Chandler PD, it was determined this case does not meet that standard. MCAO\u2019s review of the case involved the attorneys assigned to it, along with highly experienced senior attorneys and the County Attorney herself.\u201d\nBrady\u2019s attorney Flynn Carey responded to the update in the case via a statement shared with multiple outlets at the time.\n\u201cWe are grateful to law enforcement and the county attorney for conducting a thorough investigation and confirming that this was a tragic accident,\u201d the statement read.\u201cBrady remains in the midst of the grieving process and is thankful to be with his family as they heal together. We appreciate the compassion and support shown during this difficult time.\u201d"

      "text": "Emma Stone and husband Dave McCary kept their romance relatively under wraps before welcoming their first child in March 2021.\nStone previously dated Andrew Garfield, with whom she appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and its 2014 sequel. The costars were together for four years until Us Weekly confirmed in October 2015 that they had called it quits.\nThe next year, Stone hosted Saturday Night Live for the third time. At that point, McCary had been working behind-the-scenes at the NBC sketch comedy series for three seasons, having joined as a segment producer in 2013 alongside buddies Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett. The California native directed the Maniac actress in a digital short titled \u201cWells for Boys.\u201d\nSparks seemingly flew between the two, but it wasn\u2019t until October 2017 that their relationship was confirmed. Four months earlier, they were spotted leaving the premiere of Brigsby Bear, a comedy-drama directed by McCary and produced by Andy Samberg\u2018s The Lonely Island.\nBy December 2019, the pair were engaged. Us broke the news in January 2021 that Stone was pregnant, several months after the couple quietly tied the knot.\nA source exclusively told Us that McCary gave his wife \u201call his energy and love\u201d throughout her pregnancy, adding, \u201cHe caters to her left and right and treats her like a true queen, which she deserves.\u201d\nScroll down to relive the couple\u2019s whirlwind romance:"

      "text": "On a gray New York City morning, Emma Stone steps inside a quiet breakfast spot downtown, and you can feel the ions in the room begin to stir. Service, heretofore professional, notches up a tick. The manager and someone who appears to be the manager\u2019s manager stop at our table\u2014How are you, good to see you, what can I get you, okay, perfect, of course, right away. Everything comes right away, because it\u2019s Emma Stone, and you or I would do the same.\nWho doesn\u2019t adore or at least admire Stone? In an acrimonious era during which it\u2019s near impossible to achieve critical unity on any being or concept\u2014even Stevie Wonder and sunny afternoons have their antagonists\u2014the 36-year-old actress and producer has reached a rare altitude of public goodwill.\nMaybe it\u2019s because Stone\u2019s really good at what she does for a living, like double-Oscar good. Maybe it\u2019s because she keeps taking devilish risks with outr\u00e9 collaborators like auteur Yorgos Lanthimos and pilot Nathan Fielder. Maybe it\u2019s because, despite all of her plaudits, Stone remains Emily\u2014a self-deprecating, anxious girl from the Arizona suburbs who regularly worries the whole thing\u2019s about to fall apart, and would never use the word plaudits.\nStone settles into our table wearing a Silk Laundry vest over a white T-shirt, Agolde jeans with Common Projects sneakers, and if you think I had to ask her to tell me all those things, bingo. (She offers a cheeky rundown: \u201cFor the record, they\u2019re long black jeans, kind of a wide leg\u2026.\u201d)\nHer red hair is short and still growing out\u2014\u201cPretty slowly for how long it\u2019s been,\u201d she says\u2014from a film for which she dramatically shaved her head. (More on that in a sec.) She orders a croissant and what appears to be a bottomless cup of coffee and congratulates me when I turn down a refill.\n\u201cI\u2019m so impressed,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m such a caffeine freak.\u201d\nI\u2019ve known Stone for a little while. The first time I wrote about her for this magazine was in 2014, when we went to an LA mall and visited two iconic Vogue haunts, Build-a-Bear and Hot Dog on a Stick. The second time was in 2016, just before La La Land, which would go on to win the Academy Award for best picture for approximately two minutes. Stone, of course, won best actress\u2014and got to keep that one.\nStone\u2019s acting career has only flourished further since. There was Battle of the Sexes, in which Stone played Billie Jean King and attained a respectable volley. There was The Favourite, the first of four films so far with Lanthimos, the absurdist Greek director who would conspire with Stone on her most daring role, the randy, reanimated Bella Baxter of 2023\u2019s Poor Things, for which she won a second Oscar. Stone and Lanthimos\u2019s next film, the rivetingly unhinged Bugonia, arrives in October.\nAlong the way was a Zombieland sequel, a TV drama called Maniac with old pal Jonah Hill, a wild Lanthimos triptych called Kinds of Kindness, the meta series The Curse with Fielder, and Cruella, the finest 101 Dalmatians\u2013inspired fashion saga ever made\u2014and if you disagree, my daughter and I will chase you with sticks.\nMeanwhile there have been bright developments in Stone\u2019s personal life. A lifelong Saturday Night Live obsessive and a five-time host, Stone would meet and begin dating Dave McCary, an SNL writer-director. The pair, who are now producing partners, would confirm their engagement in 2019. The following year, Stone would marry into the Studio 8H mafia, wearing a dress designed by her close friend (and Louis Vuitton women\u2019s artistic director) Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2014plus a black eye she gave herself after yanking a handle off a refrigerator door.\n\u201cTruly a cosmic joke,\u201d Stone says. \u201cWhose refrigerator handle breaks off while opening it?\u201d\nMost profoundly: In March 2021, Stone and McCary welcomed a child, Louise Jean, her middle name shared with her mother. Three years later Stone would memorably thank her daughter from the Academy Awards stage for turning her parents\u2019 lives \u201cTechnicolor.\u201d\nMotherhood, marriage, movies, two Oscars, Saturday Night Live, producing, a self-inflicted black eye from a fridge handle\u2014it\u2019s been an audacious stretch.\nWhere does one begin?\nI agree completely. Let\u2019s talk about Emma Stone\u2019s shaved head.\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t want her to shave her head,\u201d Stone\u2019s longtime close friend Jennifer Lawrence writes by email. \u201cI had already lived through the Billie Jean King haircut.\u201d\nHere\u2019s our scenario, and I promise I\u2019m not spoiling anything: In Bugonia, Stone\u2019s character is a pharmaceutical CEO who\u2019s kidnapped by a pair of conspiracy theorists played by Jesse Plemons and newcomer Aidan Delbis. The two men believe their hostage\u2019s hair must go, and so they shave her head, with an electric clipper, in the back seat of a stolen Range Rover. This is all done on film, with zero CGI\u2014those are Stone\u2019s actual locks, spilling onto the leather interior.\nStone is not the first high-profile actress to go head-shaven for a part, of course. Natalie Portman did it for V for Vendetta; Charlize Theron for Mad Max: Fury Road; and please don\u2019t make me explain what a big deal it was when Demi Moore buzzed for G.I. Jane.\nStill, it\u2019s a massive show of commitment, which was not lost on Plemons and the Bugonia gang when the moment arrived. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Here we go\u2014Emily has shaved her head,\u2019 \u201d Plemons says. \u201cWe better make this good!\u201d\nStone loved it. \u201cNo better feeling in the world,\u201d she says of the cut, which, in case you\u2019re mulling it, deployed a 1.5-millimeter blade. (\u201cThe first shower when you\u2019ve shaved your head? Oh my God, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d she says, sounding like Laird Hamilton raving about the curls at Teahupo\u2018o.) Stone had no hesitation\u2014and she did get to shave Lanthimos\u2019s head first\u2014but admits that, right before, she burst into tears in her trailer. Years ago, Stone\u2019s mother, Krista, lost her hair during treatment for breast cancer. \u201cShe actually did something brave,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cI\u2019m just shaving my head.\u201d\nTurns out Krista Stone was envious. \u201cMy mom was like, \u2018I\u2019m so jealous. I want to shave my head again.\u2019 \u201d\nBugonia\u2014based on a 2003 South Korean film called Save the Green Planet!\u2014is an intense movie shot within tightly confined spaces, one of which is the basement of a rural house. For long stretches, Lanthimos, working with Poor Things cinematographer Robbie Ryan, trains the camera directly on Stone\u2019s face and shorn scalp. The effect is mesmerizing, almost feral.\n\u201cHonestly, she looked beautiful,\u201d writes Lawrence. \u201cShe pulled it off.\u201d\nDuring filming, Stone wore hats in public and turned up at the New York Film Festival in a wig. Her shorter mane was praised as a style move at awards season\u2014\u201cEmma Stone Debuts Pixie Cut at Golden Globes,\u201d read one headline. The secret came out when a Bugonia teaser arrived with a shot of clippers digging into Stone\u2019s scalp.\nStone misses it, honestly. \u201cI was bummed I wasn\u2019t going out with it,\u201d she says. \u201cJust straight-up bald. I think that would have been fun.\u201d\nAlright. Enough about the hair.\nThen again, cutting off all her hair is emblematic of what Stone\u2019s done with acting: See the sharpest turn and swerve right into it.\nThere\u2019s a version of Stone\u2019s career in which, year after year, she signs up for action capers and romantic comedies in which she plays, I don\u2019t know, a narcoleptic lawyer who can\u2019t get a second date.\nInstead, she\u2019s taken a riskier path. This is most evident in her extended partnership with Lanthimos, a 51-year-old filmmaker pathologically averse to standard Hollywood fare. In Stone, he\u2019s found a kindred spirit. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can be any other way,\u201d Lanthimos says. \u201cShe wants to be excited by the stuff that she does, to try different things. It\u2019s more about the experience for her.\u201d\nNowhere was this clearer than in Poor Things, the Mary Shelley\u2013inspired Victorian romp in which Stone played a dead-by-suicide pregnant woman reanimated with the brain of her own baby, and gang, that\u2019s just the half of it. Stone\u2019s performance\u2014Bella wobbling like a toddler, then voyaging into adult independence, self-discovery, and a libertine sexual awakening\u2014was unlike anything she\u2019d done.\n\u201cWhen it was going out into the world, I was like, I have no idea what people are going to say about this,\u201d Stone recalls. \u201cI started to get scared, but then I was like: There\u2019s nothing you can do. Yorgos and I have talked a lot about this. There\u2019s no reason to be prescriptive to an audience about what it should like and not like. If you don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s fine. If it\u2019s not for you, that\u2019s okay.\u201d\nAudiences went amok for Poor Things\u2014the film grossed $117 million worldwide, making it Lanthimos\u2019s biggest hit and a crazy uncle in the cookie-cutter multiplex. Plotwise, Bugonia is a 180 pivot, but it\u2019s just as provocative, a meaty rumination on modern conspiracy theorizing, medical-industry corruption, and obsessions like extraterrestrials, and again gang, that\u2019s just the half of it.\n\u201cThe more challenging it gets, the more I like it,\u201d says Stone, who also appeared this summer in Eddington, writer-director Ari Aster\u2019s bonkers riff on COVID-era American paranoia. \u201cIf you\u2019re not growing or pushing yourself to different places\u2014and I feel it\u2019s the same for most people in almost any job\u2014you get stagnant.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all a long way from making tiramisu with Jonah Hill in home-economics class. Stone often credits legendary casting director Allison Jones for her breakthrough as Hill\u2019s sharp-witted Superbad crush, Jules. Jones remembers Stone well: She first encountered Stone as a teenager, when she and Lawrence (brought in by another casting director) tested for the same part in a comedy pilot. Stone and Lawrence were often up for the same things; neither got this one, and the sitcom never went to series.\n\u201cShe was a young Shirley MacLaine, even as a teenager,\u201d Jones emails, recalling Stone\u2019s \u201craspy voice and her ability to \u2018get the joke,\u2019 \u201d which made an impression at a Superbad table read.\nJesse Plemons, who first worked with Stone on Kinds of Kindness, says Stone was an invaluable guide to Yorgos World, where extensive rehearsals and acting exercises are part of the cast\u2019s bonding process. \u201cSeeing her throw herself into these exercises and games gives you more confidence to do the same,\u201d Plemons says. \u201cShe takes the work seriously\u2014but not herself too seriously.\u201d\nLawrence believes two Oscars make Stone \u201cundeniable\u201d\u2014even if Stone doesn\u2019t see it that way. A winner herself, Lawrence was onstage at the Dolby Theatre for Stone\u2019s second triumph, when co-presenter Michelle Yeoh gracefully passed the statue over so the two friends could have a moment.\n\u201cIn true Emily form, as soon as we got offstage and ran into the bathroom to scream and cry,\u201d Lawrence writes, \u201cI whispered, Two-time best-actress winner, and she replied, \u2018I feel like that\u2019s bad, though.\u2019 \u201d\nThis is the Stone her close friends know and love\u2014even in exultant moments, always worrying that the other shoe is going to drop. \u201cAlways, always, always,\u201d Stone says. Such anxiety might encourage career caution, but Stone has prioritized a more radical path, pursuing partnerships where trust and familiarity allow her to take chances. \u201cWhen you find people you really have a shorthand with,\u201d she says, \u201cto me, that\u2019s the dream.\u201d\nSimilarly adventurous is Stone\u2019s almost decade-long professional collaboration with Ghesqui\u00e8re and Louis Vuitton. Stone and Ghesqui\u00e8re met at the Met Gala in 2012, introduced by the late Lanvin designer Alber Elbaz, who made Stone a red minidress embroidered with crystal flowers.\n\u201cIt was the best introduction possible\u2014she was so sweet, so charismatic,\u201d says Ghesqui\u00e8re, who designed all the fashion for the images accompanying this story, which were photographed at the Palais des Papes in Avignon. Here, for Stone and Vogue, the acclaimed designer has ventured into the exacting discipline of handmade fashion\u2014akin to French couture.\n\u201cCouture is about experimentation, which she loves,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re says. He calls it \u201ca story in my head, a movie that doesn\u2019t exist in which she is the lead character.\u201d\nGhesqui\u00e8re and Stone have proven to be an auspicious match\u2014he arrived at Vuitton just as Stone ascended to the Hollywood mountaintop. A dedicated movie fan (he has a soft spot for Stone\u2019s early Crazy, Stupid, Love), Ghesqui\u00e8re has been inspired by her onscreen performances. For Stone\u2019s public appearances around Poor Things, he drew on costume designer Holly Waddington\u2019s Oscar-winning creations, in one instance pairing a blue midi-dress with a scrunchy robe that mimicked Bella Baxter\u2019s exaggerated shoulder lines.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a fashion addict,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re says of Stone. At the same time, \u201cShe loves the quality of the clothes, the fabric, the craftsmanship. She\u2019s curious about the way things are done. It\u2019s a very inspiring exchange\u2014like a tennis match where we keep sending things to each other.\u201d\n\u201cNicolas is just somebody you can sit, have dinner with, talk about life and everything going on,\u201d Stone says. \u201cThe only relationship I had like that with a designer was with Alber, who I miss terribly. He was so human and loving. Nicolas has that kind of humanity to him.\u201d\nStone points out that she and Ghesqui\u00e8re both have partners from San Diego\u2014McCary grew up there, as did Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s partner, Drew Kuhse\u2014and also share a sense of humor. This helped at the 2024 Oscars, when Stone realized on her way to accepting her statue for Poor Things that her strapless tulip-shaped Vuitton dress had broken a zipper.\nGhesqui\u00e8re, watching on TV, was aghast. But Stone joked onstage\u2014\u201cI think it happened during \u2018I\u2019m Just Ken,\u2019 \u201d she said, referring to old pal Ryan Gosling\u2019s Barbie musical performance\u2014and turned the mishap into self-effacing magic. \u201cIt was human,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re says. \u201cThe whole thing for me, that accident, was quite beautiful,\u201d he continues, before adding: \u201cNow we make sure we make solid zippers.\u201d\nFor Stone and McCary\u2019s small outdoor wedding in 2020, Ghesqui\u00e8re created both Stone\u2019s wedding dress and a feathered reception minidress, the latter of which she didn\u2019t wear because social-distance rules precluded a real party. She decided to give it an encore at the 2022 Met Gala.\n\u201cThat dress was a lifetime memory,\u201d Ghesqui\u00e8re says. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have a friend like that.\u201d\nStone-McCary is a union born of Saturday Night Live\u2014in 2016, McCary, then a staff writer, directed her in a satirical commercial called \u201cWells for Boys,\u201d in which Stone played the doting mother of a comically sensitive son. Their relationship went public with a courtside appearance at an LA Clippers game in early 2019. The couple remain devoted sports fans, Stone converting McCary into a supporter of her beloved Phoenix Suns; McCary turning Stone into a die-hard for the San Diego Padres.\nSNL remains a through line. Stone describes herself as an SNL \u201cWAG,\u201d and has been part of the show for a long time, says its creator, Lorne Michaels. \u201cSo when you see her at the studio, you\u2019re not surprised. She\u2019s completely comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cAll my heroes growing up were SNL people,\u201d says Stone. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m not \u2018cast member\u2019 material.\u201d (Michaels disagrees: \u201cOh yeah\u2014she\u2019s a star. That was evident early.\u201d)\nFor SNL\u2019s 50th anniversary in February, Stone did a jump-kick onstage with Molly Shannon\u2019s quinquagenarian Sally O\u2019Malley, and her dress, designed by Ghesqui\u00e8re, had hip-side popcorn buckets as an homage to the kernel-loving Michaels.\nToday, Stone and McCary have a joint production company, Fruit Tree. Like Stone\u2019s acting choices, Fruit Tree\u2019s slate is impossible to pigeonhole: three films from longtime Stone friend Jesse Eisenberg, who refers to Stone as his \u201cfairy godmother\u201d; comedies with Julio Torres; a raw documentary called The Yogurt Shop Murders. The company also coproduced The Curse, which brought Stone together with Fielder (who wrote the series with Benny Safdie). She\u2019s a massive fan of Fielder\u2019s other series The Rehearsal. \u201cI want him to win a Nobel,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI\u2019m drawn to material that asks more questions than gives you answers,\u201d Stone says. \u201cI think critical thinking is the most valuable resource that a person can have, and I like that feeling of being asked to answer things for myself.\u201d At Eisenberg\u2019s urging, Stone recently dove into When We Cease to Understand the World, Benjam\u00edn Labatut\u2019s 2020 book on morality and science. When we speak, she\u2019s halfway through Edith Wharton\u2019s The Custom of the Country.\nStone and McCary, who are based in New York City, turn up at red carpets now and then, and there\u2019s a 300 percent chance of finding them at the ballpark when the Padres are in town\u2014but otherwise, they lead a low-key city life. Stone, who made her Broadway debut as Sally Bowles in Cabaret in 2014, raves over Cole Escola\u2019s Tony-winning Oh, Mary! about Mary Todd Lincoln, and is very open to theater again. (A role she covets down the road: Martha in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?)\nShe famously avoids posting on social media\u2014you won\u2019t find her chugging out TikToks\u2014and is far more likely to be making pumpkin oatmeal cookies or watching Bluey with Louise Jean, who\u2019s now four. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I feel luckier about,\u201d she says of her daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s the greatest gift of my life, for sure.\u201d (As for Bluey, she champions the canonical second-season episode \u201cSleepytime.\u201d)\n\u201cMotherhood can be so difficult, and she\u2019s handling it with grace,\u201d says Martha MacIsaac, the actress who played Becca, friend to Stone\u2019s Jules in Superbad. MacIsaac has two children, and she and Stone have stayed close: \u201cI FaceTimed her during both of my labors. Her medical advice is very sound.\u201d\nMotherhood now impacts Stone\u2019s creative choices. \u201cIt\u2019s streamlined everything,\u201d she says. She now asks herself if a job is worth it\u2014spending months away, not seeing her daughter for long stretches on set. \u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9d thing to say, but it changes everything. And simplifies everything.\u201d\nHas being a parent made her better at what she does\u2014has it opened deeper emotional registers as an actor?\nShe pauses for a moment.\n\u201cI do think it unlocks different things,\u201d Emma Stone says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s specifically that, but I feel everything I could possibly feel, because everything has exploded.\u201d\nIn this story: hair, Mara Roszak using R\u014cZ hair; makeup, Pat McGrath; tailors, Francesca Camugli and Michael Morgado; manicurist, Emi Kudo.

      "text": "The official cause of death for Kelly Clarkson\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Blackstock, has been confirmed.\nSilver Bow County Coroner Dan Hollis told Us Weekly on Monday, August 11, that Blackstock\u2019s cause of death was melanoma, a form of skin cancer, and the manner of his death was natural causes. \u201cBrandon Blackstock passed away peacefully at his home in Butte, Montana on August 7th under hospice care surrounded by his family,\u201d Hollis said in a statement.\nBlackstock died on August 7 after privately battling cancer for three years. He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a family rep told Us in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, Clarkson, 43, alerted fans to Blackstock\u2019s illness when she put her Las Vegas residency on pause, though she didn\u2019t reveal the nature of his condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she announced via Instagram on August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock wed in October 2013 and went on to welcome daughter River, 11, and son Remington, 9. During their marriage, Blackstock worked as the singer\u2019s manager. Clarkson ultimately filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years. The pair finalized the proceedings in March 2022 following a messy legal battle.\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The exes shared daughter Savannah, 23, and son Seth, 18.\nIn January 2022, Blackstock became a first-time grandfather when Savannah gave birth to her and now-husband Quentin Lee\u2019s son, Lake. Savannah announced in July that the couple are expecting their second baby.\nOutside of his marriage to Clarkson, Brandon had another Hollywood connection via his father, Narvel Blackstock, who was Clarkson\u2019s manager earlier in her career. Narvel was previously married to Reba McEntire from 1989 to 2015, during which time she was stepmom to Brandon and his two sisters, Chassidy and Shawna. Narvel and McEntire\u2019s son, Shelby, who was born in 1990, was Brandon\u2019s half-brother."

      "text": "Emma Stone was crowned the Best Actress in a Leading Role winner at the 2024 Oscars for her performance in Poor Things, and she gave a special shout-out to her family.\n\u201cI know I have to wrap up, but I really just want to thank my family,\u201d Stone, 35, said toward the end of her acceptance speech on Sunday, March 10. \u201cMy mom, my brother Spencer, my dad, my husband, Dave [McCary], I love you so much. And most importantly, my daughter who is going to be 3 in three days and has turned our lives technicolor. I love you bigger than the whole sky, my girl.\u201d\nStone was nominated alongside Nyad\u2019s Annette Bening, Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019s Lily Gladstone, Anatomy of a Fall\u2019s Sandra H\u00fcller and Maestro\u2019s Carey Mulligan at the awards show, which was held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday.\n\u201cThis is really overwhelming,\u201d the winner said as she initially took the stage. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m \u2014 OK, my voice is also a little gone. Whatever. The women on the stage, you are all incredible, and the women in this category, Sandra, Annette, Carey, Lily, I share this with you. I\u2019m in awe of you. It\u2019s been such an honor to do all of this together, I hope we get to keep doing more together. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\nStone found her words while thinking about Poor Things director Yorgos Lanthimos\u2018 advice.\n\u201cThe other night, I was panicking \u2014 as you can kind of see, happens a lot \u2014 that maybe something like this could happen and Yorgos said to me, \u2018Please take yourself out of it.\u2019 And he was right, because it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about a team that came together to make something greater than the sum of its parts.\u201d\nShe went on to thank her cast, crew and director. \u201cYorgos, thank you for the gift of a lifetime in Bella Baxter,\u201d she gushed. \u201cI\u2019m forever thankful for you. Thank you for inviting all of us to be members of this team. Thank you.\u201d\nAhead of the ceremony, Stone was the only previous Academy Award winner in the category after earning Best Actress for La La Land in 2017. Her other past nominations include Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Birdman in 2015 and The Favourite in 2019, while she was also up for Best Picture this year for her work as a producer on Poor Things.\nBening, 65, has been nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role on three other occasions: for American Beauty in 2000, Being Julia in 2005 and The Kids Are All Right in 2011. She also received a nod for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for The Grifters in 1991. Mulligan, 38, similarly earned nominations for Best Actress in a Leading Role for An Education in 2010 and Promising Young Woman in 2021.\nFor Gladstone, 37, and H\u00fcller, 45, this marked their first-ever Oscar nods.\nGladstone has been a 2024 awards-season favorite. In January, she won Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama at the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, defeating Bening, Mulligan, H\u00fcller, Priscilla\u2019s Cailee Spaeny and Past Lives\u2019 Greta Lee. The following month, she bested Stone, Bening, Mulligan and Barbie\u2019s Margot Robbie in the Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role category at the 2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to distance ourselves. It\u2019s so easy to close off, to stop feeling, and we all bravely keep feeling, and that humanizes people. That brings people out of the shadows; it brings visibility,\u201d Gladstone said in her SAG acceptance speech. \u201cThank you for all of the compassionate souls in this room and all of the storytellers here tonight. Keep speaking your truths, and keep speaking up for each other.\u201d\nAlthough Gladstone beat Stone at the SAG Awards, Stone was not without a victory of her own, winning Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy against Robbie, Fallen Leaves\u2019 Alma P\u00f6ysti, The Color Purple\u2019s Fantasia Barrino, No Hard Feelings\u2019 Jennifer Lawrence and May December\u2019s Natalie Portman at the Golden Globes.\nStone noted in her acceptance speech that she views Poor Things as a romantic comedy, \u201cin the sense of Bella falls in love with life itself, rather than a person. She accepts the good and the bad in equal measure, and that really made me look at life differently. All of it counts, and all of it is important.\u201d"

The actress has given birth to her and Dave McCary\u2019s first child, according to TMZ.\nNews broke on Thursday, March 25, that the couple welcomed their little one on March 13 in Los Angeles.\nUs Weekly exclusively confirmed in January that the Battle of the Sexes star, 32, was pregnant. \u201cShe seems very happy and very excited about becoming a mother \u2014 she\u2019s constantly oohing and cooing,\u201d a source told Us at the time. \u201cShe looks great, she looks healthy, she\u2019s glowing. She\u2019s been keeping up with friends and work lately, she\u2019s always staying active and gets her daily exercise in.\u201d\nThe Arizona native was spotted cradling her baby bump in a black top on a Los Angeles walk with a friend that same week.\nThe Oscar winner previously spoke to Jennifer Lawrence about her desire to start a family in an August 2018 Elle interview.\n\u201cMy perspective about kids has changed as I\u2019ve gotten older,\u201d Stone explained to the Hunger Games star, 30, at the time. \u201cI never babysat or anything. As a teenager, I was, like, \u2018I\u2019m never getting married, I\u2019m never having kids.\u2019 And then I got older and I was, like, \u2018I really want to get married, I really want to have kids.\u2019\u201d\nTurning 30 changed the Maniac alum\u2019s mind, she added. \u201cYou\u2019re, like, \u2018I\u2019m not that young.

While McCary sported a classic black tuxedo, the actress stunned in a red-hot crimson Louis Vuitton gown with her newly cut pixie \u2018do. Stone\u2019s custom frock had pockets to hold a popcorn snack.\nSunday is the star-studded celebration of SNL\u2019s milestone 50th anniversary. Stone and McCary famously met when she hosted a 2016 episode of SNL.\n\u201cI have made so many memories here and so many friends and I even met my husband here at SNL,\u201d she recalled in her December 2023 opening monologue. \u201cI know he\u2019s pretty camera-shy, he\u2019s not a performer, but it\u2019s such a special night for us.\u201d\nDuring Stone\u2019s SNL debut, McCary directed her sketch \u201cWells for Boys\u201d \u2014 and they were romantically linked several months later.

Their daughter, Louise, was born in March 2021.\nBecoming a parent has since shifted Stone\u2019s entire worldview.\n\u201cI know I have to wrap up, but I really just want to thank my family,\u201d Stone said in March 2024 during her Oscars acceptance speech. \u201cMy mom, my brother Spencer, my dad, my husband, Dave I love you so much.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cAnd most importantly, my daughter who is going to be 3 in three days and has turned our lives technicolor. I love you bigger than the whole sky, my girl.\u201d\nA source told Us one year earlier that Stone was \u201cgrateful\u201d to be a working mother.\n\u201cFor Emma, quitting acting and being a stay-at-home mom would be like cutting off one of her limbs. That\u2019s just not her,\u201d the insider exclusively said in September 2023. \u201cActing is as vital to her as breathing, it\u2019s a part of who she is \u2014 and Dave\u2019s 100 percent behind her.\u201d\nAccording to the insider, Stone also enjoys bringing her daughter to work.\n\u201cShe\u2019s able to bring Louise to the set with her and that makes a huge difference,\u201d the source added. \u201cThere is no shortage of people in her circle willing to help with Louise \u2014 and Emma is grateful to them.\u201d"
