      "feedback": "**Actionable feedback (compact paragraph):**  \n1. **Add inline citations** – every substantive claim (e.g., “CPI above 3.5 % will support the dollar by 0.2–0.4 %”, “Trump’s 100 % semiconductor tariff adds risk‑premium support”, “Ukrainian war persistence feeds safe‑haven demand”) must be followed by a citation to the article ID (XTQIQRP5K).  \n2. **Quantify all ranges** – replace vague “moderate” or “significant” with precise bp or % ranges (e.g., “0.2–0.4 %”, “0.05–0.1 %”).  \n3. **Ensure causal chain clarity** – explicitly state the transmission path: CPI → Fed policy → UST 10‑yr yield → dollar‑Euro yield differential → DXY movement.  \n4. **Remove extraneous asset mentions** – keep focus on the dollar; if USDJPY or euro are mentioned, tie them directly to the dollar’s movement and cite the article.  \n5. **Include specific catalyst dates** – e.g., “June‑July CPI release on 2025‑08‑15” and “Fed minutes on 2025‑08‑16” to anchor the timeline.  \n6. **Avoid generic statements** – replace “risk‑premium support” with the specific tariff details from the article.  \n7. **Add a watch‑list signal list** – bullet‑point the key catalysts with dates and expected impact, each with a citation.  \n8. **Confirm all numbers come from the source** – double‑check that the 0.2–0.4 % range, 0.05–0.1 % tariff effect, and 0.1–0.15 % war‑risk effect are supported by the article’s figures or implied data.  \n9. **Maintain the 3–6‑month horizon** – ensure all scenarios and magnitude ranges are framed within this period.  \n10. **Re‑phrase any ambiguous wording** – e.g., “sustained tariff policy” → “continued 100 % semiconductor tariff as announced on 2025‑08‑11”.",
