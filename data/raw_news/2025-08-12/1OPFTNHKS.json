  "description": "Astrid, 4, died after she was shot in the back of her grandparents' car outside a target in Austin, seconds after her grandfather Adam Chow, 65, was gunned down, allegedly by Ethan Blaine Nieneker, 32.",
  "content": "A crazed gunman allegedly shot dead a little girl in front of her grandmother seconds after murdering her grandpa in a rampage through a Target.\n\nAdam Chow, 65, and his four-year-old granddaughter were gunned down in the parking lot, along with Target worker Hector Leopoldo Martinez Machuca, 24.\n\nEthan Blaine Nieneker, 32, was subdued by police tasers as he ran naked out of a 'porta potty' after he fled the store in northern Austin on Monday.\n\nChief Lisa Davis alleged at a press conference on Tuesday that Nieneker first 'randomly' shot Machuca about 2.15pm as he collected trolleys.\n\nThe Hawaiian shirt-wearing gunman then fired at a black jeep that tried to evade his shot, before turning his gun on Chow's grey Toyota 4-Runner.\n\nChow was shot in the driver's seat, then Nieneker fired into the back seats - hitting the granddaughter Astrid, Davis alleged.\n\nThe mortally wounded grandfather's wife Doris tried to carry the girl to safety, when Nieneker pushed them out of the car and drove away.\n\nAustin homicide detective Nathan Sexton said Nieneker chose his victims 'completely randomly' and used a handgun given to him by a family member.\n\n'He said that he was Jesus and there was no real reason whatsoever given,' he said.\n\nAbout 2.20pm he pulled up next to a water truck parked by the side of the Mopac Expressway, allegedly bashed its driver, and pulled him out of the vehicle.\n\nNieneker tried to drive the truck away but wasn't able to, instead chasing the truck driver away with his pistol before returning to the Toyota.\n\nFive minutes later he crashed into a Volkswagen before landing on top of an Infiniti SUV, then allegedly attacked and carjacked the Volkswagen driver.\n\nNieneker only drove that car until 2.34pm when he tried to steal a Waymo car, but failed and got back in the Volkswagen.\n\nMinutes later, a church acquaintance of Nieneker claimed a brick came flying through the window of his house on La Casa Drive after the gunman threw it.\n\nNieneker's alleged rampage continued until 2.58pm when he was spotted walking naked through a backyard down the street from the one he bricked.\n\nHe was seen running into a 'porta potty', then running away again before police found him, still nude and holding a Bible, and demanded he surrender.\n\nWhen he refused, police fired their tasers and he was arrested at 3.06pm.\n\n'The investigation shows that Nieneker conducted these violent offenses of shooting at multiple victims, killing three victims, and destroying multiple vehicles, in the span of less than one hour,' police said.\n\nChow was pronounced dead at the scene at 2.39pm and his granddaughter at. 2.50pm. Doris only suffered minor injuries.\n\nNieneker was charged with two counts of capital murder for Chow and his granddaughter first-degree felony murder of Machuca.\n\nHis booking photo at the Travis County Jail showed him staring straight at the camera with several fresh cuts on his face.\n\nSexton said Nieneker gave no motive for the shooting and his state of mind at the time was still being investigated.\n\n'We\u2019re still looking into the drug portion of it. He could have been under the influence of narcotics, it might not necessarily be all attributed to mental illness, so we\u2019re still investigating all of that,' he said.\n\nDavis admitted there were failures by authorities to follow up on mental health callouts, which may have prevented the shooting.\n\n'This man had some serious issues, and I think about the systems that failed... there were some serious failures here,' she said.\n\nNieneker had two emergency mental health detentions of up to 72 hours in 2018, but was not committed either time.\n\nHow Nieneker got the gun, which he left in Chow's car, from a relative is being investigated, and could lead to charges against his family.\n\n'Where does someone with this capacity to do this get a weapon and when does a family members feel comfortable giving someone with these issues a weapon?' Davis said.\n\nNieneker lived alone and worked at a nearby restaurant, police said.\n\nDavis said police received calls about the shooting 15 minutes after it began and rushed to the scene within four minutes.\n\nSocial media photos of Nieneker showed him grinning with friends at social events, posing while wearing a Covid-style mask by a trash bin, and posing beside a fireplace.\n\nAnother Facebook image showed the alleged gunman holding a large brown leaf in front of his face and creepily peering over it, and a fifth photo had Nieneker wearing an American flag as a bandana.\n\nDavis told reporters on Monday evening that Nieneker has a history of mental illness and a prior criminal history.\n\nRecords obtained by the Daily Mail showed he was arrested numerous times since 2011, serving short stints in jail for some of them.\n\nNieneker began with two days in jail for marijuana possession in 2011, then two years probation (which was later revoked) for felony criminal mischief.\n\nJust five weeks later, he was jailed for 120 days for a DWI, and two family violence charges were dismissed.\n\nThe next year he faced court for felony domestic assault, which was reduced to misdemeanor with a deferred adjudication in a pela deal.\n\nBut he couldn't stay out of trouble so he served 45 days in jail and two years of probation for that crime.\n\nTwo months later, in July 2016, he was jailed for 60 days for breaching a protection order, and another 90 days from May 2017 for a second DWI.\n\nFinally, in 2019, a felony domestic assault charge - which could have led to a long sentence as a repeat offender - was abandoned in 2022 when the victim couldn't be found. He spent time in jail for skipping bail during the case.\n\nRelative calm followed and Nieneker didn't pick up another charge before his alleged Target rampage, and friends thought he may have turned a corner.\n\n'I went to high school with Ethan. Hung out with him on the 4th of July this year, first time seeing him in a few years,' a friend shared online.\n\n'Used to see him every now and again at this popular swimming spot in Austin. I was pretty optimistic about him when I saw him on the 4th.\n\n'He had become sober and we talked for a while about him wanting to learn more technical things and try to build a technical career working with circuitry and wiring. Overall normal and positive interaction.\n\n'Blew my mind seeing this news today.'\n\nShoppers and employees at Target said they ran for cover when they heard gunshots ring out in the parking lot.\n\n'I was inside the store, but then I hear on the radio like shots fired, so then they just told us 'active shooter...' so we just ran outside, we told guests to get out,' Target employee Freyen Sagastume told KXAN.\n\n'I thought that this only happened like in the news and stuff and then like I kind of just froze at first, but then I saw everyone running.'\n\nMeanwhile, at the nearby Jiffy Lube, employees hunkered down and locked the store's doors when they became aware there was a shooting outside.\n\nOne mechanic, Paul Smith, told Spectrum Local News he saw people running from their cars in the parking lot in a panic.\n\n'I had just gotten back from the Target like a minute before,' he said.\n\nTarget said it would provide counseling to staff struggling with witnessing the shooting.\n\n'We are devastated by the violence that occurred today at our store in Austin, Texas. Our hearts are with the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives, our team in Austin and all those impacted by this tragedy,' the company said.\n\n'We are working with law enforcement as they conduct their investigation and are grateful to the first responders who acted quickly at the scene.\n\n'In the days ahead, we will continue partnering with law enforcement and will be providing support resources, including grief counseling, to our team.'",

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Police responded to a shooting at a Target in North Austin on Monday afternoon that has left at least three people dead.\nAccording to social media posts from the Austin Police Department (APD), officers responded to a shooting at a Target located at 8601 Research Blvd. Three people have died, and a suspect, who was later identified as 32-year-old Ethan Nieneker, has been detained, police said.\nAccording to Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis, the suspect escaped in a stolen car from the Target parking lot, wrecked it, stole another car from a dealership, fled to South Austin and was apprehended via Taser. Davis said Nieneker has \u201ca mental health history.\u201d Police said they were still working to determine a motive.\nAs of Tuesday, Nieneker faces charges for capital murder by terror threat, capital murder of a child under ten and first-degree murder.\nDavis said officers responding to the call at about 2:15 p.m. found three people shot in the Target parking lot. Davis said they believe one of the people who was shot was the owner of the car stolen from the store's parking lot.\nAn adult and child were pronounced dead at the scene, while another adult died after being taken to the hospital, according to Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services. EMS officials said a fourth person was treated for a minor medical complaint not related to traumatic injuries.\nAuthorities identified the victims as 24-year-old Hector Leopoldo Martinez Machuca, 65-year-old Adam Chow and Chow's 4-year-old granddaughter. Machuca was found in the parking lot and transported to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead. Chow and his granddaughter were pronounced dead at the scene; Chow's wife sustained minor injuries.\nAccording to police, Machuca was a Target employee that the shooter randomly attacked as he was collecting shopping carts. Chow and his granddaughter were killed in their vehicle. Chow's wife took the 4-year-old from the vehicle before the shooter drove away in the family's Toyota 4-Runner.\n\u201cThis is a very sad day for Austin. It\u2019s a very sad day for us all and my condolences go out to the families,\u201d Davis said. She said she had no information to release about the victims.\n\u201cWe are devastated by the violence that occurred today at our store in Austin, Texas. Our hearts are with the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives, our team in Austin and all those impacted by this tragedy,\" Target said in a statement to Spectrum News. \"We are working with law enforcement as they conduct their investigation and are grateful to the first responders who acted quickly at the scene. In the days ahead, we will continue partnering with law enforcement and will be providing support resources, including grief counseling, to our team.\u201d\nThe shooting came amid back-to-school shopping ahead of the upcoming school year.\n\u201cThis is a devastating situation, and my heart is with the victims and their families,\u201d Austin Mayor Kirk Watson said in a message on X. \u201cWhile this remains an active and ongoing investigation, what I\u2019ll say is that this was a sickening, cowardly act of gun violence.\u201d\nAt a Jiffy Lube that shares its parking lot with the Target, employees hunkered down and locked the store doors as soon as they became aware a shooting was taking place. Paul Smith, an employee at the auto store, said he saw people running from their cars in the parking lot in a panic.\n\u201cI had just gotten back from the Target like a minute before,\u201d Smith said.\nLonnie Lee, 22, said she had visited the Target with her sister just a couple of hours earlier before they left to get lunch with their grandparents. When they returned to the area to continue shopping, she said they were shocked to see the parking lot was cordoned off and filled with police.\n\u201cWe got really, really lucky,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAnd some people didn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe Target shooting comes just over two weeks after an attack at a Walmart store in Michigan. A man stabbed 11 people at the store in Traverse City on July 26 and has been charged with terrorism and multiple counts of attempted murder.\nThis is a developing story. Check back for updates."
