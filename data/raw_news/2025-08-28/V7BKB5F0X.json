  "content": "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Why should residents in Traverse City treat a skin cancer screening like any other annual health exam? In , Dr. Laurel Leithauser of Leithauser Skin Institute explains why routine checkups are essential for identifying skin cancer early, especially in a region where UV exposure is intensified by the local landscape. With Traverse City\u2019s mix of sand, water, snow, and seasonal sun, the potential for sun-related skin damage remains high, even among those who use sunscreen.\n\nDr. Leithauser notes that Traverse City\u2019s natural beauty, while a major draw for locals and visitors alike, also creates conditions where ultraviolet rays reflect more aggressively off water, snow, and sand. This kind of environmental UV exposure quietly builds up over time, increasing the risk of skin cancer even for those who take basic protective steps. The cumulative effect on skin cells can trigger changes that lead to skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.\n\nTo protect your skin, Dr. Leithauser recommends treating annual dermatology screenings with the same importance as a yearly physical. These comprehensive exams allow dermatologists to identify early warning signs that could otherwise go unnoticed. They\u2019re especially important in Northern Michigan, where the sun\u2019s reflection off water, snow and sand nearly doubles UV intensity, making daily sun protection routines less effective on their own.\n\nShe emphasizes that early detection through annual skin cancer screening leads to more straightforward treatment and better outcomes. If skin cancer is identified early, it can often be removed with a minor surgical procedure. Left untreated, however, it may become locally destructive or even become life-threatening. This is why dermatologists across Traverse City strongly advocate for regular monitoring as part of every resident\u2019s healthcare plan.\n\nBeyond the yearly visit, Dr. Leithauser urges patients to pay attention to their skin all year long. New growths, unhealed sores, or changing moles should always be brought to a professional\u2019s attention. But she also warns that self-checks should not replace full-body skin exams performed by a dermatologist, who is trained to spot subtle developments that might otherwise be missed.\n\nSunscreen, hats, and UV-blocking clothing remain essential tools in the fight against skin cancer, but Dr. Leithauser reminds readers that these steps have limits, especially in regions like Traverse City where the natural environment magnifies UV risk. For many residents, the issue isn\u2019t a lack of awareness, but underestimating how powerful UV reflection can be. She advises combining smart daily habits with professional care to build a layered defense against sun-related skin conditions.",
