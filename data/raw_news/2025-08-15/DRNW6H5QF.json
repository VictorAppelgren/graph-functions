  "title": "Why did Laura Loomer leak that crazy deposition?",
  "description": "There is no such thing as bad press for the MAGA influencer.",
  "content": "For all the power she wields with the White House\u2019s affairs, Laura Loomer does not have the traditional tools that her rivals in the MAGA influencer industrial complex have \u2014 the highest follower count, the most political power, the most internet platforms, etc. But the fact remains that she\u2019s the influencer responsible for getting Donald Trump to fire over a dozen members of his administration (and counting) for the hazily-defined crime of being disloyal to MAGA. This is something that none of her peers, individually, have been able to do. But to understand how she operates, look no further than Loomer\u2019s latest attempted power play, which, as always, involves a fair amount of self-humiliation (and some disgusting slander).\n\nEarlier this week, she leaked a private deposition that she\u2019d given in a lawsuit wherein she explained, in her own words, why she\u2019s published some of the most outre takes and allegations against her \u201cenemies\u201d on social media. The deposition was given as part of her defamation suit against HBO host Bill Maher, who claimed on a February 2025 show that Loomer was having a sexual affair with president Donald Trump. But you might have missed that context, since the social media chatter and headlines gravitated toward the sections of the deposition where Loomer was grilled about her most audacious posts: she claimed, among other things, that Sen. Lindsay Graham was secretly gay, that former Vice President Kamala Harris was a \u201cDEI skank\u201d, and her bitter MAGA rival Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) divorced her husband because of the \u201cArby\u2019s in her pants\u201d and was a \u201cpolitical prostitute [who was] sucking McCarthy\u2019s dick all day.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Loomer defended herself and her statements, both in the deposition (\u201cI\u2019m saying she literally\u2014it\u2019s so ridiculous. I\u2019m saying she literally put Arby\u2019s in her pants\u201d) and in public, after the deposition was reported on by Will Sommer at The Bulwark. \u201cI was asked about Lindsey during my deposition so I had to tell the truth. I was under oath,\u201d Loomer tweeted \u2014 along with a screenshot of the section where she explained why she believed Graham was gay.\n\nHBO\u2019s lawyers immediately argued that Loomer was violating several laws by making the private deposition public, and the document was immediately re-sealed. Loomer, on the other hand, claimed that she was simply trying to showcase that her testimony \u201cwent so well that the leftist law firm [representing HBO] wanted to SEAL my deposition.\u201d Whether it went well is somewhat debatable, given the potential legal implications for Loomer violating a court order, as well as the incontrovertibility of Loomer saying some absolutely wild things in a legal deposition, and defending them.\n\nLoomer described the stunt as another example of \u201cLoomering,\u201d the term that she uses to describe her internet bullying campaigns. At first glance, it\u2019s a tactic honed from her time working as a secret-camera sting operator at Project Veritas, which famously recorded members of the media and academics saying things that could be spun as anti-conservative and amoral. Loomer\u2019s stepped up her game, however, putting herself in front of the camera (and eventually the public eye) to make her point.\n\nThe fact that she constantly embarrasses herself only enhances the efficacy of \u201cLoomering\u201d: first, shame and embarrassment does not matter in the long term, so long as people are paying attention online. (She said as much the next day: \u201cI wake up everyday to another hit piece. It\u2019s because I am effective and it threatens a lot of people.\u201d) Second: the internet is forever, and even if a judge orders a deposition to be resealed, gawkers will save copies, screenshot the juicy bits, and publish them for posterity. Loomer might have been recorded reading her own tweets out loud and forced to explain the gross bits, but she has also gotten several White House administration officials fired.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether her influence extends beyond Trump\u2019s daily capriciousness, Loomer\u2019s unnerving gift for being an internet bully remains effective as long as she has allies in the administration, who leak her the insider info she publicly uses to humiliate others. (As she said to HBO\u2019s lawyers, her friends in the White House told her that Graham was gay.) And as long as the storm she creates can grab Trump\u2019s attention, he will most likely keep picking up her calls.",

      "text": "For the uninitiated, watching a Jeffrey Epstein truther such as Laura Loomer have such influence over the White House\u2019s decisions is nothing short of baffling. ABC News attributes \u201cthe ouster of at least 15 individuals from Trump\u2019s second administration\u201d to Loomer\u2019s influence \u2014 partially, at least. For Washington veterans who grew up in quote-unquote normal times, it\u2019s unprecedented. If this 32-year-old online personality with no government experience tweets her displeasure at a random official, they soon find themselves clearing out their desks. If she manages to call Donald Trump\u2019s cellphone \u2014 an insane proposition, because he\u2019s the president of the United States, and no one should be able to call him directly \u2014 that firing happens even sooner.\nBut after following her career for over a decade, I\u2019m not surprised at all. MAGA influencers are loud, provocative, and instinctively pro-Trump by nature, and Loomer certainly meets those standards, though I wouldn\u2019t call her the apex extremist. What made Loomer stand out for years, and what I believe makes her stand out now, is her shamelessness. She\u2019s built her career on IRL stunts, taking her trolling offline for the sake of humiliating her target \u2014 or, as she\u2019s branded it, getting them \u201cLoomered\u201d \u2014 even if it results in arrests and lawsuits. Her new influence is just a higher-stakes version of Loomering: barging into the White House, making her presence known to Trump, and eventually getting her target humiliated.\nRecapping the entire canon of her political beliefs would be a tedious and lengthy endeavor, though it\u2019s safe to call them firmly MAGA: anti-elite, anti-immigrant, anti-left, conspiratorial, and perhaps a touch more Islamophobic than her peers in the year 2025. (Just last week, she claimed that stories about starving children in Gaza were \u201cPalestinian propaganda [and] a lie\u201d and expressed her apathy thusly: \u201cEvery time I see someone cry about Gaza, a brain cell dies.\u201d) But with her newfound hold on the levels of power, here is a primer on not just who Laura Loomer is, but what she is.\nShe\u2019s the descendant of the early troll years\nThe MAGA influencers are not a new phenomenon. Long before the rise of TikTok and the establishment of the influencer economy as we know it today, the MAGA influencers were already building their followings by tweeting pro-Trump content in 2017, eventually turning it into their full-time jobs.\nAnthropologically speaking, they were the descendants of the conservative online internet trolls that rose to prominence during Gamergate and the early Breitbart years \u2014 Katie Pavlich and Milo Yiannopoulos among them. But once Trump came into power, provocative right-wing shitposters suddenly had greater influence: their content was being endorsed by the president of the United States \u2014 and perhaps could be interpreted as his official position \u2014 and one retweet from him could result in hundreds of new followers, if not thousands, in the span of hours.\nLoomer was the beneficiary of the Trump retweet, though her influence via follower count was severely curtailed after she was kicked off the major platforms at the time \u2014 Twitter in 2018, Instagram and Facebook in 2019 \u2014 primarily for tweeting explicitly anti-Muslim statements and openly calling for their deaths. But by then, she had found a way around deplatforming.\nShe was better at stunts than everyone else\nThe practice of conservative college activists trolling the libs dates back decades, from affirmative action bake sales to running provocative columns in student papers. But its impact soon expanded off campuses starting in 2010, once Project Veritas began uploading hidden camera footage of so-called liberal elite figures stating controversial opinions. Loomer was an early college troll herself: in 2015, Project Veritas published a sting video she recorded at Barry University in which she asked faculty members if she could start a student group to support ISIS, and deceptively edited it to make it appear as if they agreed.\nBut while most young conservative activists would end such stunts after graduation, Loomer kept going, escalating the scale of those public disruptions \u2014 often as the employee of right-wing media groups that were eager to post content of libs getting \u201cLoomered.\u201d She\u2019d film herself yelling at members of Congress during hearings on Capitol Hill, disrupting a Shakespeare in the Park performance of Julius Caesar in New York City, accosting James Comey at his book events, even jumping the fence of Gavin Newsom\u2019s mansion with several men dressed in serapes to protest immigration laws. Oftentimes, they would end in her humiliation: in 2018, she chained herself to the doors of Twitter\u2019s New York City headquarters to demand the return of her account, but inadvertently handcuffed herself to the door incorrectly, allowing Twitter employees to freely enter and exit the building without issue. But attention was attention, and headlines are headlines.\nCOVID lockdowns, and the subsequent cancellation of all public gatherings, derailed Loomer\u2019s trajectory for a few years, though she did attempt to make the news again by running for Congress twice. In 2020, she won the Republican nomination in Florida\u2019s 21st District \u2014 where Mar-a-Lago is based \u2014 but lost to the Democrat incumbent, Lois Frankel, by nearly 20 points. She lost her second attempt in 2022, in Florida\u2019s heavily red 11th District in Tampa, during the Republican primary.\nSomehow, she got on Trump\u2019s good side\nIn April 2023, as Trump was gearing up for the primaries, The New York Times published a shocking report: he had asked his campaign to hire Loomer as a staffer. At the time, his team quickly shot down the idea, citing her history of \u201cbigoted remarks\u201d that threatened to derail Trump\u2019s message. But Trump has a long history of circumventing his ostensible White House gatekeepers, from four-star generals and chiefs of staff to his own children, to take calls or meet with anyone \u2014 and Loomer had already proven her disregard of boundaries, no matter who was enforcing them.\nAs of today, Loomer has taken responsibility for \u2018Loomering\u2019 no less than a dozen Trump administration officials\nAs of today, Loomer has taken responsibility for \u201cLoomering\u201d no less than a dozen Trump administration officials, taking one of two approaches, and sometimes both: a public attack launched on social media, sometimes with insider information, and/or a private entreaty to Trump whenever she calls him directly or visits the Oval Office.\nThese days, Loomer frames her influence as a matter of allegiance to Trump, helping the president to purge potentially disloyal members from his cabinet. But as her stock rises, so do her haters: in recent weeks, members of the right-wing influencer complex have begun publicly raising questions, as they put it, about the purity of her own motivations. Most recently, several MAGA and MAHA influencers accused Loomer of taking money from Big Pharma to get Trump to oust Dr. Vinay Prasad, an official running a treatment-approval division of the Food and Drug Administration. (She had found a clip of Prasad on a podcast stating that he frequently stabbed a voodoo doll of Trump; it later emerged that he was imitating an aggrieved liberal.) Backstabbing, undermining, public feuds and smear campaigns are a common practice in the MAGA influencer economy \u2014 and it is almost inevitable that some unknown personality finds some way to sabotage her."
