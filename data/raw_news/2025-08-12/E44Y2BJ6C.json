  "content": "Trump and Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, both framing this summit as a feel out meeting. Do we expect therfore anything concrete to come out of it? Yeah. Good morning, Lizzie. I mean, I think it's too early to say in the sense that if both of them have come out with a very similar line, they clearly trying to sort of manage expectations that there's going to be some almighty breakthrough of these talks in Alaska. Having said that, you know, they are going into a summit with a very, very experienced negotiator in the form of Putin, who has made some very clear demands about what he wants before he's prepared to come to any sort of discussion about a cease fire and then some longer term peace. And I think Trump has indicated that a land swap of some sort is possible. So really what we'll be looking for on Friday is the sort of the contours of what that might look like. But again, Trump and again, Rubio have made it clear that they may go into that summit and nothing comes out of it whatsoever. Well, so as we wait for that, the next catalyst could be this meeting between EU leaders and Zelensky talking to Trump and his VP JD Vance today. What do we expect them to say? And is there any chance that actually that could influence the Alaska talks on Friday? Yeah, I mean, I think it is possible there may be an influence there. I mean, in terms of the position, I think the EU in particular with strong support, would of course, from Ukraine have said that, you know, there mustn't be a forced redrawing of borders. In other words, the EU position largely seems to be a ceasefire now along existing lines and then you get some sort of negotiations for a longer term peace. However, that is somewhat at odds with the kind of the rhetoric that we've been getting out of the US side. So again, are they going to be able to influence some, you know, really hard to say, but they're certainly going to give it a try. And I think, again, Ukraine has been very firm on this that they're not prepared to basically retreat from basically what accounts for three and a half thousand square miles of territory that Russia has been unable to capture militarily for the better part of a decade.",
