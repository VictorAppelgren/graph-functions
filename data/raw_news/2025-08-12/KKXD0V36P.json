  "content": "When police searched a home in Upland as part of a recent burglary investigation, they weren\u2019t looking for piles of cash or bags full of jewelry, but boxes of what has become the must-have item of the year.\n\nWithin each of the 14 boxes taken from the home, Chino police said, were those little customizable monsters that are taking over America \u2014 Labubu.\n\nAccording to a social media post on Monday, Chino police recovered $30,000 worth of the furry figurines, which usually retail for about $30, from a home as part of an investigation into a series of thefts from a local warehouse.\n\nThe figurines are usually sold at Pop Mart stores and create a fervor whenever new supplies are released. A child-sized Labubu sold at auction for $150,000, according to media reports, and limited edition monsters can retail for $150.\n\nWhen police searched the home, they found an operation to resell and ship the figurines across the country, officials said. One person inside the home tried to run away but eventually surrendered. The Labubus were then returned to their rightful owner.\n\nWith their popularity soaring, Labubu heists are not unheard of in the Southland.\n\nLast week, thieves robbed a La Puente business that advertised its stock of Labubu figurines online. One Stop Sales said that thieves broke into their shop and stole multiple boxes of merchandise, including Labubu monsters. The shop owners later announced that some of their merchandise were recovered by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nLabubu, the furry figurines sold exclusively at Chinese-based Pop Mart, are often sold in timed online events and then customers can pick up at storefronts across the U.S.",

      "text": "- Share via\nResidents in San Marino were stunned when a well-respected doctor and mother of twins was found dead in the scorched den of her sprawling estate.\nIrene Gaw-Lai and her husband, Yoon \u201cKevin\u201d Lai, had raised their sons in the affluent, quiet community, driving them to private school and baseball tournaments.\nBut when a fire burned in the rear of the family\u2019s home, family and neighbors wondered: How could a healthy 56-year-old be killed in a fire that never spread beyond a single room?\nBut her 16-year-old sons feared they knew the answer.\nReeling from the news of their mother\u2019s death, the boys spent that night with their aunt, saying they didn\u2019t want to be around their father, according to family court documents.\n\u201cThey were afraid,\u201d said Randolph Gaw, the dead woman\u2019s cousin and the attorney now representing Gaw-Lai\u2019s family.\nPublicly, investigators initially said little about Gaw-Lai\u2019s death. Investigators had not yet disclosed that she appeared to have been beaten, but her children were already harboring suspicions of their own.\nIn a court filing, family members said the two brothers \u201csuspect that Yoon had some involvement in the recent and untimely demise of their mother.\u201d\nNow, nearly six months after Gaw-Lai was found dead in her home in the 2600 block of Lorain Road, the Los Angeles County District Attorney has charged their father with one count each of murder and arson in an inhabited building.\nLai has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has been released on $2.25 million bail.\nFederal agents with the IRS, U.S. Postal Service, U.S. Labor Department and FBI were all part of the morning raid.\n\u201cWe look forward to defending these false allegations in Court,\u201d said Lai\u2019s attorney, James Robert Tedford, in an email. Tedford declined to comment on the accusations.\nFamily and neighbors said the family appeared to live a quiet life. Yet hundreds of court records reviewed by The Times, including sworn declarations, surveillance footage images and an autopsy report describe a strained marital relationship and contentious divorce.\nWhen firefighters found her corpse, Gaw-Lai had burns on about 60% of her body, according to a death investigation summary filed in court. Further investigation found that the mother had also suffered a broken nose, a fractured eye socket, a lost tooth, bruising to her knees and other parts of her body as well as multiple cuts and bruises. A frying pan and metal baseball bat with traces of blood on them were also found in the home, investigators wrote in the summary.\nAfter the fire, the twins\u2019 aunt was named temporary guardian. Lai has contested that order in court.\n\u201cShe has refused to return the children to me,\u201d the father wrote in a court filing.\nIn family court documents, Gaw-Lai\u2019s siblings described the couple\u2019s 22-year marriage as troubled and said that when the wife filed for divorce in August, she asked a judge to revoke the couple\u2019s premarital agreement. The divorce proceeding, according to court filings, meant the couple\u2019s real estate properties, believed to be worth millions of dollars by relatives, were suddenly at stake.\nAn endocrinologist, Gaw-Lai practiced in Arcadia. Lai, according to public records, owns his own civil engineering and land surveying business but also bought and sold real estate.\nThe two were married in 2002, but court records indicate their marriage quickly met challenges. Just months after they were married, Gaw-Lai filed for divorce, although they seemed to have reconciled by the time their twins were born in 2008.\nAt family gatherings, Lai would keep to himself unless the conversation turned toward business, Gaw said.\n\u201cAlmost every time he talked to me, it was almost always about money,\u201d Gaw said. \u201cEither how much people were making, how much he was paying in taxes or how much he didn\u2019t want to pay.\u201d\nA group of friends from Thousand Oaks were among the victims of a mass shooting in Reno this week. The men had attended another friend\u2019s bachelor party before the shooting.\nIn August 2024, Gaw-Lai filed for divorce again, citing irreconcilable differences. In court declarations, the couple\u2019s sons said they learned their father was having an affair after they looked at his phone.\nWhen asking for a divorce, Gaw-Lai also asked that their premarital agreement be nullified. According to Jocelyn Gaw\u2019s declaration, the request came because her sister had discovered that several properties the couple owned were solely in her husband\u2019s name and, according to the 2002 premarital agreement, would remain in his possession.\nRelatives said the couple talked about reconciliation, but Gaw-Lai had a few conditions before she reconsidered. According to text messages reviewed by The Times and filed in court, Gaw-Lai told her brother that Lai was \u201cbegging me to come back.\u201d\nSome of those conditions included voiding the premarital agreement, putting her name on all properties that had been purchased and requiring Lai to go to therapy.\n\u201cThat seems a lot, do you think he\u2019ll agree?\u201d her brother, Enrico Gaw Gonzalo, texted her.\n\u201cit depends on what\u2019s more important to him...\u201d she responded.\nThe premarital agreement was revoked on Sept. 7, 2024, and Gaw-Lai\u2019s name was also added as co-owner of the San Marino home, court records say.\nRelatives also told The Times that, despite her husband\u2019s acquiescence to her requests, Gaw-Lai still planned to go forward with the divorce. And as time went by, she told relatives she was increasingly concerned about her husband.\n\u201cIrene disclosed to others around this time that she was fearful for her safety if she was left alone with Kevin,\u201d one court filing reads.\nLai had moved out of the San Marino home but would stop by often to drive the twins to practice and events. Gaw-Lai would make sure the twins were around if her husband was stopping by, said Randolph Gaw.\nOn the morning of Jan. 6, Lai arrived at the Lorain Road home at 7:06 a.m. to take the twins to baseball practice, according to court documents. About six minutes later, Ring camera data submitted in court indicated sensors for the home\u2019s \u201cdining\u201d and \u201cgarden\u201d cameras \u2014 which pointed to where Gaw-Lai\u2019s body was found \u2014 were \u201cmanually disabled.\u201d\nAnd although Lai told his sons that he would be going to work after he dropped them off and would be picking them up late, Ring camera footage shows a car similar to Lai\u2019s returning to the neighborhood at 8:19 a.m., according to documents filed in court.\nAt 9:46 a.m., the couple\u2019s next-door neighbor, Connie Morris, called 911 when she saw smoking coming from the house, according to court documents.\nAccording to a declaration signed by Morris and submitted in court, she also spotted Lai inside the house. At one point, he opened the kitchen door to speak to her, acting \u201cbewildered\u201d when she mentioned the smoke.\nAccording to Morris\u2019 declaration, Lai said his wife was picking up the twins from baseball practice, but Morris noticed that her car was still at the house.\nIt took more than six months to confirm what officials hope will be the final death from L.A. County\u2019s January firestorm.\nGaw, the family\u2019s attorney, said cameras in the home didn\u2019t appear to capture video of what happened to Gaw-Lai.\nAccording to a death investigation summary of Gaw-Lai, the 56-year-old mother had suffered blunt force trauma to her head.\nInvestigators found the fire appeared to have started in the den, according to the report. One ignition point was near Gaw-Lai\u2019s body, and a second was about six feet away.\nMorris declined to talk about details of what she saw that day with a reporter but said she had lived next to the family for years.\nThe family led a quiet life, she said, and she can\u2019t remember ever hearing loud arguments or police being called to the house.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it was so alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just shocking.\u201d"

      "text": "- Share via\n- A global frenzy has erupted for Labubu, a furry elf character made by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.\n- Since April, every new release and restock of plush Labubu dolls has sold out, usually within minutes. Grown men and women have fought over her. Counterfeits and resellers have flooded the market.\n- Labubu\u2019s massive success has been great timing for Beijing-based Pop Mart, a huge brand in Asia that began opening stores in the U.S. last year. Worldwide, it has more than 500 retail shops and 2,500 toy vending machines in 30 countries.\nEvery few Fridays, in the middle of the night, a line forms outside the Pop Mart store at Westfield Century City.\nIt\u2019s the same scene over at Glendale Galleria. And at South Coast Plaza. Victoria Gardens in Rancho Cucamonga, too.\nThey come by the hundreds, all vying for the latest Labubu, a furry toy character with rabbit-like ears and a nightmarish grin stretched wide over a row of serrated teeth. Labubu, her legion of fans will tell you, is female, the size of a cat and a tad mischievous. She belongs to a Nordic tribe of elves known as the Monsters. She is very soft. They insist her boyfriend is a look-alike figure named Zimomo, but Pop Mart denies the relationship.\nA global buying frenzy for all things Labubu erupted in April when Lisa, a member of the popular K-pop girl group Blackpink, posted a video on Instagram of her hugging a large Labubu plush doll. The 27-year-old megastar, who isn\u2019t a brand spokesperson, further fueled the mania by accessorizing her luxury handbags with small Labubu pendants.\nSince then, every new release and restock of the plush dolls has sold out within minutes in stores and within seconds online. Grown men and women \u2014 Labubu\u2019s core customers are adults, not kids \u2014 have fought over her and police recently had to manage an unruly crowd at a Singapore toy show where Labubus were being sold. Last month, a family allegedly broke into a claw machine filled with boxes of Labubus and stole three of them. Fakes and resellers have flooded the market.\nIt\u2019s a sudden and astonishing ascent for an ugly-cute character that debuted nearly a decade ago, and fortuitous timing for Pop Mart as it makes a major push into the U.S.\nFounded in 2010, the Chinese toy maker has seen enormous success overseas for its artist-designed collectibles, growing to around 500 retail shops and 2,500 toy vending machines in 30 countries. The company\u2019s stock price has more than tripled this year, giving Pop Mart a market cap of $12.1 billion. It opened its first permanent U.S. store in September 2023 and has quickly expanded to 16 locations around the country, seven of them in California.\nOpened in February, the Century City Pop Mart is a maximalist shrine of whimsical characters such as Skull Panda and Dimoo and their many, many related products: vinyl plush dolls in all sizes, action figures, keychains, stationery, purses and tote bags, cups, hair clips, smartphone and earphone cases, lamps and night lights.\nThese days Labubu is the must-have character, with her merch universe ranging from an $8.99 fridge magnet to a \u201cMega 1000%\u201d \u2014 a giant 31-inch plastic figurine that sells for $959.90.\nBlind boxes are in high demand: The packages are sealed and contain a random product from a collection, injecting an element of surprise and tempting customers to buy boxes over and over until they get the exact figure they want. Similar to packs of baseball trading cards, a few lucky boxes contain rare \u201csecret\u201d figurines that are not part of the regular series.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high and it\u2019s excitement,\u201d said Jon Shapiro, 48, who arrived at 2:30 a.m. to be first in line at a recent Pop Mart release in Century City. \u201cYou start buying sets and you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, well I need the whole collection.\u2019 It\u2019s like you have a mission.\u201d\nShapiro, who owns a home inspection company, visited Pop Mart for the first time in January during a trip to Paris and \u201cjust got addicted.\u201d\n\u201cIt would blow your mind,\u201d he said of the number of Pop Mart collectibles he has since acquired, which span \u201calmost every collection\u201d and fill his living room in downtown L.A. from floor to ceiling. \u201cI would say I\u2019ve probably spent minimum $10,000.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a collector of anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for some reason, Pop Mart got me.\u201d\nOn that Friday morning in late October, more than 100 superfans had gathered outside the Pop Mart store before 9 a.m., having learned about the product drop from the brand\u2019s social media posts.\nUp for grabs: 29 large Zimomo dolls, 30 six-box blind sets of Labubu pendants and 40 Labubu purses.\n1. Labubu vinyl plush pendants on display. 2. The Century City Pop Mart store had only 40 Labubu purses for sale during an October launch. They sold out in less than an hour.\nA squabble had broken out a few hours earlier over line position, store manager Henry Nguyen said, and mall security stepped in to restore order. \u201cThere was an escalation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was chaotic.\u201d\nJust a few days before, an Australian TikTok user posted a video from a different Pop Mart that showed hordes of shoppers waiting for the store to open, some sleeping on the ground outside the shopping center\u2019s sliding doors overnight.\n\u201cEveryone started screaming, shoving and rushing in, and people even got crushed at the sides of the doors,\u201d Lawrence Yu said in the video, which has been viewed 1.2 million times. \u201cThere was a group of poor Asian aunties that had all got pushed to the floor. They grazed their knees and they also snapped a few nails, too.\u201d\nI\u2019m not a collector of anything else. But for some reason, Pop Mart got me.\n\u2014 Jon Shapiro, 48, a Pop Mart superfan\nThe phenomenon has forced staff at each Pop Mart store to devise their own crowd control plans on the fly. To get the line in Century City moving, Nguyen decided to open an hour early, reminding customers that they were limited to one Zimomo doll ($289.99) or one complete Labubu blind set ($131.94).\nOnce they made it through the doors, elated shoppers grabbed blind boxes and vigorously shook them to try to discern what was inside. A mother and daughter from Inglewood filmed an unboxing video for TikTok as soon as they finished paying. The store has several Instagram group chats filled with hundreds of customers, and those on the scene posted real-time updates to let others know how many items were left.\nIt was all over in about an hour, with people toward the back of the line dispersing once it became clear they wouldn\u2019t make the cutoff. Some grumbled about resellers, who sell their Labubu hauls at exorbitant markups, being among those who had swarmed the release.\nShopping online is just as disheartening, they lamented, because of bots programmed to hoover up products the instant they\u2019re available. The night before, the Zimomo plush sold out in less than a minute on Pop Mart\u2019s website and TikTok Shop.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to manufacture\u201d scarcity, said Emily Brough, head of licensing for Pop Mart North America, which is headquartered in Glendale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re just sending 12 to the store so that there\u2019s this craze and nobody gets what they want,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want people to get what they want, and we do try to stock up for the demand.\u201d\nBrough attributed the limited quantities to the Beijing-based company\u2019s supply chain timeline \u2014 Pop Mart places its orders months in advance, sometimes before a particular toy has taken off. The company said it is working on strategies to make things more fair and to better manage the masses at its U.S. stores on product launch days.\nMattel, Lego and other toy companies are targeting a growing number of adults who are buying toys for themselves.\nPop Mart reported record revenue of $638.5 million for the first half of 2024, a 62% increase over the same period a year earlier. Sales in its burgeoning North America segment totaled $24.9 million; more than three-fourths of its revenue comes from Southeast Asia and East Asia.\nPlush toys, a hot category in the toy industry, did monster numbers: Pop Mart said revenue skyrocketed nearly 1,000% in the first half of the year, to $62.5 million. The company declined to discuss Labubu-specific sales figures or to comment on whether it was ramping up production.\nCreating a viral hit is the dream for toy makers, and there is no \u201cexact formula,\u201d Brough said. \u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ve seen anything like this in North America.\u201d\nPop Mart has benefited from some right-place-right-time luck: Its Labubu pendants double as bag charms, which have been a huge trend in the fashion world. \u201cKidults\u201d \u2014 adults who are big consumers of products traditionally made for children \u2014 have been on the rise. And the organic social media love from Lisa and other celebrities was also invaluable.\n1. An employee rings up a Labubu purse for a customer. 2. The most coveted item during a recent Pop Mart launch was a large Zimomo doll for $289.99.\nBut more than anything, Pop Mart has mastered the hype playbook.\nCollectors say they became hooked by the psychological thrill of the blind-box chase and the satisfaction of completing a set; the steady release of special collaborations and seasonal collections (a recent Halloween-themed Labubu had the elf wearing a pumpkin outfit); and the feeling of desperation that comes with wanting something in short supply.\nThere are also surprise, midday product drops in stores and online. That unpredictability has led people to compulsively check the stores\u2019 Instagram Stories for news of spontaneous restocks.\nWhenever one is posted, customers within quick driving or running distance descend upon the store, as they did last Thursday afternoon after the Century City Pop Mart used red siren emojis to announce it had 83 Labubus for sale: \u201cHot restock announcement\u2026 sales start right now.\u201d A shopper who rushed over said everything was gone in less than 20 minutes.\nThey\u2019re very limited, so that\u2019s why you want it.

Over time, it pivoted to making designer toys, working closely with independent artists via licensing deals. The toys, which are mainly manufactured in China, found a broad audience among Gen Z.\nHong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung is the creator of Labubu and the other Monsters creatures, which first appeared in 2015 in a series of picture books; Pop Mart began selling Labubu merchandise four years later.\nLung told The Times that he incorporated elements of his own personality into Labubu\u2019s narrative, such as her \u201cnaughtiness,\u201d which he believed made the character more compelling.\nHe realized the impish elf had become a runaway success when \u201cone day my parents asked me for a Labubu doll,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the specific moment for me.\u201d\nNow, obsessed fans are showcasing them in acrylic display cases in their homes, clipping them onto their backpacks and purses, and customizing them with fake eyelashes, tiny clothes and braces.\nJustine Cristobal and her partner, Marivene Del Rosario, began buying Labubu in September. In two months, they\u2019ve spent $2,500 on 28 small plushes and three large ones, driving to Pop Marts all over Southern California twice a week and meeting other collectors in coffee shops and at their homes to swap figurines.\n\u201cSometimes we go to different Pop Marts just to check out what they have in the same day,\u201d said 34-year-old Cristobal, a nurse from Pico Rivera.\nBut the secret chestnut-cocoa Labubu \u2014 there\u2019s only one in every 72 boxes \u2014 has eluded them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reason for us to buy more and then we\u2019ll just trade the ones that we already have,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re very limited, so that\u2019s why you want it. You kind of crave it.\u201d"

ADUs made up about one-fifth of that, according to California Department of Finance data.\n- But ADUs are different from building new apartments and homes. At least some ADU owners do not put their units on the market, using them instead for their own families or leaving them vacant.\nWith California facing a critical housing shortage, accessory dwelling units now account for a significant portion of the state\u2019s meager growth in new homes, data reviewed by The Times show.\nCalifornia has struggled to keep up with demand, increasing housing stock by only 0.84% in 2024, or 125,000 units. ADUs made up about one-fifth of those units, according to California Department of Finance data.\nADU construction has been booming in some parts of California, with homeowners taking advantage of the opportunity to build a second housing unit in their backyard. The units often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but many residents see them as worthy investments that increase property value.\nBut ADUs are different from building new apartments and homes. Some ADU owners do not put their units on the market, using them instead for their own families, or leaving them vacant.\nAnd ADUs are more popular in some areas than others.\nEric McGhee, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, said it\u2019s hard to know whether new ADUs are being used to house people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be on the property, or whether they are just providing extra space for those already living there. As a result, it is likely that some ADUs do nothing to ease the housing shortage.\nOne clue comes from the San Diego Assn. of Governments, which calculated that 85% of permitted ADUs in the county were renter-occupied units, with only 15% occupied by owners.\nStill, in many cases, ADUs might be occupied by people spreading out within a property they already occupy, McGhee said, complicating analysis of the impact on the broader housing market.\n\u201cIs it enough to just build anything,\u201d he asked, \u201cor do we need to build a certain kind of housing that fills demand better?\u201d\nADU production was up 14.3% in 2024 over the previous year. In 2023, ADU production had grown by 10%. With statewide housing growth relatively steady year over year, ADUs have gained ground and represent a larger portion of new housing.\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass is restricting duplex construction in Pacific Palisades after an executive order from Gov. Gavin Newsom to weaken a state housing law.\nA Times analysis of finance department data shows that the city of Los Angeles increased its housing stock by 6% between 2020 and 2025, the third-highest figure of Los Angeles County\u2019s 88 cities. Only Duarte and Monrovia added more housing relative to existing stock.\nSome cities, such as Avalon, Westlake Village and Cerritos \u2014 the bottom three in Los Angeles County \u2014 hardly grew at all.\nADUs are sprouting up across California, especially in L.A. County. Here\u2019s why some cities are seeing more construction than others.\nFor all of Los Angeles County, housing stock grew by 3.75% over those five years, roughly in line with the statewide figure of 3.87%.\nIn contrast, some of California\u2019s fastest-growing counties far outpaced sluggish Los Angeles. Madera County grew its housing stock by 2.7% in 2024. Placer and San Benito counties approached 2% annual growth.\nAnd in smaller booming cities, one year of growth was comparable to five years in Los Angeles: in Huron (Fresno County), the housing stock grew by nearly 8% in 2024. Lathrop (San Joaquin County), Winters (Yolo County) and American Canyon (Napa County) all saw growth over 5% that year.\nBig cities such as Los Angeles, Oakland and San Diego have been relatively successful in producing new multi-unit complexes, McGhee said, with the vast majority of the new units being one- and two-bedroom rentals.\nWhere major metropolitan areas have been largely developed and mostly see infill, suburban, peripheral cities like Huron see \u201cgreen edge development that is overwhelmingly single-family detached homes,\u201d he said.\nL.A. County is a hotbed for ADUs. A 2024 Times analysis showed the county permitted more accessory dwelling units per capita than any other county in the state. The data showed lower- and middle-income cities approving the most construction. Among the cities that permitted the most construction: San Fernando, Rosemead, Temple City, Sierra Madre and Hidden Hills. The cities that built the fewest: Hawthorne, Commerce, Cudahy, Cerritos and Westlake Village.\nIn a 2024 research project for UCLA\u2019s Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies, master\u2019s student Miles Austin Cressy studied the western San Fernando Valley \u2014 where more than 7% of single-family residence parcels had been granted ADU permits.\nCressy sought to answer the question that continues to bedevil housing experts: Will ADUs help solve California\u2019s housing crisis?\nHe found that \u201cADU prevalence correlates with lower-income, renter-occupied, and younger households, denser populations, and areas with higher concentrations of non-white residents and registered Democrats.\u201d\nADU developments were also less common in hillside and fire-prone areas, suggesting that they might be concentrated in more climate-resilient locations, Cressy wrote.\nFinally, the verdict: \u201cADUs are usually priced at or above market rates and so they have limited viability as a solution to the housing crisis,\u201d the report said. The cheap, abundant housing that Californians crave might not be found in the backyard."

      "text": "The next \u2018Big One\u2019 on the San Andreas fault might not be the earthquake we expect, researchers say\n- Share via\n- A new report studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault.\n- While the recent quake could hold vital clues for California\u2019s next \u201cBig One,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author notes that, \u201cEarthquakes never come back exactly the same way.\u201d\nWhat could the next mega-earthquake on California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault look like?\nWould it be a repeat of 1857, when an earthquake estimated at magnitude 7.7 to 7.9 ruptured the fault from Monterey County all the way through Los Angeles County? Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County?\nDon\u2019t bet on an identical sequel.\nThat\u2019s the implication of a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas.\nThe earthquake ended up rupturing a much longer section of the fault than scientists expected, given the seismology of the region.\nThe implications of this study are that \u201cearthquakes never come back exactly the same way,\u201d Solene L. Antoine, a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech and the study\u2019s lead author, said in an interview.\n\u201cIt came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech.\nMarch\u2019s Mandalay earthquake devastated Myanmar, killing at least 3,791 people and an additional 63 people in Thailand. High-rise buildings were damaged as far away as Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and homes were damaged in the Ruili area of China. Damage was estimated at $1.9 billion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nIt was the most powerful earthquake in Myanmar in at least 79 years.\nThe magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine\u2019s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. That\u2019s the longest seismic rupture ever documented on a continent.\nBy comparison, California\u2019s 1906 earthquake ruptured 296 miles of the San Andreas fault; and the 1857 earthquake, 225 miles. Longer seismic ruptures have been found only on subduction megathrusts deep underneath the ocean.\nWhat\u2019s clear from the study is that while California\u2019s next \u201cBig One\u201d may share some characteristics of previously documented devastating quakes, it\u2019s unlikely to be an exact replay. As the recent experience in Myanmar shows, even well-documented faults can behave in surprising ways.\nThe next step is to develop a model simulating earthquakes over many millennia for the San Andreas fault, which the authors plan to do in the future. But the San Andreas fault \u201cis far more complex,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to come soon, because it\u2019s quite a heavy calculation.\u201d\nStill, such simulations would provide a model of \u201call possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.\u201d\nFor instance, maybe the San Andreas fault will rupture in smaller, separate earthquakes, Avouac said.\nOr it could be a much larger earthquake \u2014 rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. Such a quake would be the largest simultaneous disaster in modern California history, with huge swaths of the state wracked by powerful seismic shaking all at once.\nBy comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake\u2019s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley \u2014 related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7.\nBut while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just expect the exact same thing to happen,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIt is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.\u201d\nSometimes, Avouac said, \u201cit\u2019s quiet for a long time, nothing happens ... stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,\u201d Avouac said.\nBut \u201csmaller\u201d earthquakes, in the minds of researchers, are still big to the layperson. In the study\u2019s simulations, there are periods where earthquakes around magnitude 7.7 are common. In other periods, earthquakes max out at magnitude 7.5 or so, but are more frequent.\nThe entire length of the Sagaing fault \u2014 including areas that didn\u2019t rupture in the March earthquake \u2014 is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate.\nThe fact that 317 miles of the Sagaing fault ruptured in March was surprising to scientists. Only about 170 miles had been quiet seismically for more than a century, having last ruptured in 1839.\nScientists call these \u201cseismic gaps\u201d \u2014 particular areas of a fault that haven\u2019t recently ruptured.\nGenerally, scientists would\u2019ve expected only this long-dormant 170-mile piece of the Sagaing fault to rupture, Avouac said, but not more recently ruptured sections. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956.\nInstead, even those fault segments ruptured in the big March earthquake.\nSo what gives?\nA possible explanation is the Sagaing fault\u2019s extraordinary smoothness. \u201cAnd people have observed that when the fault is very smooth, the rupture ... tends to propagate at a velocity\u201d so fast that it results in an \u201cextremely elongated rupture,\u201d Avouac said.\nThe study also published the results of a computer model simulation looking at how earthquakes might rupture along sections of the entire 750-mile long Sagaing fault. The code, developed by study coauthor Kyungjae Im of Caltech, suggests that over a hypothetical 1,400-year period, there would be no repeatable patterns.\nIn other words, earthquakes didn\u2019t seem to re-occur like clockwork, rupturing the same stretch of fault in a repeatable, predictable pattern.\n\u201cThere is complexity here. And this is because each time you have an earthquake, it redistributes the stress on the fault, which is going to influence the next earthquake,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cThere\u2019s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.\u201d\nThere is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a \u201cBig One\u201d simply won\u2019t ever strike California again.\n\u201cThere will be an earthquake at some point,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIf there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won\u2019t hold forever.\u201d\nFurther research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said.\nThe other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China."
