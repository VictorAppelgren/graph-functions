      "feedback": "The article repeats the blender’s specs several times; remove the duplicate sentences and keep a single concise description (e.g., “The 600‑W, 5‑L blender has a 12‑V battery, 1½‑hour runtime, 3‑speed motor, 3.5‑inch blade, 6.5‑inch jar, 2.5‑inch base, 1.5‑inch handle, and 0.5‑inch nozzle”). Tighten the pricing section by consolidating the price, discount, and final price into one sentence. In the user review, correct the typo “I bought this blender last month” to “I bought this blender last month” and add a brief mention of the blender’s performance in a specific scenario (e.g., “I used it to make a protein shake for my workout”). Ensure the “Key Takeaways” bullet list is formatted consistently (use dashes or asterisks, not a mix). Finally, double‑check that all URLs are valid and that the “See also” links are properly hyperlinked.",
