  "title": "How Youri Tielemans proved doubters wrong (with help from Unai Emery and his Aston Villa team-mates)",
  "description": "Written off by many would-be suitors after leaving previous club Leicester, the Belgian midfielder has flourished. Here's how...",
  "content": "\u201cHe\u2019s just so good. What a player,\u201d says one Aston Villa employee.\n\nSpeak to just about any member of the Premier League club\u2019s staff and that sentiment will not change. Youri Tielemans is a midfield craftsman, boasting a skill set that is in rarefied air. He is not the most athletic or physical of footballers, but how he works is uniquely different from any other Villa player and most in the English game\u2019s top division.\n\nVilla analysts will watch or rewatch games and run several data tests on midfield transfer targets or the man himself. Predictably, the same conclusion is reached: he is really, really good.\n\nTielemans, technically, has never been doubted, but his durability and physicality have. It is what made his 2024-25 season so stellar and, in turn, why he banished the doubts that proliferated scouting circles as to whether he had already physically peaked. The 28-year-old Belgium international made 52 starts in 53 appearances \u2014 playing 4,511 minutes across all competitions \u2014 becoming the first Villa player to start more than 50 times in a single season since Alan Wright and Mark Bosnich, a goalkeeper, did it in 1995-96.\n\nHe cleaned up at Villa\u2019s end-of-season awards, having shone in a fraught campaign for the team. Tielemans was razor-sharp throughout. He identified passes and pictures quicker than anyone else, regulated possession and even in the most turbulent times, never lost his poise. The transformation was astonishing in light of his only other season at Villa, when he often appeared sluggish and admitted, in his words, he was only \u201calright\u201d on the pitch.\n\nNow, though, the mental cogs whirr fast, flawlessly and in synchronisation. He is attuned to what Unai Emery wants after initial frustration under him, when he was having to learn the manager\u2019s forte for many long and frequent meetings, without having the chance to act on the information provided in them. Tielemans joined Villa as a free agent in July 2023 after leaving relegated Leicester City, but he did not make his first Premier League start until the November, with matches in the UEFA Conference League over the intervening period illuminating his initial shortcomings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had so many meetings,\u201d Tielemans told reporters at the time. \u201cIt was just about adapting to his (Emery\u2019s) system. His playing style is all with the ball, taking more time in possession. The more you play in this team, the better you understand every position.\u201d\n\nIt was early days in that late summer and autumn two years ago, but concerns about Tielemans were prevalent. His form at Villa appeared to be an extension of his final season at Leicester, when he was running down his contract to explore free agency as they slid to a surprise relegation. Leicester were extremely dysfunctional in that 2022-23 campaign, with schisms in their midfield that were exploited by opponents.\n\nTielemans was toiling to cover ground as part of a midfield three in those final weeks and months at Leicester and not trusted to track opposition runners from deep. He was moved further forward to avoid him potentially proving a liability defensively. Emery even recognised this early on, rewiring him as a progressive No 10 and wanting him to press high.\n\nA notable regression in form meant potential suitors to sign him fell away. Interest from elite clubs had been expressed over the years, but come the day they could get him for nothing, none remained at the table. This was a surprise to a player who had scored the winning goal in the 2020-21 FA Cup final.\n\nThe cross-Midlands move he made initially only served to vindicate clubs \u2014 including Arsenal and Manchester United \u2014 reluctant to sign him. Speak to those who know Tielemans well and they will say he is a player who requires constant game time to grow into a role and achieve rhythm. Piecemeal starts and introductions off the bench only magnified a difficult opening to his Villa career.\n\n\u201cHe (Tielemans) is very honest, and he knows at the beginning he wasn\u2019t playing good,\u201d Emery said in 2023. \u201cThe adaptation in another position is a lot more difficult. But he is working every day, trying to understand everything. With his quality and his high commitment, it is easier.\u201d Emery\u2019s words were meant to demand more from the player, not as a sign that faith had been lost. He, along with Villa\u2019s recruitment team, felt Tielemans was experiencing a dip caused by numerous factors that were, in truth, not entirely down to him.\n\nEven though Villa signed him at age 26, scouts and recruitment specialists, who spoke to The Athletic on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships, insisted there was a perception his best days were behind him by then. While still pretty young, he had already been a senior professional for a decade, having made his Anderlecht debut aged 16 years, two months and 21 days. It was beginning to feel as if the number of matches he had played for the Brussels club, Monaco in France\u2019s Ligue 1, and Leicester, plus over 50 senior internationals, were taking a toll on his performances. Put plainly, that he was burnt out.\n\nVilla, however, took the opposite view. They pounced on other Premier League clubs\u2019 hesitation, with their recruitment team looking beyond perception and running critical numbers on his data. The feedback suggested being part of a failing team was proving detrimental to his own development, rather than any physical decline.\n\nLeicester\u2019s relegation did little to deter Villa. They had initiated contact with the Belgian\u2019s representatives in the January, five months before they signed him. He was their first-choice target for the No 8 position and when he was presented to Emery as an option, he gave the green light.\n\n\u201cThe biggest question marks surrounded his mobility and dynamism, but when Unai\u2019s game is so much about positioning and structure, this alleviated those concerns somewhat,\u201d says one senior source. \u201cWe essentially thought that \u2018bigger\u2019 clubs might look at his most recent and largely disappointing season for a relegated club and judge him on that more exclusively than taking a step back and looking at, or appreciating more deeply, the entirety of his career to that point.\u201d\n\nVilla staff noted that since breaking through at Anderlecht, there was only one season among the next nine that he failed to make at least 30 league appearances. Question marks over his durability were therefore misplaced. His high rate of availability meant he represented exceptional value as a free agent.\n\nThe club wanted a midfielder to partner Boubacar Kamara, somebody who was able to dovetail while offering more progression and attacking output than the France international. Tielemans had, at that stage, scored 69 career goals and provided 60 assists, which was largely unrivalled across Europe for a central midfielder. Those meaningful numbers have since held up at Villa, where he has 18 assists in his two seasons.\n\nAnother factor to consider was that he matched Emery\u2019s desire for new acquisitions to have European-level experience. With Villa going into their first year in UEFA tournaments for more than a decade, his four signings that summer \u2014 Tielemans, Pau Torres, Moussa Diaby and Nicolo Zaniolo \u2014 all met that criteria.\n\n\u201cWe were a club aspiring to get into the Europa League or Champions League,\u201d says one source. \u201cSo the fact that he had already played 56 times in those two competitions combined before joining meant we were confident he had a level of know-how and assurance above our other No 8-type central midfielders.\u201d\n\nMembers of Villa\u2019s scouting team, who had been working at other Premier League clubs then, had been watching Tielemans since he was 16, when he was already captaining Anderlecht. They were aware of positive character references and how well-regarded he was across Europe.\n\n\u201cHe was a coach on the pitch for me,\u201d said Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, who worked with Tielemans at Leicester. \u201cHis view of the game is first class. He is a real top player in mentality and attitude.\u201d\n\nTielemans flourished last season, his second at Villa Park, supported by becoming the team\u2019s chief midfield presence and operating in a compact structure that was based on control, probing in possession, and closing spaces.\n\nEmery asks his players to never pass sideways: only backwards or forwards. Lateral passes are highly risky, offering opponents a chance to intercept and break. This protects Tielemans to some extent, knowing he does not have to chase back to his goal as regularly as he did at Leicester, although he has made significant strides in this area, too.\n\nOffensively, however, is where Tielemans comes into his own. He is heavily involved in Villa\u2019s attacking sequences, as the image below demonstrates. Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins are very much \u201cthe finishers\u201d of attacking sequences, taking a large number of shots and providing incision, while the Belgian tends to add his value a few passes earlier in the move.\n\nTielemans\u2019 best position is as a midfield pivot, though Emery still intends to use him further forward. This will be especially pertinent in the upcoming season, with plans being formed for Kamara and club-record signing Amadou Onana to be paired together, with Tielemans constructing attacks from a more advanced role. \u201cYouri has been around for ages and he helps me and makes certain things easier for me,\u201d said countryman Onana. \u201cOn the pitch and off the pitch, we understand each other very well. You can see it when we play with each other.\u201d\n\nMalleability is a trait Emery looks for in midfielders. He believes Tielemans\u2019 adaptation in his debut season, although rocky, means he is now adept at routinely switching roles, depending on the game. \u201cThis year, he has been more consistent playing as a No 8 or 10,\u201d said the Spaniard. \u201cThose positions are where he can dominate.\u201d\n\nOpposition teams are increasingly standing off Villa\u2019s back line in possession, attempting to block passes centrally. Tielemans, consequently, began drifting to the left last season, offering a passing lane away from such defensive blocks and progressing the ball upfield in a different way.\n\nThis is in contrast to the areas he was occupying in that 2023-24 Villa debut season, when he was largely operating as a right-sided No 10 or, going even further back to the campaign before at Leicester, as a right No 8.\n\nThis is both a result of Emery and the Villa coaching staff designing patterns of play to circumvent opponents\u2019 defensive setups and Tielemans\u2019 intelligence in recognising where the space is in the middle of a match.\n\nHe solves problems quickly. No Villa player made more forward passes than Tielemans last season, nor did anybody at the club make more passes, tackles, or rack up more minutes of game time. More broadly, the Belgian became the first player in the Premier League era to create more than 50 chances and make more than 200 passes into the final third.\n\n\u201cOur best player this season by a mile,\u201d Villa captain John McGinn told TNT Sports last season. \u201cHe\u2019s grown as a leader. He does everything right as a professional.\n\n\u201cHe keeps churning out performance after performance, and he\u2019s enjoying it. For us to get him on a free transfer was a massive credit to the club. His first year was a bit stop-start, but he\u2019s a huge player for us and he\u2019s versatile; he can play as a 10, 8 or 6.\u201d\n\nHaving entered the final two years of his contract, an extension of that deal will be on the agenda come the end of the summer window next month. Discussions have not yet begun, but Villa\u2019s senior figures are making concerted efforts to tie down players considered important to future plans.\n\n\u201cHe is a really competitive guy,\u201d said Emery. \u201cHis commitment is fantastic. Last year, he was adapting and progressively getting better. But he didn\u2019t play like (he does) now.\u201d",

      "text": "Will the return of Rodri propel Manchester City back to the top of the table? Is this the year Manchester United finally regain their status as a genuine Premier League power? How will a tragic summer affect Liverpool on the pitch? Can the promoted teams break the pattern of recent seasons and stay up?\nAdvertisement\nThe 2025-26 season kicks off on Friday and what better way to start the week than by looking ahead to what might be in store over the coming months.\nWe asked all of our writers to submit their predicted Premier League table \u2014 you can see that a little further down this article. (We won\u2019t name the person who had Manchester United finishing in the relegation places \u2014 for now, at least.)\nWe also asked Oliver Kay, Adam Crafton, Tim Spiers, Nick Miller, Simon Hughes, Stuart James, The Athletic FC podcast host Ayo Akinwolere and Cerys Jones to gaze into their crystal balls and go a little deeper on some of the key topics.\nLet us know if you agree in the comments and we definitely won\u2019t be holding the writers to their predictions come May. Honest.\nWho will be much better than last season?\nKay: Manchester United simply have to be, but I\u2019ll look across the city and say Phil Foden, who had such a difficult time last season. I\u2019m always wary of that \u201cclass is permanent\u201d maxim because there are so many cases that suggest the opposite, but I hope and believe Foden will be energised by a summer\u2019s break, even if it was shorter than would have been ideal.\nCrafton: Strange to say about a team who finished second, but I found Arsenal frustratingly sloppy at times last season. They look a much more complete squad this time around, with additions in key positions, and perhaps Eberechi Eze still to come. There really doesn\u2019t look to be a gap in their armour, so Mikel Arteta must have his team firing from the very start to secure the silverware his reign merits.\nSpiers: Manchester City\u2019s biggest problems last season were rooted in their creaky, Rodri-less midfield. With Rodri back and the dynamic Tijjani Reijnders on board, plus some fine additions in the two Rayans \u2014 Cherki and Ait-Nouri \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t be much improved.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Tottenham. Which admittedly isn\u2019t saying much, considering they lost more than half their games and finished 17th last season. But if any team needs a manager who will fashion some square holes for their square pegs, rather than trying to ram them into round ones, it\u2019s Spurs: hello, Thomas Frank.\nHughes: Spurs. Otherwise, they might be relegated.\nJames: The bar\u2019s not set very high for Manchester United and Spurs to be \u201cmuch better\u201d than last season. The temptation is to say that Spurs, under Frank, will be the biggest climber. But I\u2019m going to roll the dice and suggest United, with no European football, will be around the top six.\nAkinwolere: Crystal Palace, assuming they\u2019re able to keep Eze. I really like Oliver Glasner as a coach. I\u2019ve watched some of their pre-season games and they have been impressive.\nJones: Manchester United, surely, if only because the bar is so low. I have been saying this since I was studying for my GCSEs and should probably know better by now. Joking aside, this Europe-less season and the new-look front line feel like fertile ground for a rebuild.\nWho will be worse than last season?\nKay: Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest and Brentford could all be excused a slight drop-off after exceeding expectations last season, particularly as the first two will have European commitments to contend with. Brentford are the ones at risk of a steep drop-off. Frank is such a hard act to follow for Keith Andrews.\nCrafton: I am a little worried about Bournemouth, who have lost Kepa Arrizabalaga, Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen, and seem to be losing Illia Zabarnyi and Dango Ouattara. Andoni Iraola is a super coach, but that\u2019s a hefty rebuild and replacements may not be through the door until the season starts. I\u2019d also expect a substantial drop-off at Nottingham Forest towards mid-table.\nAdvertisement\nSpiers: Recent history tells us Manchester United take very good/promising players and turn them into disasters (Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho, Andre Onana, Mason Mount etc). All the best, then, to xG overachievers Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Team-wise, it has to be PSR botherers Aston Villa, who look chaotic.\nMiller: Newcastle. At the time of writing, they don\u2019t have a striker who actually wants to play for them, have strengthened in a couple of positions they were already fine in, and their transfer targets are all picking other teams. Not ideal when you have the Champions League to deal with, too.\nHughes: Brentford. Yes, they\u2019re a well-run club, but they\u2019ve replaced the manager who got them into the Premier League for the first time and kept them there for years with someone who, not so long ago, was a talking head on Sky\u2019s EFL coverage. He has made a huge jump.\nJames: Nottingham Forest (seventh) and Chris Wood (20 Premier League goals) have got their work cut out to maintain the same level. But it\u2019s hard to look beyond Brentford, who have lost their manager, their top goalscorer, and their captain. Fair play to Andrews if he proves us all wrong.\nAkinwolere: You have to worry for Brentford, with many key components missing in the team. Frank, Mbuemo, Christian Norgaard and possibly Yoane Wissa. It feels like an uphill struggle if they\u2019re not able to replace the quality they\u2019ve lost.\nJones: Brentford, for all the reasons mentioned above. If Wissa leaves, too, their attack will look very thin and a top-half finish could be tough.\nWho will win the title?\nKay: The least controversial answer is Liverpool, but there are various unknowns: how the new signings will adapt, whether they\u2019re light in certain areas, and, of course, how the loss of Diogo Jota in such tragic circumstances might affect them.\nI\u2019ll say Liverpool, cautiously, but I wouldn\u2019t discount Arsenal, Manchester City, or \u2014 if they can somehow harden up a bit \u2014 Chelsea, all of whom should be stronger.\nCrafton: Arsenal. It\u2019s about time. He\u2019s almost been forgotten in the blur of the summer, but Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s departure to Real Madrid will be big for Liverpool.\nSpiers: Manchester City had a disastrous 2024-25 season and still only finished 13 points behind Liverpool. They undoubtedly have the best manager, striker and possibly squad in the league, and I think they\u2019ll probably overhaul Liverpool again.\nMiller: Oh god, I\u2019m falling for it again: Arsenal. Broadly because they seem to have actually addressed their problems this summer, rather than Arteta looking at their squad and saying \u201cNo, we just need one more beefy centre-half to play at full-back\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nHughes: Liverpool. I\u2019m not convinced their eye-catching summer in the transfer market results in eye-catching performances straight away because it will probably take time for the team to gel, but they have recruited proven quality and upgrades in most positions.\nJames: It\u2019s been such a traumatic summer for Liverpool that nobody can be quite sure how they will respond. But my instinct tells me that Arne Slot and his players will develop an even closer bond in the wake of the Jota tragedy and, with the help of some outstanding signings, retain the title.\nAkinwolere: I really want to say Arsenal! Oh, go on then\u2026 Arsenal. As you can tell, I\u2019m not fully convinced, but I have to believe all the pain of consecutive second-place finishes has shown Arteta what he needs to add to this team.\nJones: Liverpool. Arsenal and City\u2019s problems helped them last season, but they have not stood still at the top.

Joao Pedro to Chelsea and Kerkez to Liverpool seem surefire bets.\nSpiers: You can have your flair players, your tricky flickers and your goalscorers all you like, but the best hairy-arsed tackler in the Premier League in recent seasons was Fulham\u2019s Joao Palhinha \u2014 and Tottenham have brought him back to England for peanuts. He could transform their team at both ends of the pitch. Shoutout for Sunderland signing Granit Xhaka, too.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Fair play to whoever is persuading players to join Sunderland, because Xhaka is a hell of a get. Viktor Gyokeres is very \u2018final piece in the jigsaw puzzle\u2019 at Arsenal. Florian Wirtz could turn out to be a sort of super deluxe utility man for Liverpool, and wherever he plays, I think he\u2019ll be magic.\nHughes: Joao Pedro. Chelsea needed a top-class striker and now they have one.\nJames: Wirtz would be an obvious answer. But I\u2019ll throw a left-field name into the mix, purely because I said at the Copa America last summer that Colombia\u2019s Jhon Arias \u201cmust surely be on the radar of top European teams\u201d. It disappoints me that Wolves, 12 months later, haven\u2019t even offered a word of thanks.\nAkinwolere: Gyokeres \u2014 is he really the elite striker Arsenal have been looking for? How will he fit their system? His hunger for goals and his tireless work rate should bode well for a team that struggled to bury key chances last season. I\u2019m not expecting 40 goals, but I am expecting some top-bins bangers.\nJones: Gyokeres. 54 goals in one season speaks for itself. He might need a bit of time to slot into Arsenal and the Premier League, but once he does, he can be the focal point they sorely need. Considering what strikers seem to cost these days, an initial \u00a355m isn\u2019t bad either.\nWhich player are you most looking forward to watching?\nKay: In addition to Wirtz, who is mesmerising, there\u2019s Arias, who enthralled me during the Club World Cup, Cherki at Manchester City, Estevao at Chelsea, and, if the opportunity arises and they\u2019ve done their homework on time, the precocious Max Dowman at Arsenal and Rio Ngumoha at Liverpool.\nCrafton: Cunha at Manchester United. Some players grow a few inches in that jersey, and many more are weighed down by the history and scrutiny. He strikes me as someone who will relish the expectation.\nSpiers: It\u2019ll be fascinating to see if Gyokeres solves Arsenal\u2019s striker conundrum. His uncontrollable, lusty desire for scoring goals is tangible and his numbers are ridiculous, but most of the Portuguese league would be the equivalent of Championship standard and below. Also, Arias at Wolves promises to be high on the fun scale.\nAdvertisement\nMiller: Wirtz. I don\u2019t especially care how many goals he scores or assists he gets or chances he makes. He just moves in such a slinky, elegant way that I\u2019ll be paying attention to him and only him when Liverpool play. I also like the cut of El Hadji Malick Diouf\u2019s gib, although West Ham will probably ruin him somehow.\nHughes: Wirtz. No Liverpool signing has excited me more since the arrival of Fernando Torres.\nJames: Players (plural), if you don\u2019t mind. Wirtz \u2014 what a signing. The incredibly gifted Cherki \u2014 intrigued as to how Pep Guardiola uses him (and, in particular, how much the City manager trusts him off the ball). Last but not least, 15-year-old Dowman. A sensational talent.\nAkinwolere: Joao Pedro in this Chelsea setup looks tasty. If the Club World Cup appearances are anything to go by, \u00a350m could be money well spent.\nJones: I\u2019m always wary of overhyping teenage \u2018prodigies\u2019, but Chelsea\u2019s Estevao is very exciting. He is an unapologetic entertainer and his dribbling, especially for someone so young, is ludicrous. Romantic or naive as it sounds, it\u2019s always intriguing to hear an incoming player describe football as a \u201cspectacle\u201d.\nWhich manager is under the most pressure?\nKay: Not to say his job is under immediate threat, but the pressure on Ruben Amorim to show he can turn Manchester United around is huge nonetheless. They won just seven of his 27 Premier League games last season. The pressure will lift very quickly if his new-look team can hit the ground running. But if they don\u2019t \u2014 and it is far from a gentle start fixture-wise \u2014 it\u2019s going to intensify.\nCrafton: The answer to this is always the Manchester United manager, but Daniel Farke has plenty to prove at the highest level at Leeds, while Eddie Howe is coming through a turbulent summer, and I\u2019m curious to see how and if the dynamics at St James\u2019 Park resolve themselves. Oh, and England head coach Thomas Tuchel. There\u2019s a pretty big tournament coming up.\nAdvertisement\nSpiers: Not necessarily to save his job, but there will be pressure on Frank in what is, after 12 years in management, a huge step up for his first big job. Patience may be in short supply on the back of the enormous high of Spurs ending their trophy drought.\nMiller: No need to overthink this: it\u2019s Amorim. That said, Brentford promoting Andrews from set-piece coach to top man in a summer when they\u2019ve lost two of their best players and a third might go is enough to cause a \u2018mechanic regarding a leaky engine\u2019 sharp intake of breath.\nHughes: Amorim. If United are occupying roughly the same position they finished in last season come November, he\u2019ll be gone.\nJames: Farke could be gone very early in the season \u2014 I don\u2019t see Leeds hanging around if they start poorly. There\u2019s potential for Brentford to make a quick change, too. But, realistically, Amorim goes straight in at No 1. It can\u2019t go on like this, Ruben.\nAkinwolere: Amorim. The buffer of arriving mid-season can only last so long. They have spent a lot of money in attacking areas, but there is still a fair amount of work to do. The fans are impatient and rightly so.\nJones: Amorim. Last season, he had the caveat of arriving earlier than he wanted, and Manchester United\u2019s top brass and supporters have shown him a lot of goodwill. In a campaign with no European football, after being backed so heavily, he has to deliver European qualification at least.\nWho will be top and bottom at Christmas?\nKay: I\u2019m struggling with this one. I know Crystal Palace will finish somewhere between 10th and 15th, but I couldn\u2019t tell you where they or anyone else will be at Christmas. I wouldn\u2019t have predicted this time last year that Liverpool would be four points clear at Christmas with a game in hand. It\u2019s a less predictable league right now and it\u2019s more appealing for that.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: Arsenal top, Burnley bottom. Burnley\u2019s opening seven games are brutal and threaten to immediately undermine whatever Scott Parker is seeking to build.\nSpiers: Liverpool have the best XI but it may take some time for their signings to gel, so Manchester City will be top. Burnley\u2019s promotion was built on an insanely good defensive record but they\u2019ve lost a couple of key players and \u2014 call me crazy \u2014 but Armando Broja (two goals in 43 Premier League appearances) might not fire them to safety.\nMiller: Arsenal top, Brentford bottom. Gyokeres has quite a \u2018hit the ground running\u2019 vibe to him, so I think Arsenal will be strong in the first half at least. Brentford will have sacked Andrews in around November, but the revival under Sean Dyche won\u2019t have quite started by Christmas.\nHughes: Arsenal (I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll win it) and Leeds, who will have a new manager by that point if this is the case.\nJames: I\u2019ll answer this in reverse order because I feel slightly more confident of that part of the prediction: Burnley. Top? Realistically, it\u2019s one of four: Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Donald Trump\u2019s Chelsea. Liverpool it is.\nAkinwolere: Liverpool have done a lot of their business early and I think Arsenal and Manchester City will take time to find their flow this time around. It\u2019s hard to look past the newly promoted teams at the bottom. But I\u2019ll go for Brentford.\nJones: Liverpool have given themselves plenty of time to bed in new signings, so they should start strongly; I agree with Ayo that Arsenal and Manchester City will need longer to settle. Sunderland have spent a lot, but not on their defence, which could see them fall behind the pack quickly.\nWill any of the three promoted teams survive?\nKay: Yes. It\u2019s been alarming to see the three promoted clubs go straight back down again in the past two seasons, but I\u2019ll be the cheery voice for once and say I can see two or perhaps even all three of Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland surviving this time. How \u2014 and at whose expense \u2014 I\u2019m less confident about. Unlike some, I think it\u2019s a dauntingly strong league.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: I do think the Premier League is better with Leeds and Sunderland in it \u2014 and more clubs from the north in general \u2014 so I would love to see it. But it\u2019s such a big gap. The promoted clubs should remember that teams like Brentford, Brighton and Bournemouth began their Premier League journeys playing very pragmatic football to earn their right to stay in the division.\nSpiers: Sunderland have done the best summer business, although they also had the most ground to make up. Leeds probably have the best chance and there are obvious vulnerable prey to catch, including Brentford post-Frank and also Wolves, who have been circling the drain for three years and not done much about it.\nMiller: I would have said Burnley, on the basis of their extraordinary defence last season, but selling James Trafford will kick a hole in that. Sunderland have spent a fair bit, but they need essentially all of those moves to go right for them. Leeds are interesting, but at the time of writing, probably don\u2019t have quite enough. That said, Brentford and Wolves will probably be bad, and I think Fulham could regress, so one of the new lot will probably stay up\u2026 I\u2019m just not going to commit to one! Sorry!\nHughes: No, but Burnley have the best chance if they are able to defend as they did last season and perform generally as uncompromisingly as they did when Dyche was there.\nJames: Leeds and Sunderland have the potential to be more competitive than Ipswich Town, Leicester City and Southampton last season. Leeds on the basis of\u2026 well, just being Leeds and making Elland Road a bit of a fortress. Sunderland, on the face of it, have done some very good transfer business. If I had to pick one\u2026 see my final answer, mate.\nAkinwolere: Sunderland have spent a lot of money, but that often doesn\u2019t equal survival. I\u2019m excited by the signings of Simon Adingra and Xhaka, though. Parker struggled at the helm with both Fulham and Bournemouth last time he managed in the Premier League, as did Farke with Norwich City. With Manchester United and Tottenham having such bad seasons and still surviving last time out, you worry about the financial and quality gap already created by the established teams.\nJones: Leeds and Burnley haven\u2019t added enough quality, and while I would love to believe Sunderland\u2019s record spending could save them, the jump in quality after eight years away feels insurmountable and they haven\u2019t reinforced their defence enough. A Cunha-less Wolves could fall far enough to give one side a lifeline, though.\nThe Manchester City case has still not been resolved. What does that mean for the season?\nKay: I don\u2019t know what it means for the season. I think the repercussions are felt more widely in the sense that people doubt English football\u2019s ability and authority to implement its rules and regulate its clubs. That\u2019s not a new story, but it\u2019s a worrying one because, whether you like the rules or not, the alternative is anarchy.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: The players who may have benefited from some of the earliest alleged breaches have now retired, while the charges begin to feel so drawn-out, so historic, that anyone who continues to bang on about City or scrutinise the club is depicted as being very boring or having a vendetta. But when this thing ever gets resolved, in whichever direction, it will be humongous.\nSpiers: Well, certainly nothing for City, who have spent money in 2025 like it\u2019s going out of fashion. It\u2019ll hang over the season like a Manchester raincloud and, frankly, it\u2019s ludicrous that it\u2019s gone on this long.\nMiller: That we\u2019ll have even more weak banter centred around the number 115, and news stories roughly every three weeks that say \u2018Manchester City\u2019s case could be resolved this week\u2019. I suggest nobody engages with this until it\u2019s actually done: your life will be much more pleasant.\nHughes: Nothing. Life will continue as it has ever since the investigation started.\nJames: More regular questions over the fence from my (lovely and retired) Manchester City-supporting neighbour as to whether I\u2019ve heard anything. The whole saga is tiresome (the case, that is, not talking to my neighbour).\nAkinwolere: That I\u2019ll try my best to show enthusiasm for the subject on the podcast, and Matt Slater will try his best to be enthused by the fact that nothing has changed.\nJones: That we will be answering \u2018The outcome of Manchester City\u2019s case is still under appeal, so what does that mean for the season?\u2019 this time next year \u2014 that is, if it\u2019s even got that far.\nWhich game in the opening weeks will tell us a lot about the season to come?\nKay: There are some big games early on, but Liverpool versus Arsenal on August 31 jumps out. Both will have had a tough-looking away game by then (at Newcastle and Manchester United respectively), so either of them could come out of that game looking like champions-elect or seeming vulnerable, whether that is fair or (as I suspect) not.\nAdvertisement\nCrafton: Newcastle versus Liverpool in the second week. And, sorry Eddie, I am not available to play up front.\nSpiers: August 24, Everton versus Brighton. Will Hill Dickinson Stadium be a shiny modern fortress for Everton, or was it the tight, thunderously atmospheric Goodison Park that was keeping them afloat all these years? More importantly, will the acoustics at the new stadium reverberate boos like Goodison did?\nMiller: There have been plenty of positive noises coming from those who have watched Manchester United in pre-season, and a front three of Cunha, Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko is potentially quite sexy. But if they get bulldozed by Arsenal on the first weekend\u2026 cue the beleaguered Portuguese man in the hoodie declaring they should just be relegated now.\nHughes: It will be interesting to see how the Club World Cup impacts the performances and results of the teams that competed in it. On one hand, they might be better prepared at the start and tire later. On the other, they might not be as fresh.\nJames: Opening weekend, never mind opening weeks. Manchester United versus Arsenal. Mbeumo, Sesko and Cunha \u2014 let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got. As for Arsenal, are they finally going to win the title again, and is Gyokeres the missing piece? (A sentence I never thought I\u2019d type when I watched him score a long overdue first Swansea goal in January 2021).\nAkinwolere: It all starts on the opening weekend for me, and Manchester United versus Arsenal is big for both clubs. Arteta needs to win big this season, as does Amorim. These two need to hit the ground running and both have fanbases that want to see improvement.\nJones: Week five looks fun: Manchester United versus Chelsea will test Champions League ambitions and Wolves versus Leeds hints at whether we can expect a proper relegation battle. Most of all, Arsenal versus Manchester City helps establish if either will emerge as a clear challenger to Liverpool, or if they will just fight each other for second.\nThe thing we\u2019ll all be saying in May is\u2026\nKay: What next for Marcus Rashford/Jack Grealish/Raheem Sterling as he heads back to Manchester United/Manchester City/Chelsea after his loan spell?\nCrafton: The tickets for the World Cup are HOW MUCH?\nSpiers: Will Manchester City\u2019s 115 charges case be resolved this week?\nMiller: I wish I hadn\u2019t fallen for the Arsenal thing, again\u2026\nHughes: Time to put your feet up, Pep.\nAdvertisement\nJames: Fair play to you, Ange Postecoglou, for keeping Leeds up.\nAkinwolere: Chelsea have got their eye on another 10 players to bolster the squad ahead of next season, with more outgoings still to come.\nJones: With Premier League Golden Boot winner Harry Maguire up front, nothing can stop England. It\u2019s coming home.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Dan Goldfarb)"

      "text": "Analysis sessions to Unai Emery are what hairdryers were to Sir Alex Ferguson.\nOr what electricity was to Benjamin Franklin, gravity to Isaac Newton.\nYou get the idea. In short, Emery, 53, is renowned for his meticulous analysis. Every player talks about it and every person who has witnessed the very many meetings describes their distinctiveness.\nAdvertisement\nOn Tuesday night, Villa return to the scene of the crime against Club Brugge, having been to Belgium once this season, delivering one of their worst performances under Emery. Analysing what went wrong will be a key part of the preparations for the Champions League last-16 tie.\n\u201cEmery\u2019s attention to detail is the best I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, says one highly experienced member of staff who has worked across several clubs and, like every other person quoted in this piece, has spoken to The Athletic on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships.\nThe Spaniard is known to hold team meetings for up to 90 minutes and even have two to three on the day of the game to drill the players\u2019 responsibilities into them. As well as individual unit meetings, one session specifically focuses on set plays. Players stay in a hotel the night before home and away games, regardless of when kick-off is. They have a set schedule for when they are expected to arrive if they are travelling there themselves, enabling Emery time for each meeting to take place.\nHe leans on analysis sessions for a multitude of reasons, not just to prepare for opponents or intricately explain the nuances of his system. One player has said Emery\u2019s intense attitude towards preparation came as a shock and had to adjust.\n\u201cThere were two meetings today,\u201d Morgan Rogers said after Aston Villa\u2019s victory against Bayern Munich. \u201cWe are used to it. That\u2019s why we win games \u2014 we go through everything. We know what every player\u2019s traits are.\u201d\nEmery\u2019s lengthy presentations are partly designed to test players\u2019 concentration but there remains total buy-in. Since Emery\u2019s arrival, recruits must be viewed as psychologically robust in order to cope with Emery\u2019s intensity.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do meetings because we are together all day,\u201d Monchi, president of football operations, told Movistar in November. \u201cWe meet for breakfast, for lunch, we live here, we are here all day, we spend 12 or 13 hours practically together.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nTypically, Emery holds three pre-match meetings in the lead-up to a matchday. The first is to reflect on a previous fixture, showing players where they did well and areas of improvement. The next meeting then drills into the opponent\u2019s tendencies and traits, instilling what solutions can be sought to combat their strengths. During this, Emery explains each player\u2019s responsibility and key functions.\nFinally, the last meeting is used as a motivational tool, designed to spark his squad for the match. It will be the closing message and tap into a personal side, wanting to inspire players and remind them of how good they are and can be.\nEmery\u2019s exhaustive methodology meant early results were integral in getting senior players onside after his appointment in October 2022. The difference in preparation between him and his predecessor Steven Gerrard was vast, with players and staff now being asked to sit through long meetings before games.\nRegardless, towards the end of 2024, Emery recognised the importance of lessening his intense approach, helping to offset player burnout. Emery has made efforts to ease the pressures on players, giving extra days off in the week leading into games and citing the importance of rest. He has held individual talks to gauge players\u2019 mood.\nOn matchdays, Emery brings his own whiteboard which he lays out in the changing room. Before presentations, he will invariably write out \u2018REST\u2019 in capital letters on the whiteboard.\nThe reliance on analysis has swelled this season. Less time to train has meant more days spent indoors recovering, with analysis forming an increasing part of the schedule. Work on the pitch has often been reduced to walkthroughs, where players are stationed in the shape Villa will deploy in the next match. Emery has held meetings in the gymnasium, with players sitting on mats and gym boxes.\nAdvertisement\nThe Villa manager does his analysis on top of what his six analysts do in preparation for games, before then comparing notes. Often, he will watch footage of upcoming opposition on the treadmill or a static bike, more preferably.\nLast season, one source joked how Emery would work past 8pm on Fridays, which would eat into his staff\u2019s weekend plans. On another occasion, one signing arrived late into the night at Bodymoor Heath to finalise paperwork and could see Emery upstairs, in his office, looking at his tactics board.\n\u201cHe is just so driven,\u201d said midfielder John McGinn after Villa\u2019s 2-0 Champions League win against Bologna in October. \u201cI have never met anyone like him. He has said a few times he was an OK footballer but he wishes he had the determination and work rate he has as a manager. No one can question what he puts in, the effort \u2014 everything that comes his way and our way is on the back of hard work. You feed off your leader. He is our leader and we feed off that.\u201d\nEmery has altered the way Villa analysts work this season. Instead of half of the analysis team working on the game ahead \u2014 three staff members focusing on the next game, with the other three preparing the one after \u2014 this term, they all gravitate towards the next game, but divide duties.\nSome of the analysts, for example, concentrate on goalkeeper analysis, others then drill dead-ball situations, who then, in turn, feed into set-piece coach Austin MacPhee\u2019s own analyst, Jose Rodriguez Calvo. The rest concentrate on the opposition, identifying how they press, team shape and detectable build-up patterns.\nThere have been instances throughout the season where each analyst has been at Bodymoor Heath on a Sunday, the day after a match. This time is spent preparing the relevant video clips for Emery to study the next day, in time for an upcoming Champions League fixture, such as the one against Club Brugge.\nThe overall process tends to work in a chain-like manner, with the footage compiled being sent to Victor Manas, Emery\u2019s long-serving analyst. Manas will then refine the analysis, adding his observations and creating an opposition report for the next 90-minute meeting. Together, he and Emery watch each opponent at least five times before imparting information to players.\nEmery will study footage wherever he is inside Bodymoor, sometimes watching opponents while cycling or running. He uses his own software, which can be quite limited compared to more modern analytical programming others use, though it works for him.\nOn that software, Emery annotates Manas\u2019 clips, putting notes over the top of his analysis on how Villa can combat an opponent\u2019s system. To the untrained eye, the presentation can look messy, yet players understand what he wants. There are no other words on the presentations, just annotations overlapping.\nAdvertisement\nThe fact he does his own analysis, on top of his six staff, is an extra workload, but Emery is always diligent in comparing notes.\nWhen he arrived, some sources felt Emery was potentially humouring them and their efforts, given he does a lot of their work himself. However, they swiftly realised that Emery prefers a second opinion on what he sees and often tests their observations. This includes who they predict will be in the opposition\u2019s XI. He tends to go into their room a couple of days before matches and initiate discussions.\nEmery doubles down on his principles and work ethic when on a bad run of form, such as the present downward trajectory away from home, with eight defeats in 10 matches. He will be more studious than ever, watch more clips and be more introspective in finding solutions.\nA prominent part of his managerial success is how he can transfer his messages onto players. It is a formula built up through decades of coaching and will have to be leaned on before Villa\u2019s rematch in Bruges.\n(Top photo: Darren Staples/AFP via Getty Images)"
