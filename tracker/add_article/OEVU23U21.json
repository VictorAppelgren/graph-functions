      "summary": "A U.S. court ruled that Google will not be forced to divest Chrome or Android, but will face limits on exclusive search deals and data sharing with rivals, citing the rise of generative AI as a competitive force. The decision requires Google to open parts of its search index to competitors over six years while protecting advertising data. Alphabet shares jumped over 8% in after‑hours trading, and Apple rose about 3%, reflecting market optimism that the ruling preserves the Google‑Apple search partnership and opens the door for deeper AI collaboration. Google plans to appeal, and the case may ultimately reach the Supreme Court.",
