      "feedback": "The draft achieves a coherent macro-to-policy throughline and anchors key moves (CPI 2.7%, a likely Sep 50bp cut, dollar/credit-spread tilts, and a quality-growth tilt evidenced by the JUST Capital signal), but it needs a world-class upgrade in structure, rigor, and sourcing. Actionable edits: (1) anchor the reasoning in a transparent first-principles frame (inflation persistence and the real-rate differential drive discount rates, which in turn drive equity valuations and credit spreads) and quantify the sensitivity of P/E, spreads, and loan pricing to a 50bp cut; (2) replace or supplement narrative “quality signals” (e.g., IBM AI productivity blips, 12–18% justness premium) with explicit, source-backed metrics (e.g., ROIC, cash conversion, or earnings-quality indicators) and tie each to a visible channel; (3) implement a formal three-horizon scenario with explicit probabilities (base/upside/downside) and clear triggers (e.g., CPI moves beyond a defined band, September outcome deviates by more/less than X bps, or dollar moves beyond Y%); (4) convert catalysts/triggers into testable thresholds with timing, and add invalidation rules (what would disconfirm the thesis); (5) tighten quantification and unify ranges across sources (CPI, dollar move, spread compression, oil supply/demand, energy margins) and explicitly reconcile conflicts, for example between oil oversupply (J99EM2TPZ) and inflation persistence; (6) expand coverage to critical signals from IEA oil outlook and tariff/regulatory developments (RHXDOHQQX, 9W8ZUIBDY) and present a clear watch-list of 4–6 signals with stated thresholds; (7) ensure every numerical claim has a source tag, and flag any assumptions as such; (8) prune hedges and align language with SECTION FOCUS by delivering a concise cross-topic synthesis plus a concrete watch-list, keeping to the same nine IDs and avoiding any unanchored statements.",
