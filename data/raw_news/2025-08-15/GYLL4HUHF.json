  "title": "Trump and Putin Have Different Goals for Anchorage Summit",
  "description": "Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will measure success at their summit in Alaska very differently, even as both leaders are already looking toward a second meeting. The US president sees any kind of ceasefire in Ukraine as a key objective of the talks. For the Russian leader, getting face time with Trump on American soil without having made any concessions on the war is already a win. Those are the contrasting stakes as both leaders head to Anchorage for their first summit since 2018 in Helsinki. Monica Duffy Toft, Professor of International Politics for The Fletcher School at Tufts University, joins Bloomberg Businessweek Daily to discuss. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "So I think it's too soon to tell. I'm speculative in that piece because Putin and President Putin and President Trump are still developing or redeveloping their relationship, which is why all of our eyes in August are on Alaska, because a lot rides on this. And the question is, is whether the two of them are going to make the decision that they're going to be the grand, you know, power brokers here or whether they are going to invite Zelensky and President Zelensky of Ukraine, maybe invite in the Europeans who have a vested interest in this as well. So I think we're all curious to see what sort of bilateral, unilateral decisions these two leaders make at this particular juncture, at this important point in the war, and then also in their relationship. I mean, this is the first time that Putin has met with an international leader, much less an American leader, since he started that war in Ukraine. So it's a big moment for us. You know, Monica, one thing I do want to mention, as you talk about kind of the roles of each, is that we did hear from we didn't hear, but we know that Fox News Bret Baer was on the plane with President Trump and did an interview and the president said, I can set the table to negotiate the deal. It's not for me to negotiating a deal for Ukraine. The next meeting will be with Ukrainian President Zelensky, President Putin and probably me. So it sounds like he's already managing expectations already, maybe potentially setting the table for that second meeting. Monica, tell us about. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Okay. Tell us more. And I think that that's right. I mean, look, they're trying to set expectations because, of course, he's not the only party to this. And we've seen that that Putin is a very good negotiator and that he has a strong will, just like President Trump does. So. So again, it's early days, but you never know what can happen with these two. So sorry. Back to you. Talk to us about spheres of influence. What exactly how do you define that term? Why is it so relevant right now? Spheres of influence to kind of understand that concept as we see these two major world leaders meet for the first time in a long time? You know, so we're living in sort of a different moment than we were during the height of the Cold War, in the sense that we knew what the spheres of influence were. They were bipolar, the Soviet Union in the Warsaw Pact. They were sort of settled in the East. And then then you had the United States and its Western allies. And we're in this liminal moment where you've got Russian President Putin, Putin, who has made it very clear that he would like to reestablish authority in parts of the Soviet Union, if not the entire expanse of what was once the Soviet Union. And Ukraine is part of that. He's made that very clear in his writings and, of course, in his actions. And then President Trump has made it clear that he would like for the United States to assert authority and have more influence and control, not necessarily abrogating the sovereignty of other states, but having more control over portions where he feels as if the United States should have more influence. And that's the talking about Greenland. They're talking about the Panama Canal. And so you have a moment and then, of course, we could bring in Chinese President Xi, who does you know, China does not recognize Taiwan as an independent state. And so what you have is these leaders who are openly speaking about the possibility of rearranging territory, something that we thought had been settled since at least 1945 after World War Two, and openly talking about the possibility of territory and getting territory under control, either through the use of force, which Putin is doing or through sort of exertion of sort of power. The United States has a lot of trade power, has a lot of military might. And so you see this sort of saber rattling on the on on the Russian side. And then on the US side, you see President Trump having no qualms about using the U.S. economic strength to be able to try to get others to bend the U.S. his way, including our allies. And he did that in his first administration, wasn't so successful. But he is appearing with his tariff regime to be more successful this time around. Well, you know, you get to this point and there's the potential that this is a second Yalta moment and a carving up of the world. President Trump, earlier on his way to Alaska on Air Force One, talked to reporters about, you know, a cease fire, his goals here and how Europe played into this. Let's just play that back for everybody. There's nothing set in stone. I want certain things. I want to see a cease fire. This is not to do with Europe. Europe's not telling me what to do, but they're going to be involved in the process, obviously, as well. So that's great. But I want to see a cease fire rapidly. I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today. All right. That, again, was President Trump en route to Alaska earlier today. Monica Duffy Toft is still with us, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. So the president there, Monica, is saying this is not nothing to do with Europe. Europe's not telling me what to do, but they're going to be involved in the process, obviously, as well. A little bit of a mixed message there. Is Europe going to be involved in your view? And we've just got about a minute left here. Sure. So what's interesting about the cease fire is that could be a quick visible win for President Trump. And Putin can agree to that. He's already agreed to other cease fires and he hasn't abided by those. And what's interesting is if you look at the four parties that we've talked about and we can also include China as the fifth, that is the one point of convergence that everybody wants a cease fire, Right. Everybody wants the violence to end at this particular moment. And then once we do that, we can take a breath. But cease fires without enforcement is sort of like coffee breaks for militaries. The question is, how is it going to be enforced? And to the two, so far to date, we have not seen any of these cease fires enforced. However, for President Trump, he can get that headline that he has now maybe gotten a guarantee or some sort of promise and then we can work on with Zelinski and the Europeans about enforcing that. President Putin has gotten a photo op of recognition with a major regional leader, the United States. And then Zelinski, at least he is getting a heard. He's not going to be eaten at the meal. Right. That he's actually being heard, even though he's not at the table. If they actually do agree to this next meeting with him.",

  "summary": "The first time Putin has met with an international leader since he started the war in Ukraine with an American leader since then, this is a big moment for both Putin and President Trump. The question is whether the two leaders will make significant decisions regarding bilateral, unilateral decisions at this crucial time in the war. This is also the first time they have met since Putin started the Ukraine war. The two leaders are also trying to set expectations for each other, with reports suggesting that Putin is a good negotiator and has a strong will, just like President Trump does. The author suggests that this is part of a broader discussion about spheres of influence, with Putin's focus on reestablishing authority in parts of the Soviet Union and Ukraine, while President Trump wants the United States to have more influence and control over portions where he feels it should.",
