  "title": "Keegan Bradley\u2019s surprising decision says a lot about his Ryder Cup captaincy",
  "description": "No captain has ever been in the predicament Bradley was in over the last year, and there was temptation to lean in and choose himself.",
  "content": "FRISCO, Texas \u2014 All of his life, Keegan Bradley has been on the outside looking in.\n\nHe\u2019s from Vermont, somewhere no other PGA Tour player is from. His only college scholarship offer was from St. John\u2019s, hardly known for its golfing prowess. When he did have success, when he did earn his PGA Tour card and perform well, when he got Presidents and Ryder Cup team invitations, he still somehow was never on the inside.\n\nBradley was told for a decade that he was not good enough, not a part of this. Cast aside, as the Americans\u2019 plan changed every two years but never included him. The worst of it was two years ago, Bradley\u2019s golf clearly making him deserving of the 2023 Ryder Cup team, but still not enough in the face of Zach Johnson\u2019s bro-centric captaincy. Insult to injury was that it all played out in front of Netflix cameras.\n\nIt was humanizing, that moment, but for only one of the men involved. As Bradley collapsed onto the arm of his couch and his wife consoled him, it was impossible not to feel something for Bradley. To then wonder what it would be like to have a man who cared that much to be the captain, what would be possible. He was not the first choice, keeping in the story of Bradley\u2019s career, but he could be the right one.\n\nYou have to understand all of that to understand what the temptation must have felt like for Bradley to pick himself for this Ryder Cup team, and what courage and character it took to choose six other men instead to represent the United States next month at Bethpage Black.\n\n\u201cKeegan \u2026 will continue to do whatever he feels like is best for the team, and that\u2019s what he did,\u201d said Justin Thomas, one of Bradley\u2019s captain\u2019s picks.\n\nIf Bradley had sat there on Wednesday in the PGA of America headquarters and watched as his bag was placed on the stage, it would not have been without merit. He\u2019s played better golf recently than at least one member of this team, and he was in the top 12 of the points standings, after all. Plenty, including the president, were behind him.\n\nBut it was all giving just a bit too much Jeremiah \u2014 choosing the me before the we \u2014 and in the end, Bradley may just be more of a Conrad.\n\n\u201cI grew up wanting to play Ryder Cups. I grew up wanting to fight alongside these guys. It broke my heart not to play. It really did,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cYou work forever to make these teams, but ultimately, I was chosen to do a job. I was chosen to be the captain of this team. My ultimate goal to start this thing was to be the best captain that I could be.\n\n\u201cThis is how I felt like I could do this.\u201d\n\nNo captain, American or European, has ever been in the predicament Bradley was in over the last year, and therefore, there was temptation to lean into the golfer\u2019s ego and choose himself. \u201cI think you really need to think about it,\u201d Bradley said when I asked him if he\u2019d suggest the PGA of America pick another in-prime golfer to be captain again anytime soon, which says it all about what he faced.\n\nDoes it not?\n\nBradley did allow that there were moments along the way that he thought the best thing was for him to play and turn over parts of his captaincy to his vice captains, particularly after he won the Travelers Championship in June.\n\nHowever, it became clear to him, in time, that more and more Americans were playing well enough that he was no longer necessary, and by the time last week\u2019s Tour Championship came along, he knew he would not be the first playing captain since Arnold Palmer. Telling The Athletic\u2019s Gabby Herzig, \u201cI\u2019m more worried about the Ryder Cup than my own game\u201d on Thursday supports that.\n\nHow close did it really come? Only a small group knows the whole truth for themselves. The skeptic could suggest there were elements of the last week suggesting Bradley is akin to the college athletic director insisting they only offered the job to one coach, even though at least three others publicly turned them down.\n\nBut Bradley got there. He picked Ben Griffin, a Ryder Cup rookie who not even he saw coming less than a year ago, instead of himself. There was no one to tell Bradley no \u2014 they\u2019re called captain\u2019s picks for a reason.\n\nNothing about this assures the United States of a particular result, but it is setting a tone for this group and what they should expect to be asked of them. The Europeans have always known that, however major championships they\u2019ve won, they leave their name at the door to the team room come the Ryder Cup. The Americans have long believed they could be them, and that would be enough.\n\nIt sometimes works \u2014 Whistling Straits in 2021 was utter domination and bombastic through and through \u2014 but Europe wins more of these for a reason, and solving for that is essential to leveling the playing field.\n\nBradley was unequivocally right Wednesday when he said that a captain\u2019s legacy is ultimately result-based, but no matter what happens at Bethpage, we should remember him as the captain who got this decision right.",

  "summary": "Keegan Bradley's decision to captain the United States team for the Ryder Cup has been controversial, as he has been told for a decade that he is not good enough for the team. Despite winning his PGA Tour card and performing well, Bradley was never included in the team plans. He was not the first choice for the 2023 Ryder Cup team, but could be the right one. His decision to choose himself for this team was seen as a sign of his commitment to be the best captain. Despite initially being considered a strong contender for the position, Bradley chose six other men instead of himself. He has played better golf recently and was in the top 12 of the points standings, but still not enough in the face of Zach Johnson\u2019s bro-centric captaincy. Despite these challenges, Bradley maintains his desire to play and turn over parts of his captaincy to his vice captains.",

      "text": "After months of debate, Keegan Bradley is not picking himself. The U.S. Ryder Cup captain announced his final six captain\u2019s picks for next month\u2019s cup on Wednesday, and Bradley left himself off the team.\nThe six spots instead were given to Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay, Sam Burns, Cameron Young and Ben Griffin.\nAdvertisement\nThey will fill out a team that already includes automatic qualifiers Scottie Scheffler, Bryson DeChambeau, Xander Schauffele, J.J. Spaun, Russell Henley and Harris English to face Europe next month at Bethpage Black in New York.\nBradley\u2019s dilemma has become the biggest story in golf in recent weeks, escalating after Bradley\u2019s signature event win at the Travelers Championship in July.\nBradley, 39 and the No. 11 player in the world per OWGR, spent the first year of his captaincy maintaining he\u2019d only pick himself if he qualified on points. But ever since that win, Bradley has changed his tune, saying the win \u201cchanges things\u201d and maintaining that \u201cPretty much everyone outside of our bubble tells me to play.\u201d\nBradley & The Boys Are Ready for Bethpage Black \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8#GoUSA pic.twitter.com/CxSmzjDdUm\n\u2014 Ryder Cup USA (@RyderCupUSA) August 27, 2025\nBradley was famously the last person left off the 2023 U.S. team, a storyline he told with vulnerability for the Netflix documentary \u201cFull Swing.\u201d The series endeared Bradley to the golfing world, a veteran two-time Ryder Cup participant who still cared so deeply about representing his country. Enough so that when the PGA of America decided to change the direction of the U.S. captaincy, it made the surprising decision to turn to Bradley.\nHe\u2019s since played himself back into contention, with two wins in the last 12 months and rising to No. 18 in the DataGolf rankings. Even with his play declining since the Travelers, Bradley had a strong enough case to be considered for a contender to make the team of 12.\nBradley takes pressure off himself\nUltimately, he decided his case wasn\u2019t strong enough to validate the extra pressure and scrutiny of being the first playing captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963.\nWhile established veterans and stars like Thomas, Cantlay and Morikawa were expected to make the team \u2014 and Burns is an experienced cup player who nearly won the U.S. Open in June \u2014 Young and Griffin represent new voices in the room.\nAdvertisement\nYoung is considered a perfect course fit as a distance-chasing bomber who ended the season with a win and a FedEx Cup playoff stretch bested only by Scheffler and Tommy Fleetwood.\nGriffin, on the other hand, may have been the final man on the team. On paper, Griffin has been the fourth-best American in strokes gained data and won two tournaments this summer to launch himself into contention. He finished top 10 at the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open and finished T10 at the Tour Championship last week. His breakout season was enough to convince Bradley.\nUltimately, logic prevailed. It would have been understandable \u2014 and defensible \u2014 for Bradley to pick himself. He is very good. He is experienced. He brings passion. But it doesn\u2019t mean Bradley is so good that it validates making himself the entire focus of the week. It would be a monumental distraction in which a pretty good but not great player is the most scrutinized aspect in the biggest event on the calendar. It\u2019s too much.\nThe good news for the U.S.: Ben Griffin brings all the passion, swagger and energy that Bradley does, and he\u2019s playing far better golf. Griffin is in great form, and he was born to perform and rile up New York crowds the same way the Justin Thomas types do so well. This is the best version of this team, and then the U.S. still has Bradley as an (uncompromised) leader. \u2014 Brody Miller, golf writer\nNew representation will get a chance to shine\nBradley made the right call here, and he most likely made it by going against a lot of the strongest voices within the U.S. Ryder Cup inner circle \u2014 the support was always there. All of the responsibilities of a modern-day Ryder Cup captain would have made a playing captain role incredibly difficult. It\u2019s not just the picks and the player communication on the course \u2014 it\u2019s the mental capacity that it takes to handle the outside pressure and be the representative for the team\u2019s success.\nAdvertisement\nBradley has played well amid the chaos of the lead-up to the event. He won the Travelers, he made a run at the Tour Championship, but he made the selfless decision. Especially because this could have been Bradley\u2019s last real chance to make the team. And in turn, a new face in Griffin will get to prove himself on the biggest stage possible. If there was anyone that might have been left off the team, it appears to have been Griffin who was teetering on the edge.\nHe\u2019ll be a Ryder Cup rookie, but has all the chops to perform when it matters. Young \u2014 a player who has proven success at Bethpage Black and an excellent energy heading into the event \u2014 will also experience his first cup. \u2014 Gabby Herzig, golf writer\n(Photo: Kevin C.

      "text": "Walking down Bourbon Street after midnight with a six-inch rhodium-plated belt around his waist was a golfer this city hardly knew. But Ben Griffin knew who he was and how he felt \u2014 invincible. He walked into some random dive bar in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter to loud cheers of \u201cHey, nice belt!\u201d But they weren\u2019t aware of the significance, nor did they see anything strange about the fashion choice, because around these parts, standing out is fitting in.\nAdvertisement\nThe belt read \u201cZurich Classic Team Champions\u201d along the buckle, with music notes, fleurs-de-lis, gators and Mardi Gras masks decorating the edges. Some six hours earlier, Griffin and his good buddy Andrew Novak won the PGA Tour\u2019s lone team event for their first career wins on tour.\nThat meant it was time for a Sunday night celebration, and fortunately, they were in a place where nothing shuts down early. A tournament official got the duo a table at Galatoire\u2019s, a fine-dining institution on the edge of Bourbon. They ate all night, drinking champagne and gulping down a few old-fashioneds. They roamed the Quarter and popped into bars before ending their evening at Caesars Palace, where Griffin proudly won $45 playing craps.\n\u201cWhat didn\u2019t we do?\u201d he said last week, as he prepared for his first Tour Championship. \u201cThe night was long.\u201d\nIn that moment, Ben Griffin was just another first-time PGA Tour winner, feeling like he broke through by claiming the title at a lower-tier event. There was more media attention on his partner, Novak.\nThe golf world wasn\u2019t aware that this was the beginning of being introduced to a new main character: an aviator-wearing, cocksure-strutting, viral quote-producing personality who has gone from being an afterthought to playing like one of the 10 best golfers in the world. Griffin is a showman, the type of guy who walks off the course telling tales of blacking out from a creatine \u201coverdose.\u201d Who says \u201cbring it on\u201d to evil weather and plays up to crowds. The kind of person who says he\u2019s \u201ctoo blessed to be stressed\u201d as he awaits Wednesday\u2019s big announcement.\nGriffin appears to be a golfer put on Earth to lean into the pandemonium of a Long Island Ryder Cup next month at Bethpage Black, heeding the raucous crowds and staring straight into the pressure-filled moments behind his tinted USwing Mojing shades.\nAdvertisement\nMany have spent the better part of the summer assuming he was a lock for the American team, with two wins, 10 top-10 finishes this season and ninth in the Ryder Cup points standings. But the closer we get to Wednesday\u2019s team announcement, the more speculation rises about Griffin\u2019s status. Especially after U.S. captain Keegan Bradley told Golf Channel on Sunday, \u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be a few guys that think they are going to be on the team that aren\u2019t going to be.\u201d\nAnd Griffin has never been shy about believing in himself. Like when he walked off the course tied for fourth place halfway through the U.S. Open. He did it playing in a group with Bradley, to which the ever-joking Griffin quipped, \u201cYeah, Keegan said whoever was low man after 36 holes was getting on the Ryder Cup, so I guess I\u2019m getting \u2014 I\u2019m just kidding.\u201d\nOr when the PGA Tour posted a video following Griffin during the FedEx St. Jude Championship, and after bumping fists with Bradley, he playfully turned back and whispered, \u201cPick me!\u201d\nUnderstanding Griffin\u2019s career arc is about recognizing this undeniable sense of self-belief. It\u2019s how a golfer who stepped away from golf in 2021 to work as a mortgage loan officer can earn a PGA Tour card a year later and be among the game\u2019s best by 2025. Even when he was playing the obscure starting times along the fringes of a tee sheet, the same chirpy swagger followed. That is what a captain\u2019s pick of Griffin is relying on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just how Ben is,\u201d Novak said.\nNovak still can\u2019t get over a moment three years ago. Griffin was playing a casual round at Sea Island in Georgia, and he was on the heater of all heaters \u2014 11 under with a hole to go. He needed an eagle to shoot 59. Standing in the fairway about 160 yards to the final pin, he had the presence of mind to tell his buddy to start filming. \u201cI\u2019m gonna make this,\u201d he said.\nAdvertisement\nAnd Griffin made it. He holed out from 160, sprinting around the fairway with his eyes bulging before the viral video took the internet.\n\u201cWho does that?\u201d Novak said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nFun to watch!! Had to hole it on the last for 59! @ChillinChico @PGATOUR @PGATOURKevin @GolfChannel @GolfCentral @KornFerryTour @espn @SportsCenter @bengriffingolf https://t.co/3WS1JfuR6q pic.twitter.com/EdmbA8xh9s\n\u2014 Harrison Shih (@hshihgolf) July 9, 2022\nOK, so somebody who believes in themself this much, did he know this season was coming?\n\u201cNot necessarily everything that has happened, but I knew I would be better,\u201d Griffin said in Atlanta. He saw the progress happening, in three years rising from the Korn Ferry Tour to keeping his PGA Tour card to No. 61 in points last season. He saw the benefits of experience. Realistically, he saw himself joining the top 50 in points this season and getting himself into all the signature events.\nBut then he finished in the top 10 three times by March 2. He won the Zurich in April with Novak, at the time one of the hottest players on tour. That seemed to unlock an even greater belief. Eighth place at the PGA Championship. A solo win at the Charles Schwab Invitational. Second place at the Memorial, 10th at the U.S. Open and never stopping after that \u2014 10 top-20 finishes in his final 12 starts. This was no longer a hot streak. Griffin had risen to become the fourth-highest rated American by strokes gained data.\nGriffin\u2019s short game has always been respected \u2014 he says he developed it when his family was crushed by the 2008 recession and he couldn\u2019t spend much on range balls. But he began to chase swing speed. He said his goal is to add a mile per hour each week, slowly improving to 71st in driving distance on the PGA Tour. He now gains strokes off the tee, after three years that were well below the tour average.\nGriffin leans into all these stories about himself. He admits he\u2019s not exactly a grinder, calling himself \u201cmore of a gamer.\u201d He doesn\u2019t turn down media requests. Even if he really is the version of himself he portrays, he still knows how to play it up for the camera. Still, he does slightly pump the brakes on the description.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOff the golf course, I\u2019m not necessarily blaring, like, alpha male,\u201d he jokes with a laugh, \u201cmore just a normal person. But on a golf course, you have to be confident. You have to have a little selfishness in a way, have a ton of self-belief to make it to the Tour Championship.\u201d\nNow, Bradley will have an unenviable decision to make. He\u2019ll have to choose between superstar major winners and inexperienced golfers in far better form. He\u2019ll need to battle course fit versus who\u2019s really playing well. Oh, and he\u2019ll need to decide if he wants to pick himself as a playing captain, a controversial decision no matter which way he leans.\nBut if Griffin is left off, it will likely signify that it was never quite about the golf, because on paper there is no strong argument against him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting summer. I\u2019ve been doing (Netflix documentary) \u201cFull Swing,\u201d I\u2019ve been doing a lot of media, and I feel like every day I get the questions about the Ryder Cup. It\u2019s definitely been an added pressure for me, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s been more on my mind than it probably should be,\u201d Griffin said.\nFor one more day, he\u2019ll have to wait and hope he made his case, something he\u2019s never been shy about doing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough being a bubble guy and being outside that top six, but I played really solid this year,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cHopefully, Keegan sees that and wants me to represent the United States.\u201d\n(Top photo: Kevin C.

      "text": "ATLANTA \u2014 Keegan Bradley is here competing in the Tour Championship, vying for a $10 million winner\u2019s check and the FedEx Cup title, just like everyone else. Except he\u2019s not. Bradley\u2019s mind is elsewhere.\n\u201cI\u2019m more worried about the Ryder Cup than my game,\u201d Bradley told The Athletic, standing in the bowels of East Lake\u2019s clubhouse, after bogeying his final two holes to shoot even par Thursday. \u201cYeah, just trying to get through the week here, get the team set, and go from there.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nOne round gone, three to go.\nThis is the last chance. This is the finale of the mad scramble to complete the back-half of the U.S. Ryder Cup team, and the Tour Championship is its arena. Bradley, the American captain at age 39, is not only at the helm of the decisions that\u2019ll determine the Ryder Cup future of roughly nine players in the tournament\u2019s 30-man field. He\u2019s also choosing his own destiny. And the fact that he\u2019s more concerned about his duties as captain than this event says something.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the biggest decision of my life, one that I\u2019ll probably look back on \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll look back on it. Hopefully, I look back and I made the right choice, but you never know how this ends up. It\u2019s gonna be the right or wrong choice. We\u2019ll see how the Ryder Cup plays out, and what decision we make on Wednesday,\u201d Bradley said.\nAt 12:38 p.m., Bradley teed off at East Lake Golf Club alongside Andrew Novak, an up-and-coming American who made a convincing Ryder Cup case during the first half of the season. Just in front of him on the tee sheet were 2023 team members Sam Burns and Brian Harman, and just behind Bradley was New York native Cameron Young, who launched himself into the Ryder Cup conversation with his first PGA Tour win last month.\nIt\u2019s all happening here in Atlanta with six days to go until Bradley takes the podium at the PGA of America\u2019s headquarters in Frisco, Texas, to make perhaps the most important decision of his career. There\u2019s the question of the hour: Will Bradley select himself to make the team, becoming the first playing captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963? What about the rest of the team?\nSix men on the U.S. team are locked in as automatic qualifiers, as of the conclusion of the BMW Championship: Scottie Scheffler, J.J. Spaun, Xander Schauffele, Russell Henley, Harris English and Bryson DeChambeau.\nAdvertisement\nAt No. 7 and No. 8 in the U.S. standings, Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa \u2014 both tied for third at 6-under after Round 1 at East Lake \u2014 might feel like they\u2019ve made it, but you don\u2019t stop pushing until you know for sure. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever comfortable until you get that call and you\u2019re on the team,\u201d Morikawa said.\nPatrick Cantlay, historically a match-play machine, sits at No. 15 in the standings after a season below his usual standard. Cantlay might not admit it outwardly, but he knows what he needs to do. He played a practice round with Bradley at last week\u2019s BMW Championship, and he started this week well: Cantlay also shot 6-under on Thursday, three behind the leader, Henley.\nBen Griffin, a two-time winner this year and No. 9 in the standings, shot 66 in Round 1 and would be a Ryder Cup rookie. The steady Maverick McNealy is 10th in the standings, and Harman floats along at No. 12. Burns, the best putter on the PGA Tour, lurks, as does Chris Gotterup \u2014 a New Jersey native who became a potential wildcard after his win at the Scottish Open, and his third-place finish at The Open.\nThen there\u2019s Bradley, at No. 11. It\u2019s the same spot he sat in when Zach Johnson, the 2023 Ryder Cup captain, passed over him for the team in Rome.\nWill Bradley the captain do the same thing to Bradley the player? It\u2019s the kind of rare situation that comes with appointing a 39-year-old as Ryder Cup captain.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s got one of the most difficult decisions anyone has ever had to make,\u201d Morikawa said Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s put more hours than we could even ask and know about into this Ryder Cup, and he still has played great golf. He is one of the best Americans as of right now. But I truly do not know where his head sits, and I don\u2019t want to be in that position.\u201d\nIt feels like everything is on the line for the guys on the cusp, but realistically, a performance at this tournament won\u2019t make or break someone\u2019s chances to be on the team. If a player is relying on the Tour Championship to move into real consideration, he wasn\u2019t that high on the captain\u2019s list to begin with. These conversations have been happening for months, and yes, they\u2019ve been ramping up in recent weeks. But Bradley and his team of assistant captains, statistics gurus and advisors are not just talking about who is playing the best golf right now. They\u2019re talking about chemistry between potential pairings \u2014 who plays which golf ball for alternate shot. They\u2019ve begun to get into the weeds.\nAdvertisement\nAnd in those conversations, which are complex to begin with, Bradley is attempting to sit back and evaluate himself. The pressure of selecting a team is one thing. The added pressure of deciding whether or not you are fit to be on it is another.\n\u201cMy vice captains and our analytics team know how to talk about me as if I\u2019m not there. I can handle the negative. I actually would be upset if they held stuff from me,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cI have to be like that in order to put the best team on the course at Bethpage.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a strange predicament, and a mighty one. Many, especially on the European side, have warned that there\u2019s simply too much on the plate of a modern-day Ryder Cup captain, and serving as a playing captain could lead to both a weaker captain, and a weaker 12th player. But Bradley is hearing from left, right and center that he should pick himself: \u201cPretty much everyone outside of our bubble tells me to play.\u201d But Bradley, more than anyone, appears to be aware of the potential ramifications of making the wrong decision, whatever that might be. That\u2019s why Bradley is increasingly thankful that he has Tiger Woods on his side, who, according to the captain, has guided him through the process.\nBradley is treating the decision \u2014 both about himself and the rest of the team \u2014 with the type of commitment that has left him unable to think about anything else.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThe past month has been really tough for me to detach.\u201d\n(Top photo: Kevin C.
