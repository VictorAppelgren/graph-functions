  "description": "iOS 26 has a new Adaptive Power feature that can ensure your iPhone battery lasts as long as possible without giving up much performance.",
  "content": "Battery life is easily one of the iPhone\u2019s most important features. Whether you\u2019re planning to buy the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air, the battery beast iPhone 17 Pro Max, or hold on to your current model, iOS 26 has a new feature coming that can make your iPhone\u2019s battery last longer: Adaptive Power.\n\nAdaptive Power is a new iOS 26 setting to extend battery life\n\nIf your iPhone battery is getting low, iOS has long offered Low Power Mode as a helpful tool.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve heard of some users keeping Low Power Mode on all the time, that\u2019s a pretty extreme option to stretch your iPhone\u2019s battery life.\n\niOS 26 has a much more moderate solution.\n\nAdaptive Power is a brand new battery setting that can ensure your iPhone lasts longer\u2014particularly on the high-usage days.\n\nYou can find it inside the Settings app\u2019s Battery menu under \u2018Power Mode.\u2019\n\nUnlike Low Power Mode, which deactivates lots of features and noticeably degrades your experience, Adaptive Power is all about making small battery gains with minimal impact on performance.\n\nEssentially, on a \u201cnormal use\u201d day, your iPhone battery won\u2019t necessarily be extended much\u2014if at all.\n\nBut when you\u2018re using your iPhone more than usual, Adaptive Power will kick in and make minor adjustments to help stretch your battery longer.\n\nNote: even though Apple doesn\u2019t market Adaptive Power as an AI feature, users running the iOS 26 beta have found that it\u2019s only available on Apple Intelligence-supported devices.\n\nThat means you\u2019ll need an iPhone 16-class model or newer, or an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max.\n\nHave you been using Adaptive Power in the iOS 26 beta? How\u2019s it been working for you? Let us know in the comments.\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)",

      "text": "Next month, the iPhone lineup is getting a brand new model: the iPhone 17 Air. Per various reports, Apple plans to drop its Plus option in favor of an ultra-thin new form factor that could tempt a lot of Pro users. Here are seven features coming to the iPhone 17 Air.\nUltra-thin form factor\nFollowing the trend started by Apple\u2019s M4 iPad Pro, the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s defining feature will be its thinness.\nPer Ming-Chi Kuo and various other reports, iPhone 17 Air will be just 5.55mm thin. Presumably, this measurement does not include the camera bar.\nThis is a massive reduction from current iPhones. The 16 Pro models are 8.25mm thick, while the base 16 and 16 Plus are 7.8mm.\nApple\u2019s thinnest model ever was the iPhone 6, and even that was 6.9mm.\nNew 6.6-inch display\nBeing ultra-thin won\u2019t be the 17 Air\u2019s only hardware advantage over the Pro line. Apple will also give its new model a unique display that could offer the perfect compromise between existing sizes.\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will feature 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays, respectively. These are the same sizes as the 16 Pro line.\niPhone 17 Air, however, will slot in exactly halfway between the two models with a 6.6-inch display. Thanks to its ultra-thin form factor, the 17 Air\u2019s display may still feel small enough for current Pro users while offering just enough space to satisfy Pro Max fans too.\nAlways On and high refresh rate features\nEver since 2022, a big difference between Apple\u2019s entry models and Pro line has involved two display features:\n- Pro models boast an Always On display\n- they also support the 120Hz ProMotion high refresh rate\nThese are the kind of features that, once you get used to them, are hard to go without.\nFortunately, for the first time, Always On and a version of ProMotion are expected to hit the base iPhone 17 and 17 Air.\nI say \u2018a version of\u2019 because rumors have swirled about a possible 90Hz refresh rate display being in the works at Apple. No credible rumor has indicated this will hit the 17 Air, so it\u2019s likely it will get the full 120Hz ProMotion feature.\nA19 Pro chip\nApple giving a new chip to its latest iPhone is always a given. But iPhone 17 Air chip rumors are especially intriguing.\nFor a while, consensus was that the base iPhone 17 and 17 Air would get an A19 chip, while the 17 Pro and Pro Max alone get A19 Pro.\nRecently though, a leaker suggested Apple is putting the A19 Pro in the iPhone 17 Air too\u2014but with one GPU core disabled.\nHow much difference will there ultimately be between these various A19 chips? Probably not a lot for everyday tasks.\nNew design with single rear 48MP camera and four colors\nAs seen in the dummy models above, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to differ from its siblings substantially in the design and camera departments.\nWhile the 17 Pro line again offers three rear cameras, and the base model two, the 17 Air will feature only one: the main 48MP \u2018Fusion\u2019 camera.\nRumors have been minimal around this camera\u2019s features, which could indicate it will be very similar to the existing main camera on the iPhone 16 line.\nAs for the rest of the design, expect four color options:\n- Black\n- Silver\n- Light Gold\n- Light Blue\n24MP front camera\nCurrently, the iPhone\u2019s selfie camera is only 12MP\u2014and gets clearly inferior results to the rear cameras.\nFortunately, Apple is bringing a welcome 24MP upgrade to the front camera on the iPhone 17 Air and all other iPhone 17 models.\nThe new front camera is still unlikely to match the quality of the rear camera, but it should at least close the gap substantially.\nApple\u2019s in-house C1 modem\nFinally, there\u2019s a connectivity change coming to the iPhone 17 Air that could help boost battery life a bit.\nApple\u2019s in-house C1 modem debuted earlier this year in the iPhone 16e, bringing several benefits including a battery improvement.\nOut of the full iPhone 17 lineup, only the iPhone 17 Air will get the new C1 modem.\niPhone 17 Air features: wrap-up\nThe iPhone 17 Air will no doubt be the most exciting fourth model in Apple\u2019s lineup to date. Where the iPhone mini and Plus had their niche groups of loyal fans, the 17 Air seems likely to set the future tone for iPhone design. It\u2019s going to be a fun iPhone 17 launch season.\nWhich iPhone 17 Air features are you most excited about? Do you plan to buy the new model? Let us know in the comments.\nBest iPhone accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)\n- MagSafe Car Mount for iPhone\n- HomeKit smart plug 4-pack\n- 10-year AirTag battery case 2-pack\n- 100W USB-C fast charging power adapter\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Here is the full list of devices that support Apple Intelligence.\niPhones\n- iPhone 16e\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\nMacs\n- M4 MacBook Air\n- M3 MacBook Air\n- M2 MacBook Air\n- M1 MacBook Air\n- M4 MacBook Pro\n- M3 MacBook Pro\n- M2 MacBook Pro\n- M1 MacBook Pro\n- M4 iMac\n- M3 iMac\n- M1 iMac\n- M4 Mac mini\n- M2 Mac mini\n- M1 Mac mini\n- M4 Mac Studio\n- M2 Mac Studio\n- M1 Mac Studio\n- M2 Mac Pro\niPads\n- M4 iPad Pro\n- M2 iPad Pro\n- M1 iPad Pro\n- M3 iPad Air\n- M2 iPad Air\n- M1 iPad Air\n- iPad mini (A17 Pro)\nApple Intelligence features\nApple has released its AI features gradually across several software releases.\nThe first wave of AI features included language tools for AI to analyze your writing and offer revisions in various writing styles, or simply proofread for grammar and spelling. Another early feature was notification summaries, which make notifications more actionable than ever. There are also summary tools in Mail, Safari, and Messages.\nThe first steps of an upgraded Siri also arrived on supported Apple Intelligence devices in iOS 18.1 and 18.2. Some of its most advanced capabilities, though, won\u2019t debut until later in iOS 18.4 and beyond. These include on-screen awareness, cross-app actions, and personal context awareness.\nTop comment by Nozuka\nDon't buy first gen they said... yet the M1 Air is still going strong :)\nApple Intelligence also offers image tools for creating original images via a simple typed description. These include a new Image Playground app and Genmoji.\nNo Vision Pro, Apple Watch, or HomePod support\nApple Intelligence currently requires a compatible iPhone, Mac, or iPad. No other Apple devices support the new technology.\nVision Pro support is reportedly in the works, and perhaps new HomePod models will be powerful enough to host the new Siri. There\u2019s no official support for Apple Intelligence on Apple Watch either, though the Watch does benefit from a couple key AI features.\nIt\u2019s likely that a few years from now, Apple Intelligence will pervade every product Apple sells. But for now, only select iPhones, iPads, and Macs support it.\nBest iPhone accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2\n- 10-year AirTag battery case 2-pack\n- Anker 100W charging brick for fast charging\n- MagSafe Car Mount for iPhone\n- HomeKit smart plug 4-pack\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "In just one month, Apple will unveil its full iPhone 17 lineup. The brand new Air model will get a lot of attention, but Apple also has big changes coming for iPhone 17 Pro Max. I\u2019m tentatively planning to buy a 17 Air, but there are three Pro Max features in particular that could make Apple\u2019s premium iPhone hard to resist.\n#1: Anti-reflective display\nI love a sunny day. More so than the average person, my mood depends heavily on how much sunshine there is, and my ability to get out and enjoy the sun.\nSo I became very excited by the rumor that iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will pack a new, anti-reflective display.\nDepending on how much of a difference Apple\u2019s anti-reflective tech makes, I could see this feature being hugely influential in my iPhone purchase decision.\nFor days in the sun, an iPhone 17 Pro Max with anti-reflective display would be fantastic. Plus, I\u2019d be able to keep brightness cranked up due to this next feature.\n#2: Biggest battery ever\nBattery anxiety, for me at least, has mostly become a thing of the past. Last year\u2019s iPhone 16 Pro brought enough battery improvements that even on the most demanding days, I\u2019ve rarely needed to worry about charging up.\niPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to improve things even further. Even though Apple\u2019s Pro Max model always offers the best battery life, this year\u2019s 17 Pro Max is getting thicker than ever to pack an even bigger battery.\nEven though I\u2019ve been leaning toward an iPhone 17 Air this year, battery struggles on the iOS 26 beta have me second-guessing that choice. I\u2019m sure iOS battery performance will improve before the public launch. But the thought of getting the best battery life ever in an iPhone is now suddenly more appealing.\n#3: Camera upgrades\niPhone cameras are at the point where they can be used to shoot major Hollywood blockbusters. Yet Apple continues making big and small improvements every single year.\nWith iPhone 17 Pro Max, there are potentially a lot of camera upgrades coming. Two solid bets:\n- 24MP TrueDepth front facing camera (up from 12MP)\n- 48MP Telephoto lens (up from 12MP)\nTop comment by Bacon Bits\nI'm all in for the anti reflective display and 8x optical zoom. The first feature has only been done by Samsung and I need more companies to hop on board. My Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn't have this and you can't even find a screen protector with the feature.\nOutside of these sensor changes, which supply chain leaks have made all but certain, there are a variety of other possible improvements.\nRumors include: a second Camera Control button, multi-cam video recording, 8x optical zoom, and a pro camera app. None of these seem as solidly supported as the sensor changes, but they\u2019re certainly possible.\nWhich iPhone 17 Pro Max features are you most excited about? Let us know in the comments.\nFeatured image source: Majin Bu\nBest iPhone accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)\n- MagSafe Car Mount for iPhone\n- HomeKit smart plug 4-pack\n- 10-year AirTag battery case 2-pack\n- 100W USB-C fast charging power adapter\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

  "argos_summary": "Apple\u2019s upcoming iOS 26 introduces Adaptive Power, a subtle battery\u2011saving mode that activates on high\u2011usage days and requires Apple\u2011Intelligence\u2011enabled devices such as iPhone 16\u2011class models. The company is also set to launch the iPhone 17 lineup next month, with the new ultra\u2011thin Air model featuring a 6.6\u2011inch display, 24\u2011MP front camera, and a single 48\u2011MP rear sensor, while the Pro and Pro\u202fMax variants promise anti\u2011reflective screens, larger batteries, and camera upgrades. Apple Intelligence, now beta\u2011available on select iPhones, Macs, and iPads, adds AI\u2011driven writing, notification, and image tools, but is not yet supported on Apple Watch, HomePod, or Vision\u202fPro. Meanwhile, iOS 26\u2019s Low Power Mode remains a manual battery\u2011saving option that reduces background activity and display performance when the battery is low. Together, these updates highlight Apple\u2019s focus on extending battery life, enhancing camera and display technology, and integrating AI features across its ecosystem.",
