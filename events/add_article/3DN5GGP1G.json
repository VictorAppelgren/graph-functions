      "summary": "Apple has confirmed its iPhone 17 event will take place on Tuesday, September 9, with the lineup expected to include a new ultra‑thin iPhone 17 Air, a standard iPhone 17, and Pro and Pro Max models featuring an all‑aluminum chassis, a larger camera island, and a vapor‑chamber cooling system. Rumors suggest the Air will use a titanium frame, a single‑lens camera, and a 2,800 mAh battery, while the Pro models will have 12 GB of RAM and a 48 MP rear camera. Pricing is expected to rise by about $50 across the board, potentially offset by higher storage options and new color releases such as orange and light blue. The event will also likely showcase new Apple Watch models, AirPods Pro 3, and iOS 26 with its “Liquid Glass” design and AI‑powered features. The announcement is poised to impact U.S. and global smartphone markets, with implications for supply‑chain tariffs and consumer pricing.",
