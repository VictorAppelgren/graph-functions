  "title": "Federal court rejects challenge to Oklahoma law banning gender transition treatment for minors",
  "description": "A federal appeals court upheld an Oklahoma law prohibiting gender transition treatment for minors, relying on a Supreme Court decision on a similar law in Tennessee.",
  "content": "The law, Senate Bill 613, makes it a felony for health care workers to provide gender transition treatment such as puberty-blocking drugs and hormones to a minor.\n\nThe bill was passed by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature and signed into law by GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt in 2023.\n\nFive families of transgender children and a physician challenged the state\u2019s law, arguing it violated their constitutional rights.\n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Oklahoma, argued that lawmakers approved the law with discriminatory intent, pointing to a 2022 law that froze pandemic relief funding for the hospital system OU Health unless Oklahoma Children\u2019s Hospital halted gender transition treatment for minors.\n\nA federal judge declined to block the law from taking effect in 2023, writing that transgender medical care for children is \"an area in which medical and policy debate is unfolding\" and the state \"can rationally take the side of caution before permitting irreversible medical treatments of its children.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in June upheld a similar Tennessee ban on transgender-related treatment, a ruling relied upon when the 10th Circuit issued its ruling in Oklahoma on Wednesday, when a three-judge panel ruled unanimously that Oklahoma\u2019s law is constitutional.\n\nThe laws in Tennessee and Oklahoma \"are functionally indistinguishable,\" Circuit Judge Joel M. Carson, an appointee of President Donald Trump, wrote in the order.\n\nThe order says Oklahoma\u2019s law does not violate the Constitution and was not intended to discriminate against transgender children.\n\n\"We recognize the importance of this issue to all involved,\" Carson wrote. \"But this remains a novel issue with disagreement on how to assure children\u2019s health and welfare. We will not usurp the legislature\u2019s judgment when it engages in \u2018earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality, and practicality\u2019 of gender transition procedures for minors.\"\n\n\"While we respect that Plaintiffs disagree with the legislature\u2019s assessment of such procedures\u2019 risks, that alone does not invalidate a democratically enacted law on rational-basis grounds,\" the judge added.\n\nOklahoma's Republican Attorney General Gentner Drummond praised the court\u2019s ruling in a post on social media.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"For years, radical left activists pushed the lie of 'gender transition' procedures for minors. The truth is much simpler: there is no such thing,\" he wrote Thursday on X. \"Today, here in Oklahoma, we celebrate a new decision from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals that recognizes this truth and protects our children. I am proud to have fought this battle and won. This is a victory for our children, for our Constitution, and for common sense.\"\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs, on the other hand, described Wednesday\u2019s ruling as \"a devastating outcome for transgender youth and their families across Oklahoma and another tragic result of the Supreme Court\u2019s errant and harmful ruling\" in the Tennessee case.\n\n\"Oklahoma\u2019s ban is openly discriminatory and provably harmful to the transgender youth of this state, putting political dogma above parents, their children, and their family doctors,\" the attorneys said in a joint statement. \"While we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all transgender people and their families across Oklahoma to know we will never stop fighting for the future they deserve and their freedom to be themselves.\"",

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency responsible for enforcing laws against workplace discrimination, will allow some complaints by transgender workers to proceed, a change from earlier guidance that indefinitely halted cases alleging workplace discrimination against transgender people.\nAn email was sent earlier this month to leaders of the EEOC in which Thomas Colclough, director of the agency\u2019s Office of Field Programs, said if new transgender worker complaints involve \"hiring, discharge or promotion, you are clear to continue processing these charges.\"\nEven with the change, those complaints will still face higher scrutiny than other workplace discrimination cases, requiring approval from acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, who was appointed by President Donald Trump earlier this year.\nLucas has said one of her priorities would be \"defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\"\nUTAH BATH & BODY WORKS MANAGER SAYS SHE WAS FIRED OVER COMPANY'S PRONOUN POLICY\nSince Trump returned to the presidency in January, the EEOC has shifted away from its previous interpretation of civil rights law that included prohibiting workplace discrimination against people based on their gender identity.\nThis comes after the agency issued a landmark finding a decade ago that a transgender civilian employee of the U.S. Army had faced discrimination when her employer refused to use the worker's preferred pronouns or allow the individual to use bathrooms based on gender identity rather than biological sex.\nUnder Lucas' authority, the EEOC has dropped several lawsuits alleging discrimination against transgender workers. Lucas defended that decision during her Senate committee confirmation hearing last month, citing Trump's executive order stating that there are only two sexes \u2014 male and female.\nBut she also acknowledged that the 2020 Supreme Court ruling Bostock v. Clayton County \"did clearly hold that discriminating against someone on the basis of sex included firing an individual who is transgender or based on their sexual orientation.\"\nUS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION DEMANDS 20 LAW FIRMS DISCLOSE DEI EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES\nColclough said in his email that the EEOC will consider transgender discrimination complaints that \"fall squarely under\" the Supreme Court's ruling, including cases involving hiring, firing and promotion, which reversed an earlier policy that de-prioritized cases filed on behalf of transgender workers.\n\"Under federal law, charge inquiries and charges of discrimination made to the EEOC are confidential,\" an EEOC spokesperson told The Associated Press, while declining to comment on the specifics of its updated policy.\n\"Pursuant to Title VII and as statutorily required, the EEOC is, has been, and will continue to accept and investigate charges on all bases protected by law, and to serve those charges to the relevant employer,\" the spokesperson added.\nBut even the cases the EEOC will consider under the Supreme Court ruling must still be reviewed by a senior attorney advisor and sent to Lucas for final approval.\nThe expanded review process for transgender cases is not typical of other discrimination complaints and reflects the agency\u2019s increased scrutiny of these cases, according to former EEOC commissioner Chai Feldblum, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"It is a slight improvement because it will allow certain claims of discrimination to proceed,\" Feldblum told The Associated Press. \"But overall it does not fix a horrific and legally improper situation currently occurring at the EEOC.\"\nColclough's email did not clarify how long the review process might take, or whether cases that include additional claims, such as harassment or retaliation, would be eligible to proceed, and the EEOC declined to address those questions.\n\"This is not the EEOC being clear to either its own staff or to the public what charges are going to be processed,\" Feldblum said. \"This is not a panacea.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
