      "summary": "Icahn Enterprises L.P. (IEP) strengthened its balance sheet by selling $500 million of senior secured notes, raising $493 million to partially redeem 6.250% senior notes due 2026. The sale, priced at 99.01% of face value, follows a first‑quarter earnings beat that lifted NAV by $252 million, largely driven by a 38% rise in CVI share price. IEP’s dividend yield sits at 23.20% with a share price of $8.62, positioning the company as a high‑yield, low‑price dividend play amid broader market volatility.",
