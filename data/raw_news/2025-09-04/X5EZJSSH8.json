  "description": "After intense testing, seven virtual private networks hit the top of our list.",
  "content": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nAs frustrating as it is that governments and businesses are running roughshod over our online freedoms, at least we have plenty of good VPNs to choose from to keep us protected online. There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it's all styrofoam under the hood.\n\n\n\nI built this list of the best VPNs after intensive testing to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money. Which one truly fits your needs is dependent on who you are and what you do online, but if you pick any of my seven recommendations, you can't go too far wrong.\n\n\n\nFor each VPN on this list, I've shared which platforms it works on, how much it cuts into your download speed, where it offers servers, what other features are included and how much the best available deal costs. At the end, I'll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs.\n\n\n\nEditor's note: This list has been completely overhauled and rewritten as of September 2025. We intend to revisit this list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in pricing, features, testing results and other factors.\n\u2022 None What to look for in a VPN\n\nThe VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation.\n\nWindscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once.\n\nUnfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan \u2014 the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways.\n\nThere's a lot to recommend with CyberGhost. Its streaming-optimized servers meet a high standard for playback quality, it's pretty fast overall and its Smart Rules offer some of the deepest VPN automation on the market. The ad blocker works well, and the NoSpy servers are a neat idea \u2014 CyberGhost keeps them under lock and key near its Romania headquarters and carefully fine-tunes all their settings.\n\nOn the other hand, its apps just aren't up to the standard set by our favorites on this list. I like the designs on paper, but there are too many snags in the experience, from laggy connections to an overactive kill switch that often blocks internet access even when the VPN is working perfectly.\n\nI also have some concerns about its commitment to data privacy, since its privacy policy retains the right to share your personal data with its entire corporate family. CyberGhost's parent company, Kape Technologies, also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, but neither of those VPNs have privacy policies quite so permissive.\n\nTunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month.\n\nVyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks.\n\nDespite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch \u2014 you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits.\n\nNorton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix.\n\nThis isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts.\n\nWhat to look for in a VPN\n\nChoosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below.\n\nCompatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal \u2014 check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need.\n\nSpeed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content.\n\nBackground: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit.\n\nServer network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address \u2014 e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada.\n\nCustomer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that \u2014 and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone.\n\nPricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals.\n\nTo wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here.\n\nVPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity.\n\nWhenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address \u2014 a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online.\n\nWhen you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours.\n\nWhat are some things VPNs are used for?\n\nThe three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online.\n\nOne side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online.\n\nLocation spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries \u2014 like the UK \u2014 that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well \u2014 just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location.\n\nWhether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world.\n\nWith entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform \u2014 for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries.\n\nA VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship.\n\nHowever, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN.\n\nA VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else \u2014 make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up.\n\nAs far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. There are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, so always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it.\n\nCan you get a VPN on your phone?\n\nAbsolutely \u2014 almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like.\n\nWhat about Google's One VPN?\n\nGoogle One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber.\n\nThat said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.",

The list includes platforms, features, location, availability, and cost of each service. These recommendations are compiled to help users identify the best providers for their protection online.

Windscribe, another free VPN supported by paid subscriptions, shares the privacy of its own users with Mullvad and Proton VPN, but lacks the unlimited data plan. Meanwhile, TunnelBear offers a decent interface and some of the highest VPN automation on the market.

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nSurfshark VPN review: A fast VPN for casual users\nSurfshark pushes the envelope with its Nexus and Everlink features, but its fundamentals are solid too.\nSurfshark is one of the youngest major VPNs, but it's grown rapidly over the last seven years. Since 2018, it's expanded its network to 100 countries, added a suite of apps to its Surfshark One package and experimented with advanced touches like servers that constantly rotate your IP address.\nFormerly a budget VPN, Surfshark is still pretty affordable but the cost of a one-month subscription is way too high. These days, it's more interested in innovation than affordability. Its features may not always be cutting-edge \u2014 Nexus is basically Tor and Everlink is a slightly better kill switch \u2014 but it's rare to find either implemented so well in a commercial VPN. Plus, download and upload speeds are fantastic.\nIt all adds up to one of the best VPNs for casual users, even when compared to others in its weight class. But those already deeply familiar with VPNs might trip over some aspects. For this review, I studied 11 different angles on Surfshark's service, some through hands-on tests and others with old-fashioned journalism. Check out the sections most important to you, then head to the end for my final verdict.\nEditors' note: We're in the process of rebooting all of our VPN reviews from scratch. Once we do a fresh pass on the top services, we'll be updating each review with a rating and additional comparative information.\nA fast, stable VPN with unique features and good attention to security.\n- Very fast speeds\n- Split tunneling on all apps\n- Can choose your own multihop paths\n- Single-month pricing is excessive\n- Lots of popups on desktop\n- NoBorders Mode useful but can turn on needlessly\nTable of contents\nFindings at a glance\nThis table summarizes everything I discovered about Surfshark. For details on any bullet point, see its section in the full review.\nCategory | Notes |\nInstallation and UI | Excellently organized, but geared toward new VPN users Apps are overly reliant on popup messages to convey information Auto-connect and NoBorders are enabled by default Mobile apps have the same clear controls with less friction, though Android and iOS are quite different |\nSpeed | Download speed drops an average of 5.4 percent worldwide, the fastest in our current round of tests Average upload speed drop is 3.6 percent Mean worldwide latencies slightly higher, with an average ping of 344 ms |\nSecurity | Uses WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2, which are all secure protocols No IP address leaks, including via DNS or WebRTC Blocks IPv6 by defaultWireShark test showed that encryption works |\nPricing | Three pricing tiers, each available at three durations Surfshark Starter has the full VPN service Best deal is $53.73 for 27 months, but can only be renewed as $47.85 for 12 months One month is sharply overpriced, but longer durations grant steep discounts |\nBundles | Alternative ID masks your email address and personal details when signing up for websites Surfshark Antivirus got a perfect AV-Test protection score with no false positives Surfshark Alert checks data breaches to see if any of your important info turns up Surfshark Search is a private search engine that can change locations using Surfshark's VPN network Incogni automatically requests that data brokers delete your information Surfshark includes a coupon code for Saily eSIM service |\nPrivacy policy | Based in the Netherlands and appears to be GDPR compliant June 2025 audit confirmed that the posted privacy policy is accurate RAM-only servers delete stored activity at intervals Does gather information from ad trackers, but those are run by third parties and don't compromise what you do on the VPN |\nVirtual location change | Unblocked Netflix on 14 out of 15 servers in five test locations One Japan server got caught, but disconnecting and reconnecting solved the issue Every server showed the content library from its country, suggesting an untraceable change of location |\nServer network | 141 servers in 100 countries 47 server locations are virtual, or about 1/3 of the entire network \u2014 a smaller fraction than any direct competitor At least one real server on every continent |\nFeatures | Everlink instantly switches you to the next-best server if your current one fails Nexus makes it possible to select your own multihop nodes and constantly switches out your IP address Technically has unlimited simultaneous connections, but you might get in trouble for using a huge number at once NoBorders and Camouflage modes help Surfshark work on restrictive networks, though NoBorders sometimes activates when you don't need it Bypasser lets you split tunnels by URL or app (URL only on iOS) CleanWeb blocks banner ads and trackers on all apps, while the CleanWeb 2.0 browser extension blocks video ads and auto-rejects unnecessary cookies |\nCustomer support | Can access the most-used troubleshooting articles straight from the app FAQ pages are easy to use without technical knowledge Live chat support starts with a bot but gets you to human experts quickly Email ticket took less than a day to return with a useful answer |\nBackground check | Founded in Lithuania in 2018; currently based in the Netherlands No major hacks or breaches since launch Merged with NordVPN in 2022, but continues to operate independently Removed risky certification authority formerly used by IKEv2 on Windows |\nInstalling, configuring and using Surfshark\nFor this section, I'll be going over how it feels to use Surfshark. I'll look at how easy or difficult it is to install, what you have to do to set it up and whether the user interface (UI) helps out or gets in the way on each platform.\nWindows\nSurfshark is easy to download and install on Windows. You can get it through the Microsoft store, but going directly through the Surfshark website makes sure you have the latest and most complete version. The downloader asks you to click \"Yes,\" but mostly handles itself, and finishes up in a short time.\nThe first point that might divide casual users and VPN veterans comes once you open the app for the first time. Surfshark insists on taking you through a guided setup process for all its features. This is extremely helpful if you've never used a VPN before. If you have, its repeated insistence on sending you through the tour can get aggravating.\nThis pattern repeated itself as I went through the app. The front page is sensibly organized and arranged so I could see all the facts and settings \u2014 but it remains way too reliant on unskippable pop-ups to provide information. Messages appeared when I tried to cancel a stuck connection, when I turned settings on and off and even when I tried to close the app. It's usually important information, but displaying a message that freezes every other button is a bad move.\nIt's a shame, because everything else works fine. The settings tabs do an admirable job of packing multiple, semi-related apps into a single UI. Just take note that a lot of stuff is enabled by default, including auto-connect and NoBorders, which may make the VPN behave in ways you don't need.\nMac\nSurfshark's app for macOS is mostly the same as its Windows app, for better or worse. It's got the same split-second download and installation and the same clear organization of tabs with well-explained features. It's also got the same relentless popups, settings on by default and occasionally sticky connections. If it gets hung up at 95 percent, just wait \u2014 it's still working.\nAndroid\nThe Surfshark Android app, available through the Google Play Store, is ready after you simply download and login. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but Surfshark's design language turns out to be very easy to compress into mobile \u2014 except that it's dark-mode by default, while all the other three are light. I found everything I needed within moments. Android even removes almost all the full-screen stop-everything notifications.\nOne thing to be aware of: when you start up the Android app, the VPN is visible, but the landing page includes all the features of Surfshark One. To get the VPN-only front page, click the arrow across from \"VPN\" at the top of the screen. That said, you can do almost everything you need to do no matter which page you're on.\niOS\nIt's unusual to see a big difference between a VPN's apps on the two mobile platforms, but Surfshark switches up its design from Android to iOS. Everything now lives in four tabs on the bottom of the window. The settings tab is great, largely because it looks like how preferences do on Mac and Windows.\nThe main VPN window is a bit jankier. It works fine, but in order to make the server list constantly visible (unnecessary IMO), it relegates the actual VPN connection to a floating box that looks like an afterthought. It even includes a button to open the server list that's already open. I freely admit this is just a personal complaint, but it still baffles me.\nBrowser extensions\nSurfshark's browser extensions for Firefox and Chromium are almost clones of its desktop apps, with a few differences. The Alert tab tells you if the site you're on has suffered a security breach recently. CleanWeb 2.0 is the main reason to add Surfshark to your browser; it's a much stronger blocker that even works on some video insert ads.\nSurfshark speed test: Super fast with some latency\nAll VPNs add to your web browser's workload, so it's normal to see speeds drop. The best VPNs manage to keep the drops as small as possible. I used speedtest.net to see how quickly my download speeds declined at six of Surfshark's server locations \u2014 that's a measure of how fast a browser can load web pages, buffer videos and download large files.\nI also looked for latency, which affects real-time communication with another server (important for gamers) and upload speed, which affects how quickly your device can send data (important for torrenting). My results are in the table.\nServer location | Latency (ms) | Increase factor | Download speed (Mbps) | Percentage drop | Upload speed (Mbps) | Percentage drop |\nPortland, U.S.A. (unprotected) | 18 | \u2014 | 58.27 | \u2014 | 5.88 | \u2014 |\nBend, U.S.A. (fastest) | 30 | 1.7x | 55.35 | 5.0 | 5.56 | 5.4 |\nMontreal, Canada | 164 | 9.1x | 56.47 | 3.1 | 5.58 | 5.1 |\nBogota, Columbia | 281 | 15.6x | 55.01 | 5.6 | 5.58 | 5.1 |\nJohannesburg, South Africa | 605 | 33.6x | 51.87 | 11.0 | 5.62 | 4.4 |\nDubai, U.A.E. | 534 | 29.7x | 54.53 | 6.4 | 5.74 | 2.4 |\nJakarta, Indonesia | 449 | 24.9x | 57.55 | 1.2 | 5.92 | -0.7 |\nAverage | 344 | 19.1x | 55.13 | 5.4 | 5.67 | 3.6 |\nIn terms of download and upload speeds, Surfshark is the fastest VPN I've tested so far, beating out ExpressVPN, Proton VPN and NordVPN \u2014 and none of those are exactly sluggish. If you look at the Indonesia row, you'll see I actually got a higher upload speed than I did without the VPN active. That probably has more to do with natural fluctuations from my ISP than anything Surfshark did, but it still indicates how little this VPN weighs down your browsing.\nLatency is more of a mixed bag. Jumps in ping time are expected across long distances, but I also saw a fairly large jump on a server in the same state as me. Surfshark may not be ideal for fast-paced online games, but its speeds are just about perfect for any other task.\nSurfshark security test: Simple but effective protocols\nTo determine whether Surfshark can keep you safe, I'll be looking at three factors: whether it uses secure and up-to-date VPN protocols, whether any of those protocols leak your IP address and whether encryption is being applied to all data packets. The first is a matter of researching the technology, but I've run practical tests for the other two.\nVPN protocols\nSurfshark uses the VPN protocols WireGuard, OpenVPN (over TCP or UDP) and IKEv2. All of these are field-tested protocols that rely on uncracked encryption and proven authentication methods. There's no proprietary protocol with shady source code, nor any outdated legacy options that might pose a risk if you pick them. My only complaint is that OpenVPN isn't available on Mac.\nEach of these protocols does the same thing: establish communication between your device, VPN servers and the internet. They handle the steps differently, but the average user is only likely to see small differences. If one protocol isn't working, you can switch to another \u2014 or just pick the automatic protocol selection option, which worked fine during my tests. If you want to pick for yourself, use the table below for reference.\nProtocol | Use case | Available on | Other notes |\nWireGuard | Generally provides the best speeds | All platforms | Saves static IP addresses, but Surfshark masks these with dynamic IPs for users |\nOpenVPN over TCP | When the other protocols have dropped your connection | All platforms except macOS and iOS | Automatic obfuscation |\nOpenVPN over UDP | When you need speed more than stability (and WireGuard isn't working) | All platforms except macOS and iOS | Automatic obfuscation |\nIKEv2 | On mobile, as it's good at reconnecting when moving between Wi-Fi and data | All platforms except Windows | Not open source |\nLeak test\nNext, I picked five of the servers I didn't use for the speed test and checked all of them for three different kinds of leaks using ipleak.net. Surfshark has its own DNS servers, so DNS leaks are unlikely \u2014 those usually come from a VPN using public servers to resolve DNS requests. As expected, DNS requests didn't reveal my IP address in any of the tests.\nThere's more potential for IPv6 leaks, as Surfshark doesn't support IPv6. It recommends turning it off instead, and has guides on doing that. To fully put Surfshark through its paces, though, I ran my tests with IPv6 still active on my computer. On all five servers, the IPv6 test could not run. This indicates that Surfshark actively blocks IPv6, which (until more of the internet starts running on the new protocol) is a fine way to prevent IPv6 leaks.\nThe leak testing tool also checks for WebRTC leaks, so I ran each test with a Google Meet call active, but that didn't leak either. In short, Surfshark didn't spring a leak no matter how many times I poked it. I'm prepared to call it watertight.\nEncryption test\nTo be absolutely sure I was recommending a safe VPN, I used WireShark (no relation) and HTTP Forever to see whether its encryption works. From examining the data stream before and after connecting to a Surfshark server, it's clear that encryption is truly being applied. Take a look for yourself \u2014 the fact that you can't get any information from the screenshot means the VPN protocol is working.\nHow much does Surfshark cost?\nSurfshark is part of a suite of security products \u2014 a lot like its sister brand NordVPN, but with the offerings per tier a little more coherent. It comes in three subscription types, each of which is available at three durations. The table below shows the whole range of costs.\nNote that the 24-month plans are introductory only. You can only renew for one month or 12 months. The prices below also factor in extra months you'll get when you sign up for the first time, which aren't available in renewals.\nPlan | One month | 12 months | 24 months |\nSurfshark Starter | $15.45 | $48.75 ($3.19/month with 3 extra months) | $53.73 ($1.99/month with 3 extra months) |\nSurfshark One | $17.95 | $50.85 ($3.39/month with 3 extra months) | $67.23 ($2.49/month with 3 extra months) |\nSurfshark One+ | $20.65 | $91.35 ($6.09/month with 3 extra months) | $107.73 ($3.99/month with 3 extra months) |\nSurfshark's price drops steeply from its shortest to its longest subscriptions. $15.45 is way overpriced (even for a service we quite like), but $1.99 per month is about the least you'll pay for any VPN worth recommending. The jump from Starter (which only includes the VPN service) to One (which includes everything else except Incogni) is also tiny on the 12-month plan \u2014 only an extra $0.20.\nSurfshark is almost certainly doing this to juice active user numbers \u2014 but that doesn't mean you can't take advantage of it. To our mind, the 12-month subscription to Surfshark One is extremely good value, provided you already know you want Surfshark VPN.\nEvery plan comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. At any point before 30 days have elapsed, you can start a live chat conversation to get your money back. This is only allowed once every six months.\nYou can also get a free trial for seven days by installing the Surfshark app from the Apple or Android app store, creating an account, then choosing the plan that includes the 7-day free trial. However, since you have to enter a payment method for this \u2014 and it's not accessible on Windows \u2014 the 30-day period is generally more convenient.\nSurfshark side apps and bundles\nHere's what you can get from Surfshark aside from its VPN service. In order to keep our focus on the VPN, we didn't have time to rigorously test all these, but we've included the basic information to help you make your decision.\nAlternative ID\nAlternative ID is included along with VPN service in a Surfshark Starter plan. It consists of two features: masked email generator and personal detail generator.\nMasked email generator gives you a random email address that sends all messages along to your real inbox. Since it auto-forwards everything, an email mask isn't for reducing spam. Instead, it lets you keep your real email address secret when signing up for online services \u2014 since providing your actual address runs the risk of leaking it. For an extra $2.89 per month, you can also get an alternative phone number that works similarly.\nPersonal detail generator creates fake names, addresses and birthdays you can use to sign up for any websites you're uncertain about. Be sure to use it along with the VPN, or your IP address will reveal the actual details. It also might be helpful for randomly generating your next RPG character.\nSurfshark Antivirus\nSurfshark Antivirus is included in Surfshark One and One+ subscriptions. It can scan files as you download them and can also scan your whole system for malware, checking against a list of unwanted programs it claims to update every three hours.\nAV-Test gave it a perfect score in protection. A top score (6 out of 6) means Surfshark Antivirus caught 100 percent of malware thrown at it, both known threats and zero-day attacks. It also got a perfect usability score for totally avoiding false positives, and a 5.5 out of 6 on performance \u2014 it had nearly no impact on downloading apps or copying files, but slowed down popular websites by around 30 percent on average.\nSurfshark Alert\nSurfshark Alert, which is also part of Surfshark One and One+, scans the information released in data breaches to see if any of your important data has been compromised. It can check for email addresses, usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and government IDs. It can also warn you when malware on your computer is capable of stealing your data.\nSurfshark Search\nYou can get access to Surfshark Search, a search engine akin to Google, with a One or One+ subscription. It offers a number of benefits over Google, including being totally ad-free (a perk of being subsidized by subscription). You can also change the region from which you get results. Surfshark claims that all results are totally organic, with no trackers or learning from logged searches.\nIncogni\nIncogni, an automated data removal service, is the one feature restricted to Surfshark One+ plans. It searches data brokerages to see if they have any of your information, then contacts them for you to request they purge the data. Brokers don't have to honor all deletion requests, but it never hurts to try. Incogni keeps searching as long as your subscription is active, so it can automatically send multiple requests to the same broker if necessary.\nSaily eSIM\nSeveral VPNs now provide their users with Saily eSIM discounts, which can be used to get regular phone service in foreign countries. Surfshark grants various discounts through the coupon code surfshark5, which appears to be usable even without a Surfshark account.\nClose-reading Surfshark's privacy policy\nSurfshark's privacy policy shows us its outward attitude toward user privacy. While it's possible for a VPN provider to lie outright in its posted policy, they prefer not to for liability reasons. An unreliable service will instead use loopholes, vagueries and incomplete statements to make privacy promises it doesn't plan on keeping.\nBy contrast, a VPN service worth your money will be as specific as possible about any exceptions to its no-logs policy. I read Surfshark's entire privacy policy to see which type of VPN it is \u2014 no small feat, as it's well over 5,000 words long. The page includes summaries, but they're pared down a little too far to be useful, so it's into the full text I go.\nSurfshark is based in the Netherlands, which makes it subject to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). That's good news, since GDPR does not permit any company to retain data without justifying it. The Netherlands is likely part of the Nine Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement, but agencies can't spy on a VPN's users unless that VPN is already saving activity logs \u2014 and if it is, it's got much bigger problems than where it's based.\nSurfshark's entire server network runs on RAM-only infrastructure, so any saved activity is erased at regular intervals. Even better, the policy is clear that your activity on any server is deleted within 15 minutes. If we take Surfshark at its word, there's very little reason to worry about servers being seized or searched.\nThat means the only risk is that Surfshark itself might take advantage of its access to your information. It does, unfortunately, claim the right to view information gathered by third-party trackers, such as the cookies used by social media sites to track ad performance. But none of those trackers are watching what you do when you use the VPN, nor digging into your actual browsing activity \u2014 which, as we've seen, doesn't exist after 15 minutes.\nIndependent privacy audits\nAlthough we can't conclusively verify any VPN's privacy policy, since that involves the logically impossible feat of proving a negative, we can get very close by checking independent audits. Third-party auditors can verify a VPN's public statements through a combination of interviews, document review and directly tinkering with the infrastructure.\nSurfshark passed its most recent audit in June 2025, which \u2014 at time of writing \u2014 leaves very little room for interference. Deloitte, the audit firm, concluded that \"the configuration of IT systems and management of the supporting IT operations is properly prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the Surfshark\u2019s description set out in the Appendix I.\"\nI checked that description and found that it matches up to Surfshark's public privacy policy. So, as much as we can say that any VPN is private, Surfshark is private. It may not stop all personalized ads, but it will at least keep your personal information secret.\nCan Surfshark change your virtual location?\nIf you mainly need a VPN for streaming, this is the section for you. Here, I test whether Surfshark can change your location convincingly enough for you to see content from other countries, without getting caught and blocked by streaming platforms.\nThe procedure is simple: I pick five test locations, connect to three different servers in each and load Netflix. If I get in cleanly without error messages, and actually see different shows than I would without a VPN, I'll know Surfshark convincingly changed my location. (As a reminder, when unblocking with any VPN, always make sure you're logged into your streaming account first.)\nServer Location | Unblocked Netflix? | Changed content? |\nCanada | 3/3 | 3/3 |\nIreland | 3/3 | 3/3 |\nColombia | 3/3 | 3/3 |\nSouth Africa | 3/3 | 3/3 |\nJapan | 2/3 | 2/3 |\nSurfshark performed extremely well in this test, not only unblocking every location at least twice but also maintaining fast enough speeds to keep the videos from stuttering. The only failure was that one server in Japan got spied out as a VPN and blocked. However, simply disconnecting and reconnecting was enough to get me over the hurdle.\nAny failure to change virtual location counts against a VPN, but even the best services can't keep their servers off 100 percent of blocklists. NordVPN, another top-five VPN, scored the same 14/15. As far as I'm concerned, that's a passing grade for streaming \u2014 but if it's a dealbreaker for you, remember ExpressVPN and Proton VPN both have perfect scores.\nInvestigating Surfshark's server network\nSurfshark has a total of 100 server locations in 141 countries. Of those locations, 47 are virtual and 92 are physical. A virtual VPN server gives you an apparent digital location different from where it's really located. There's little security tradeoff, but speeds may vary depending on how far you are from the server's actual position. The one count against Surfshark here is that it doesn't clarify where its virtual servers are really located, so using them is a speed crapshoot.\nThe table below shows the proportions of server locations in each region, so you can decide whether Surfshark is likely to be useful for where you are. You can find a full list on Surfshark's website, though only the apps show which servers are actually virtual.\nRegion | Countries with servers | Total server locations | Virtual server locations |\nNorth America | 8 | 32 | 5 |\nSouth America | 10 | 10 | 6 |\nEurope | 46 | 58 | 13 |\nAfrica | 6 | 6 | 4 |\nMiddle East | 3 | 3 | 1 |\nAsia | 25 | 26 | 18 |\nOceania | 2 | 6 | 0 |\nTotal | 100 | 141 | 47 (33%) |\nThese numbers are interesting in a few ways. First, Surfshark's server network is only about one-third virtual, the lowest proportion of any major VPN I've reviewed so far. There's also no continent without a single physical server. This makes Surfshark a very good choice to guarantee usable internet speeds while globetrotting.\nAs usual, servers are mostly in Europe and North America, although there's a fair amount of Asia represented by the virtual locations. Surfshark is newer than most of its competitors, so it's impressive that it's built such an extensive network in half the time. The table reveals a VPN service that's interested in expanding, but won't do so at the expense of establishing quality locations that actually work.\nExtra features of Surfshark\nSurfshark sets itself apart from the VPN pack with several features, some visible to the user and some working behind the scenes. Mostly, its features are familiar concepts implemented well, rather than outright innovations like NordVPN's Meshnet \u2014 but there's a lot of possibility for exciting new directions.\nUnderlying technology: Surfshark Nexus and Everlink\nSurfshark has two technological innovations under the hood that make its VPN relatively unique. The first is Nexus, which has been active since 2022. Nexus connects all Surfshark's servers together into a tighter network than most VPNs use. All its servers are nodes in a web of interconnected paths, a lot like the Tor network, except proprietary to one company.\nWhen you choose a server location, you're only selecting the last node in a sequence. Surfshark software selects the entry point and the path to your chosen exit. This gives every user more options for a working connection path, and allows Surfshark to regularly rotate your apparent IP address so activity on one masked identity can't trace back to you. It's also what makes it possible to pick the two steps in a double-hop connection (see \"Dynamic MultiHop\" below).\nEverlink is a newer technology that Surfshark calls a \"self-healing VPN infrastructure.\" Any time you're connected to Surfshark through the WireGuard protocol, you're also connected to Everlink \u2014 a parallel infrastructure that watches your VPN connection. If it ever drops, Everlink instantly reconnects you to another server nearby, theoretically so fast you won't notice the outage.\nThis is basically one step up from a kill switch. Instead of cutting off your connection, Everlink switches it to the next server instead. This makes it difficult to test \u2014 the way to check a kill switch is to simulate a server drop by cutting off your own internet connection, which makes Everlink's function impossible. However, I can at least say I'm cautiously excited about Everlink's potential power to negate server drops.\nUnlimited simultaneous connections\nOne thing you'll regularly hear about Surfshark is that it puts no limits on how many devices can connect through your account. In theory, one subscription is enough for you, your household and any friends that want to borrow it.\nIn practice, though, \"unlimited\" is a stretch. A support article acknowledges that some people may abuse the privilege by reselling access, or by masking illegal botnet activity behind hundreds of Surfshark connections.\nThe article doesn't explicitly say Surfshark will limit or ban abusers, but questions to the support team revealed that an account could be locked if an automated system detects fraud. If you use a high number of simultaneous connections, even legitimately, you could be flagged \u2014 though you may be able to unlock your account by telling customer service what happened.\nBypasser split tunneling\nBypasser lets you split your internet connection so certain apps or websites go through the VPN while others remain outside. This gets you better speeds on sites and apps that don't involve any sensitive information. Also, whenever a service requires your real IP address, you can keep using the VPN for everything else. Torrenting is a classic use case \u2014 you can keep BitTorrent protected in the background while you do something innocuous without VPN protection, improving speeds for both processes.\nBypasser split tunneling is available on all of Surfshark's desktop and mobile clients, though iOS users can only split by website, not by app. Windows and Android users can also choose between two forms of split: \"Bypass VPN,\" which keeps all listed sites and apps outside the VPN tunnel, and \"Route via VPN,\" in which only the listed sites and apps stay within the VPN tunnel.\nDynamic MultiHop\nMany VPNs have a double-hop option, which routes connections through two VPN servers to keep you protected in case one breaks. However, most of them restrict you to set paths of two servers. Surfshark is the only VPN that lets you choose both steps, thanks to Nexus pre-establishing paths between all the servers.\nFor the best performance, I recommend picking an entry node near your real location, then choosing your exit node based on what you need to unblock. If you aren't unblocking anything in particular, your best bet is to simply choose two nodes in your own country.\nCamouflage Mode obfuscation\nVPN obfuscation refers to VPNs hiding the fact that they're VPNs at all \u2014 so not only is your IP address not your real one, but it doesn't appear to have been changed. Surfshark's obfuscation is called Camouflage Mode. As long as you're connected via OpenVPN, it's active automatically. So, if you suspect an outside firewall is preventing you from getting online while running Surfshark, switching to OpenVPN might solve the problem.\nNoBorders mode\nNoBorders is another option for getting online with Surfshark under external restrictions, especially those imposed by entire governments (like the Great Firewall of China). If Surfshark detects restrictions on internet usage, NoBorders activates and switches you to a server well-placed to get around those restrictions \u2014 for example, an IP address from the next country over.\nThe problem with NoBorders is that it's active by default, which may restrict you to certain servers when you don't need the help. I recommend switching NoBorders off in the settings for better performance. It may turn on again if it detects possible restrictions, so check the setting again if you find your speeds slower than usual.\nCleanWeb\nCleanWeb, Surfshark's ad blocker, is available in two forms. The basic version of CleanWeb, which blocks banner ads and trackers, comes with all Surfshark apps.\nCleanWeb 2.0 comes as a browser extension, which means it only works in-browser. However, it's a much stronger blocker, capable of cancelling video ads on streaming and YouTube. It also automatically rejects non-vital cookies on every site so you don't have to click the button \u2014 which I appreciated, as my ADHD brain is easily distracted by pop-ups.\nStatic and dedicated IPs\nSurfshark gives you a list of static IP addresses at no extra charge, another rarity among leading VPNs. A static IP means you'll have the same address every time you connect to the VPN, so you won't look suspicious for regularly opening the same service with a different IP. Without this, you'll find yourself hitting CAPTCHAs more often. You can also keep your home device connected to a static IP server and use that to access your home network remotely.\nFor an extra cost, Surfshark also offers dedicated IPs, which are the same as static IPs except you're the only person using them. Sometimes, a static IP can get blocked because of one bad user's behavior; a private dedicated IP removes that risk.\nOther features\nA few other features are worth noting. Surfshark has a kill switch that cuts off your internet connection if your VPN server ever drops \u2014 this is largely obsolete with Everlink, but remains in the background as an extra precaution. You can set the VPN to connect automatically except on trusted networks, and can choose the location to which it auto-connects.\nIf you need to briefly work without the VPN, you can pause Surfshark for five minutes, 30 minutes or two hours. Finally, Android users can have their VPN server override their GPS location, moving it to wherever their IP address is currently. You obviously don't want to use this while your phone is navigating you somewhere, but otherwise it's useful for privacy.\nSurfshark customer support options\nSurfshark includes a few links to troubleshooting pages directly in the app, a tantalizingly unfinished feature. If you go to the settings tab and click Get Help and then Browse Guides, you'll see several links to FAQ articles about the version of the VPN client you're using. Clicking any link opens the page in your default browser. Jumping directly from the app to the relevant guide is really convenient, but if your problem isn't one of the five most common, you're out of luck \u2014 just click More Guides to go to the main support page.\nOnce you're here, you'll find a helpful set of articles that make good design choices to put the average user at ease. \"Getting started\" includes setup guides for every Surfshark app, with abundant screenshots. Help articles are effectively written from the user's perspective. Instead of technical descriptions of problems, they start with topics like \"I can't connect to Surfshark\" or \"I'm getting an error,\" then provide a sequence of DIY solutions.\nThe only category without a clear direction is \"Surfschool,\" which gathers a disparate bunch of feature explanations, advanced tips and basic VPN information under one heading. If you can't find what you need in the other sections, it may be easier to use the search bar instead of digging around in Surfschool.\nThe live support experience\nTo reach live support, scroll to the bottom of the main support page, then click \"Chat with us.\" A chat window will open in the corner of your screen. I used the live chat support to ask about receiving a link to the test account I used to write this review. As is now standard, I had to work my way past a chatbot first, but that didn't take too long. Once I reached a real person, they resolved my problem right away.\nThe email ticket system is for difficult problems that can't be resolved in a single exchange, so I decided to test it with something a little more complicated. I asked about the status of IKEv2, which Surfshark promised to eliminate in 2022 but has only removed from Windows (this is in fact what they promised to do, but I wasn't aware of that yet).\nI heard back about 22 hours later with a speedy and applicable answer: a representative said that \"currently, Surfshark does not have plans to remove IKEv2 from all operating systems.\" See the next section for details about that risk.\nSurfshark background check: No real blemishes\nSurfshark was founded in 2018, making it a relative newcomer to the security scene, and the VPN was its first product. Alert and Search debuted in 2019, while Antivirus and Incogni joined them in 2021. For the first two years of its existence, Surfshark was part of the Tesonet group, a Lithuanian startup incubator that also helped launch NordVPN (see \"Connection to NordVPN\" below).\nIts youth may be why there are few serious blemishes on Surfshark's record. Like Proton VPN, which is just a year older, it simply hasn't had time to put a foot wrong yet. However, that doesn't mean it's inevitable that Surfshark will screw up at some point. So far, it appears to be learning from its predecessors and avoiding their mistakes.\nThe trusted root certification authority risk\nThe only potential error I can point to hasn't compromised anyone yet, but may in the future. In 2022, Surfshark was one of several VPNs cited for relying on a trusted root certification authority \u2014 a verification method that, if compromised, could let an attacker sneak malware onto a user's device using Surfshark's ID badge. There's no record of the certificate actually being exploited, and Surfshark claimed it was necessary to enable the IKEv2 protocol.\nIn response to the report, Surfshark deprecated IKEv2 from its Windows app, which was the only one that used trusted root CAs for IKEv2. It's still available on all OSes except Windows, but a Surfshark rep told me in an email that they don't use trusted root CAs on those platforms, so there's no risk.\nConnection to NordVPN\nIn 2022, Surfshark announced a merger with NordVPN, though both companies repeatedly stressed that nothing about either service would change. According to Surfshark's announcement at the time, \"The idea behind the deal is to align on a tactical level in reaching mutual goals while keeping the autonomy of our operations.\"\nAs of 2025, nothing seems especially merged about NordVPN and Surfshark. Publicly, they're still completely different brands with few mentions of the other on their respective websites. In an email, a Surfshark representative told me that \"Surfshark and Nord Security operate as autonomous companies relying on separate infrastructures, different product development plans and separate customer bases.\"\nThat said, it's worth noting that Surfshark and Nord have a shared lineage in Tesonet, the Lithuania-based tech incubator that, with Nord, shares Tom Okman and Eimantas Sabaliauskas as co-founders, and nurtured Surfshark for the first two years of its life. In the end, a Surfshark representative told Engadget that Surfshark currently \"operates independently\" of Tesonet. Be that as it may, the combination of Surfshark and NordVPN is yet another example an increasingly consolidated VPN industry, where competitors like Kape Technologies and Ziff Davis operate multiple digital service brands under one corporate roof.\nFinal verdict\nIn a lot of ways, Surfshark works hard to earn your trust. Its reliance on brick-and-mortar servers testifies to that, as do its speeds, regular privacy audits and refusal to rest on its laurels. Nexus and Everlink may not be perfectly implicated, but they do have tangible results that indicate they're a lot more than just marketing gimmicks. Both are positive signs of a VPN provider genuinely trying to stand out in a crowded field.\nIt's also a great sign that Surfshark responded to the trusted root CA risk with a targeted intervention. I wish they'd found a way to run IKEv2 on Windows without as much risk (other VPNs manage it), but I can't deny they seem serious about addressing potential issues before they become crises. It's nice that I can enthusiastically recommend Surfshark for its attention to security as well as its speeds and straightforward features."

      "text": "How we test VPNs\nThey all say they're the best \u2014 here's how we find out who's telling the truth.\nVPN users have an unbelievable amount of choice in the market, but lots of those choices are bad. Upwards of 180 virtual private networks are available for commercial users alone. For the casual user who just wants a VPN to protect themselves online or change their virtual location, the risk of analysis paralysis is very real.\nIt doesn't help that VPN providers love to make misleading claims about their own product. Read a few of their homepages and you'll start to see some phrases repeat. \"Lightning-fast.\" \"Bank-grade encryption.\" \"Zero-logs policy.\" It's designed to sound good without meaning much, and unfortunately, even the best providers love to talk like this.\nOur team at Engadget started digging into the VPN world to help you cut through all this clutter and pick the provider you actually want and need. We've developed a rigorous testing process that combines investigative journalism, objective testing and qualitative review. This article explains how we research and test a VPN.\nUpdate, May 28, 2025: This story has been completely overhauled to reflect the updated 2025 Engadget VPN testing methodology.\nTable of contents\nOur process at a glance\nCheck the table for a quick illustration of our VPN testing process.\nTesting Step | What We Do |\nInstall, configure and use the VPN on multiple platforms | Investigate how easy it is to download, install and configure the VPN At a minimum, experience all features of the Windows, Mac, iOS and Android apps |\nTest speeds | Test download speeds, upload speeds and latencies on a representative sample of servers around the world Test each location at least three times across two days and average scores |\nTest security | Run encryption tests using WireSharkTest for DNS and WebRTC leaks See how the VPN handles IPv6 traffic Check that the VPN uses up-to-date protocols |\nLook at pricing and deals | See what plans and discounts are available Investigate whether long-term deals rise in cost after the first billing period Look for free trials, coupons and other ways to save money |\nLook at subscription bundles | Check what other standalone apps or services are bundled with the VPN Investigate how much those bundles cost and whether they're worth buying |\nClose-read the privacy policy | Investigate the privacy policy for any loopholes Note what information is saved, what is shared and with whom |\nCheck the VPN's ability to change geolocation | Make sure virtual locations match DNS locations Test the VPN on streaming sites to see if it gets caught |\nInvestigate the server network | Check how many server locations are physical vs. virtual and how many are owned vs. rented Discover which users are most likely to have access to a physical server near them |\nTest all extra features | Explore the user interface and any features outside the VPN connection itself Ensure features work as advertised and judge how easy they are to use |\nUse the customer service options | Read the help pages to see how they answer simple questions Test the live chat, how capable the bot is and how difficult it is to reach a human Submit an email ticket and grade response times and usefulness |\nInvestigate the VPN's background | Check the VPN's history in the news Read any published audit reports Look into past data breaches and/or privacy violations |\nVPN testing: Our 11 steps\nA quick note before we start \u2014 whenever we say \"VPN\" in this article, we're referring to a commercial VPN, the kind any individual can download and use. Corporate VPNs like Cisco Secure Client and Perimeter81 require a different testing process.\n1. Install and configure the VPN on multiple platforms\nThe most work you'll likely have to do with a VPN comes when you download and install it. We run through that process on as many different platforms as possible. When we can't hit them all, we try to get at least one in each category \u2014 desktop, mobile, smart TV and browser \u2014 plus the \"big four\" of Windows, Mac, iOS and Android.\nWe take careful notes on the whole process, trying to think from the perspective of someone who has never used a VPN before. How easy is it to find the installation file? How do you log in and out? Are there quality-of-life features, like a programmable auto-connect to save work the next time you open the VPN app?\nAfter installing each VPN, we run through the basic tasks of connecting, disconnecting and changing server locations. If these go smoothly, 90 percent of users will face very few problems with the interface. On the other hand, any hiccups on the basic connection process bode poorly for the operability of the VPN's more advanced features.\n2. Test speeds\nWe take it for granted that a VPN will reduce your browsing speeds. Except in certain rare cases where your ISP has severely misconfigured your local pathways, it's not possible for a VPN to give you faster speeds than your normal internet service. That means the \"fastest VPN\" is the one that drags down your normal speeds as little as possible.\nWe use Ookla's speed testing software to check each VPN's servers in three categories. Download speed describes how much data can move from a web server to your device in one second; this determines how quickly web pages load and when streaming videos need to buffer. Upload speed is the same in reverse, and matters most for torrenting, social media sharing and outbound communication from your computer.\nThe third metric is latency, measured by the length of a \"ping\" \u2014 the time in milliseconds that a single data packet takes to travel between your device and the web. Latency, which is highly dependent on distance, is important for anything that happens online in real time, like gaming or video chat.\nAll three speed stats can fluctuate as individual server loads change. To get a clear picture of performance across the entire network, we pick six server locations for each VPN, including the one the app designates as the fastest. We then test each location three times across two days, averaging each result to get a final score.\n3. Test security\nA VPN's most important job is to keep your real IP address hidden. If it can't do that, we can't recommend it. The simplest way we test a VPN's security is by checking our IP address while connected. If the VPN server is airtight, any IP lookup tool should show the server's address, not our home network.\nIP leaks \u2014 in which your home IP address is visible even while you're connected through a VPN \u2014 are most often caused by VPNs using public DNS servers that make your requests visible to your internet provider. The culprit can also be a misconfiguration in real-time communication protocols (WebRTC) or a failure to properly incorporate IPv6 traffic.\nWe also check for weak, outdated VPN protocols like PPTP, or untested proprietary protocols with no available source code. We finish this step by testing the VPN's encryption by analyzing a few data packets using Wireshark.\n4. Look at pricing and deals\nNext, we see how much the VPN costs. We read the fine print on multi-year deals to see if advertised savings stop after the first billing period; when VPNs offer \"bonus months\" for new sign-ups, it's common for prices to go up later. We also evaluate any free plans, temporary free trials or money-back guarantees \u2014 paying special attention to the refunds, as VPNs occasionally refuse to honor their stated policies.\nWe close out by seeing if there are any special pricing discounts or coupons that may make the VPN more affordable. Ultimately, we try to make a call about whether the VPN gives the user enough value to justify its price.\n5. Check out pricing bundles\nMany of the top VPNs are expanding their offerings into larger bundles, like NordVPN Complete, Surfshark One, or ExpressVPN's Identity Guard suite. This can also happen from the other direction, as companies like Norton and Proton add VPNs to their existing product lines.\nVPN bundles almost always come at an additional subscription cost, which they sometimes earn with added value \u2014 and sometimes don't. Whenever we review a VPN, we check out the products associated with it and advise you on whether or not to heed the VPN's inevitable calls to upgrade.\n6. Close-read the privacy policy\nThe next step is to sit down with the VPN's privacy policy and read it like a lawyer would. A VPN privacy policy is technically legally binding, in that the provider can be sued for false advertising if they violate it. Instead of lying outright, the less-trustworthy VPNs minimize their risk by hiding controversial practices behind vague language and loopholes.\nAs an example, a VPN might claim on its homepage to have a \"zero-logs policy,\" but it's impossible to provide VPN service without keeping at least some logs. The honest providers lay out exactly what data they keep, how they anonymize it and what they do with it. Red flags include saving your data for longer than necessary, logging activity for non-security purposes like marketing, or claiming that the privacy policy does not apply to partners or parent companies.\n7. Check the VPN's ability to change geolocation\nWhen a VPN changes your virtual location, it needs to do so in a way destination servers can't see through. The sites you'd want to change your location for, like Netflix, YouTube and sports streams, block content in regions where they don't have a licensing agreement to stream it (that's why Netflix libraries change in every country). These sites know VPNs can circumvent their blocks, so they ban VPN access whenever they detect it.\nThe best VPNs fight back by updating their server IP addresses quickly enough that streaming platforms can't block them. We test a VPN's unblocking ability by connecting to multiple streaming websites \u2014 each in several different countries \u2014 and looking for proxy errors. We check to see if content is accessible and whether speeds remain fast enough to view it.\n8. Investigate the server network\nA VPN's \"server network\" is the selection of IP addresses it lets users connect to. Large server networks are a common selling point for VPNs, which argue that more servers means better performance and more locations means more options to circumvent blocks.\nWhile it's true that a larger network is a good sign, it's easy to artificially inflate the numbers. For one thing, a VPN provider can set up virtual servers with IPs from locations where it isn't physically present. This is helpful for getting locations in countries like China and India that ban most VPNs, but means you can't always trust that a server which looks close to you actually is.\nIt's also common for providers to rent server space from third-party data centers to get more locations out faster. While convenient, this adds more potential failure points, since the data center operators may not follow the VPN's security standards (this is how NordVPN was briefly compromised in 2018).\nWhen reviewing a VPN, we investigate not just the quantity of its server network, but also its quality. If it doesn't disclose which servers are virtual and/or rented, we check the IP addresses of suspicious locations and research whether the VPN has worked with data center providers.\n9. Test all extra features\nMost VPNs include features beyond the core ability to connect to a server. These extras range from vital security measures like kill switches (which cut you off from the internet if you aren't connected to a VPN server) to tangential nice-to-haves like ad and malware blockers (which often work well but can't replace a designated antivirus).\nWe test two things: whether these features work and whether they're easy for beginners to use. The former depends on the feature \u2014 for example, for an ad-blocker, we'll see if it blocks different types of ads. The latter is qualitative and depends on where the feature is found in the VPN app, how well it explains itself and what customization options exist.\n10. Use the customer service options\nNo VPN client is so well designed that you'll never need help. Good customer support starts with an up-to-date knowledge base written in clear English by a human author, with logical organization and plenty of screenshots. An active user community is a bonus, whether hosted on the VPN site or somewhere else (often Reddit).\nMost VPNs have other tech support options, generally live chat and/or email tickets. We test both by submitting a simple question. With live chat, we determine whether it's possible to talk with a human and how long it takes to reach that point. With email, we measure how long it takes to get a reply from the experts and how useful it is for solving the problem.\n11. Investigate the VPN's background\nThe first step is to find out exactly who we're dealing with. We comb through the VPN's history since its launch, looking for any security breaches, violations of its own privacy policy or any attempts to pull the wool over the customers' eyes. News archives are the best source, but we also incorporate academic research by security investigators and published third-party audits of the VPNs themselves.\nWhen we find black marks on a VPN's record, we try to place them in context. A past security breach doesn't necessarily disqualify a VPN from our recommendation \u2014 most of the best options have slipped up at least once. The best evidence comes from how the provider responded to the incident. Did they change anything or double down? Did their recovery produce lasting improvements, or did the same problem happen again a year later?\nPrivacy violations are much more serious. A VPN that breaks its agreement to not log information on its users cannot be trusted to keep its word in the future without evidence of drastic internal change. Another major red flag is a lack of transparency, like when it's unclear where a VPN is based or who owns it.\nGet started with our VPN reviews\nReviewing a VPN is a matter of patient investigation, rigorous testing and an unwillingness to take anything at face value. We're constantly refining our process, so we'll make sure to update this page whenever we change any of the steps above.\nNow that you understand our process, you're ready to dive into our coverage of the best VPN services (soon to get an extensive update), or head straight to our in-depth ExpressVPN review to see the process in action."

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nNordVPN review 2025: Innovative features, a few missteps\nNordVPN is as fast as it claims, but its apps sometimes get in their own way.\nWhen we say that NordVPN is a good VPN that's not quite great, it's important to put that in perspective. Building a good VPN is hard, as evidenced by all the shovelware VPNs flooding the market. NordVPN may not be perfect, but it's easily top-five caliber and excels in certain use cases.\nFirst, the bad: NordVPN's apps could all stand to undergo a little more quality control, with elements distracting from other elements and inconsistent designs from platform to platform. At least one of its FAQ pages directly contradicts itself. And while all the server locations could unblock Netflix, the one in Nigeria still showed U.S. content, indicating that our real location might have leaked.\nHowever, there's a lot of good to balance that out. Speeds are fantastic and we saw no other hint of any kind of leak. Its server network is expansive and not overly reliant on virtual locations. The vast majority of servers are ideal for unblocking foreign websites. The real draw, though, is the extra features, including the innovative and flexible Meshnet, plus a malware blocker that acts more like a full antivirus and forward-looking quantum resistant encryption.\nEditors' note: We're in the process of revamping our VPN coverage to provide more in-depth, actionable information and buying guides. Our recommendations, and all the info on this page, are subject to change as the update continues. To see the new direction, check out our revamped ExpressVPN review and Proton VPN review, or learn more about how we test VPNs.\nNordVPN is a fast service with a powerful content scanner and built-in file transfer features.\n- Excellent download speeds\n- Useful exclusive features\n- Extensive server network\n- Clunky interface choices\n- Collects device info by default\nTable of contents\nFindings at a glance\nCheck out a summary of our NordVPN review in the table below.\nCategory | Notes |\nInstallation and UI | Connections happen quickly and features are easy to use on all platforms UI sometimes gets in the way; map screens can be clunky and apps come with unnecessary notifications Surprisingly, the best UI may be in the browser extension |\nSpeed | Extremely fast download speeds with only a 6.4-percent average drop Good latencies on nearby servers, but farther ones have some lag Fast upload speeds, but losses spiked in a few locations |\nSecurity | Uses acceptable protocols with uncracked encryption NordWhisper obfuscated protocol recently implemented on Windows, Android and Linux No DNS, WebRTC or IPv6 leaks on five test servers |\nPricing | Best plan is the 2-year Basic for $81.36, or $3.39 per month Basic gives you the complete VPN If you get a multi-year plan, be sure to manually renew in order to keep the promotional rates |\nBundles | Plus tier adds advanced malware protection and NordPass password manager Complete plan adds NordLocker cloud storage Prime tier adds ID theft protection and insurance features |\nPrivacy policy | NordVPN does not log user activity on the VPN, a policy backed up by several third-party audits However, it does log potentially identifiable device information unless you opt out in settings Some concerning liberties taken in the overall Nord policy, but no documented malfeasance |\nVirtual location change | Four out of five test servers unblocked Netflix three times running, including virtual India location Location in Nigeria got into Netflix, but didn't change available titles |\nServer network | 153 server locations in 117 countries and territories Server network is about 40 percent virtual, including all locations in Africa |\nFeatures | Extra servers grant additional privacy (double VPN, Onion over VPN, obfuscation) or specific optimizations (P2P, dedicated IP) Meshnet directly connects two devices without a NordVPN server mediating Threat Protection blocks dangerous domains and the Pro upgrade has some antivirus capability Dark Web Monitor reports to you when any sensitive information has appeared on clandestine leak sites Presets let you activate several settings with one clickPost-quantum encryption is nice, but not necessary yet Kill switch is a useful safety feature on all appsSplit tunneling by app on Windows and Android, and by URL on browser extensions |\nCustomer support | Written FAQs, live chat and email support Live chat connected to an expert human within a minute FAQs are poorly organized and contain some conflicts, but well-written on average |\nBackground check | NordVPN is headquartered in Panama, while its parent company Nord Security is based in the Netherlands 2018 theft of public keys was a mistake, but NordVPN did almost everything right in response Claims of law enforcement collaboration are overblown \u2014 NordVPN will comply with requests, but that doesn't mean they'll have information to provide |\nInstalling, configuring and using NordVPN\nNordVPN's biggest strengths are its speeds and the range of options it puts at your fingertips. User experience is important, but it's not quite as front-and-center as it is with ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. Here's how the apps run on all the major platforms.\nWindows\nThe Windows app is the first instance of NordVPN's UI being not bad enough to complain about, but not good enough to be considered excellent. The initial connection process is a little slow, and it's far easier to connect than it is to disconnect (click the power button while connected to shut the VPN off). The map takes up space that would have been better allocated to the server list.\nThe minor problems continue in the settings list, which makes the mistake of not keeping all its tabs visible in the window \u2014 if you open one, you have to click back to the main menu to reach another page. The pages themselves are easy to use; it's just a bit clunkier than it could have been.\nMac\nSetup is swift and easy on Mac, but the full NordVPN interface is a little awkward. The vast majority of the main window is taken up by a large map, which is mostly useless. There's no way to zoom out to see the whole world, and you can't choose between servers in each country unless you zoom way in. The server list on the left-hand side is almost always more useful.\nThe preferences panel is better. All the tabs come with clear explanations of their function, and are laid out so the menu is always visible, unlike the Windows app. The gear icon at the bottom includes its own set of tabs that encompass most of the common functions, including changing your VPN protocol, activating the kill switch and setting the VPN to automatically connect on untrusted networks.\nAndroid\nNordVPN on mobile can be described in much the same way as its desktop apps: generally great, occasionally getting in its own way. On Android, the map screen is much more helpful. It's expandable to the entire world and allows you to choose between servers within a country. On the other hand, the important settings are buried in the Profile tab, and the app notifies you about your \"security score\" to pressure you into activating certain settings.\nTo find the general settings page on Android, tap the bottom-right Profile tab and scroll down. Except for Threat Protection, which has its own tab on the main window, every feature is located here. It's probably necessary to keep the main app from getting cluttered, but still mildly frustrating.\niOS\nThe NordVPN iOS app resembles a compressed version of the macOS client, for better or worse. As with Android, most of its features are in the bottom-right Profile tab. It works well most of the time, but often feels slightly cumbersome. There's a bit too much on the screen, and a bit too much of the stuff has nothing to do with the VPN's core function.\nAs an example, you can't log into your account within the app \u2014 you have to load your Nord account page in a web browser. Forced app switching is a design choice that truly needs to die. That said, VPN connections happen quickly. If you tend to simply leave your VPN active, you probably won't notice any of this stuff.\nBrowser extensions\nMost VPN browser extensions consist of the same features on a smaller scale, and NordVPN's \u2014 on Chrome, Firefox and Edge \u2014 are no exception. They are important for one reason, though: they're the only way to split tunnels by URL and the only split tunneling at all on macOS and iOS. Despite being more compact, they're also easy to use, making for an excellent quick-start VPN solution.\nNordVPN speed test\nAll VPNs slow down your average browsing speeds by adding extra steps into the connection process. When we test speed, we're looking for the VPN to drag as little as possible on your unprotected speeds. Download speed will be the most important stat for most users, since that determines how fast web pages load and how quickly videos can buffer.\nLatency is important for live connections like video chats, games and live streaming. Latency increases with distance \u2014 in the test below, data packets were sent to the remote server, then back to our home network. Upload speeds likewise influence your live two-way communications and are also vital for torrenting. Let's see how NordVPN performs on all three metrics.\nServer location | Latency (ms) | Increase factor | Download speed (Mbps) | Percentage drop | Upload speed (Mbps) | Percentage drop |\nUnprotected (Portland, OR, USA) | 22 | -- | 59.20 | -- | 5.86 | -- |\nSeattle, WA, USA (Fastest) | 44 | 2x | 57.21 | 3.4 | 5.62 | 4.1 |\nNew York, NY, USA | 177 | 8x | 56.90 | 3.9 | 5.60 | 4.4 |\nStockholm, Sweden | 371 | 16.9x | 55.94 | 5.5 | 5.63 | 3.9 |\nIstanbul, Turkey | 411 | 18.7x | 53.02 | 10.4 | 5.78 | 5.9 |\nHong Kong | 350 | 15.9x | 56.18 | 5.1 | 5.72 | 2.4 |\nJohannesburg, South Africa | 602 | 27.4x | 53.26 | 10.0 | 5.67 | 3.3 |\nAverage | 326 | 14.8x | 55.42 | 6.4 | 5.54 | 4.0 |\nTo summarize: NordVPN's download speeds are the fastest we've seen and its upload speeds and latency tie with the best. Downloads only dropped by an average of 6.4 percent across the globe and readings were mostly consistent \u2014 the servers in question performed much the same in each test. We even threw in Turkey and South Africa, two locations that commonly cause problems, but NordVPN still kept the drop to 10 percent.\nLatency is more a product of physical distance than VPN infrastructure, but you can still see differences between services. When tested on a similar range of locations, ExpressVPN and Proton VPN both kept average latencies under 300 ms. NordVPN's average came out to 326 milliseconds, though we should note that its latency increased less than Proton's on the closest server.\nUpload speeds declined an average of four percent, but there were a few anomalously high readings in Istanbul that skewed those numbers up. Without that location, NordVPN's upload rates would also have been the industry's current best.\nNordVPN security test\nNo matter how well-built a VPN looks from the outside, there are several ways its security can fail. The most common problems are outdated protocols with weak encryption, failing to block IPv6 traffic or inadvertent leaks from sending DNS requests outside the encrypted tunnel. We'll start by looking for those common leak sources, then check whether NordVPN's encryption might be failing in less traceable ways.\nVPN protocols\nA VPN protocol is a set of rules used to get data quickly and safely from your device to a VPN server and back, even while that data is encrypted. Different protocols are connected with different encryption algorithms and can impact the speed, security and stability of your connection.\nWhen testing VPN security, the first step is to see if it's using any protocols like PPTP that are outdated and crackable, or homebrewed protocols with unclear security. NordVPN users have four options for protocols: OpenVPN, IKEv2 (not available on Mac or iOS), NordLynx and NordWhisper (available on Windows, Android and Linux only).\nOpenVPN and IKEv2 are both standard protocols you'll find on most VPN providers. Both use various strengths of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), with OpenVPN defaulting to AES-256 and IKEv2 to AES-128. OpenVPN can be set to UDP (faster but less stable) or TCP (more reliable but slower). So far, so secure.\nNordLynx is unique to NordVPN, but it's not that far off the beaten track \u2014 it's just WireGuard with extra security. WireGuard normally works by saving a stable IP address for each connection, which raises the very slight risk of exposing a user. NordLynx adds a second layer of abstraction that means those stable addresses are never revealed. Since NordVPN strongly recommends it for most situations, we used it for all our tests in this review.\nFinally, there's NordWhisper, a new protocol introduced in early 2025 that disguises your VPN traffic as normal web traffic to evade blanket web blocks. It's likely to be slower than the other protocols, so don't use it unless everything else has been blocked. We also don't recommend counting on it too much in general \u2014 large-scale censorship technology, like the Great Firewall of China, tends to rely on blocklists of known VPN servers, whose identity NordWhisper can't disguise.\nLeak test\nOur first order of business was to check five test servers to see if they leaked our real IP address \u2014 staying away from the ones in the speed test in order to get as comprehensive a picture of NordVPN's security as possible. With help from ipleak.net, we found all five to be free of the three major types of leaks.\nDNS leaks occur when a VPN sends DNS requests (in short, how your browser knows which websites to show you) outside its encrypted tunnel. By default, NordVPN uses its own private DNS servers, which our tests showed to effectively prevent leaks.\nWebRTC leaks are caused by real-time communication protocols sending information outside the VPN, which may reveal your real IP address. NordVPN is consistently successful at keeping WebRTC inside the tunnel, but you can have your browser block it if you're still worried.\nIPv6 leaks happen when a VPN only blocks IPv4 traffic and lets v6 through. NordVPN automatically blocks IPv6 traffic while it's active, so an IPv6 leak is all but impossible.\nAlthough that's all great news, it is still possible for leaks to occur without a clear explanation, so we ran one final test on NordVPN.\nEncryption test\nWireshark is a program that captures detailed images of information sent over a device's internet connection. Even though our tests showed NordVPN to be free of leaks, we wanted to inspect it at the most granular level. Using WireShark, we recorded the traffic sent to an unencrypted HTTP site, before and after connecting to each NordVPN test server.\nEvery server showed the same pattern: readable plaintext before, encrypted ciphertext after. If there is a security flaw remaining in NordVPN, it's unlikely to be relevant to the overwhelming majority of users.\nHow much does NordVPN cost?\nNordVPN's pricing structure looks convoluted at first, but it's much simpler than it appears. A Basic subscription gets you full VPN functionality, and all the other tiers just add more features. If all you need is a VPN, you only need to concern yourself with the left side of the table below.\nThe best deal for a Basic NordVPN subscription, which lets you connect to NordVPN with up to 10 devices at once, costs $81.36 for two years when you pay upfront ($3.39 per month). One year of the same plan costs $59.88 in advance ($4.99 per month) or $12.99 for one month at a time. The table below shows the complete cost; for more information on plans above Basic, see \"side apps and bundles\" in the next section.\nPlan | 1-month cost | 1-year cost | 2-year cost |\nBasic | $12.99 | $59.88 ($4.99/month) | $81.36 ($3.39/month) |\nPlus | $13.99 | $71.88 ($5.99/month) | $105.36 ($4.39/month) |\nComplete | $14.99 | $83.88 ($6.99/month) | $129.36 ($5.39/month) |\nPrime | $17.99 | $107.88 ($8.99/month) | $177.36 ($7.39/month) |\nThe longer plans save money, but be careful: if you let them expire, you'll automatically renew at the more expensive one-year plan. Enough customers claim to have been auto-renewed at the higher rate that they've launched a class-action lawsuit against NordVPN, accusing the company of deceptive pricing practices and making renewals too difficult to cancel. A NordVPN PR rep said they could not comment on ongoing legal action, \"other than to state that we are and always have been very clear about the recurring nature of our services.\" No court date has been set so far.\nThat said, there's a fairly straightforward workaround in the meantime: To prevent the auto renewal, log out of your NordVPN account, then sign up for a discounted plan again using the same email. As long as you do this before your subscription expires, your new account should link to your old one, keeping you subscribed at the introductory rate.\nFree trials and refunds\nEvery NordVPN plan comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you cancel and request a refund before 30 days are up, you'll get the full cost back. The only way to try it for free without paying is to get the app on Android, where there's a seven-day trial through the Google Play Store.\nNordVPN side apps and bundles\nNordVPN is part of a larger family of Nord Security products, which you can save money on if you need more than one. We won't review all of them here, but for reference, here's everything you'll get from the higher subscription tiers.\nBasic: VPN on 10 devices, specialty servers, DNS ad-blocking, Meshnet\nPlus: All Basic features, plus malware scanning, extra scam blocking, tracker blocking, NordPass password manager, data breach scanner\nComplete: All Plus features, along with 1TB of NordLocker encrypted cloud storage\nPrime: All Complete features, plus NordProtect features like dark web monitoring, credit monitoring, ID theft insurance and extortion insurance\nAnother tier called Ultra includes a subscription to Incogni, a data removal service run by Nord's partner Surfshark. The Ultra bundle is only available in certain countries, since NordVPN is still testing it; users outside the test countries can still add Incogni service at checkout. There also used to be a NordVPN family plan, but it seems to have been eliminated after Nord expanded the devices per subscription to 10.\nYou can get a dedicated IP address on NordVPN to ensure you have the same IP every time you connect. This lets you configure remote firewalls to let you through while you're connected to the VPN. A dedicated IP costs $8.99 per month, $70.68 for a year ($5.89 per month) or $100.56 for two years ($4.19 per month).\nThe NordVPN pricing page lists access to a Saily eSIM plan as a perk, though mysteriously, none of the existing plans seem to include it yet. A lot of VPNs are expanding into the eSIM space, so this may change soon.\nClose-reading NordVPN's privacy policy\nA VPN privacy policy isn't just empty words \u2014 it's a contract between the provider and its users. If a service openly defied its own policy, it could be sued for false advertising. VPNs tend to sneak loopholes into their privacy policies instead of flouting them outright; these loopholes can shed light on how the provider actually views your privacy.\nWe combed through NordVPN's privacy policy to see whether it tries to take any such liberties. The policy has two parts: the general Nord Security policy and an addendum specific to NordVPN.\nGeneral Nord privacy policy\nThis policy applies to all Nord Security apps. It's impossible to create an account without a valid email address, but you can use a separate email masking service to make that anonymous. The policy also explicitly says that your email address will be added to a marketing mailing list, though you can opt out. Irritating, but not a privacy risk in itself.\nWe're more concerned about the later statement that it may process data without the user's consent \"under the legal basis of our or third parties' legitimate interest.\" This clause covers some cases we'd agree are legitimate, such as identifying people who launch cyberattacks from NordVPN servers. But Nord also considers it \"legitimate interest\" to process your personal data \"to improve or maintain our services and provide new products and features.\"\nReached for comment, a NordVPN representative said that using personal data in this way \"generally involves aggregated, depersonalized or technical information.\" That's somewhat reassuring, but the \"generally\" leaves a bit too much wiggle room. Ideally, we'd prefer that personal data exist wholly in the \"consent only\" section.\nThe section on sharing your data with third parties only lists \"some of\" the service providers who may receive your information. Among these are Google Analytics, which is known to store personal data on U.S. servers \u2014 all of which are potential security risks in the age of DOGE. Other unnamed \"third parties\" are involved in targeting ads at users of Nord websites.\nThe NordVPN representative said that \"since some partners, such as payment processors, can vary by region or specific service and may change over time depending on our operational needs, we do not publish a fixed list.\" They added that all third parties are \"contractually required to handle personal data in accordance with applicable laws and industry standards.\"\nWe aren't using this to condemn Nord; many of these practices are fairly standard in the VPN industry. But it's important to know about all the potential leakage points before trusting your deepest secrets to any company.\nNordVPN specific policies\nThe NordVPN privacy policy doesn't add much atop the general Nord notice. It does track session activity connected to your username to make sure you're staying within the 10-device limit, but it automatically deletes these logs 15 minutes after you disconnect. The logs also don't include your IP address or the addresses of VPN servers you used.\nThe only real problem we found is that NordVPN apps collect information about your activity on the app by default. This doesn't include information about your browsing habits, but it does include unique traits that could conceivably be used for \"device fingerprinting\" \u2014 in which a third party can deduce a user's identity through clues about their device. You can turn this off in the General settings.\nA NordVPN spokesperson told us that the data collected is \"not personally identifiable,\" and that the company takes \"deliberate steps to strip out anything that could be linked back to a specific person.\" This presumably means the data is aggregated so it only shows general trends, not any one device's activity. That's a lot less risky, but we still recommend switching the setting off.\nThird-party privacy audits\nNordVPN has passed five independent audits of its privacy policy so far, most recently from Deloitte in late 2024. Annoyingly, you can only read the entire report by logging into a Nord account, but it at least doesn't have to be a paid account.\nThe audit found that NordVPN was following its own no-logs policy. Specifically, the Deloitte Lithuania investigators concluded that \"the configuration of IT systems and management of the supporting IT operations is properly prepared, in all material respects in accordance with the NordVPN's description set out in the Appendix I.\" (Appendix I of the report is identical to NordVPN's privacy policy.)\nCan NordVPN change your virtual location?\nYou'll be most interested in this section if you mainly use a VPN to change their location for streaming. To see if NordVPN could unlock new streaming libraries, we picked a new batch of five test servers, then logged onto Netflix. Since Netflix tries to block all VPN servers to prevent copyright issues, our first question was whether we'd get through at all.\nOur second question: would connecting to a NordVPN server actually change what Netflix library we saw? It should, given that NordVPN seems leak-proof, but thoroughness demands we check anyway. Here's what we found.\nServer location | Netflix unblocked? | Content changed? |\nCanada | Yes | Yes |\nArgentina | Yes | Yes |\nGermany | Yes | Yes |\nIndia | Yes | Yes |\nNigeria | Yes | No |\nFour out of five locations worked perfectly. On a Canadian server, we were able to stream Star Trek: The Next Generation, which left American Netflix years ago. The Argentine server gave us access to something called Pasion de Gavilanes, which we'd never heard of but sounds great.\nThe only problem was Nigeria. We tested it several times, connected to multiple different Nigerian locations, but saw our American Netflix library every time. We then ran a leak test on Nigeria, which wasn't one of our security test locations, and found it to be working normally. It's hard to say what happened, especially since the Nigeria server doesn't appear to be virtual, but we can confirm that it wasn't working.\nInvestigating NordVPN's server network\nNordVPN has servers in 153 cities in 117 countries. Out of all total options, 62 are virtual locations (about 40 percent), where the server is really located somewhere else. This makes it possible to get servers into more places, but depending on your actual location relative to the server, it may perform differently than you expect.\nVirtual locations have allowed NordVPN's server network to grow quite extensive, with lots more locations in South America, Africa and Asia than the industry standard. Check out the distribution in the table.\nRegion | Countries and territories with servers | Total server locations | Total virtual server locations |\nNorth America | 15 | 36 | 12 |\nSouth America | 10 | 10 | 6 |\nEurope | 48 | 57 | 11 |\nAfrica | 10 | 10 | 10 |\nMiddle East | 7 | 7 | 4 |\nAsia | 24 | 26 | 18 |\nOceania | 3 | 7 | 1 |\nTotal | 117 | 153 | 62 (40.5 percent) |\nThe relatively low proportion of virtual locations (nearly identical to that of ExpressVPN) is a good sign, as it means NordVPN has been growing its server network thoughtfully. Some VPNs \u2014 looking at you, HMA \u2014 inflate their server lists as a marketing point without seriously considering what it takes to maintain such a large network. That thankfully doesn't seem to be the case here.\nExtra features of NordVPN\nHere's everything you get with a NordVPN app other than the VPN itself. There's a lot going on here, so we'll limit ourselves to a sketch of each feature.\nSpecialty servers\nAs soon as you load NordVPN, you'll see a list of special servers near the top of the right-hand column. We'll go over each of them in order.\nDedicated IP: As discussed in the bundles section, a dedicated IP address costs extra. With this, you'll always connect with the same IP, which is private to you alone. It may be worth the price if you find yourself getting asked for CAPTCHAs a lot more while connected to NordVPN \u2014 though for what it's worth, that didn't happen to us.\nDouble VPN: This sends your connection through a second VPN server before it reaches your ISP. The second server is your apparent location. There are 10 endpoints to choose from. As you might imagine, your internet will run slower with two VPN servers in the mix, so only use this if you seriously need security.\nObfuscated servers: These are only available on OpenVPN. Obfuscation can help you get around firewalls that seek out and block VPN traffic. If you can't get online with NordVPN when you're on a certain network, obfuscated servers might work.\nOnion Over VPN: After encrypting your data as normal, these servers send it through several nodes of the Tor network, granting you the total anonymity of onion routing while keeping you safe from malicious relays. It's available in two locations, Netherlands and Switzerland, and \u2014 like double VPN \u2014 is best used only when you need the utmost privacy.\nP2P: NordVPN only allows torrenting on its peer-to-peer servers, but fortunately, it's got P2P servers in 114 countries \u2014 only three fewer than it has in total. NordVPN keeps your download and upload speeds very fast on average, so you shouldn't have trouble torrenting from any location.\nMeshnet\nMeshnet is NordVPN's most unique and exciting feature by a long shot. By logging into the same NordVPN account on multiple devices, you can connect those devices directly through a NordLynx tunnel without needing a NordVPN server in between.\nEssentially, you're using your own devices as VPN servers \u2014 obviously not great for privacy, but amazing for accessing web services in other countries. While two devices are connected, you can transfer files between them through the NordLynx tunnel. You can even invite friends and use their devices.\nThreat Protection\nNordVPN has two levels of antivirus: Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro. The former is a simple DNS filter that stops your browsing from loading unsafe web pages while NordVPN is active. It's the highest level available on Android, iOS and Linux, or on any Basic subscription.\nThreat Protection Pro, which Plus subscribers or higher can set up on Windows and Mac, can work even when you aren't connected to a NordVPN server. It acts more like a standalone antivirus by scanning downloaded files for malware, and can even block trackers. Basic Threat Protection (without Pro) can block some trackers by filtering out domains known to use them, but doesn't block the trackers directly.\nDark Web Monitor\nWhile active, Dark Web Monitor continually searches known data breach dump sites on the dark web and notifies you if it ever finds your account email address. If you get that notification, change any passwords associated with the address. With a Prime subscription, you can also have it search for your phone number, social security number or other financial information.\nPresets\nPresets let you set up one-click VPN connections with a desired group of settings, a lot like Proton VPN's Profiles. NordVPN comes pre-loaded with presets that optimize for \"Downloads,\" \"Speed\" and \"Browsing,\" which sounds to us like the same thing three times.\nMore usefully, you can create presets for particular countries, then add website shortcuts that will appear once you've connected. You could, for example, set one that connects to a specific location, then add a shortcut to a streaming site available in that location.\nPost-Quantum encryption\nExperts widely believe that quantum computers will eventually make our current encryption algorithms obsolete, but there's almost no consensus on when that will actually happen \u2014 except that it hasn't happened yet. Knowing that, NordVPN's \"post-quantum encryption\" feature comes across as a bit premature, but it's reassuring that someone is thinking about it.\nHaving said that, we don't recommend using post-quantum encryption yet. It works by layering one of the known quantum-proof encryption standards on top of a standard NordLynx session, which makes your VPN connection slower and more erratic. Until we can verify a real quantum cyberattack, post-quantum encryption is a needless precaution.\nKill switch\nA kill switch cuts off your internet the instant you lose your connection to a NordVPN server. This protects you in case a server unexpectedly fails, and as a side benefit, prevents you from connecting to any fake VPN servers. You should keep the kill switch on at all times.\nSplit tunneling\nSplit tunneling is available on NordVPN's Windows and Android apps (and Android TV by extension), along with its browser extensions. On Windows and Android, it splits by app: you can determine which apps get online through the VPN and which go unprotected. The browser extensions let you split by URL, so the VPN only protects certain sites.\nNordVPN customer support options\nNordVPN's apps link directly to its online help center. As always, we went in with a specific question in mind: whether the basic level of Threat Protection could block trackers, and if so, what kind. We found the categories on the written support page difficult to parse, especially the troubleshooting section \u2014 would the average user appreciate the difference between \"app issues,\" \"connection issues\" and \"errors\"?\nWe correctly guessed that our question would be under \"Using NordVPN -> Features,\" but the introductory article on Threat Protection and Threat Protection Pro was buried at the bottom of the list. Unfortunately, that made things more confusing, as this article says that Threat Protection (not Pro) both does and doesn't block trackers. In NordVPN's favor, however, using the search bar brought us instantly back to that article without any confusion.\nThe live support experience\nUsing NordVPN's live chat was a smooth and reassuring experience. From the time we decided to ask directly, it took us less than a minute to connect with a real person, who quickly cleared up the confusion and promised to update the confusing support page (we'll check back to see if they actually do).\nOne other option is an email support form, which can be found both on the website and in the help sections of NordVPN apps. This is best for complex problems that require screenshots to explain, and promises a response within 24 hours.\nNordVPN background check\nNordVPN was founded in 2012. Launching with its desktop apps, it moved to iOS and Android in 2016, then added apps for browser extensions and smart TVs. Its developer, Nord Security, has no parent company, and its history is relatively uncontroversial. We've documented two notable incidents below, plus more about Nord Security's operations.\nHeadquarters and ownership\nNord Security was founded in Lithuania, and maintains offices there. Although Nord Security is registered in Amsterdam, NordVPN operates under a separate license in Panama, which makes any data requests subject to Panama's courts.\nFinland server breach\nThe first serious incident in NordVPN's history began in March 2018, when unidentified hackers managed to steal three private keys from one of Nord's data centers in Finland. Researchers didn't notice the leak until October 2019, well after the stolen keys had expired, but NordVPN's encryption was still technically vulnerable for several months.\nWe say \"technically,\" because it was really only the outer layer of encryption \u2014 and even if they'd broken through it all, the hackers would only have seen browsing activity, not usernames, passwords or anything else sensitive. If anything, NordVPN's response actually makes us trust it more. It ended its relationship with the contractor who ran the Finnish data center and revamped its policies to eliminate the kind of negligence that led to the breach.\nArguably, its only real error was not immediately disclosing the breach. NordVPN learned about the leak and started addressing it in May 2018, but the news didn't break until more than a year later. That timing probably made it look more suspicious than any actual mishandling did.\nLaw enforcement compliance\nAnother minor controversy erupted in 2022, when PCMag and other outlets reported that NordVPN had edited its website to say that it would comply with data requests from law enforcement. NordVPN responded with a new post that said nothing had changed: their policy was always to comply with lawful requests, which \u2014 provided the requests were lawfully submitted through a Panamanian court \u2014 is literally their only option.\nWe're inclined to agree. VPNs are legal companies. They wouldn't last long if they openly declared their intent to break the law. The key is that when law enforcement comes calling, there shouldn't be anything to show them, as with the Turkish seizure of ExpressVPN. That's why verifiable no-logging policies are so important.\nFinal verdict\nNordVPN is a great service on its own merits. It only suffers from having to be compared with the likes of ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. For example, its P2P servers are good for torrenting, but not as useful without Proton's port forwarding. It's fast, but speed tests fluctuated just a little more than Express.\nNordVPN's extra features are the best reason to pick it over its rivals. With Meshnet, you can theoretically set up a VPN connection anywhere in the world, and no other VPN has anything close to Meshnet's file transfer powers. Threat Protection Pro is also great if you can get it, adding file scanning to bolster the typical approach of just blocking suspicious DNS addresses. Specialty servers round out the offering, with double VPN maintaining good speeds with extra safety and Onion over VPN being among the safest ways to use Tor."

Powered by principles, not pockets.\nWindscribe is open source, letting you see exactly what you\u2019re signing up for. Our transparency reports, audits, and court wins prove it.\nOur RAM disk infrastructure stores no identifying data anywhere. Keep your online activity private from everyone, including us!\nHonest, no B.S. billing! The price you signed up for is the price you pay. Forever. Predictable, but in a good way.\nAES256, \u201cSuper Duper Encryption,\u201d \u201cNo Logs,\u201d \u201cMilitary Grade\u201d (but not like that cheap gov stuff made by the lowest bidder). You get the point. We\u2019re not just here to play\u2014Windscribe f*cks.\nConfused? Hopefully this video we dropped someone's yearly salary on can clear things up\nYes, you do! Here are several reasons why using a VPN like Windscribe is essential:\nPrivacy Protection from ISPs and Advertisers\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) can track and log your browsing activity, often selling data to advertisers. A VPN encrypts your connection, preventing ISPs from seeing what you're doing online.\nSecurity on Public Wi-Fi\nPublic Wi-Fi networks (in cafes, airports, hotels) are notoriously insecure, making you an easy target. Windscribe encrypts your data, ensuring that even if someone intercepts your connection, they can\u2019t see or steal your information.\nAccess to Geo-Restricted Content\nMany websites, streaming services, and news outlets restrict content based on your location. A VPN allows you to connect through different countries, bypassing these restrictions and letting you access content from anywhere.\nAvoid Censorship and Surveillance\nIn countries with strict internet censorship, many sites and services are blocked. A VPN helps bypass these restrictions, ensuring access to free and open information. Windscribe is particularly effective in countries with heavy internet surveillance, offering an anti-censorship mode to bypass detection.\nWhile there are many VPN services available, Windscribe stands out for several reasons:\nStrong Privacy Policy\nWindscribe has a strict no-logs policy, meaning it does not store your browsing history, connection timestamps, or IP addresses. Unlike other VPNs that claim to have no logs but still collect metadata, Windscribe ensures your online activity remains private.\nGenerous Free Plan\nWindscribe offers 10GB/month for free users who confirm their email. You can also earn more data through simple tasks like tweeting about Windscribe.\nAdvanced Security Features\nWindscribe includes features like R.O.B.E.R.T. (customizable adblocker), Split Tunneling, and Double Hop (routing through two VPN servers for extra anonymity).\nUnblocks Streaming Services\nMany VPNs struggle to bypass geo-restrictions on popular streaming services. Windscribe's servers are optimized for streaming, allowing access to content worldwide without any lag or buffering.\nWorks in Censored Regions\nUnlike many VPNs that fail in restricted regions of the world, Windscribe offers obfuscation tech to bypass censorship and keep the internet open and secure.\nYes, VPNs are legal in most countries. They are legitimate tools for securing online privacy, protecting data, and accessing restricted content. However, there are exceptions:\nRestricted Use\nSome countries, like China, Russia, UAE, and Turkey, heavily regulate or restrict VPN usage. They may block VPN services or require government approval for operation.\nIllegal Activities Remain Illegal\nUsing a VPN does not make illegal activities (such as hacking, fraud, or distributing copyrighted content) legal.\nFor most users, especially in countries with open internet policies, VPNs are completely legal and widely used for privacy, security, and unrestricted access to information.\nVPNs can cost up to $30/month, but Windscribe offers flexible pricing plans that are easy on your wallet and don\u2019t lock you into prohibitive, long-term contracts.\nWindscribe's Pro Plan costs only $5.75 / month (billed annually) for unlimited data, access to all servers, and advanced features like R.O.B.E.R.T.\nBuild-a-Plan starts as low as $3/month \u2014 $1 per location, $1 for unlimited data.\nWindscribe team accounts are priced at $3/month, with a minimum of 5 seats per team.\nEach plan comes with access to unlimited devices, helping you access Windscribe on mobile, tablet, PC, laptop, smart TV, and more. Most competitors offer a limit of up to 5 devices, making Windscribe more flexible and cost-effective for casual and power users alike.\nNo two people are the same; some VPN users may prioritize security features, while others might just be looking for the cheapest price. Here's a handy reference list of how to choose the best VPN:\nPrivacy & Logging Policy: Ensure the VPN does not log your browsing activity. Windscribe has a strict no-logs policy.\nSpeed & Server Locations: Global servers mean more options to get an IP address of your choice and better speeds. Windscribe offers a wide range of locations with optimized performance.\nSecurity Features: Look for AES-256 encryption, ad/tracker blocking, and a firewall. Windscribe includes all these and more, like Double Hop and Split Tunneling.\nDevice Compatibility: Ensure the VPN works on your devices (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, routers). Windscribe supports all major platforms.\nBypass Censorship: If you're in a country with strict internet controls, choose a VPN with stealth features. Windscribe\u2019s anti-censorship feature helps bypass the toughest restrictions.\nPricing & Flexibility: Some VPNs force expensive yearly plans. Windscribe\u2019s Build-a-Plan option lets you customize your subscription for as little as $3/month.\nIf you need a VPN that prioritizes privacy, flexibility, and strong features without breaking the bank, Windscribe is a top choice.\nWindscribe doesn\u2019t offer a traditional free trial, but we do offer a completely free plan with up to 10GB of data per month (no credit card required). If you need more, you can upgrade to Windscribe Pro for as little as $3 USD per month. If you aren\u2019t ready to upgrade, you can always get more data by referring a friend or posting about us on X.\nYes! Windscribe helps you stay secure while travelling by:\nIt\u2019s always best to download Windscribe before you travel to have it handy and ready to go on your devices.\nAbsolutely! Windscribe follows a strict no-logs policy, meaning we do not store your browsing history, connection timestamps, or personally identifiable information. Unlike other VPNs that claim to be private but secretly track you, we take privacy seriously. Read our privacy policy to learn more. Windscribe is also one of the rare VPNs that's completely open source.\nWhat's more, while many VPNs claim to be secure, few undergo external verification. Windscribe has conducted independent security audits to ensure the integrity of our infrastructure and policies. You can find details about our audits here.\nLearn more about Windscribe, who we are, and why we do what we do."

Alternatively, use our Smart DNS feature for smart TVs, game consoles, and routers.\nWhat Is a VPN?\nThe definition of a VPN is a Virtual Private Network. Meaning, it\u2019s a service that provides a secure and encrypted internet connection. It became a popular cybersecurity tool in recent years due to the rise of online threats on public networks.\nPIA VPN protects your digital identity by rerouting your internet traffic through private and secure servers. We have a vast global network of advanced VPN servers, and we use the best VPN protocols available to encrypt your personal data.\nPIA's Robust Server Infrastructure\nPIA VPN uses the IP Security Architecture (IPSec) open framework to encrypt and authenticate information. It encrypts outgoing data and authenticates incoming data. In both cases, the data is transferred through an intermediate secure server that handles all communication. That\u2019s why the quality of these servers is crucial.\nPIA has a network of NextGen servers, designed and optimized with the best hardware components. Our colocated servers guarantee that our infrastructure is unreachable to third parties. We also upgraded our servers to have 10Gbps network cards and allow maximum connection speeds. These features ensure you get the safest and fastest connection possible.\nHow Does a VPN Work?\nA VPN reroutes your internet traffic, encrypts your data, and masks your IP. This boosts your security and increases your anonymity\n.When you browse online, your internet traffic can be intercepted. Your data is accessible to your ISP, network admins, packet analyzers, and more. Rerouting your traffic through a remote server creates an effect similar to that of a tunnel \u2014 whatever goes through the tunnel can\u2019t be seen by third parties.\nUsing a private network gives you an advantage by employing high-grade encryption. Enciphering your data secures your private information.\nCan I be tracked when a VPN is on?\nYour online activities can\u2019t be tracked when you\u2019re using a top-shelf VPN. PIA\u2019s VPN servers reroute and encrypt your internet traffic and mask your IP address in real-time. By using PIA you can make sure ISPs, government bodies, and cybercriminals can\u2019t monitor your online activities and pinpoint your location.\nConcealing your IP address also prevents websites and trackers from identifying your online activities. This way, you\u2019ll stay incognito, and bypass network blocks while traveling. A VPN is crucial to improving your online anonymity and freedom.\n6 Benefits of Using a VPN\nChange Your Virtual Location\nChoose your online location by connecting to PIA\u2019s extensive NextGen VPN server network. It covers 91 countries, including in all 50 US states.\nProtect Your Privacy\nConceal your IP address to protect your online identity. Stop your ISP from keeping tabs on your online activities. Enjoy secure web browsing anywhere.\nEnjoy Complete Digital Security\nMake sure ISPs and network administrators can\u2019t store or sell your data. Secure all your devices with PIA. Enjoy a private connection on any network.\nGet Public Wi-Fi Protection\nPublic networks pose a threat to your privacy. Install PIA on your devices to prevent snoopers or cybercriminals from intercepting your traffic.\nSafe File-Sharing\nMask your IP address when you\u2019re sharing files online. Connect to PIA and encrypt your data when you\u2019re sending or handling private files.\nTravel Abroad Securely\nWhen you\u2019re traveling out of state or internationally, you\u2019ll see local content restrictions. Connect to PIA VPN to safely access apps from back home.\nWhat Is a Mobile VPN?\nA mobile VPN lets you maintain a VPN session even when you\u2019re switching between different networks, like between your home network and phone carrier.\nPIA VPN has mobile VPN functionality, optimized to provide a seamless connection on any device. We have user-friendly apps for smartphones and tablets. They\u2019re optimized with a Kill Switch to protect you from any accidental data leaks.\nGet PIA VPN for all your mobile devices in 3 simple steps:\nStep 1\nSign up for Private Internet Access\nStep 2\nDownload the PIA VPN app\nStep 3\nTap on the power button to connect\nWhat Is an Open-Source VPN?\nAn open-source VPN releases the source code publicly for anyone to inspect. Through transparent practice, you can achieve stable and secure software. That\u2019s why open-source VPNs are much more trustworthy.\nPIA is known as one of the best open-source VPNs. Anyone can analyze our VPN apps and VPN protocols, and verify the steps we take to ensure a safe and seamless connection. We also use WireGuard\u00ae and OpenVPN, two of the best open-source VPN protocols.\nOpen-source coding also helps improve performance and innovate due to its cooperative nature. Having an open-source code lets PIA\u2019s community members send suggestions.\nHow to Choose the Best VPN\nfor Yourself\nSpeed\nGood speeds are vital. Choose a VPN that has top-of-the-line fast servers that seamlessly support streaming and gaming. PIA has ultra-fast 10 Gbps VPN servers, to allow you to enjoy buffer-free streaming and lag-free online gaming on any device. With our extensive global VPN network, you avoid overcrowding and congestion.\nSecurity\nWhen it comes to online security, quality encryption is crucial. That\u2019s why you should pick a VPN that uses the strongest encryption protocols. It\u2019s the only way to make sure ISPs, network admins, and government bodies can\u2019t access your data. PIA VPN offers the most powerful encryption ciphers available \u2014 you can choose between 128-bit AES or military-grade cipher, 256-bit AES.\nPrivacy\nYou want a VPN that will protect your privacy. PIA has a strict No Logs policy. It was reviewed in an independent audit conducted by one of the Big Four firms. Our log-less service\nwas proven twice in court. You can feel safe knowing we respect and support your right to privacy, and we don\u2019t keep or store your data.\nSplit Tunneling\nThis important VPN feature allows you to create custom VPN connection protocols. For example, if you don\u2019t want your banking service to flag your activity as fraudulent, you shouldn\u2019t keep switching IP addresses. Set a case-based rule for its specific apps and websites easily. PIA VPN has an advanced split-tunneling feature that lets you create automated settings and choose which apps and domains can sidestep your VPN tunnel.\nOpen-Source\nWhen it comes to VPNs, open-source is crucial for transparency. An open-source code allows you to take a look under the hood, and see how a VPN really operates. PIA VPN is the best open-source VPN. You can inspect our client source code, and see for yourself the steps we take to secure your traffic and data.\nAdvanced & Convenient Protection\nIf you feel that you need an extra layer of protection, look for a VPN that has a multi-hop feature. This feature, also known as double VPN, allows you to chain your connection through two VPN servers, boost your anonymity, and bypass censorship. With PIA\u2019s multi-hop feature, you can reroute your internet traffic through a 2 RAM-only VPN that we designed to prevent data retention and protect your digital footprint.\nCost\nWhen it comes to your online privacy and security, you don\u2019t want to settle. Choose a trustworthy and quality VPN that comes at a reasonable price point. PIA VPN is affordable and reliable. Our plans offer the best value for money. Subscribe for only per month. It\u2019s completely risk-free with our 30-day money-back guarantee.\nAre VPNs Legal?\nYes, VPNs are completely legal in most countries around the world. In fact, most governments understand the need for better online data safety and support VPNs as a consumer security tool. Some countries don\u2019t feel the same, and allow citizens to use only state-approved VPNs which can have surveillance capabilities.\nWhile more policymakers and individuals are beginning to understand the importance of online privacy, the internet isn\u2019t a safe and free environment yet. You need a quality VPN to protect your digital identity, keep your data private, and enjoy a free and safe internet.\nCan I Use a Free VPN?\nYou can use a free VPN, but it\u2019s not advised. Most free VPNs have a few common problems related to quality and security.\nMost free VPNs have fewer server locations because of budget restraints. This means their servers are usually crowded and slow, and they might not have a server in your country.\nThe second issue is that most free VPNs have older servers. Using outdated hardware can lead to vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, and cause connection issues.\nMost free VPNs turn a profit by selling users\u2019 data, showing in-app advertisements, or both. This is a major concern since the main goal of using a VPN is to protect your privacy..\nAvoid these issues by trying an affordable and reliable VPN such as PIA. We have ultra-fast NextGen servers in 91 countries, we use the best VPN protocols for encryption, and we abide by a strict No Logs policy.\nWant To Know More?\nA VPN is a cybersecurity tool that allows you to protect your digital identity and data. It also comes with many other benefits like fast VPN speeds for seamless browsing, sidestepping connection slowdowns, accessing your favorite content safely while traveling, and preventing cyber attacks like DDoS and Man-in-the-Middle attacks.\nYou are not completely anonymous with a VPN, but you can boost your online anonymity with a top-shelf VPN. With PIA, you can encrypt your online traffic and mask your IP address to regain your digital privacy. By hiding your unique IP address, you can make sure your ISP and other third parties won\u2019t be able to track your activities back to you.\nA No Logs policy means your VPN doesn\u2019t collect or store your data. You might think this is a given for a privacy-focused service, but unfortunately, it\u2019s not. Some services monetize by keeping users\u2019 logs and selling their data. If you want to enjoy a truly private internet experience, you need a VPN that has a strict No Logs policy, like PIA.\nA top-tier VPN won\u2019t slow down your internet connection. It can even improve your speeds when your ISP is throttling your connection during streaming or online gaming. For example, PIA has ultra-fast servers, and uses the most efficient VPN protocols. This means that you can enjoy the online world at full speed, with no more stuttering or freezing.\nYou can run your VPN 24/7 as long as you have a VPN that has no bandwidth caps. Most VPNs have bandwidth restrictions, but PIA doesn\u2019t. Use PIA to mask your online activities, and circumvent your ISP content-based bandwidth throttling. Stream, game, or browse the web privately as much as you'd like.\nYou can set up your VPN on any device if you have suitable VPN apps. PIA has native VPN apps for all major operating systems \u2014 macOS, Windows, Linux, Apple iOS, and Android. You can also use PIA on your home devices like your router and Smart TV. They\u2019re all simple to set up and use. With just 1 PIA subscription you can protect unlimited number of devices simultaneously.\nVPN prices vary between different brands and plans \u2014 some are free and some are very expensive, but only a few are both reasonably priced and trustworthy. PIA VPN is an affordable and reliable option. Subscribe to our offer for only per month, and enjoy our 30-day money-back guarantee benefit.\nDownload our Chrome VPN extension, to enjoy online protection on your Chromebook at school or anywhere else. It\u2019s simple to install, includes access to the PIA MACE ad blocker, and works seamlessly on your ChromeOS. You can also set up PIA Smart DNS on your Chromebook \u2014 look it up on our support portal for a step-by-step guide.\nStill Not Convinced?

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nExpressVPN switches to multi-tiered pricing with more feature options\nThe VPN provider now offers three types of plan at three lengths each, giving users more control over how they subscribe.\nExpressVPN has tripled its subscription options by switching to a tiered pricing structure, effective today. The new system includes three levels of service, the cheapest offering basic VPN service and the others adding extra features. Each one of those levels \u2014 Basic, Advanced and Pro \u2014 can be purchased for monthly, yearly or two-year durations.\nIn total, you've now got nine different options for subscribing to ExpressVPN. The company also says legacy plans will remain active \"for now,\" and current customers won't be downgraded. The change is similar to the approach already used by rivals like NordVPN and Surfshark.\nPreviously, ExpressVPN locked feature offerings to the duration of the plan, so the only way to get the full suite of features was to subscribe for 24 months. Now, while longer-term subscriptions will still offer discounts, features depend on your level of subscription instead of how long it lasts.\nThe new tiers roll in some features that were previously part of ExpressVPN's Identity Defender suite, including identity monitoring, credit reports and data removal services. New types of plans will also bump the number of allowed simultaneous connections to as high as 14. Here's what you'll get with each tier.\nThe Basic plan comes with \"core VPN functionality\" including the Lightway protocol. Basic users will no longer have access to the ad blocker, tracker blocker or parental controls. It can be used on 10 devices at once and will cost $12.99 for a month, $74.85 for a year and $97.72 for two years.\nThe Advanced plan raises the device limit to 12 and adds the blockers and parental controls, plus the ExpressVPN Keys password manager. It also gives you three days of eSIM service and adds the Identity Defender features \u2014 leak alerts, $1 million of identity theft insurance, data removal and credit monitoring. As was already the case, those ID protection features are available only to users in the United States.\nAn Advanced plan will cost $13.99 for a month, $89.85 for a year and $125.72 for two years. The one-year and two-year plans are both cheaper than the same duration used to cost. Advanced subscribers also get five days of eSIM service and a discount coupon for between 25 and 50 percent off an ExpressVPN Aircove router (it's not currently clear how the exact discount will be determined).\nAlthough Basic and Advanced users can pay extra (between $3.99 and $8.99) for a dedicated IP address, it comes standard on a Pro subscription. Pro users additionally get monthly credit reports and data removal, 14 simultaneous connections and an Aircove discount between 50 and 75 percent. A Pro plan costs $19.99 for a month, $134.95 for a year and $209.72 for two years.\nWhat ExpressVPN tiered pricing means for VPN shoppers\nUltimately, I don't think this new approach will change much about the experience of using ExpressVPN. It's not introducing any new features; I already touched on everything here in my recent ExpressVPN review, so the only difference is how much you'll pay to access the perks.\nThe best news for consumers is that ExpressVPN is now available for significantly cheaper than before. A two-year Basic plan costs about 30 percent less than a two-year subscription used to \u2014 though a one-year basic plan is still more expensive than a comparable subscription to Proton VPN or Surfshark. All that said, I can't enthusiastically recommend a Basic subscription until I know that it includes the Network Lock kill switch and split tunneling on supported platforms (we're reaching out to ExpressVPN to confirm this).\nWe're in the process of overhauling our ranking of best VPNs, including the new information from ExpressVPN \u2014 check in soon to see the results."

The UK government announced it will start checking compliance with its Online Safety Act, which requires any website that publishes or displays pornographic content to implement a system for \"highly effective age checks.\"\nOfcom, the UK's media regulatory agency, offered a few methods for sites to provide more extensive age verification, including credit card checks, photo ID matching and even estimating a user's age with a provided selfie. Several popular porn sites, including the country's most-visited site PornHub, have agreed to the new regulations. Beyond popular porn providers, social media sites like Reddit and Bluesky, have already implemented an age verification system that complies with the Online Safety Act's rules.\nSavvy internet users are already circumventing the age checks by using a VPN, providing a fake ChatGPT-generated photo ID, or taking a high-quality selfie of video game characters. However, the UK's new law also makes it illegal for websites to promote VPNs that get around age verification. To make sure the Online Safety Act is effective, Ofcom will fine companies caught breaking the rules with fines of up to \u00a318 million or 10 percent of their global revenue."

      "text": "NordVPN will discontinue Meshnet on December 1\nThe free feature, which let users seamlessly link their own devices and others, was ahead of its time.\nNordVPN announced today in a blog post that its Meshnet feature will shut down on December 1. All aspects of Meshnet will stop working on that date, though nothing else about NordVPN will be affected. If you were using Meshnet to connect computers, route web traffic through a personal device or share files, you'll need to find another solution by December.\nAs I mentioned in my NordVPN review, Meshnet was one of the most envelope-pushing features on any VPN, letting users link their devices through a NordLynx tunnel without needing to go through a third-party server. Once the tunnel was set up, you could access either device through the other one to share files or access services. With enough connected devices, you could check your work email, visit a friend's media server, play a remote game on another server and watch your home-based TV subscriptions \u2014 all from a single laptop anywhere on the planet. Unbelievably, it was even free to use.\nI'm sad to see Meshnet go, but as NordVPN's blog post makes clear, it never found its audience. As exciting as it was to people like me who spend all day squinting at the guts of VPNs, it didn't provide enough everyday value to catch on with the majority of NordVPN's customers. Hindsight shows us that Meshnet's benefits, like remote desktop and file sharing, were mainly business-oriented; selling those was always going to be an uphill battle in a market where VPNs are more commonly used for personal reasons.\nIf you're one of the few people who was actually using Meshnet, you have a few months to arrange alternatives. Should you want to stay within the NordVPN ecosystem, you can replace its file sharing features with NordLocker, which gives you 3 GB of storage for free. Of course, Google Drive is also an option. For remote access, NordVPN recommends ZeroTier, a platform where you can connect up to 10 devices without paying.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nProton VPN review 2025: A nonprofit service with premium performance\nExtra-secure options meet some of the fastest speeds in the industry.\nProton VPN stands out for two main reasons: it's one of the only virtual private networks (VPNs) to include a free plan with no data limits, and it's one of the few services majority-owned by a nonprofit. It's the best VPN in both of those categories, and it makes a strong case for being the best overall.\nEven if you don't care about the work of the Proton Foundation, Proton VPN is a service worth using. It's easy to install and manage, runs like the wind and meets high standards for security and privacy. It has more IP locations in Africa than any of its competitors. It's even looking toward the future by working toward full IPv6 support.\nIn short, Proton VPN gets our enthusiastic recommendation, especially for torrenting (which it supports on almost every server). It's not perfect \u2014 the apps for Apple systems lag behind their Windows and Android counterparts, and the free servers can be noticeably sluggish \u2014 but the cons pale in comparison to the pros. We'll get into it all below.\nEditor's note (7/25/25): We're in the process of revamping our VPN coverage to provide more in-depth, actionable information and buying guides. Our recommendations, and all the info on this page, are subject to change as the update continues.

As a rule, it's not difficult. Proton VPN has more features than ExpressVPN, and a couple of them might trip up new users, but you'd have to really scrounge to find an actual inconvenience to complain about.\nWindows\nProton VPN installs easily on Windows \u2014 you'll need to grant it permission to make changes, but that's it. Once you've signed in on the app, you'll reach one of the best interfaces we've tried on a VPN. The server network is immediately visible as both a list and map, and the location search bar, connect button and major features are all laid out around the same window.\nIt's honestly amazing how much you can reach from the launch window without anything feeling cluttered. They even squeezed in keyboard shortcuts for the search field. We also love that settings open in the same window, since dealing with both the main VPN app and a separate preferences panel can get annoying. Our only real gripe is that there should be an easier way to adjust the size of the map.\nMac\nThe desktop app for Mac isn't quite as deftly laid out as the Windows app. You can reach most of the important features from the main window, including Profiles, NetShield, Secure Core servers and the kill switch. However, there's no longer a way to filter out a list of the P2P or Tor servers, except by digging through the Profile controls. On the plus side, you can adjust the size of the map, so it's now a viable alternative to the server list.\nThe other preferences are hidden in the menu bar \u2014 go to Proton VPN > Settings to reach them. They're laid out in four tabs, and shouldn't take more than a minute to go through at setup.\nAndroid\nThe Android app takes the same design cues as the Windows app, and works as well. Four tabs along the bottom switch between the home screen, the country list, Profiles and all other settings. You can search the list of countries by tapping the magnifying glass at the top-right. In another nice touch, tapping the dots by any virtual location will tell you where the server is physically located.\nAndroid users get some nifty exclusive Profiles, including \"anti-censorship,\" which automatically connects to the fastest country except for the one you're in. The Settings tab is a single menu with subheadings and no unnecessary complication.\niOS\nProton VPN for iPhone and iPad looks almost the same as it does on Windows and Android, but with some of the same drawbacks found on Mac. The server list is more cluttered, and once again there's no easy way to sift out the P2P and Tor locations.\nThe Settings tab puts all the feature descriptions in the open, which makes it look denser than it is. But these are minor quibbles \u2014 this is still a VPN that's very easy to activate and forget about.\nBrowser extensions\nProton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These serve as de facto split tunneling, as connecting through the extension protects only browser traffic; everything else goes unprotected. You can split the tunnel further by setting the VPN to not work on certain URLs (unlike the other apps, you don't need to know the IPs of those sites).\nProton VPN speed test: Impacts of VPN Accelerator\nWe used Ookla's Speedtest app to determine how much Proton VPN drags on a user's latency, measured in milliseconds (ms), and download and upload speeds, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Together, these three stats show whether a VPN will noticeably slow down your internet, especially during demanding tasks.\nWe had high hopes for Proton here because of its VPN Accelerator technology, which runs VPN communications across several parallel tracks to process everything faster. It didn't disappoint \u2014 for the most part. Although download speeds didn't reach the heights we saw from ExpressVPN, Proton VPN's browsing performance still looks excellent nearly across the board.\nTo choose our locations for the test, we checked Proton VPN's list of smart routing servers, which use servers in one country to simulate IP addresses in another. Almost all the smart routing servers are based in five cities: Miami, London, Marseille, Bucharest and Singapore. We ran these tests on a Mac using the automatic protocol setting.\nServer Location | Latency (ms) | Increase factor | Download speed (Mbps) | Percentage drop | Upload speed (Mbps) | Percentage drop |\nPortland, OR, USA (unprotected) | 16 | -- | 58.93 | -- | 5.82 | -- |\nSan Jose, CA, USA (best server) | 52 | 3.3x | 55.82 | 5 | 5.58 | 4 |\nMiami, FL, USA | 160 | 10x | 54.33 | 8 | 5.49 | 6 |\nLondon, UK | 332 | 20.8x | 52.55 | 11 | 5.72 | 2 |\nMarseille, France | 309 | 19.3x | 45.42 | 23 | 5.59 | 4 |\nBucharest, Romania | 408 | 25.5x | 52.51 | 11 | 5.57 | 4 |\nSingapore, Singapore | 394 | 24.6x | 52.26 | 11 | 5.50 | 5 |\nAverage | 276 | 17.3x | 52.15 | 12 | 5.58 | 4 |\nProton VPN looks very good in that table. Its average download speed was 88 percent of our unprotected speeds. To put that in perspective, if you started with 30 Mbps down (about half what we get) and connected to any Proton VPN server, you'd almost certainly still have a fast enough connection to stream in 4K.\nNote the \"almost\" \u2014 Proton VPN did drop noticeably on its French server in Marseille. It's not uncommon for one of a VPN's data centers to have trouble while the others work fine, and you can usually fix the problem by just disconnecting and reconnecting. Just note that while drops to about 75 percent of your download speed are rare, they're not inconceivable.\nProton VPN security test: Watertight protocols\nWhen we talk about VPN security, we're really talking about reliability. Can this VPN establish an encrypted tunnel and transmit all your information through it, every time, without leaks or failures? With Proton VPN, we're happy to say the answer is yes; we probed its security and found no cracks to speak of. Read the section below for specifics.\nProton VPN protocols: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2 and Stealth\nProton VPN uses four VPN protocols to communicate between your devices, its servers and the internet. Three of them (WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2) are common choices with no serious flaws as long as they're implemented thoughtfully. The fourth, Stealth, is an obfuscation protocol you should only use if the other three are blocked.\nOpenVPN is the most secure option. Without getting too technical, OpenVPN encrypts its backend functions as well as the data itself, which leaves it with no obvious vulnerabilities. It can also communicate using the same ports as common HTTPS traffic, so it's hard to block.\nWireGuard is more efficient than OpenVPN, both in its source code and the cryptography it uses. It normally requires an exchange of fixed IP addresses, but the Proton VPN implementation overwrites those IPs with randomized addresses, cutting the security risk.\nIKEv2 is a safe choice that's occasionally faster than either OpenVPN or WireGuard. You probably won't use it unless it happens to come up while you've set the protocol to Smart. As such, it's on the way to being phased out of Proton VPN.\nStealth is unique to Proton VPN, though its function is not. It's got the same architecture as WireGuard, but adds another TLS tunnel to evade network blocks that catch VPN traffic. That extra encryption slows it down, so we don't recommend using it unless the other three protocols don't work.\nThe first option on the app, called \"Smart,\" is not a protocol \u2014 it means your VPN client selects the protocol that will give you the best speeds on your current server. Since all four protocols are safe, there's no downside to using the Smart setting most of the time.\nLeak test\nWe used AirVPN's IP leak tool to check all four of Proton VPN's protocols for DNS and WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN uses its own DNS servers to reduce the risk of sending unencrypted requests, but since leaks are still possible, we tested using a simple method: checking our visible IP address before and after connecting to the VPN.\nDespite testing several locations over three days, we never saw our real IP address show up on the tool. This held true even outside the Secure Core server list, where data centers might have been managed by third parties. It's not perfect proof, but it's a very good sign that Proton VPN enforces a consistent security regime on all its servers.\nWe also used BrowserLeaks to check for WebRTC leaks. These are mainly an issue on the browser side, but a VPN is doubly important if your browser happens to be leaking. We enabled WebRTC on our browser and tested the same set of Proton VPN servers without springing any WebRTC leaks.\nProton VPN and IPv6\nProton is working on making its entire VPN compatible with IPv6 addresses. If a VPN that's only configured for IPv4 has to resolve an IPv6 address, it can cause a leak \u2014 that's why most VPNs, even the best ones, block IPv6 altogether. That said, the whole internet will run on IPv6 one day, so it's nice to see Proton VPN leading the pack.\nSo far, IPv6 is automatically enabled on Proton VPN's Linux apps and browser extensions, and can be optionally activated on its Android app. The Proton VPN apps for all other platforms still block IPv6 traffic, but this should hopefully change soon.\nEncryption test\nEven if a VPN's protocol choices are solid, it's possible for individual implementations of those protocols to fail. We used WireShark, a packet inspector app, to test whether Proton VPN's encryption worked no matter what settings were in place. We're happy to say we never saw plaintext once.\nHow much does Proton VPN cost?\nTo get full access to Proton VPN, you'll need a Plus subscription, which costs $9.99 per month. You can knock off half that price by subscribing for a full year and paying a lump sum of $59.88, working out to $4.99 per month. A Plus account with Proton VPN also gives you free access to every other Proton app.\nYou can also pay $107.76 in advance to subscribe for two years, an average of $4.49 per month \u2014 perhaps more convenient, but it doesn't save you much. The one-year plan is the best value, though it's also nice that you don't have to pay through the nose for only one month. There's a 30-day, money-back guarantee on all plans.\nProton VPN is currently offering Engadget readers an exclusive deal that offers a 12-month plan for $47.88 ($3.99 per month) and a 24-month plan for $81.36 ($3.39 per month). Learn more about it here. One final option is the Proton Unlimited subscription, discussed in the \"side apps and bundles\" section below.\"\nThe Proton VPN free plan\nProton VPN is one of the best free VPNs on the market right now. No other VPN backed by as much experience and good judgment has a free plan with no data limits. Instead of capping how much data you can use per month, Proton VPN restricts which servers free users can access, limiting them to five countries: the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania.\nThe frustrating part is that you can't choose which of these servers you use; Proton VPN just auto-connects to whichever one is the least burdened. A Proton representative told us that this change goes along with improvements to the selection algorithm, better load balancing and the addition of the Poland and Romania locations. It is also possible to try for a better connection by clicking \"change server.\"\nThe fact remains, though, that a free Proton VPN plan is useless for unblocking content in specific locations \u2014 but this may be by design. The free plan seems more aimed toward privacy and anonymity than streaming, and the placement of the free locations near Russia and China reflects that. Free Proton VPN plans don't sacrifice any essential security features.\nProton VPN side apps and bundles\nProton VPN's main bundle is Proton Unlimited, which gets you all six Proton products in one package: VPN, Mail, Drive, Calendar, Wallet and Pass. This costs $12.99 for a month, $119.88 for a year ($9.99 per month) and $191.76 for two years ($7.99 per month). We won't be going in-depth on any of them in this review, but here's a quick rundown of each.\nProton Mail: An end-to-end encrypted email service. Proton can still see a Mail user's real IP address, but can't read any of their messages.\nProton Drive: Encrypted cloud storage. As with Mail, Proton can identify users, but can't read any of the content they store.\nProton Calendar: An encrypted scheduling app with events and reminders.\nProton Wallet: A self-custody wallet for storing Bitcoin unconnected to any exchange.\nProton Pass: A password manager that generates, stores and autofills passwords for online accounts.\nEven if you only need two of the six, Proton Unlimited saves you money. Separate monthly subscriptions to Proton VPN and Proton Mail would cost a total of $14.98, so you've already knocked off $2 per month. That increases if you're able to commit to a year in advance.\nClose-reading Proton VPN's privacy policy\nProton's privacy policy comes in two parts: the general Proton policy and the shorter policy specific to Proton VPN. We'll cover them in that order.\nGeneral Proton privacy policy\nProton tracks user activity on its product websites using its own marketing tools; the data set collected does not include IP addresses. It retains an email address connected to each user's account, but it's not allowed to connect IP addresses (and thus identities and locations) to those emails unless the user breaches the terms of service.\nYou may rightly ask how Proton would know a user is abusing one of their services if they don't keep activity logs. The answer is that logs aren't needed; most forms of abuse can be detected in other ways and observed in real time. For example, if someone used a Proton VPN server to launch a DDoS attack, the team could inspect that server and find the hacker while the attack was still ongoing.\nThe policy goes on to list the five third-party data processors Proton uses (Zendesk, PayPal, Chargebee, Atlassian and Stripe), none of whom are allowed to store customer activity data. Proton cautions that it will share what data it does have in response to unblockable requests from the Swiss government, but not \"until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted.\" This is standard for a VPN that wants to remain in business, and the transparency report shows the company does indeed fight court orders when it can.\nProton VPN privacy policy\nProton's VPN-specific privacy policy is quite short. It states that Proton cannot log user activities or identifiable characteristics of devices connected to the VPN, cannot throttle internet connections and must extend full privacy and security to free users.\nIn one sense, a privacy policy requires you to take the VPN provider at their word, but it's dangerous for a company to make promises they don't intend to keep. The policy is legally binding, and breaking it is grounds for a lawsuit. Proton VPN's succinct no-logs policy is therefore a great sign. It's also been confirmed several times by a third-party audit, most recently in July 2024.\nCan Proton VPN change your virtual location?\nTesting a VPN's ability to mask a user's location isn't complex \u2014 all you need is a streaming subscription. We connected to five test locations and tried to unblock Netflix with each one. If we managed to access the site, and saw different shows than those on the American library, we concluded that the location had masked us successfully.\nServer location | Unblocked Netflix? | Library changed? |\nCanada | Y | Y |\nRomania | Y | Y |\nGhana | Y | Y |\nJapan | Y | Y |\nNew Zealand | Y | Y |\nProton VPN passed the test every time in all five locations. The only hiccup came in Romania, which we chose because it's one of the free locations. The app connected us to a free server, which was too slow to load Netflix; when we chose a paid server, the problem disappeared.\nInvestigating Proton VPN's server network\nProton VPN's free plan includes servers in five locations: the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United States and Japan. When you connect as a free user, you'll be automatically connected to whichever location is fastest.\nA paid plan opens up the full network of 154 servers in 117 countries and territories. The menu includes a huge selection of African locations, more than any VPN we've tested in some time. The Middle East, along with central and southern Asia, are also well represented, and U.S. users will find 20 different locations to choose from.\nKeep in mind that about two-thirds of these server locations are virtual, meaning they're not physically located where they claim to be. This includes all the African servers except South Africa and Nigeria; all the South American servers except Brazil, Colombia and Argentina; and all the Middle Eastern servers except Turkey, Israel and the UAE. A majority of the locations in Asia are also virtual, including South Korea, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nTo be clear, virtual locations can hide your IP address just as well as physical ones. It's only a problem if you're expecting the kind of performance, particularly in terms of latency, that you get from a nearby server. Luckily, Proton VPN gives you fast enough download and upload speeds that distance shouldn't be a problem.\nNone | Countries | Virtual Locations | Cities |\nNorth America | 6 | 3 | 25 |\nSouth America | 7 | 4 | 7 |\nEurope | 42 | 6 | 51 |\nAfrica | 25 | 23 | 26 |\nMiddle East | 13 | 10 | 14 |\nAsia | 22 | 16 | 25 |\nOceania | 2 | 0 | 6 |\nTOTAL | 117 | 62 | 154 |\nFeatures of Proton VPN\nProton VPN has a number of extra features that go beyond standard VPN functionality. We've already mentioned the Stealth protocol and IPv6 support. In this section, we'll cover an additional five features that might be of interest.\nNetShield ad blocker\nProton VPN's built-in ad blocker is known as NetShield. It's available on the main UI page, and has two settings: one that blocks only malware sites, and one that blocks sites connected with malware, ads and trackers. The stronger feature is on by default.\nNetShield works by checking any DNS requests against a database of web servers known to host malware, inject ads or attach cross-site trackers to your browsing session. The DNS-blocking approach means it's not capable of blocking ads served from the same domain that hosts them \u2014 so no blocking YouTube video ads. On the positive side, it means NetShield works across your entire device, not just on your browser.\nNetShield also displays a running total of how many of each form of interference it's blocked. It catches most banner ads, but since you can't customize the blocklist in any way, it's best when combined with another browser-level ad blocker.\nSecure Core servers\nHere's an interesting one. Secure Core is a form of a common feature known as double VPN or multi-hop VPN, in which a connection runs through two VPN servers before being decrypted. If one server fails or gets compromised, the other server keeps your connection private.\nProton VPN takes this a step further. When you activate Secure Core, your connection will still end at your chosen server location \u2014 but before that, it will travel through a designated server in Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland. A few touches make Secure Core servers more reliable than the average VPN node:\nAll three countries are safe jurisdictions, with consumer-friendly privacy laws and courts sympathetic to privacy claims.\nSecure Core data centers are locked down physically; for example, the Iceland location is a refitted military base, and the Sweden location is literally underground.\nProton owns and operates all Secure Core locations itself, with no rentals or third-party managers.\nAlmost no other VPNs pay as much attention to physical security as Proton VPN does with this feature. The second hop makes Secure Core connections slower on average, but it's worth it if you have something especially sensitive to do online.\nKill switch\nProton VPN includes a kill switch, a standard feature. When active, a kill switch cuts off your internet whenever your connection to the VPN drops. This means you're never in danger of leaking your real identity or location, even for a second. It also protects you against the TunnelVision exploit, which requires the hacker to make a fake VPN server.\nSplit tunneling\nSplit tunneling is included on the Windows and Android apps, but users on other devices can access it through the browser extension. With split tunneling, some apps or websites get online through the VPN, while others stay unprotected.\nProton VPN allows split tunneling by both app and IP address. This grants you a precise level of control over your split, as long as you know the IP of each website you're placing on the list (you can find that out using DNS checker).\nTorrenting servers and port forwarding\nProton VPN is one of the best VPNs for torrenting. It restricts torrenting to P2P servers, but nearly every server on the list is a P2P server \u2014 only Secure Core servers and some free servers don't permit torrenting. Combine that with the fact that it maintains 96 percent of your upload speeds on average, and you should have few problems using a torrenting client.\nIt also has some support for port forwarding, which can improve torrenting speed. Windows and Linux users can enable it with a simple toggle, which provides an active port number for configuring private servers. Mac users can set up port forwarding through manual OpenVPN or WireGuard configurations.\nTor over VPN\nA handful of Proton VPN servers route you directly to the Tor network after encrypting your connection. While connected to one of these Tor over VPN servers, which are marked with TOR in their names and an onion symbol, you'll be able to open .onion links on a normal browser.\nThis is more than just convenient \u2014 Tor over VPN is the safest way to access the dark web. With the VPN as an intermediary, you're never connecting to Tor with your own IP address, so malicious node operators can't see your real identity. For maximum privacy, use Tor Browser to create your Proton VPN account, so you're never exposed at any point in the process.\nProton VPN has Tor servers in six countries (the U.S., France, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Hong Kong). Each just has one Tor server, except the United States, which gets two. Tor over VPN is supported on all platforms, but it won't work on Mac or iOS unless you have the kill switch enabled.\nProfiles\nA \"profile\" on Proton VPN is a group of pre-established settings you can use to quickly configure the VPN for a particular task. Two profiles are available from the start: Fastest, which connects to the fastest server, and Random, which always connects to a different server. You can create more profiles by toggling four settings:\nFeature: The type of server used. Choose from Standard, Secure Core, P2P or Tor over VPN.\nCountry: The country to which the profile connects.\nServer: A server within that country. You can also select \"fastest\" or \"random.\"\nProtocol: Which VPN protocol the profile will use. \"Smart\" can be selected.\nAs an example, say you want to watch a TV series that's only available on Netflix in Canada. You could create a profile called \"Netflix Canada\" that connects to the fastest Canadian server with just one click. We'd call profiles situationally useful, but they can save a lot of time if you regularly perform the same action on your VPN.\nProton VPN customer support options\nWe went to Proton VPN's FAQ pages with two questions that came up while researching other sections: which of Proton VPN's servers are managed by third parties, and why do certain server locations (like Marseilles) run slow despite the app showing a light load?\nYou can access the help center through any of Proton VPN's apps, or by going directly to the website. Articles appear to be organized into six categories. Oddly, clicking any category button only shows you a handful of the articles in that section \u2014 for example, the Troubleshooting category looks like it only has five articles. If you type \"troubleshooting\" into the search bar, though, you'll see dozens pop up. There are even some sections, like Billing, that don't appear on the main page at all.\nIt has the feel of a website update that wasn't adequately brought in line with the bulk of the support content. Until Proton fixes it, just use the search bar for everything. The articles themselves are well-written, give or take some stilted English.\nGetting quick help\nWe couldn't find written answers to our questions about ownership and server load, so we turned to live chat. Free users should keep in mind that live chat support is only available on paid accounts, but there's a fairly active subreddit at r/protonvpn where Proton staff frequently post.\nLive chat is not intuitively located on protonvpn.com. We finally found it by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the main page, only to be told nobody was online to help at the moment \u2014 live chat is only accessible from 9 AM to midnight Central European Time (CET). We submitted our question about the Marseille servers as an email ticket instead.\nThis part was easy, at least, as the form helpfully populated our system information. We also got a prompt response within 24 hours. We ended the interaction there, as we weren't able to reproduce the sluggish behavior on the French server locations, but it's nice to know the team will answer quickly.\nProton VPN background check: The CERN origins of Proton AG\nProton VPN launched in 2017, but its team's experience goes back much farther. The founders of its parent company, Proton AG, met while working at CERN in Switzerland, and the company remains under Swiss jurisdiction.\nTheir first product, Proton Mail, went live in 2014 after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and claims to have 100 million users today. Proton VPN was Proton AG's second project. Like Proton Mail, it consists of a free plan supplemented by paid upgrades.\nSince then, Proton has introduced several more products: Proton Calendar in 2020, Proton Drive cloud storage in 2022 and the Proton Pass password manager in 2023, each designed around using end-to-end encryption to make user data inaccessible.\nThe Proton Foundation\nProton announced in 2024 that the majority of its shares had been acquired by the Proton Foundation, a nonprofit whose only purpose is to control Proton stock. Among other benefits, this prevents it from being purchased by anyone who disagrees with its mission. To sell to an objectionable parent company, the entire board of trustees would have to agree, which feels unlikely based on Proton's track record.\nThroughout Proton's history, we only found two incidents serious enough to comment on, and only one of them concerned Proton VPN. We'll cover them both below.\nProtonMail law enforcement collaboration allegations\nOn the page that hosts its annual transparency report, Proton states openly that it \"may be legally compelled to disclose certain user information to Swiss authorities\" (see the Privacy Policy section of this article for more on precisely what information that describes). In 2021, the company admitted it had given Swiss police (acting on a French warrant) a ProtonMail user's IP address and device logs. The police arrested the user, a French environmental activist.\nWhile that's unnerving for privacy-minded users, there are some important contextual issues to consider. Most importantly, ProtonMail is not governed by the same policy as Proton VPN. At the time the case unfolded, Swiss law obliged all email companies to comply with court orders from Swiss authorities to hand over data. VPNs aren't subject to those retention requirements.\nToday, Swiss email companies have been reclassified so they're also exempt from data retention requirements, thanks in part to a policy change Proton fought for. A representative from Proton confirmed that \"under Swiss law, we are not obligated to save any user connection logs.\" It's also reassuring that, despite complying with the subpoena, Proton wasn't able to turn over the contents of any emails.\nAlleged WireGuard memory vulnerability\nIn January 2025, researchers at Venak Security alleged that Proton VPN lacks memory protection for keys generated under the WireGuard protocol, which might let hackers scrape the keys and decrypt intercepted communications. Proton responded to Venak in a blog post, which a Proton representative confirmed remains their official response to the allegations.\nIn short: the Venak article only demonstrates that it's possible to view public keys, not private ones. This isn't much of a bombshell, given that \"public\" is right there in the name. But asymmetric encryption \u2014 the kind used by VPN protocols like WireGuard \u2014 requires both keys to decrypt any messages. Even if a hacker were able to get ahold of a private key, they likely wouldn't be able to use it for anything. WireGuard incorporates perfect forward secrecy by default, changing session keys often enough that any given key is obsolete by the time it's stolen.\nFinal verdict\nIn short, we're prepared to recommend Proton VPN to almost anybody. Whether you're mainly concerned with security, streaming or something else, chances are good that you'll be satisfied. The only serious downsides are that the long-term plans are overpriced and that it's hard to get live tech support if you live outside of Europe.\nIt's also our unqualified pick for the best free VPN, but with the caveat that it's a bad choice for anyone who needs to choose specific server locations. If all you care about is staying hidden from your ISP and advertisers, Proton should be your first choice."

      "text": "Google to pay $30 million to settle class-action suit over children's privacy\nIf this story sounds familiar, that's because it is.\nGoogle has reached a settlement over a lawsuit that claimed it illegally collected data from child users without parental consent through its YouTube video platform and then sent them targeted ads. The tech giant will shell out $30 million to settle the proposed class-action suit. According to Reuters, the plaintiffs' lawyers said there could be 35 million to 45 million class members. Children aged 13 or younger who watched YouTube between July 1, 2013 and April 1, 2020 could be covered. The proposed settlement was filed last night and now awaits judge approval.\nThis settlement amounts to a slap on the wrist compared to the $170 million fine Google faced in 2019 following a similar suit brought by the Federal Trade Commission for alleged violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Under the terms of that case, YouTube had agreed to stop collecting data on videos aimed at children, and both YouTube and Google were prohibited from future COPPA violations."

It's easy to be skeptical of any service with a knack for self-promotion, but don't let ExpressVPN's hype distract you from the fact that it keeps its front-page promise of \"just working.\"\nOutside of solid security, the two best things ExpressVPN offers are fast speeds and a simple interface. Our tests showed only a 7% average drop in download speed and a 2% loss of upload speed, worldwide. And while the lack of extra features may frustrate experienced users, it makes for a true set-and-forget VPN on any platform.\nThis isn't to say ExpressVPN is without flaws \u2014 it's nearly bereft of customization options and it's notably more expensive than its competition \u2014 but it beats most VPNs in a head-to-head matchup.\nFor this review, we followed our rigorous 10-step VPN testing process, exploring ExpressVPN's security, privacy, speed, interfaces and more. Whether you read straight through or skip to the sections that are most important for you, you should come away with all the information you need to decide whether to subscribe.\nEditor's note (7/25/25): We're in the process of revamping our VPN coverage to provide more in-depth, actionable information and buying guides. Our recommendations, and all the info on this page, are subject to change as the update continues.

The first step for any setup process is to make an account on expressvpn.com and buy a subscription.\nWindows\nOnce subscribed, download the Windows VPN from either expressvpn.com or the Microsoft Store, then open the .exe file. Click \"Yes\" to let it make changes, wait for the install, then let your computer reboot. Including the reboot, the whole process takes 5-10 minutes, most of it idle. To finish, you'll need your activation code, which you can find by going to expressvpn.com and clicking \"Setup\" in the top-right corner.\nExtreme simplicity is the watchword for all ExpressVPN's designs. The Windows client's launch panel consists of three buttons and less than ten words. You can change your location or let the app pick a location for you \u2014 the \"Smart Location\" is the server with the best combination of being nearby and unburdened.\nEverything else is crammed into the hamburger menu at the top left. Here, in seven tabs, you'll find the Network Lock kill switch, the four types of content blockers, the split tunneling menu and the option to change your VPN protocol. You can also add shortcuts to various websites, useful if you regularly use your VPN for the same online destinations.\nTo sum up, there's almost nothing here to get in the way: no delays, no snags, no nested menus to get lost in. It may be the world's most ignorable VPN client. That's not a bad thing at all.\nMac\nExpressVPN's app for macOS is almost identical in design to its Windows app. The process for downloading and setting it up is nearly the same too. As on Windows, it can be downloaded from the App Store or sideloaded directly from the expressvpn.com download center. Only a few features are missing and a couple others have been added. Split tunneling is gone (unless you're still on a macOS lower than 11), and you won't see the Lightway Turbo setting.\nMac users do gain access to the IKEv2 protocol, along with the option to turn off automatic IPv6 blocking \u2014 Windows users have to leave it blocked at all times. Almost every website is still accessible via IPv4, but it's useful if you do need to access a specific IPv6 address while the VPN is active.\nAndroid\nAndroid users can download ExpressVPN through the Google Play Store. Open the app, sign in and you're ready to go. The Android app has a very nice dark-colored design, only slightly marred by an unnecessary information box about how long you've used the VPN this week.\nThere's a large button for connecting. Clicking on the server name takes you to a list of locations. On this list, you can either search or scroll and can choose individual locations within a country that has more than one. We connected to as many far-flung server locations as we could, but not a single one took longer than a few seconds.\nThe options menu is organized sensibly, with no option located more than two clicks deep. You will see a couple of options here that aren't available on desktop, the best of which is the ability to automatically connect to your last-used ExpressVPN server whenever your phone connects to a non-trusted wifi network.\nThere are also a few general security tools: an IP address checker, DNS and WebRTC leak testers and a password generator. These are also available on the website, but here, they're built into the app. With the exception of the latter, we'd recommend using third-party testing tools instead \u2014 even a VPN with integrity has an incentive to make its own app look like it's working.\niPhone and iPad\nYou can only install ExpressVPN's iOS app through the app store. During setup, you may need to enter your password to allow your phone to use VPN configurations. Otherwise, there are no major differences from the Android process.\nThe interface is not quite as pleasing as the dark-mode Android app, but it makes up for that by cutting out some of the clutter. The tabs and features are similar, though split tunneling and shortcuts are absent. Also, both mobile apps make customer support a lot more accessible than their desktop counterparts \u2014 plus, mobile is the only way to send email support tickets.\nBrowser extension\nExpressVPN also includes browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome. These let you connect, disconnect and change server locations without leaving your browser window. It's nice, but not essential unless you have a very specific web browser flow you like.\nExpressVPN speed test: Very fast averages\nConnecting to a VPN almost always decreases your speed, but the best VPNs mitigate the drop as much as possible. We used Ookla's speed testing app to see how much of your internet speed ExpressVPN preserves. For this test, we emphasized the locations ExpressVPN uses for most of its virtual servers, including the Netherlands, Brazil, Germany and Singapore.\nSome terms before we start:\nLatency, measured in milliseconds (ms), is the time it takes one data packet to travel between your device and a web server through the VPN. Latency increases with distance. It's most important for real-time tasks like video chatting and online gaming.\nDownload speed, measured in megabits per second (Mbps), is the amount of information that can download onto your device at one time \u2014 such as when loading a web page or streaming a video.\nUpload speed, also measured in Mbps, is the amount of information your device can send to the web at once. It's most important for torrenting, since the amount of data you can seed determines how fast you can download in exchange.\nThe table below shows our results. We conducted this on Windows, using the automatic protocol setting with the Lightway Turbo feature active \u2014 a recent ExpressVPN addition that keeps speed more consistent by processing connections in parallel.\nServer location | Latency (ms) | Increase factor | Download speed (Mbps) | Percentage dropoff | Upload speed (Mbps) | Percentage dropoff |\nPortland, Oregon, USA (unprotected) | 18 | -- | 58.77 | -- | 5.70 | -- |\nSeattle, Washington, USA (best server) | 26 | 1.4x | 54.86 | 6.7% | 5.52 | 3.2% |\nNew York, NY, USA | 156 | 8.7x | 57.25 | 2.6% | 5.57 | 2.3% |\nAmsterdam, Netherlands | 306 | 17x | 53.83 | 8.4% | 5.58 | 2.1% |\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil | 371 | 20.6x | 53.82 | 8.4% | 5.65 | 0.9% |\nFrankfurt, Germany | 404 | 22.4x | 55.71 | 5.2% | 5.67 | 0.5% |\nSingapore, Singapore | 381 | 21.2x | 52.76 | 10.2% | 5.64 | 1.0% |\nAverage | 274 | 15.2x | 54.71 | 6.9% | 5.61 | 1.6% |\nThese are extremely good results. ExpressVPN is a winner on both download and upload speed. No matter where we went in the world, we never lost more than about 7% of our download speeds, and upload lost an astoundingly low average of 2%. This suggests that ExpressVPN deftly distributes its user load between servers to eliminate bottlenecks.\nThe latency numbers look worse, but the rise in the table is less sharp than we projected. Ping length depends far more on distance than download speed does, so we expect it to shoot up on servers more than 1,000 miles from our location. Keeping the average below 300 ms, as ExpressVPN does here, is a strong showing.\nExpressVPN security test: Checking for leaks\nA VPN's core mission is to hide your IP address and make you untraceable online. Our task in this section is to figure out if ExpressVPN can carry out this mission every time you connect. While we can't be 100% certain, the tests we'll run through below have led us to believe that ExpressVPN is currently leak-proof.\nAvailable VPN protocols\nA VPN protocol is like a common language that a VPN server can use to mediate between your devices and the web servers you visit. If a VPN uses outdated or insecure protocols, or relies on unique protocols with no visible specs or source code, that's a bad sign.\nExpressVPN gives you a selection of three protocols: IKEv2, OpenVPN and Lightway. The first two are solid choices that support the latest encryption algorithms. OpenVPN has been fully open-source for years and is the best choice if privacy is your goal. While IKEv2 started life as a closed project by Microsoft and Cisco, ExpressVPN uses an open-source reverse-engineering, which is both better for privacy and quite fast.\nLightway is the odd one out, a protocol you'll only find on ExpressVPN, though its source code is available on Github. It's similar to WireGuard, in that both reach for faster speeds and lower processing demands by keeping their codebases slim. However, Lightway was recently rewritten in Rust to better protect the keys stored in its memory.\nUltimately, you can't go wrong with any of ExpressVPN's protocol options. 99% of the time, your best choice will be to set the controls to Automatic and let the VPN decide which runs best.\nTesting for leaks\nExpressVPN is one of the best services, but it's not leak-proof (as you can read in the Background Check below). Luckily, checking for DNS leaks is a simple matter of checking your IP address before and after connecting to a VPN server. If the new address matches the VPN server, you're good; if not, your VPN is leaking.\nFirst, we checked the Windows app with split tunneling active to ensure the flaw really had been patched. We tested several servers and didn't find any leaks, which suggests the patch worked, though leaks were rare even before ExpressVPN fixed the vulnerability.\nIn fact, we didn't find any leaks on any ExpressVPN server we tested on any platform. Though questions remain about iOS, as you'll see later in this section, that's a problem on Apple's end that even the best VPNs can do very little about for now.\nThe most common cause of VPN leaks is the use of public DNS servers to connect users to websites, which can mistakenly send browsing activity outside the VPN's encrypted tunnel. ExpressVPN avoids the risks of the public system by installing its own DNS resolvers on every server. This is the key factor behind its clean bill of health in our leak testing.\nTwo other common flaws can lead to VPN leaks: WebRTC traffic and IPv6. The former is a communication protocol used in live streaming and the latter is a new IP standard designed to expand domain availability. Both are nice, but currently optional, so ExpressVPN automatically blocks both to ensure there's no opportunity for leaks to arise.\nOne note about VPN security on iOS: it's a known and continuing problem that iOS VPNs do not prevent many online apps from communicating with Apple directly, outside the VPN tunnel. This risks leaking sensitive data, even with Lockdown Mode active in iOS 16. A blog post by Proton VPN shares a workaround: connect to a VPN server, then turn Airplane Mode on and off again to end all connections that were active before you connected to the VPN.\nTesting encryption\nWe finished up our battery of security tests by checking out ExpressVPN's encryption directly. Using WireShark, a free packet sniffer, we inspected what it looks like when ExpressVPN transmits data from one of its servers to the internet. The screenshot below shows a data stream encrypted with Lightway UDP.\nThat lack of any identifiable information, or even readable information, means encryption is working as intended. We repeated the test several times, always getting the same result. This left us satisfied that ExpressVPN's core features are working as intended.\nHow much does ExpressVPN cost?\nExpressVPN subscriptions cost $12.95 per month. Long-term subscriptions can bring the monthly cost down, but the great deals they offer tend to only last for the first billing period.\nA 12-month subscription costs $99.95 and includes three months for free with your first payment, costing a total of $6.67 per month. The bonus disappears for all subsequent years, raising the monthly cost to $8.33. You can also sign up for 28 months at a cost of $139.72, but this is also once-only \u2014 ExpressVPN can only be renewed at the $99.95 per year level.\nThere are two ways to test ExpressVPN for free before making a financial commitment. Users on iOS and Android can download the ExpressVPN app without entering any payment details and use it free for seven days. On any platform, there's a 30-day money-back guarantee, which ExpressVPN has historically honored with no questions asked. You will have to pay before you can use it, though.\nIn our opinion, ExpressVPN's service is solid enough that it's worth paying extra. Perhaps not this much extra, but that depends on what you get out of it. We recommend using the 30-day refund period and seeing how well ExpressVPN works for you. If it's a VPN you can enjoy using, that runs fast and unblocks everything you need, that's worth a server's weight in gold.\nExpressVPN side apps and bundles\nExpressVPN includes some special features that work mostly or wholly separate from its VPN apps. Some of these come free with a subscription, while others add an extra cost.\nEvery subscription includes the ExpressVPN keys password manager. This is available under its own tab on the Android and iOS apps. On desktop, you'll need to download a separate extension from your browser's store, then sign in using your account activation code. It's available on all Chromium browsers, but not Firefox.\nStarting in 2025, new subscribers get an eSIM plan through holiday.com, a separate service linked to ExpressVPN. The baseline 1GB holiday eSIM plans last for 5 days and can apply to countries, regions, or the entire world (though it's not clear whether the package deal applies to the regional and global plans). Longer-term plans include larger eSIM plans.\nYou can add a dedicated IP address to your ExpressVPN subscription for an additional cost per month. A dedicated IP lets you use the same IP address every time you connect to ExpressVPN. You can add the address to whitelists on restricted networks, and you're assured to never be blocked because of someone else's bad activity on a shared IP.\nUnlike many of its competitors, ExpressVPN doesn't currently offer antivirus or online storage services, but there is a comprehensive bundle of ID protection tools called Identity Defender. We haven't reviewed any of these products in detail, but here's a list for reference:\nID Alerts will inform you if any of your sensitive information is leaked or misused online. It's free with all plans, but you'll have to enter your personal information on your ExpressVPN account page or a mobile app.\nID Theft Insurance grants up to $1 million in identity theft reimbursement and comes free with new ExpressVPN one-year or two-year subscriptions. It's not yet available to those who subscribed before it launched in October 2024.\nData Removal scans for your information in data brokerages and automatically requests that it be deleted. It's also free with one-year and two-year plans.\nCredit Scanner is only available for United States users. It monitors your activity on the three credit bureaus so you can quickly spot any suspicious transactions.\nThe Identity Defender features are currently only available to new ExpressVPN customers in the US.\nClose-reading ExpressVPN's privacy policy\nAlthough we worry that the consolidation of VPN brands under the umbrella of Kape Technologies (ExpressVPN's parent company) will make the industry less competitive, we don't believe it's influencing ExpressVPN to take advantage of its users' privacy. To confirm, and get a full sense of what sort of privacy ExpressVPN promises its users, we set out to read ExpressVPN's privacy policy in detail. It's long, but thankfully aimed at casual users instead of lawyers. You can see it for yourself here.\nIn the introduction, ExpressVPN states that it does not keep either activity logs (such as a user's browsing history while connected to the VPN) or connection logs (such as the duration of a user's session and their IP address, which can be used to extrapolate browsing activity). It then specifies the seven types of data it's legally allowed to collect:\nData used to sign up for an account, such as names, emails and payment methods.\nVPN usage data which is aggregated and can't be traced to any individual.\nCredentials stored in the ExpressVPN Keys password manager.\nDiagnostic data such as crash reports, which are only shared upon user request.\nIP addresses authorized for MediaStreamer, which is only for streaming devices that don't otherwise support VPN apps.\nMarketing data collected directly from the app \u2014 a \"limited amount\" that's kept anonymous.\nData voluntarily submitted for identity theft protection apps.\nOf those seven exceptions, the only ones that count as red flags are account data and marketing data. Both categories are highly personal and could be damaging if mishandled. Fortunately, complying with subpoenas is not one of the allowed uses listed for either data category, nor does the policy let ExpressVPN sell the data to other private parties.\nThe only really annoying thing here is that if you ask ExpressVPN to delete your personal data, you won't be able to use your account from then on. You aren't even eligible for a refund in this case, unless you're within 30 days of your initial subscription.\nAs for marketing data, ExpressVPN collects device fingerprints and location data when you sign up for an account on its website. The privacy policy also claims this is anonymized, as its \"systems are engineered to decouple such data from personally identifiable information.\" Audits corroborate this, as we'll see in the next section. So, while it would be better if ExpressVPN didn't collect any personal data at all, its practices don't appear to pose a risk to anything you do while using the VPN \u2014 just the ExpressVPN website.\nPrivacy audits\nVPN providers often get third-party accounting firms to audit their privacy policies. The idea is that a well-known firm won't mortgage its reputation to lie on behalf of a VPN, so their results can be trusted.\nFor the last several years, ExpressVPN has had KPMG look over its privacy policy and relevant infrastructure (see \"TrustedServer\" below). KPMG's most recent report, completed in December 2023 and released in May 2024, found that ExpressVPN had enough internal controls in place that users could trust its privacy policy.\nThe report is freely available to read. This is a very good sign, though we're looking out for a more up-to-date audit soon.\nTrustedServer\n\"TrustedServer\" is a marketing term ExpressVPN uses for its RAM-only server infrastructure. RAM-only servers have no hard drives for long-term storage and return to a standard disk image with every reboot. This makes it theoretically impossible to store user activity logs on them, even if ExpressVPN wanted to do that.\nThe KPMG audit, linked above, reports that TrustedServer works as advertised. Between its many clean privacy audits and the Turkish server incident in 2017, we're prepared to say ExpressVPN is a private VPN, in spite of its aggravating exception for marketing.\nCan ExpressVPN change your virtual location?\nNext, we tested whether ExpressVPN can actually convince websites that you're somewhere other than your real location. Our security tests have already proven it can hide your IP address, but it takes more than leak-proofing to fool streaming sites these days \u2014 Netflix and the others have gotten very good at combing through metadata to sniff out proxy users.\nThe process for testing this is a lot like how we handled the DNS leak tests: try several different servers and see if we get caught. We checked five sample locations outside the U.S. to see if we a) got into Netflix and b) saw different titles in the library. The results are below.\nServer Location | Unblocked Netflix? | Library changed? |\nCanada | Y | Y |\nUnited Kingdom | Y (second try; Docklands failed) | Y |\nSlovakia | Y | Y |\nIndia | Y | Y (different from UK library) |\nAustralia | Y | Y |\nIn fifteen tests, ExpressVPN slipped up only once. Docklands, the UK server it chose as the fastest, wasn't able to access Netflix. We switched to a server labeled simply \"London\" and unblocked it without issue.\nAll the other locations got us access to an alternate Netflix library on the first try. We even checked whether the India server, which is physically located in the UK, showed us different videos than the UK servers. It did, which makes us even more confident that ExpressVPN's virtual locations are airtight.\nInvestigating ExpressVPN's server network\nExpressVPN users can connect to a total of 164 server locations in 105 countries and territories. These locations are reasonably well distributed across the globe, but as with all VPNs, there's a bias toward the northern hemisphere. There are 24 locations in the U.S. alone and a further 66 in Europe.\nThat isn't to say users in the Global South get nothing. ExpressVPN has IP addresses from nine nations in South America (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela) and six in Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco and South Africa). The network even includes Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Mongolia, impressive since central Asia may be the region most often shafted by VPNs.\nHowever, many of these servers have virtual locations different from their real ones. For those of you choosing a server based on performance instead of a particular IP address, ExpressVPN's website has a helpful list of which servers are virtual. The bad news is that it's a big chunk of the list. A total of 63 ExpressVPN locations are virtual, or 38% of its entire network.\nTo reduce the sting, ExpressVPN takes care to locate virtual servers as close to their real locations as possible. Its virtual locations in Indonesia and India are physically based in Singapore. This isn't always practical, leading to some awkwardness like operating a Ghana IP address out of Germany. But it helps ExpressVPN perform better in the southern hemisphere.\nExtra features of ExpressVPN\nCompared to direct competitors like NordVPN and Surfshark, ExpressVPN doesn't have many special features. It's aimed squarely at the casual market and will probably disappoint power users. Having said that, what they do include works well. In this section, we'll run through ExpressVPN's four substantial features outside its VPN servers themselves.\nNetwork Lock kill switch\n\"Network Lock\" is the name ExpressVPN gives to its kill switch (though it's called \"Network Protection\" on mobile). A VPN kill switch is a safety feature that keeps you from broadcasting outside the VPN tunnel. If it ever detects that you aren't connected to a legitimate ExpressVPN server, it cuts off your internet access. You won't be able to get back online until you either reconnect to the VPN or disable Network Lock.\nThis is important for everyone, not just users who need to hide sensitive traffic. The recently discovered TunnelVision bug theoretically allows hackers to set up fake public wi-fi networks through which they redirect you to equally fake VPN servers, which then harvest your personal information. It's unlikely, but not impossible, and a kill switch is the best way to prevent it \u2014 the switch always triggers unless you're connected to a real server in the VPN's network.\nLike most of ExpressVPN's features, all you can do with Network Lock is turn it on and off. You can also toggle whether you'll still be able to access local devices while the kill switch is blocking your internet \u2014 this is allowed by default.\nThreat manager, ad blocker and parental controls\nExpressVPN groups three tools under the heading of \"advanced protection\" \u2014 Threat Manager, an ad blocker and parental controls. Threat Manager consists of two checkboxes: one that blocks your browser from communicating with activity tracking software and one that blocks a list of websites known to be used for malware.\nYou can't customize the lists, so you're limited to what ExpressVPN considers worthy of blocking. They share their sources on the website. While the lists are extensive and open-source, they rely on after-the-fact reporting and can't detect and block unknown threats like a proper antivirus.\nThe adblock and parental control options work the same way: check a box to block everything on the list, uncheck it to allow everything through. In tests, the ad blocker was nearly 100% effective against banner ads, but failed to block any video ads on YouTube or Netflix.\nThe parental control option blocks a list of porn sites. It's an easy option for concerned parents, but only works while ExpressVPN is connected. As such, it's meant to be used in conjunction with device-level parental controls that prevent the child from turning off or uninstalling the VPN client.\nSplit tunneling\nSometimes, you'll find it helpful to have your device getting online through two different IP addresses at once \u2014 one for your home services and one for a location you're trying to spoof. That's where split tunneling is helpful: it runs some apps through the VPN while leaving others unprotected. This can also improve your speeds, since the VPN needs to encrypt less in total.\nExpressVPN includes split tunneling on Windows, Android and Mac (though only on versions 10 and below). You can only split by app, not by website, but it's still pretty useful. For example, you can have BitTorrent handling a heavy download in the background while you use your browser for innocuous activities that don't need protecting.\nExpressVPN Aircove router\nBy now, it should be clear that we find ExpressVPN to be a highly reliable but often unexceptional VPN service. However, there's one area in which it's a clear industry leader: VPN routers. ExpressVPN Aircove is, to our knowledge, the only router with a built-in commercial VPN that comes with its own dashboard interface.\nUsually, installing a VPN on your router requires tinkering with the router control panel, which turns off all but the most experienced users \u2014 not to mention making it a massive pain to switch to a new server location. Aircove's dashboard, by contrast, will be instantly familiar to anyone who already knows how to use an ExpressVPN client. It even allows different devices in your home to connect to different locations through the router VPN.\nAircove's biggest drawback is its price. Currently retailing at $189 (not including an ExpressVPN subscription), it's around three times more expensive than an aftermarket router fitted with free VPN firmware. Some of you might still find the convenience worth the one-time payment.\nExpressVPN customer support options\nExpressVPN's written help pages are some of the best on the market. Its live chat is more of a mixed bag, and complex questions may cause delays. However, it is at least staffed with human agents who aim to reply accurately, rather than resolve your ticket as quickly as possible.\nWe approached ExpressVPN's support features with a simple question: \"If I requested that ExpressVPN delete all my personal data, would I be able to get a refund for my unused subscription time?\" (Remember from the Privacy Policy section that submitting a full deletion request also cancels your ExpressVPN account.)\nOur first stop was expressvpn.com/support, the written support center and FAQ page. It's divided into setup guides, troubleshooting, account management and information on each of ExpressVPN's products. The setup guides are excellent, including screenshots and clearly written steps; each one includes a video guide for those who learn better that way.\nTroubleshooting is just as good \u2014 no videos, but the same standards of clarity and usefulness prevail. The section starts with general problems, then delves into specific issues you might face on each operating system. Each article clearly derives from a real customer need.\nThe live support experience\nTo get answers on our refund question, we visited the account management FAQs. This section stated that the refund policy only applies within 30 days of purchase. Pretty clear-cut, but we still wanted an answer on our special case, so we contacted live chat by clicking the button at the bottom-right of every FAQ page.\nLive chat starts with an AI assistant, which is not too hard to get past \u2014 just ask it a question it can't answer, then click \"Transfer to an Agent.\" We got online with (what claimed to be) a human in less than a minute. Answering the question took longer and involved an uncomfortable 10-minute silence, but we did get a clear verdict from a real person: refunds are within 30 days only, no matter what.\nIf the live chat agent can't answer your question, you'll be redirected to open an email support ticket. Annoyingly, there's no way to go directly to email support through the website or desktop apps, though mobile users have the option to skip directly there.\nExpressVPN background check: From founding to Kape Technologies\nExpressVPN launched in 2009, which makes it one of the oldest consumer VPNs in continual operation. In more than 15 years of operation, it's never been caught violating its own privacy policy, though its record isn't free of more minor blemishes.\nHeadquarters in the British Virgin Islands\nFounders Dan Pomerantz and Peter Burchhardt registered the company in the British Virgin Islands from the start to take advantage of that territory's favorable legal environment for online privacy. The BVIs have no law requiring businesses to retain data on their users, and the process for extraditing data is famously difficult, requiring a direct order from the highest court.\nIn 2021, the BVI implemented the Data Protection Act (DPA) [PDF link], which prevents companies based in the territory from accessing data on their users anywhere in the world. It's a great privacy law in theory, modeled on best-in-class legislation in the EU. However, we couldn't find any evidence that its supervising authority \u2014 the Office of the Information Commissioner \u2014 has a leader or staff.\nIn other words, while ExpressVPN is not legally required to log any data on its users, there's technically nobody stopping them from doing so. Whether you trust the jurisdiction depends on whether you trust the company itself. Let's see what the other evidence says.\nSecurity and privacy incidents\nTwo significant incidents stand out from ExpressVPN's 16-year history. In 2017, when Andrei Karlov, Russia's ambassador to Turkey, was shot to death at an art show. Turkish police suspected someone had used ExpressVPN to mask their identity while they deleted information from social media accounts belonging to the alleged assassin. To investigate, they confiscated an ExpressVPN server to comb for evidence. They didn't find anything.\nA police seizure is the best possible test of a VPN's approach to privacy. The provider can't prepare beforehand, fake anything, or collude with investigators. The Turkey incident is still one of the best reasons to recommend ExpressVPN, though eight years is a long time for policy to change.\nThe second incident began in March 2024, when a researcher at CNET informed ExpressVPN that its version 12 for Windows occasionally leaked DNS requests when users enabled the split tunneling feature. While these users remained connected to an ExpressVPN server, their browsing activity was often going directly to their ISP, unmasked.\nThe bug only impacted a few users, and to their credit, ExpressVPN sprang into action as soon as they learned about it. The team had it patched by April, as confirmed by the researcher who initially discovered the vulnerability. But while their quick and effective response deserves praise, it's still a mark against them that a journalist noticed the bug before they did.\nKape Technologies ownership and management questions\nIn 2021, an Israeli-owned, UK-based firm called Kape Technologies purchased a controlling interest in ExpressVPN. In addition to ExpressVPN, privately held Kape owns CyberGhost, Private Internet Access, and Zenmate (before it merged into CyberGhost). As shown on its website, it also owns Webselenese, publisher of VPN review websites WizCase and vpnMentor, which poses an apparent conflict of interest.\nWhen reached for comment, a representative for ExpressVPN said that \"ExpressVPN does not directly engage with, nor seek to influence, the content on any Webselenese site,\" and pointed us to disclosure statements on the websites in question \u2014 here's one example. Even so, it's a good reminder not to take VPN reviews at face value without knowing who's behind them (Engadget is owned by Yahoo, which does not own any VPNs).\nDiving deeper into the background of Kape's ownership will lead you to owner Teddy Sagi. Go back far enough, and you'll see he did prison time in Israel and was mentioned in the Pandora Papers, among other things. More recently, headlines about the billionaire have focused more his businesses in the online gambling and fintech arenas, as well as his real estate ventures. An ExpressVPN representative told us that \"Kape's brands continue to operate independently,\" and our investigation bore that out \u2014 we couldn't find any proof that Kape or Sagi have directly attempted to influence ExpressVPN's software or daily operations.\nCloser to the immediate day-to-day operations of ExpressVPN was the company's employment of Daniel Gericke as CTO from 2019 through 2023. During that time, the US Justice Department announced it had fined Gericke and two others for their previous employment on a surveillance operation called Project Raven, which the United Arab Emirates (UAE) used to spy on its own citizens.\nThe revelation prompted a public response from ExpressVPN defending its decision to hire Gericke, arguing that \"[t]he best goalkeepers are the ones trained by the best strikers.\" ExpressVPN's representative confirmed that the company still stands by that linked statement.\nGericke parted ways with ExpressVPN in October 2023, per his LinkedIn profile. While we don't know what we don't know, we can say that ExpressVPN has not notably changed its public-facing security and privacy policies during the time it's been connected to Kape, Sagi, or Gericke.\nIn the end, how much ExpressVPN's history matters to you is a personal choice. If you object to any current or past actions by Kape Technologies or Teddy Sagi, there are other premium VPN options you might prefer. If you need more information to make up your mind, we recommend reading through CNET's 2022 deep dive on ExpressVPN's corporate history.\nFinal verdict\nExpressVPN is the VPN we most often recommend to beginners. It takes zero training to use, and consistently gets past filters on streaming sites. It also runs in the background with virtually no impact. If anything is worth the high price of admission, it's the excellent speeds distributed evenly across the worldwide server network.\nHowever, for certain specific cases, ExpressVPN may not be the best choice. There's no way to set up your own server locations, like NordVPN offers, and no double VPN connections, like you can build for yourself on Surfshark. Its corporate background is more suspect than the entities backing Proton VPN, and unlike Mullvad, ExpressVPN doesn't work in China \u2014 it's so well-known that the government targets its servers specifically.\nWe suggest going with ExpressVPN for general online privacy, for spoofing locations in your home country while traveling, or if you regularly need to unblock sites in other countries. That encompasses 19 of every 20 users, which is fine by us, as ExpressVPN is a great service. It's just more of a reliable old screwdriver than a multi-tool."

      "text": "Pornhub to leave five more states over age-verification laws\nThe new laws are aimed at protecting minors, but have raised questions about broader online privacy issues.\nPornhub will cease operating in five more states this summer due to new legislation that requires age verification on adult entertainment websites. The move is in response to a wave of recently-passed laws that require porn websites and other platforms with explicit adults-only content to collect proof of their users' ages. In all of these states, that means people would need to upload a copy of their driver's license or other government ID, or register with a third-party age verification service, in order to use sites like Pornhub.\nA blog post from Pornhub said that its latest locations for shutdowns are Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky and Nebraska. The site said it would end operations in those states in July 2024. The website closed in Texas last week, and has also blocked access to its site in Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia in response to similar state legislation.\nLawmakers from these states who supported age-verification laws said the rules would keep children from viewing explicit content. For example, the Kentucky bill framed pornography as a \u201cpublic health crisis\u201d with a \u201ccorroding influence\u201d on children.\nPornhub parent company Aylo has countered that the approach taken by these laws puts users' privacy at risk and may not actually prevent minors from seeing explicit content. After Louisiana enacted a similar law last year and Aylo remained in operation with a government-supported age verification service, Pornhub traffic in the state dropped 80 percent.\n\"These people did not stop looking for porn,\" Aylo told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. \"They just migrated to darker corners of the internet that don\u2019t ask users to verify age, that don\u2019t follow the law, that don\u2019t take user safety seriously, and that often don\u2019t even moderate content.\" The company advocates a device-based age verification solution rather than state legislation to keep minors off of adults-only sites.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation also raised privacy concerns around these bills, noting that no age-verification method is completely foolproof. \"No one should have to hand over their driver\u2019s license just to access free websites. That\u2019s why EFF opposes mandated age verification laws, no matter how well intentioned they may be,\" the organization said in a 2023 statement."
