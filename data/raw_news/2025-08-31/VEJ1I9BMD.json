  "content": "is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nVerizon has confirmed to customers in stores and online that its network is having an issue on Saturday. Many people have been unable to connect and make or receive calls for hours, while DownDetector\u2019s tracker peaked in the afternoon at around 3:30PM ET with more than 20,000 reports. Some customers report their service has continued to function throughout the day, so it\u2019s unclear what the cause is exactly.\n\nDowndetector\u2019s outage map showed hotspots in many cities, and Verizon didn\u2019t specifically list affected areas. On X, the @VerizonSupport account confirmed the issue in response to customers\u2019 questions, but didn\u2019t have additional details on restoration or how widespread it is.\n\nDiana Alvear, the head of media relations for the Atlantic North Market, responded to our inquiry about the issue and confirmed the outage, saying,\n\nWe are aware of a software issue impacting wireless service for some customers. Our engineers are engaged and we are working quickly to identify and solve the issue. Please visit our Check Network Status page for updates on service in your area. We know how much people rely on Verizon and apologize for any inconvenience. We appreciate your patience.\n\nIf we find out more information, we will update this post.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",
