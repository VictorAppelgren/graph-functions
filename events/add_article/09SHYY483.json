Netanyahu's strategy includes allowing Palestinians to leave combat zones, which critics warn could lead to ethnic cleansing. Meanwhile, international condemnation is growing over Israel's military actions, with calls for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid access amidst rising starvation and casualties in Gaza.",
