      "feedback": "The draft meets the 4–6‑sentence limit and contains the required dated catalysts (Sept 5 payrolls, mid‑Sept Fed meeting) and magnitude ranges (5–10 % downside, 2–5 % rally).  However, to hit Argos‑style precision and canonical mapping, tighten the language and ensure every claim is directly tied to a canonical handle with a citation.  **Action items**:  \n\n1. Replace “S&P 500” with the canonical handle **spx** in every sentence.  \n2. Add a confidence qualifier (e.g., “moderate‑high confidence”) at the end of the first sentence to signal the strength of the view.  \n3. Condense the mortgage‑reset paragraph to a single clause that links higher payments → lower discretionary spending → earnings compression → spx risk, and keep the citation (KX6AOMQZ5).  \n4. Explicitly state the catalyst dates: “Sept 5 payrolls (2025‑09‑05) and the mid‑Sept Fed meeting (2025‑09‑16/17)”.  \n5. Ensure each sentence ends with a citation; remove any stray commas or filler words.  \n\nWith these edits, the brief will be concise, fully mapped to canonical handles, and fully traceable to the source material.",
