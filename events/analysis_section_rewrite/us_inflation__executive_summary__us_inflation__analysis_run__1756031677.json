      "feedback": "The draft is data-rich but not yet a tight, decision‑useful 4–6 sentence brief; prune off-theme analogies (Douglas Tires, Starsky/Hutch) and force every assertion to a source ID, then deliver a clean house view with a crisp causal chain. Actionable edits: (1) compress to a 5‑line executive brief that states the base case, catalysts (accelerants), key risks/invalidations, and watch items, with horizon framing (0–3m and 3–6m) and 1–2 milestone triggers per horizon; (2) rebuild the causal chain from first principles—AI/cloud productivity drives higher cloud capex/backlog (0G3A676BP) -> durable earnings/free cash flow for platform leaders (0G3A676BP) -> higher valuations or compression under stress (4LQD15CFU)—and keep it lattice-like across MSFT/SHOP/NOW/CRM; (3) convert the lengthy exposition into a disciplined scenario matrix (Base Case, Accelerant, Slowdown, Stress) with explicit numeric triggers (e.g., 0–3m: Pacaso achieves two consecutive quarters ≈21% YoY gross volume; 3–6m: FDA/Mayo milestones for HeartSciences) and explicit invalidation rules; (4) clamp all quantitative claims to sources and ranges (cloud CAGR 19–23% 2024–2030; backlog ~$368B; Shopify revenue ~$2.7B; FCF ~$422M; Workers Leaders 35.95%/34.04%) and reconcile conflicts by presenting a central tendency plus a sensitivity band (e.g., oil tariff/inflation trajectories) (0G3A676BP; 4LQD15CFU; J99EM2TPZ; RHXDOHQQX; TN66GHPAT); (5) craft the watch list to 3–5 clear signals (AI productivity signal, UAS/hiring data, tariff trajectory, policy/regulatory milestones, consumer/CPI wage trends) with concrete exit or recalibration triggers, and tag each to its source (e.g., FOM34PUWA, U1KRCQOYR, A7VLN74BK); (6) ensure tone is executive and concise, and maintain 4–6 lines; finally, remove any nonessential hedges and ensure every line cites only IDs from the SOURCE MATERIAL.",
