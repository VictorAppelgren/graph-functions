Michael Erik Kurilla, and welcoming incoming commander U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper.\n\nCooper, who previously served as deputy commander at CENTCOM, was nominated by President Donald Trump for head of CENTCOM on June 4. The admiral was confirmed as the new leader during a change of command ceremony held at the Tampa Convention Center, Florida, according to a CENTCOM press release.\n\n\u201cI am deeply grateful for the opportunity to lead America\u2019s sons and daughters as we support the important mission of enhancing regional security and stability in the Central Command region,\u201d Cooper said in a statement provided in the release.\n\nIt is just the second time that a Navy admiral has held the top job. The first was Adm. William Fallon , who led the command in 2007.\n\nCooper will oversee military missions involving 21 countries in regions including the Middle East, according to the release.\n\nHe will be tasked with confronting increasing tension in the region, as the Trump administration aims to strike a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas amid rising death tolls in Gaza.\n\nA July 30 report from The Washington Post cited that 60,000 Gazans have died since Israel began their military campaign in 2023 against Hamas \u2014 18,500 of whom were children.\n\nHamas killed nearly 1,200 Israelis and abducted 250 hostages during its Oct.7, 2023, attack on Israel. It is believed that there are 20 remaining hostages in Gaza.\n\nTrump names nominees to take over Middle East, Africa commands\n\nThe U.S. is also trying to broker a deal with Iran for the country to drop its uranium enrichment program.\n\nKurilla assumed command of CENTCOM in April 2022 and worked to provide stability and security to the Middle East, combating ISIS and completing 15 major combined combat operations, which included Operation Rough Rider and Midnight Hammer.\n\nOperation Rough Rider was launched by CENTCOM on March 15 to target Iranian-backed Houthi Rebels. The aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman fired over 1.1 million pounds of ordnance and delivered the largest carrier-launched airstrike in history as part of the operation.\n\nOperation Midnight Hammer was a June 22 precision strike in which B-2 stealth bombers unleashed 14 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs on three Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Kurilla looked back fondly on his time leading military personnel.\n\n\u201cIt has been the honor of my life to have been their commander,\u201d Kurilla said.",

      "text": "The aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman, the flagship of the Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, returned this past weekend to Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, after an eventful 251-day deployment that saw the vessel fire over 1.1. million pounds of ordnance and deliver the largest carrier-launched airstrike in history.\nThe Truman\u2019s arrival in its home port Sunday followed months of almost ceaseless action in the Middle East against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels as part of Operation Rough Rider, launched by U.S. Central Command on March 15.\nDuring the operation, which targeted Houthi infrastructure such as command centers, training camps and weapons manufacturing sites, the Truman saw continuous action for over 50 days, conducting precision airstrikes and launching Tomahawk missiles while under constant fire from Houthi militants seeking to hamstring global shipping.\nThe Truman launched 11,000 sorties and expended over 1.1 million pounds of ordnance during its deployment, and on Feb. 1 launched the largest-ever airstrike against Islamic State terrorists in Somalia. Launched from the Truman, 27 F/A-18 Super Hornets of Carrier Air Wing 1 struck ISIS militants based in cave complexes, dropping 124,000 pounds of ordnance within less than two minutes and killing 14 terrorists, including ISIS recruiter Ahmed Maeleninine.\nDuring its grueling deployment, which was extended numerous times, the Truman underwent several hardships, including a collision with a civilian merchant vessel in the Mediterranean in February, an abrupt change in command and the loss of three F/A-18 fighter jets.\n\u201cThese warrior Sailors demonstrated superb grit for more than eight months. Even in the face of significant challenges, they persevered, never giving up when their nation needed them,\u201d said Capt. Chris \u201cChowdah\u201d Hill, commanding officer of the Truman, in a release. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to serve alongside such dedicated professionals and to take them home to their families.\u201d\nOther vessels in the strike group accompanying the Truman included the Ticonderoga-class cruiser Gettysburg and two Arleigh-Burke class destroyers, the Jason Dunham and the Stout. Altogether, the vessels sailed over 240,000 nautical miles during the lengthy deployment.\nZita Ballinger Fletcher previously served as editor of Military History Quarterly and Vietnam magazines and as the historian of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. She holds an M.A. with distinction in military history."

      "text": "The U.S. Navy\u2019s Carrier Air Wing 1 engaged in the largest maritime strike in Navy aviation history in terms of bomb tonnage earlier this year, a defense official confirmed to Military Times.\nOn Feb. 1, the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman launched 27 F/A-18 Super Hornets as part of a coordinated airstrike against Islamic State operatives in Somalia in collaboration with the federal government of Somalia, a defense official with knowledge of the strike said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.\nSixteen aircraft dropped 124,000 pounds of ordnance on targets in less than two minutes.\n\u201cThe joint airstrikes targeted senior ISIS-Somalia leadership in a series of cave complexes approximately 50 miles southeast of Bosaso,\u201d U.S. Africa Command said in a Feb. 11 statement. \u201cThe command\u2019s current assessment is that approximately 14 ISIS-Somalia operatives were killed and no civilians were harmed.\u201d\nRELATED\nAmong those killed was Ahmed Maeleninine, an ISIS recruiter and operations leader who led efforts to deploy jihadists into the U.S. and Europe, according to the statement.\nPast large-scale U.S. airstrikes, like those conducted during Operation Desert Storm, involved multiple aircraft carriers and air wings, which would fly joint missions, said the defense official.\nBut the Feb. 1 strike was unique in that it was conducted by a single air wing.\nThe Truman arrived in the Red Sea on Dec. 14, 2024, to provide combat support against Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who\u2019ve conducted missile and drone strikes against shipping and military vessels in the region since November 2023.\nWhile there, Carrier Air Wing 1, composed of eight embarked squadrons aboard the Truman, took part in operations striking over 1,100 targets, the defense official said. The strikes killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and multiple senior Houthi officials, according to the official.\nSpecifically, Carrier Air Wing 1 flew over 13,000 sorties and used over 770 weapons and 1.1 million pounds of ordnance.\nThe Truman left the Red Sea earlier this month for its homeport of Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, according to reports, several weeks after President Donald Trump called off a nearly two-month-long airstrike campaign against Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels.\nStill, the carrier was marred by several mishaps during its deployment in the Red Sea, including the loss of three F/A-18 Super Hornets, which cost at least $67.4 million each, according to Naval Air Systems Command. One jet was shot down by friendly fire from the guided missile cruiser Gettysburg in December. Two jets fell overboard, one in April while being towed in the carrier\u2019s hangar bay and the other less than two weeks later after a failed landing.\nThe carrier also collided Feb. 13 with a civilian merchant vessel in the Mediterranean Sea near Port Said, Egypt. The Navy, as a result, relieved the commanding officer of his duties.\nRiley Ceder is a reporter at Military Times, where he covers breaking news, criminal justice, investigations, and cyber.
