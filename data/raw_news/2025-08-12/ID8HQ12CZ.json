  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Total GAAP costs and expenses, including research and development as well as general and administrative expenses, increased 73.5% year over year for the three months ended June 30, 2025.\n\u2022 None Cash and cash equivalents climbed to $106.3 million as of Q2 2025, providing a significant runway despite the continued absence of revenue.\n\u2022 These 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires \u203a\n\nPulse Biosciences (NASDAQ:PLSE), a medical device innovator focused on nanosecond pulsed field ablation (nsPFA) for treating various conditions, released its second-quarter 2025 results on August 12, 2025. The company reported another pre-commercial quarter, with no revenue. Operating expenses increased substantially amid ongoing clinical trial expansion and commercialization preparations. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $106.3 million as of June 30, 2025, up from $26.2 million a year earlier. Overall, the results show the company\u2019s rapid advance through clinical and regulatory milestones while highlighting the sustained financial investment needed ahead of first product revenue.\n\nPulse Biosciences is developing the CellFX System, a device that uses ultrafast electrical pulses to treat unwanted or problematic tissue while sparing healthy cells. The underlying nsPFA technology is being tested for uses in soft tissue tumor removal, treatment of benign thyroid nodules, and cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), a type of heart rhythm disorder.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent strategy has been to drive clinical evidence for three main product types: the Percutaneous Electrode for soft tissue ablation, the Cardiac Surgery System for surgical AF ablation, and the 360\u00b0 Catheter for endocardial ablation. Success depends on generating positive clinical outcomes, building a robust regulatory dossier, scaling up for various indications, and protecting intellectual property to defend its competitive position.\n\nQuarter in Review: Clinical, Regulatory, and Financial Progress\n\nDuring Q2 2025, Pulse Biosciences expanded its pilot program for the nsPFA Percutaneous Electrode, a device for treating benign thyroid nodules, enrolling over 140 patients\u2014up from 90 in the prior quarter. Five U.S. study centers were also identified for a planned post-market study, setting the stage for expanded clinical evidence and future commercialization in soft tissue indications.\n\nIn its cardiac programs, the company submitted investigational device exemption (IDE) requests to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for both the Cardiac Surgery System (surgical clamp) and the 360\u00b0 Catheter, staying on schedule for pivotal trials. In Europe, the feasibility trial with the Cardiac Surgery System enrolled 40 patients as of Q2 2025, 10 more than in the prior quarter, with the company highlighting \u201cpositive clinical outcomes, as indicated by follow up remapping procedures.\u201d For the 360\u00b0 Catheter, European clinical sites have now treated more than 140 patients as of Q2 2025, advancing clinical expertise and operational efficiency, as demonstrated by improved procedure times presented at the Heart Rhythm Society Meeting in April.\n\nNo product or service revenue was reported for the quarter, consistent with its pre-commercial phase. While this absence of revenue matched expectations, it underscores the company\u2019s current focus on investing in clinical validation and regulatory progress. Non-GAAP costs and expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2025, increased 57.4% year over year. The primary cost drivers were high levels of investment needed to advance clinical programs and grow the organizational infrastructure, including a material increase in non-cash stock-based compensation.\n\nNet loss widened on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in Q2 2025 as expenditures increased for clinical trials and early commercialization preparation. At the same time, the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents (GAAP) increased by $80.1 million in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024. The available cash provides a cushion for ongoing development and the expected push into commercialization, though the pace of spending means future fundraising or a swift move to revenue generation may be necessary in the future.\n\nInventory levels, while still small, rose to $51,000 as of June 30, 2025, hinting at initial production activities ahead of commercial launch. The quarter also saw an interest income boost driven by a larger cash balance. No one-time settlement costs were incurred during the period\u2014a contrast to several earlier quarters. As of quarter-end, there was no preferred stock outstanding, and common shares increased modestly as funding was raised through warrant exercises earlier in the year.\n\nPulse Biosciences does not currently pay a dividend.\n\nManagement did not provide any quantitative revenue or earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2025 or beyond.\n\nFor investors, key points to watch in upcoming quarters include the pace of patient enrollment in both U.S. and European trials, progress in securing IDE approvals and launching pivotal studies, and signs of initial commercial adoption for the nsPFA Percutaneous Electrode in benign thyroid nodule treatments. The company\u2019s ability to bring a first product to market, manage costs, and extend its cash runway will remain central to its story as it attempts to move from clinical-stage to commercial-stage operations.\n\nRevenue and net income presented using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) unless otherwise noted.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060%* \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nJesterAI is a Foolish AI, based on a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) and proprietary Motley Fool systems.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."
