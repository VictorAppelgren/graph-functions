  "title": "Venice Immersive 2025: A Community, An Island, And The Year\u2019s Must-See XR",
  "description": "Venice Immersive 2025 gathers XR\u2019s top creators and works on its own island, blending cinema\u2019s prestige with immersive art\u2019s innovation in a one-of-a-kind festival.",
  "content": "When Venice launched its immersive section in 2017, it became the first A-list festival to treat XR on par with feature films. Nine editions later, Venice Immersive remains the only competitive XR program at a major international festival. It now fills the Lazzaretto Vecchio, a former plague quarantine station a three-minute vaporetto ride from the Lido, with 69 works from 27 countries.\n\nThe head programmers of Venice Immersive, Liz Rosenthal and Michel Reilhac, see their mission as more than curating the year\u2019s best VR, MR, and hybrid experiences. They want to foster a global creative community, one that returns each year to share work, swap ideas, and test the limits of immersion. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration not just of the works,\u201d Reilhac said, \u201cbut of a community in the making and an art form in the making.\u201d\n\nVenice awards three Lions in XR: the Grand Prize, Special Jury Prize, and Achievement Prize, judged by an international jury with the same ceremony, red carpet, and press attention as the feature film awards. \u201cThese details may sound trivial,\u201d Reilhac said, \u201cbut they\u2019re symbolically charged. They signal we\u2019re treating this as a full art form.\u201d\n\nThat parity extends to the rules: competition titles must be world premieres, with some exceptions for international premieres. This year\u2019s competition includes 30 projects, from intimate single-viewer works to multiplayer mixed-reality performances.\n\nThe curators revisit the definition of \u201cimmersive\u201d each year. \u201cFor us, it is defined by some kind of technology-driven interface that allows for some kind of interactivity\u2014or none,\u201d Reilhac said. But they also program pieces that sit outside headsets, using phones, projections, or other digital interfaces.\n\n\"Ancestors,\" featured in the Best of Experiences section, is a 70-minute AI-driven performance by The Smartphone Orchestra, known for its technology-centered productions. At SXSW, about sixty of us used a dedicated app that began by asking for a selfie. The app then showed each participant a photo of a young woman \u2014 our imagined future daughter \u2014 whose face was a blend of our image and that of a stranger in the audience. The goal was to find this \u201cfuture spouse,\u201d identified by carrying the same image on their phone. Couples were paired with others the same way. By the finale, it was revealed that everyone in the room was connected as part of an expansive, multi-generational family. Rosenthal, who also experienced \u201cAncestors\u201d at SXSW described the work as \u201cdeeply profound.\u201d\n\nTender Claws\u2019 Face Jumping, uses eye-tracking on the Meta Quest Pro to let participants swap perspectives with what looked like ghosts, by locking gazes with them. You literally are seeing the world from another perspective. The ghosts are interactive, but they are not live performers featured in co-director Samantha Gorman\u2019s previous VR theater productions The Under Presents and The Tempest.\n\nBlack Cats & Chequered Flags puts four players in a mixed-reality pit stop, reliving the career of Italy\u2019s only two-time Formula 1 champion, Alberto Ascari. Story sequences explore his family, superstitions, and untimely fate.\n\nBlur blends live performance with VR to create a liminal space between life and death, fact and fiction. Ten audience members share the journey, encountering both wonder and dread in this surreal theatre piece.\n\nCreation of the Worlds takes audiences inside more than 60 paintings by Lithuanian artist M.K. \u010ciurlionis, evolving them into living worlds. Viewers shift from observer to creator, guided by a contemporary reimagining of the artist\u2019s music.\n\nMulan 2125 reimagines the Chinese legend. In a post-apocalyptic future, Earth is tainted by an alien substance that Mulan must repel to save her people.\n\nThe Clouds Are Two Thousand Meters Up adapts Wu Ming-yi\u2019s novel into a roaming VR journey of grief, myth, and ecological mystery. With no controllers\u2014just walking and looking\u2014you follow prompts into new chapters, from forest to dreamscape.\n\nThe Great Orator is an open-world, AI-driven narrative about a preacher whose identity blurs with that of her followers. Visitors decide what\u2019s real, shaping her memories in a world that shifts with real-world events.\n\nAsteroid, directed by Doug Liman, is a 180\u00b0 short film about a desperate asteroid-mining mission. After the screening, the story continues through a phone call from an AI-driven character left behind.\n\n8PM and the Cat is a generative meditation on grief, following an artist who lost his partner in Seoul\u2019s Itaewon crowd crush. Every run is unique, with images and monologues created in real time.\n\nA Long Goodbye invites you into the life of a pianist living with dementia, piecing together memories through objects in her apartment. As her world fills in like a painting, so does her sense of self.\n\nMirage pairs VR with hand tracking and a haptic vest in a desert-set allegory for depression and anxiety. The audience\u2019s challenge is to help the young protagonist, though accepting help proves difficult for her.\n\nThe Exploding Girl VR is a visceral portrait of anger, with the protagonist erupting\u2014sometimes seven times a day\u2014as an expression of the world\u2019s fraying edges. Directors Caroline Poggi and Jonathan Vinel turn fury into poetry.\n\nSense of Nowhere is a dreamlike navigation from \u201cno-where\u201d to \u201cnow-here,\u201d inspired by Taoism, Buddhism, and Jung\u2019s active imagination. The player\u2019s task is to reassemble fragmented thoughts into a return to the present.\n\nGhost Town, from Fireproof Games, is a cinematic VR puzzle-adventure set in a deserted settlement. Its seamless production design makes it equally rewarding for gamers and newcomers.\n\nWall Town Wonders turns your home\u2019s walls into a playground, using mixed reality to build and populate an entire town. It\u2019s whimsical, but with substantial story and character arcs.\n\nOne True Path is a narrative-rich VR game from the creators of A Fisherman\u2019s Tale. Players navigate a branching journey that rewards exploration and experimentation.\n\nThe Midnight Walk takes players on a fantastical stroll through shifting dream environments, combining VR\u2019s scale with a narrative spine.\n\nVenice\u2019s \u201cBest of Worlds\u201d remains a unique platform showcase. Guided tours take audiences through elaborate VRChat environments, from surreal dreamscapes to intricate social hubs. \u201cThe community there is so well established and technically adept,\u201d Rosenthal said, \u201cwe find things we\u2019d never imagine.\u201d\n\nVenice Immersive\u2019s physical setting is integral to its appeal. \u201cThe fact that you have to take a boat produces a networking effect,\u201d Reilhac said. Industry, artists, and press spend days together in the island\u2019s garden, attending Q&As, panels, and market pitches. This year the market includes 14 projects seeking financing and 10 from the Biennale College Immersive program.\n\nThe Festival designed the visit to mimic cinema\u2019s rituals: bookings instead of queues, trained docents, and an emphasis on presentation. \u201cWe wanted to start a real exhibition culture for these experiences,\u201d Rosenthal said, \u201cwhich didn\u2019t exist back in 2017.\u201d\n\nXR in the Context of Cinema\n\nVenice positions XR not as the future of cinema, but as a parallel art form that draws from its own spatial language. \u201cImmersive stems from cinema, inherits from it, but is its own art form,\u201d Reilhac said. Rosenthal sees a trend toward cinematic forms as XR creators master their tools: \u201cWorld-building, cinema, and emotional engagement with characters are becoming central.\u201d\n\nThat convergence is evident in this year\u2019s picks, where big-budget hybrids like Asteroid sit alongside intimate pieces like A Long Goodbye and experimental theatre like Blur.\n\nA Gathering Like No Other\n\nVenice Immersive offers something rare: a place where the entire spectrum of XR from commercial games, to fine art, and narrative XR all under one curatorial vision. For creators, it is a proving ground with the symbolic weight of the Golden Lion. For this very select and lucky audience, Venice Immersive is both a survey of the state of the art and a living lab for what immersive storytelling can become.",
