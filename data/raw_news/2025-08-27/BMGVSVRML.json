  "content": "Algernon Yau , Secretary for Commercial and Economic Development, said: \"The Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI) has been put into practice, turning an idea into action and a vision into reality. The HKSAR Government contributes to the B&RI in various areas, and actively participates in the eight major steps to support Belt and Road development. Since 2013, Hong Kong's merchandise trade with Belt and Road countries and regions has grown substantially by nearly 80%, which is 3.2 times the growth rate of Hong Kong's external merchandise trade during the same period, reaching about US$280 billion. This demonstrates Hong Kong's capabilities as an international trade and investment hub, and highlights the growth potential of Belt and Road markets. The theme of this year's Summit is \"Collaborate for change Shape a shared future\". We will further enhance Hong Kong's role in taking forward the B&RI, raising the awareness of the B&RI among different sectors of the community and helping them to capture Belt and Road opportunities.\"\n\nMarking its 10th edition this year, the Summit will build on the successes of the past nine editions, by developing further into a leading platform for policy dialogue and business collaboration between Belt and Road economies and other countries and regions. Since the first Belt and Road Summit in 2016, more than 700 distinguished speakers from over 30 countries and regions have shared their insights at the Summit. Over 660 exhibitors have showcased a wide range of professional services and investment projects, attracting more than 45,000 participants from over 120 countries and regions. The Summit has also facilitated around 5,400 business matching meetings and supported over 2,000 projects, originated or facilitated more than 30 deals involving over 50 companies. These agreements span key areas such as infrastructure, finance, technology, and green development, underscoring the Summit's important role in advancing Belt and Road cooperation.\n\nHONG KONG - August 27, 2025 ( NEWMEDIAWIRE ) - The 10th Belt and Road Summit , co-organised by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), will take place on 10 and 11 September 2025 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Under the theme Collaborate for Change Shape a Shared Future, the Summit will bring together over 90 key officials and business leaders from 18 Belt and Road countries and regions and feature in-depth discussions on the immense opportunities arising from the Belt and Road Initiative across sectors including finance and investment, innovation and technology, professional services, infrastructure and maritime services. The Belt and Road Summit fosters long-lasting international collaboration and promotes the building of a sustainable future.\n\nNicholas Ho, Commissioner for Belt and Road, Commercial and Economic Development Bureau said: \"We will embrace changes and promote greater collaboration at the 10th Belt and Road Summit. New elements of the Summit include sessions featuring signature projects and market spotlights, a roundtable session promoting sustainable development, and more opportunities to exchange in the session for young business leaders. We will also enhance promotion beyond the Summit - over 20 activities in various fields will be organised in different venues over an extended period, including art and cultural exhibitions, Chinese and Western music concerts, a film festival and quizzes for secondary school students, enabling the public to participate in and experience the global collaborative achievements of the B&RI.\"\n\nPatrick Lau, Deputy Executive Director of the HKTDC, said: \"The HKTDC has a longstanding commitment to leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages in connectivity, strengthening the city's role as both a super connector' and a super value-adder'. Through its global network of 51 offices, enhanced information platforms and outbound missions, the HKTDC has contributed to advancing the Belt and Road Initiative. As one of the world's most important platforms for exploring Belt and Road policies and opportunities and fostering concrete cooperation, the Belt and Road Summit has successfully promoted regional connectivity and economic development. Marking its tenth anniversary this year, the HKTDC remains dedicated to enhancing this international cooperation platform, enabling all parties to explore new markets and opportunities, deepen engagement and collaboration along the Belt and Road economies, and continue turning the Initiative's vision into tangible partnerships and achievements, opening a new chapter together.\"\n\nThe Belt and Road Summit features various sessions and activities, including the Opening Session, Policy Dialogue, Business Plenary, Keynote Luncheon, Thematic Breakout Session, Project Investment Session and Cocktail Reception.\n\nThe Opening Session will feature welcome remarks by Professor Frederick Ma, Chairman of the HKTDC, followed by opening remarks from John Lee, Chief Executive of the HKSAR.

Among the sessions are two business plenaries to explore emerging opportunities and frontier developments across different regions and industries.\n\nIn May this year, a business delegation led by John Lee, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and organised by the HKTDC, visited Qatar and Kuwait in the Middle East. This trip marked a significant milestone as it included representatives from mainland enterprises for the first time, aimed at fostering collaboration and creating new business opportunities. The visit has facilitated the signing of an MoU between Dongchao Information Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd and Qatari developer Fikri Group, to establish a factory in Qatar, further solidifying Hong Kong's connections with the Middle Eastern market. Wang Chaoyou, President of Dongchao Technology Group will share his successful experience of \"going global\" through Hong Kong's business platform at one of the plenary sessions. Themed Exploring Frontiers in New Markets and Industries, the session will be chaired by Professor KC Chan, Chairman of WeLab Bank. Keynote speakers include H.E. Abdulsalam Al Murshidi, President of Oman Investment Authority; Elton Chan, Director of Jardine Matheson Limited; Ronald Lam, CEO of Cathay Group; and Gansha Wu, Co-founder, Chairman and CEO of UISEE Technologies (Beijing) Co., Ltd.\n\nThe other business plenary session, themed ASEAN: Unveiling New Opportunities for Growth and Collaboration, will be chaired by Dr Victor K Fung, Chairman of Fung Group, and feature speakers Zeng Qi, Vice President of CITIC Group Corporation; Dong Mingzhu, Chairperson and President of Gree Electric Appliance Inc. of Zhuhai; Tony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A; Antony Leung, Chairman of Nan Fung Group; and Dr. Hashim S.

The Youth Chapter will include interactive elements to facilitate deeper engagement between participants and young leaders.\n\nDuring the Summit, the Project Investment Session, the Belt and Road Deal-Making, and Exhibition will highlight developments from around the world, particularly in the Middle East and ASEAN markets, facilitating interaction among regional opinion leaders and business decision-makers, and promoting substantive cooperation across different sectors.\n\nThe Project Investment Session will feature a new segment themed Middle East & ASEAN Market Focus, showcasing high-potential projects from these two fast-growing regions. Additionally, a new Signature B&R Projects-featured Session will feature forward-looking initiatives, underscoring the Belt and Road Initiative's role in driving economic transformation and innovation. The investment project sessions will continue to cover four popular themes from previous editions - Energy, Natural Resources and Public Utilities; Urban Development; Transport and Logistics Infrastructure; and Innovation and Technology - showcasing over 300 investment projects across these sectors. The Belt and Road Deal-Making will provide participants with key opportunities for negotiation and collaboration. Held concurrently with the Summit and extended online from 15 to 16 September, this will bring together global resources and facilitate long-term partnerships and resource integration through one-to-one project matching meetings.\n\nThe Exhibition will bring together global project collaboration opportunities, featuring a newly introduced ASEAN Pavilion highlighting the latest projects across diverse sectors in the region. Also included will be the Hong Kong Zone, Global Investment Opportunities Zone, InnoTech Zone, and Mainland Pavilions, collectively showcasing professional services, innovative technologies, and investment prospects. In addition, the Belt and Road Global Forum Annual Roundtable 2025 will be held on 12 September morning, alongside Belt and Road Week, bringing together Hong Kong, Mainland and international organisations and associations to share information, interact and explore multilateral cooperation.\n\nThe 10th Belt and Road Summit is supported by a wide range of partners, including China International Capital Corporation Limited as Strategic Partner, and Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited as the Banking Partner.
