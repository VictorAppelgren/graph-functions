  "content": "Cloud content management platform Box (NYSE:BOX) will be reporting earnings this Tuesday after market close. Here\u2019s what investors should know.\n\nBox beat analysts\u2019 revenue expectations by 0.6% last quarter, reporting revenues of $276.3 million, up 4.4% year on year. It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 billings estimates and EPS guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nIs Box a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it\u2019s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Box\u2019s revenue to grow 7.7% year on year to $290.8 million, improving from the 3.3% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.31 per share.\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Box has missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue estimates three times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Box\u2019s peers in the productivity software segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Dropbox\u2019s revenues decreased 1.4% year on year, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.2%, and SoundHound AI reported revenues up 217%, topping estimates by 31.2%. Dropbox traded up 2.8% following the results while SoundHound AI was also up 25.8%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Dropbox\u2019s results here and SoundHound AI\u2019s results here.\n\nThe outlook for 2025 remains clouded by potential trade policy changes and corporate tax discussions, which could impact business confidence and growth. While some of the productivity software stocks have shown solid performance in this choppy environment, the group has generally underperformed, with share prices down 4.3% on average over the last month. Box is down 2.7% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $36.50 (compared to the current share price of $31.98).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nStockStory is growing and hiring equity analyst and marketing roles.

      "text": "Box (BOX)\nBox doesn\u2019t excite us. Its growth has been lacking and its cash conversion is projected to decline, a situation we\u2019d avoid.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Box Is Not Exciting\nKnown as the \"Content Cloud\" for managing the 90% of business data that exists as unstructured files and documents, Box (NYSE:BOX) provides a cloud-based platform that enables organizations to securely manage, share, and collaborate on their content from anywhere on any device.\n- 6.6% annual revenue growth over the last three years was slower than its software peers\n- Anticipated sales growth of 7.9% for the next year implies demand will be shaky\n- A consolation is that its powerful free cash flow generation enables it to reinvest its profits or return capital to investors consistently\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Box\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Box\nBox\u2019s stock price of $31.98 implies a valuation ratio of 4x forward price-to-sales. This is a cheap valuation multiple, but for good reason. You get what you pay for.\nCheap stocks can look like great bargains at first glance, but you often get what you pay for. These mediocre businesses often have less earnings power, meaning there is more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns - an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Box (BOX) Research Report: Q1 CY2025 Update\nCloud content storage and management platform Box (NYSE:BOX) reported Q1 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 4.4% year on year to $276.3 million. Guidance for next quarter\u2019s revenue was optimistic at $290.5 million at the midpoint, 2.6% above analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.30 per share was 17.2% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nBox (BOX) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $276.3 million vs analyst estimates of $274.7 million (4.4% year-on-year growth, 0.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.30 vs analyst estimates of $0.26 (17.2% beat)\n- The company slightly lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $1.17 billion at the midpoint from $1.16 billion\n- Management raised its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $1.24 at the midpoint, a 7.8% increase\n- Operating Margin: 2.3%, down from 6.8% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 42.8%, up from 32.7% in the previous quarter\n- Billings: $242.3 million at quarter end, up 27.2% year on year\n- Market Capitalization: $4.50 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 2005 by Aaron Levie and Dylan Smith, Box (NYSE:BOX) provides organizations with software to securely store, share and collaborate around work documents in the cloud.\nThe world is shifting away from physical storage and content sharing methods that made it difficult for employees to securely collaborate and share data at work. Box has helped accelerate this shift through its cloud-based content management and collaboration software platform.\nFor example, when preparing a presentation, employees can use software provided by Box to collaboratively make edits, updates and comments via a user-friendly cloud-based interface. The presentation can be accessed from mobile and desktop devices from any location. Box has also invested in securing the transfer and sharing of sensitive documents which enables it to address highly sensitive verticals such as finance and healthcare.\nBox started with offering cloud storage as a simple way for employees to share content more securely, but has since expanded into new functions such as e-signatures, monitoring anomalous behaviour and workflow management.\n4. Document Management\nThe catch phrase \"digital transformation\" originally referred to the digitization of documents within enterprises. The growth of digital documents has spurred an explosion of collaboration within and between businesses, which in turn is driving the demand for e-signature and content management platforms.\nAs you might have guessed, Box has plenty of competitors, such as DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), Google Drive (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft OneDrive (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n5. Sales Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, Box\u2019s 6.6% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was weak. This fell short of our benchmark for the software sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis.\nThis quarter, Box reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 4.4% but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 0.6%. Company management is currently guiding for a 7.6% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5.7% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is underwhelming and implies its newer products and services will not catalyze better top-line performance yet.\n6. Billings\nBillings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract.\nBox\u2019s billings punched in at $242.3 million in Q1, and over the last four quarters, its growth slightly outpaced the sector as it averaged 11.7% year-on-year increases. This alternate topline metric grew faster than total sales, meaning the company collects cash upfront and then recognizes the revenue over the length of its contracts - a boost for its liquidity and future revenue prospects.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it\u2019s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability.\nBox is very efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 28 months this quarter. The company\u2019s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation. These dynamics give Box more resources to pursue new product initiatives while maintaining the flexibility to increase its sales and marketing investments.\n8. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like Box, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nBox\u2019s robust unit economics are better than the broader software industry, an output of its asset-lite business model and pricing power. They also enable the company to fund large investments in new products and sales during periods of rapid growth to achieve higher profits in the future. As you can see below, it averaged an excellent 79.1% gross margin over the last year. Said differently, roughly $79.08 was left to spend on selling, marketing, and R&D for every $100 in revenue.\nBox\u2019s gross profit margin came in at 78% this quarter, in line with the same quarter last year. On a wider time horizon, Box\u2019s full-year margin has been trending up over the past 12 months, increasing by 3.5 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest better unit economics due to more leverage from its growing sales on the fixed portion of its cost of goods sold (such as servers).\n9. Operating Margin\nBox has been an efficient company over the last year. It was one of the more profitable businesses in the software sector, boasting an average operating margin of 6.2%. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Box\u2019s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\nIn Q1, Box generated an operating profit margin of 2.3%, down 4.5 percentage points year on year. Since Box\u2019s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead increased.\n10. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nBox has shown terrific cash profitability, driven by its lucrative business model and cost-effective customer acquisition strategy that enable it to stay ahead of the competition through investments in new products rather than sales and marketing. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the software sector, averaging 27.2% over the last year.\nBox\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $118.3 million in Q1, equivalent to a 42.8% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 3.7 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, but it\u2019s still above its one-year average. We wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on this quarter\u2019s decline because investment needs can be seasonal, causing short-term swings. Long-term trends are more important.\nOver the next year, analysts\u2019 consensus estimates show they\u2019re expecting Box\u2019s free cash flow margin of 27.2% for the last 12 months to remain the same.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nBusinesses that maintain a cash surplus face reduced bankruptcy risk.\nBox is a profitable, well-capitalized company with $790.4 million of cash and $725 million of debt on its balance sheet. This $65.45 million net cash position gives it the freedom to borrow money, return capital to shareholders, or invest in growth initiatives. Leverage is not an issue here.\n12. Key Takeaways from Box\u2019s Q1 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Box blew past analysts\u2019 billings expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS guidance for next quarter trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 10.9% to $34.90 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Box?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:14 PM EDT\nBefore investing in or passing on Box, we urge you to understand the company\u2019s business quality (or lack thereof), valuation, and the latest quarterly results - in that order.\nBox has a few positive attributes, but it doesn\u2019t top our wishlist. Although its revenue growth was weak over the last three years, its growth over the next 12 months is expected to be higher. Plus, Box\u2019s bountiful generation of free cash flow empowers it to invest in growth initiatives.\nBox\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 4x. This valuation is reasonable, but the company\u2019s shakier fundamentals present too much downside risk. We're pretty confident there are superior stocks to buy right now.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $36.50 on the company (compared to the current share price of $31.98)."

      "text": "Dropbox (DBX)\nWe aren\u2019t fans of Dropbox. Its sluggish sales growth shows demand is soft, a worrisome sign for investors in high-quality stocks.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Dropbox Will Underperform\nOriginally named after the founders' tendency to \"drop\" files into a shared folder, Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) provides a content collaboration platform that helps individuals and teams store, organize, share, and work on files from anywhere.\n- 4% annual revenue growth over the last three years was slower than its software peers\n- Sales are projected to tank by 2% over the next 12 months as demand evaporates\n- A silver lining is that its disciplined cost controls and effective management have materialized in a strong operating margin\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Dropbox\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Dropbox\nAt $28.64 per share, Dropbox trades at 3.2x forward price-to-sales. This certainly seems like a cheap stock, but we think there are valid reasons why it trades this way.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with higher long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality stocks because they appear cheap. These challenged businesses often don\u2019t re-rate, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Dropbox (DBX) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nCloud storage and e-signature company Dropbox (Nasdaq: DBX) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, but sales fell by 1.4% year on year to $625.7 million. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.71 per share was 12.3% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nDropbox (DBX) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $625.7 million vs analyst estimates of $618.4 million (1.4% year-on-year decline, 1.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.71 vs analyst estimates of $0.63 (12.3% beat)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: $259.4 million vs analyst estimates of $232.4 million (41.5% margin, 11.6% beat)\n- Operating Margin: 26.9%, up from 20% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 41.3%, up from 24.6% in the previous quarter\n- Customers: 18.13 million, down from 18.16 million in the previous quarter\n- Annual Recurring Revenue: $2.54 billion at quarter end, down 1.2% year on year\n- Billings: $629.6 million at quarter end, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $7.46 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded by the long-serving CEO Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi in 2007, Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) provides a file hosting cloud platform that helps organizations collaborate and share documents.\nHouston came up with the idea when he realised that he didn't have his work USB drive on him, while sitting on a bus to New York for a weekend. He saw that a shared folder on the cloud would remove the need for a physical drive and he started coding the product (for himself) while still on the bus. And so blossomed a passion for the file-sharing product, which he named Dropbox after the communal folder he and his friends would use during LAN parties, back in their teens. Today, over half a million organisations use Dropbox to securely store and collaborate on all manner of file types.\nFrom its inception, Dropbox saw viral growth because when one person used it to share a folder with another, the second person would have to create a dropbox account. From the early days, it was clear that Dropbox would face a crowded field, but by moving first and growing free users quickly, the company was able to become a trusted name in cloud storage. Since then, it has expanded into electronic signatures, but to this day organisations can sign up and try the solution for free, at least initially.\n4. Document Management\nThe catch phrase \"digital transformation\" originally referred to the digitization of documents within enterprises. The growth of digital documents has spurred an explosion of collaboration within and between businesses, which in turn is driving the demand for e-signature and content management platforms.\nDropbox faces competition from large organizations that provide cloud content management solutions such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Box (NYSE:BOX).\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Unfortunately, Dropbox\u2019s 4% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was weak. This was below our standard for the software sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis.\nThis quarter, Dropbox\u2019s revenue fell by 1.4% year on year to $625.7 million but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 1.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 2.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will face some demand challenges.\n6. Annual Recurring Revenue\nWhile reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable.\nOver the last year, Dropbox failed to grow its ARR, which came in at $2.54 billion in the latest quarter. This performance mirrored its total sales, showing the company faced challenges in winning long-term deals and renewals. It also suggests there may be increasing competition or market saturation.\n7. Customer Base\nDropbox reported 18.13 million customers at the end of the quarter, a sequential decrease of 30,000. That\u2019s better than last quarter but a bit below what we\u2019ve seen over the previous year. This indicates the company is optimizing its go-to-market strategy to reinvigorate growth.\n8. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it\u2019s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability.\nIt\u2019s relatively expensive for Dropbox to acquire new customers as its CAC payback period checked in at 125 months this quarter. The company\u2019s slow recovery of its sales and marketing expenses indicates it operates in a highly competitive market and must invest to stand out, even if the return on that investment is low.\n9. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like Dropbox, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nDropbox\u2019s robust unit economics are better than the broader software industry, an output of its asset-lite business model and pricing power. They also enable the company to fund large investments in new products and sales during periods of rapid growth to achieve higher profits in the future. As you can see below, it averaged an excellent 81.4% gross margin over the last year. Said differently, roughly $81.44 was left to spend on selling, marketing, and R&D for every $100 in revenue.\nDropbox produced a 80.2% gross profit margin in Q2, down 2.9 percentage points year on year. Zooming out, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past 12 months, suggesting its input costs have been stable and it isn\u2019t under pressure to lower prices.\n10. Operating Margin\nDropbox has been a well-oiled machine over the last year. It demonstrated elite profitability for a software business, boasting an average operating margin of 22.4%. This result isn\u2019t surprising as its high gross margin gives it a favorable starting point.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Dropbox\u2019s operating margin decreased by 4 percentage points over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability.\nIn Q2, Dropbox generated an operating margin profit margin of 26.9%, up 6.9 percentage points year on year. The increase was solid, and because its revenue and gross margin actually decreased, we can assume it was more efficient because it trimmed its operating expenses like marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead.\n11. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nDropbox has shown terrific cash profitability, driven by its lucrative business model that enables it to reinvest, return capital to investors, and stay ahead of the competition while maintaining an ample cushion. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the software sector, averaging an eye-popping 35.2% over the last year.\nDropbox\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $258.5 million in Q2, equivalent to a 41.3% margin. This result was good as its margin was 5.9 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends carry greater meaning.\nOver the next year, analysts predict Dropbox\u2019s cash conversion will slightly improve. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 35.2% for the last 12 months will increase to 36.9%, it options for capital deployment (investments, share buybacks, etc.).\n12. Balance Sheet Assessment\nDropbox reported $954.7 million of cash and $3.04 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $1.14 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Dropbox\u2019s 1.8\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $31.3 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n13. Key Takeaways from Dropbox\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by Dropbox\u2019s strong growth in customers this quarter. We were also happy its billings outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock remained flat at $26.35 immediately following the results.\n14. Is Now The Time To Buy Dropbox?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 10:13 PM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy Dropbox or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nDropbox\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. To begin with, its revenue growth was weak over the last three years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its bountiful generation of free cash flow empowers it to invest in growth initiatives, the downside is its ARR has disappointed and shows the company is having difficulty retaining customers and their spending. On top of that, its declining operating margin shows it\u2019s becoming less efficient at building and selling its software.\nDropbox\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 3.2x. While this valuation is reasonable, we don\u2019t really see a big opportunity at the moment. We're fairly confident there are better investments elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $28.13 on the company (compared to the current share price of $28.64)."

      "text": "SoundHound AI (SOUN)\nWe\u2019re skeptical of SoundHound AI. Its low gross margin indicates poor unit economics, partly explaining why it has historically burned cash.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think SoundHound AI Will Underperform\nBorn from the idea that machines should understand human speech as naturally as people do, SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) develops voice recognition and conversational intelligence technology that enables businesses to integrate voice assistants into their products and services.\n- Gross margin of 40.5% is way below its competitors, leaving less money to invest in areas like marketing and R&D\n- Track record of operating margin losses stem from its decision to pursue growth instead of profits\n- The good news is that its impressive 88.5% annual revenue growth over the last three years indicates it\u2019s winning market share\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than SoundHound AI\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than SoundHound AI\nSoundHound AI is trading at $12.77 per share, or 26.9x forward price-to-sales. This valuation multiple seems a bit much considering the quality you get.\nThere are stocks out there similarly priced with better business quality. We prefer owning these.\n3. SoundHound AI (SOUN) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nVoice AI recognition company SoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) reported Q2 CY2025 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 217% year on year to $42.68 million. Its GAAP loss of $0.19 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $42.68 million vs analyst estimates of $32.54 million (217% year-on-year growth, 31.2% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): -$0.19 vs analyst estimates of -$0.09 (significant miss)\n- Adjusted Operating Income: -$78.05 million vs analyst estimates of -$37.86 million (-183% margin, significant miss)\n- Operating Margin: -183%, down from -163% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was -$24.69 million compared to -$19.35 million in the previous quarter\n- Market Capitalization: $4.31 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 2005, SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) develops independent voice artificial intelligence solutions that enable businesses across various industries to offer customized conversational experiences to consumers.\nTheir technologies are utilized in a variety of voice-enabled products and services, primarily in automotive, TV, IoT, restaurant, customer service, healthcare, finance, and retail industries.\n4. Automation Software\nThe whole purpose of software is to automate tasks to increase productivity. Today, innovative new software techniques, often involving AI and machine learning, are finally allowing automation that has graduated from simple one- or two-step workflows to more complex processes integral to enterprises. The result is surging demand for modern automation software.\nCompetitors in the voice AI and speech recognition sector include Microsoft Azure Speech Services (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet\u2019s Cloud Speech-to-Text (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple Siri (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Verint Systems (NASDAQ:VRNT).\n5. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Thankfully, SoundHound AI\u2019s 88.5% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was incredible. Its growth beat the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nThis quarter, SoundHound AI reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 217%, and its $42.68 million of revenue beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 31.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 32.5% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. Still, this projection is admirable and suggests the market is forecasting success for its products and services.\n6. Billings\nBillings is a non-GAAP metric that is often called \u201ccash revenue\u201d because it shows how much money the company has collected from customers in a certain period. This is different from revenue, which must be recognized in pieces over the length of a contract.\nSoundHound AI\u2019s billings punched in at $38.13 million in Q2, and over the last four quarters, its growth was fantastic as it averaged 202% year-on-year increases. This alternate topline metric grew faster than total sales, meaning the company collects cash upfront and then recognizes the revenue over the length of its contracts - a boost for its liquidity and future revenue prospects.\n7. Customer Acquisition Efficiency\nThe customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments.\nSoundHound AI is extremely efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 0.5 months this quarter. The company\u2019s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation. These dynamics give SoundHound AI more resources to pursue new product initiatives while maintaining the flexibility to increase its sales and marketing investments.\n8. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nFor software companies like SoundHound AI, gross profit tells us how much money remains after paying for the base cost of products and services (typically servers, licenses, and certain personnel). These costs are usually low as a percentage of revenue, explaining why software is more lucrative than other sectors.\nSoundHound AI\u2019s gross margin is substantially worse than most software businesses, signaling it has relatively high infrastructure costs compared to asset-lite businesses like ServiceNow. As you can see below, it averaged a 40.5% gross margin over the last year. Said differently, SoundHound AI had to pay a chunky $59.48 to its service providers for every $100 in revenue.\nSoundHound AI produced a 39% gross profit margin in Q2, down 24 percentage points year on year. SoundHound AI\u2019s full-year margin has also been trending down over the past 12 months, decreasing by 28.6 percentage points. If this move continues, it could suggest deteriorating pricing power and higher input costs.\n9. Operating Margin\nSoundHound AI\u2019s expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 183% over the last year. Unprofitable, high-growth software companies require extra attention because they spend heaps of money to capture market share. As seen in its fast historical revenue growth, this strategy seems to have worked so far, but it\u2019s unclear what would happen if SoundHound AI reeled back its investments. Wall Street seems to be optimistic about its growth, but we have some doubts.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, SoundHound AI\u2019s operating margin decreased by 43.6 percentage points over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. SoundHound AI\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nIn Q2, SoundHound AI generated a negative 183% operating margin.\nIn the coming year, Wall Street expects SoundHound AI to shrink its losses but remain unprofitable. Analysts are expecting the company\u2019s trailing 12-month operating margin of negative 183% to rise to negative 44.6%.\n10. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nSoundHound AI\u2019s demanding reinvestments have drained its resources over the last year, putting it in a pinch and limiting its ability to return capital to investors. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 85.8%, meaning it lit $85.80 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nSoundHound AI burned through $24.69 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 57.8% margin. The company\u2019s cash burn was similar to its $18.73 million of lost cash in the same quarter last year.\nOver the next year, analysts predict SoundHound AI will continue burning cash, albeit to a lesser extent. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of negative 85.8% for the last 12 months will increase to negative 26.1%.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nSoundHound AI burned through $112.8 million of cash over the last year. Although the company has $4.39 million of debt on its balance sheet, we think its $230.3 million of cash gives it enough runway (we typically look for at least two years) to prioritize growth over profitability.\n12. Key Takeaways from SoundHound AI\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly SoundHound AI blew past analysts\u2019 EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates by a wide margin. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 23.3% to $13.25 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy SoundHound AI?\nUpdated: August 24, 2025 at 11:41 PM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy SoundHound AI or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nSoundHound AI\u2019s business quality ultimately falls short of our standards. Although its revenue growth was exceptional over the last three years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its declining operating margin shows it\u2019s becoming less efficient at building and selling its software. And while the company\u2019s efficient sales strategy allows it to target and onboard new users at scale, the downside is its operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other software companies.\nSoundHound AI\u2019s price-to-sales ratio based on the next 12 months is 26.9x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think other companies feature superior fundamentals at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $14.50 on the company (compared to the current share price of $12.77)."

      "text": "High-Quality Businesses Win\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) is an exciting stock because it offers exposure to the multi-decade mega-trend of automation. On top of that, its role in automating IT Service management puts it in a prime position to benefit from the introduction of generative AI.\nWe are long-term investors, not speculators, so we don\u2019t celebrate the short-term wins. Nonetheless, we are grateful and fortunate that Lead Analyst Anthony Lee chose a good time (August 17, 2023) to issue our ServiceNow buy recommendation exclusively to paying members of StockStory Edge. The stock was roughly $540 a share then.\nDespite the 85+% share price increase since then, we still have ServiceNow in our portfolio. Note that we (the StockStory team) only bought shares in ServiceNow days after recommending it to members of StockStory Edge. And if in the future we no longer consider ServiceNow compelling, StockStory Edge members will be the first to know. We never trade personally until after informing our members and giving them 5 trading days to act.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nServiceNow (NOW): StockStory Edge Stock Of The Month For August 2023\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has been a stock market winner ever since its summer 2012 IPO. It priced at $18, closed its first day of trading at $24.60, and hasn\u2019t looked back. The shares now trade at around $1,000. Since its IPO, this is not just one of the best-performing stocks in enterprise software but in the whole market.\nJust because the stock is up big, however, doesn\u2019t mean the opportunity is gone.\nIn this case? Quite the opposite.\nThat\u2019s because ServiceNow offers sticky mission-critical products across IT, HR, and customer service that reduce manual work, eliminate human error, and keep large corporations functioning. The company generates reliable subscription revenue from its happy customers and because of attractive unit economics, that revenue turns into high profits and free cash margins. The excess cash churned out by the business can be used to continually widen ServiceNow's lead over the competition competition from a brand, product, and customer service standpoint.\nThe kicker is that ServiceNow is now very much a Generative AI beneficiary due to its partnership with NVIDIA.\nWhat Does ServiceNow Do?\nServiceNow\u2019s software platform helps businesses automate workflows and gives them a birds-eye view of their operations, unifying what has become an increasingly complex technology stack for many companies.\nServiceNow was founded in 2003 when current Chairman of the Board Fred Luddy recognized the inefficiencies of traditional IT Service Management (ITSM) at a time when employees might have to jump through multiple hoops to request help and then sit on standby for hours until someone from the IT department fixed their problem.\nLuddy envisioned a world where technology could speed up these slow, cumbersome processes and launched the company\u2019s first product in 2006.\nToday, corporations of all sizes rely on ServiceNow to not only streamline IT but also manage their entire organization through a simple yet comprehensive online portal. For example, onboarding a new employee involves HR for payroll, IT for device needs, and whatever is specific to that person\u2019s department.\nServiceNow brings these disparate systems together and automates the onboarding process, which will inevitably happen over and over again.\nServiceNow\u2019s all-in-one platform gives customers numerous products to choose from, as shown in the graphic below. These software programs allow administrators to execute repetitive, labor-intensive tasks with the click of a button. On top of that, each product is wrapped in analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities, allowing customers to extract powerful insights from their data.\nThe company\u2019s ambition doesn\u2019t end there. ServiceNow has a strong track record of releasing new products to boost its customers\u2019 productivity, the latest being a low-code platform that enables non-technical employees to build custom software applications. ServiceNow constantly surprises its customers (and investors) with innovation, granting it huge upside potential.\nWhy We Love An Investment In ServiceNow\nFor starters, we love the software subscription business model. If you sell sneakers, for instance, customers who bought from you last quarter may not come back again this quarter. On the other hand, software customers often sign multi-year contracts, resulting in recurring, predictable revenues and lower customer acquisition costs.\nWithin software, we believe ServiceNow has a very strong brand. \u201cNobody ever got fired for buying IBM\u201d was a common phrase in IT circles in the 1980s and early 1990s, and we argue that NOW is heading in the same direction. 85% of Fortune 500 companies are ServiceNow customers and those controlling IT budgets view the company as trustworthy, reliable, and safe because of how many happy, loyal, and influential customers it has.\nFurthermore, ServiceNow\u2019s customers rarely cancel their subscriptions because its products are deeply intertwined with company operations. ServiceNow is capable of replacing a multitude of legacy software systems\u2013everything from technical support to managing downtime. That means switching to ServiceNow can make life easier for employees, and once it\u2019s there, switching away is very disruptive. This results in a sky-high renewal rate of around 98%.\nTurning to profit, ServiceNow stands out with its gross margin of around 85% on its subscription revenue. From there, its adjusted operating margin and free cash flow margin will both hover around 30% when 2024 is all said and done. This makes ServiceNow a money-printing machine with the capital to grow its competitive position by improving existing products, adding new products, and promoting its brand.\nWhat Does ServiceNow\u2019s Future Hold?\nWe think much of ServiceNow\u2019s future growth will stem from selling more products to existing customers. The chart below shows how its \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy has developed over time. ServiceNow has successfully upsold its customers as 82% of contracts in 2023 featured five or more products purchased, up from 54% in 2019 (note that NNACV is 'net new annual contract value', a proxy for incremental revenue). We expect this number to be around 85% when the company reports 2024 results.\nAnother underappreciated growth lever is ServiceNow\u2019s pricing power. Before 2018, the company had one pricing tier for all products. That changed in 2018 when NOW introduced a \u2018Pro\u2019 tier for IT service management, whereby customers could upgrade their packages to get more analytical and AI functionality. What\u2019s next? Pro Plus, of course. It boasts \u201cgreater AI capabilities\u201d, and we expect it to contribute to future growth.\nWe think as more of ServiceNow\u2019s growth comes from existing customers, marketing expenses will moderate as a percentage of revenue, and thus we believe ServiceNow can earn higher profit margins as it grows.\nWhy Is Now The Right Time to Buy?\nServiceNow\u2019s price-to-forward-sales (next 12 months) multiple is currently over 15x, higher than most companies and higher than when we recommended it back in August 2023.\nNonetheless, we think ServiceNow can justify its valuation due to its long-term demand tailwinds, predictable subscription model, best-in-class customer retention, and robust profit margins. We'd also add that our extensive backtest research and analysis has shown that when it comes to outperforming the market, business quality matters much more than entry price--you get what you pay for. Said differently, valuation may seem daunting in the near term, but companies showing robust growth up and down the P&L \"grow into\" their premium multiples over time.\nThe cherry on top is that the company is increasingly showing that it will be a Generative AI beneficiary for years--even decades--to come. In May 2023, ServiceNow and NVIDIA announced a partnership. The principal goal for ServiceNow was to develop custom large language models (LLMs) using NVIDIA\u2019s technology.\nThe result includes intelligent virtual assistants and AI chatbots that can better resolve user issues and support requests. The secret sauce involves two parts: the GenAI\u2019s capability to pull knowledge from unstructured data such as source code, internal documents, or videos to answer questions combined with the LLMs\u2019 ability to summarize the information, eliminate the technical jargon, and give conversational responses.\nIn February 2024, ServiceNow unveiled an industry-specific solution for the telecom sector. \u2018Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management\u2019 is for an industry where consumers are particularly frustrated with their customer service interactions (have you ever called customer service about your smartphone bill or tried to change plans??). Surely, similar solutions for other consumer-facing industries will roll out soon.\nWe really like that these GenAI and LLM-driven offerings are easy for customers to understand and provide straightforward, quantifiable benefits (the cost of a customer service agent). Combined with ServiceNow\u2019s large customer base that already trusts the company in IT, Customer Service, and Human Resources, we think the company can start reaping the needle-moving benefits of GenAI in the near term.\nWith its product portfolio that is mission-critical for most customers, the expansion of this portfolio, and the GenAI tailwind, we think ServiceNow's revenue can sustain 20+% growth for a number of years.\nWith efficiency on expenses, especially the sales and marketing leverage, that revenue growth can translate into roughly 35% adjusted operating profit growth over time. It's had a big run in a short period and could take a breather in the near term, but we\u2019re convinced the stock could approach $1,550 by the end of 2027. If that occurs, it would still generate a return that likely beats the market despite the big jump in the share price since we first pitched the stock.\nLooking beyond 2026, we love a number of things about ServiceNow: the secular tailwinds it enjoys, the company's continually strengthening brand, and its products that bring customers great value and efficiency. This combination will drive stronger-for-longer revenue growth than the market anticipates.\nThis is a stock for investors looking for a high-quality business to hold over the long term.\nWhat Are The Key Risks And How Do We Feel About Them?\nThose stocks that are \u2018\u201csure things\u201d? They don\u2019t exist. Every investment has its risks.\nFor ServiceNow, we\u2019ve boiled them down into the three most important: competition, margins, and valuation.\nServiceNow has a tight grip on the IT service management market, but future returns will need to come from selling adjacent products where it faces stiffer competition. This means squaring off against Salesforce in customer service management, Microsoft in low-code/AI applications, and younger upstarts like Rippling in HR solutions. More competition means that ServiceNow may have to spend more on product development or accept lower gross margins to maintain its growth rate.\nThat leads us to our next risk\u2013margins. Our thesis holds that ServiceNow can reduce its expenses as a percentage of revenue as it grows. There\u2019s a chance this doesn\u2019t happen. For example, new products may gain less traction than expected or cost more than anticipated to develop.\nTurning to valuation, ServiceNow isn\u2019t conventionally cheap based on current earnings. It has a lofty P/E ratio, implying the market expects many years of growth ahead. That makes it vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and sentiment around high-growth businesses.\nUltimately, we\u2019re comfortable with these risks because of ServiceNow\u2019s dominance, reputation, products, financial strength. We expect many years of healthy growth in revenue, profits, and free cash flow.\nClosing Thoughts\nWe\u2019re excited about ServiceNow at this stage in its evolution. Software is still eating the world, and within software, ServiceNow is an elite asset in terms of its products and financials. Please note that members of StockStory hold shares in ServiceNow.
