      "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for a second Chapter 11 bankruptcy and will cut service to 11 U.S. cities starting in October as it restructures its network. The carrier, which reported a $245.8 million net loss in Q2, is shedding routes, reducing its fleet, and laying off pilots to address weak domestic demand and high capacity. Frontier Airlines is targeting Spirit’s former markets with new routes. The bankruptcy filing is expected to continue until the end of 2025, with Spirit hoping to return to profitability after restructuring.",
