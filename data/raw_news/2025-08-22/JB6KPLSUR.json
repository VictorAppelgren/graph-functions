  "title": "5 hacks for helping working parents reduce the mental load",
  "description": "Parenting is a full-time job on top of the rest of your life. Here are five proven strategies to lighten the load.",
  "content": "The mental load\u2014the invisible, relentless work of managing a household\u2014includes anticipating, tracking, and executing everything from dentist appointments to birthday gifts to dinner plans. It is a full-time job embedded inside the rest of your life. It\u2019s no wonder that 48% of parents say that most days their stress is completely overwhelming. This burden also falls disproportionately on women. In dual-career households, it\u2019s often female partners carrying the majority of the logistical load, causing anxiety, depression, and burnout. As the founder of Jam, a company building tools to reduce this mental load on families, I\u2019ve interviewed hundreds of working parents\u2014executives, teachers, writers, designers\u2014about how they manage the logistics of their lives. (Spoiler: No one is as put together as they look from the outside.)\n\nAs a result, I\u2019ve also had the opportunity to see what behaviors and systems actually do work in lessening stress and chaos, as well as one very common trap that almost always makes things worse. With the new school year underway, now is the perfect time for a reset. Here are five proven strategies to lighten the load. This small weekly habit packs a huge punch. A Sunday Sync is a 15\u201330 minute meeting to review the week ahead: scheduling, to-dos, grocery needs, childcare coverage. Did that work dinner make it onto the calendar? Who\u2019s handling pickup on Wednesday? A good Sync covers both granular and high-level planning: the upcoming week and a peek at the month ahead. In families with school-age kids, everyone can be included\u2014and should be.\n\nThere are a few easily realized benefits to a family Sunday Sync. First, it mitigates the friction before it starts. (It\u2019s easier to find a ride for someone three days in advance as opposed to realizing it the morning of.) Second, it allows everyone in the family to get on the same page for the week\u2014which lessens the mental burden on parents to carry it all themselves. Families today juggle school portals, team apps, shared calendars, and never-ending group text chains. Instead of glancing at one calendar, you\u2019re scouring texts, emails, and crumpled flyers in the bottom of a backpack just to find out where and when the basketball tryouts are this week. The one not-so-great habit we saw consistently in almost every family? Attempting to coordinate everything through text with a partner. Grocery lists, pickup reminders, PDFs, and permission slips all buried alongside memes and \u201cwhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d messages is a recipe for stress\u2014things inevitably falling through the cracks.\n\nText is great for quick check-ins. But it\u2019s not a planning tool. Important information gets lost, one partner ends up doing the heavy lifting, and the mental load creeps back in. Instead, rely on your shared hub and review it during your Sunday Sync. Save texting for the cute kids pics. Thriving families tend to use one centralized place for all essential info: schedules, school events, to-do\u2019s, contacts and carpools. This hub should sync with all other calendars, house shared to-dos and shopping lists, and allow access for kids or caregivers with appropriate permissions. Bonus points if it easily allows families to tag who is going to events and who is driving, as well as having AI-powered features to ease the burden of scheduling. It might be a shared calendar or even a shared family Notion hub, but the key is that all adults have equal access to it so that one person doesn\u2019t have to be the default manager of the family. (And yes, your hub must be digital so changes can be made and synced on the fly, and no, texting does not count as a hub.)\n\nDecision fatigue is real, and the micro-decisions of parenting can really add up fast: What\u2019s for dinner? What gift to get for the birthday party? What can the kids wear for the spirit day next week? The more of these you have to make, the heavier your mental load. One easy way to reduce decisions each week is to increase routines. Think, pizza Fridays, a treat you make for every birthday, or a habit like \u201cChores & Chill\u201d Sunday afternoons. Having a few stockpiles can help as well, like a default list of go-to gifts you keep in the house (board games are a personal favorite) or a spirit day/costume bin with items that can be drawn from and repurposed all year long. In our house, Taco Tuesday started as a shortcut on a day full of commitments, but it\u2019s now a beloved family tradition! It may sound rigid in theory, but routines actually create breathing room. Kids thrive with predictability, and so do overwhelmed adults.\n\n4. Automate What You Can No need to reinvent the wheel\u2014many weekly purchases can actually be automated. Get a working list of grocery staples and put it on auto-ship each week. Yes, you\u2019ll likely still have to go to the store, but you\u2019ll be purchasing less and saving time. Families also often do this with cleaning supplies, pet food, vitamins, and supplements (and usually get better prices as a result, too). This works for chores and tasks as well: Recurring chores like a weekly dry-cleaning or monthly dog grooming can be set to the same day and time. Having a standing date night with a regular babysitter cuts down on logistics. Even switching prescriptions to a pharmacy that offers free auto-delivery can save precious time and energy. Often these errands or purchases feel small on their own, however automation reduces both the anticipation and execution time, as well as mitigating mishaps, which can lead to more serious time savings while also reducing energy expended on tedious tasks.\n\nThe mental load is heaviest when it\u2019s invisible and unshared. It can be hard to surrender control, but it\u2019s essential to avoid burnout. Delegating and sharing works best when everyone gravitates toward the tasks that suit their skill sets. Simple household chores can also be assigned to school-age kids in the family. At first this may feel like \u201cextra work,\u201d but it will pay dividends quickly, both in time saved and increased responsibility and confidence. Also consider where you can outsource some work, such as meal prep delivery, booking virtual assistant hours, or caregiving help. (Try selecting one thing to outsource and see how it impacts your mental load and time. If it\u2019s worth it, continue it, and consider adding more.)",
