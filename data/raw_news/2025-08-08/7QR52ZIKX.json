  "description": "\"Bloomberg: The Asia Trade\" brings you everything you need to know to get ahead as the trading day begins in Asia. Bloomberg TV is live from Tokyo and Sydney with Shery Ahn and Haidi Stroud-Watts, getting insight and analysis from newsmakers and industry leaders on the biggest stories shaping global markets.\n\n (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Needed to move to respond to that inflation. And I think he's done himself, you know, a big credit recently as well, you know, not succumbing to the tariff derangement syndrome that many others throughout the throughout the country, but particularly at the Fed, seem to have succumbed to. Trump's Fed governor nominee, Steven Myron is backing Christopher Waller to succeed Jay Powell, praising him for not suffering from what he calls tentative derangement syndrome. Live from Singapore, this is inside with Haslinda Amin. Asian shares are on their track for their best week since June, boosted by growing hopes of a Fed rate cut, even as tariff headlines continue to sway sentiment. The dollar set for its longest losing streak in more than a year. Citi Research, head of Asian and strategy, joins us to discuss whether assets in this region could benefit. Meanwhile, gold is shining bright with its biggest weekly climb in a month. On the Fed and tariff headlines, the FDA reports that the U.S. has imposed duties on one kilogram bullion bars. We hear from a top executive at India's second most valuable jewellery brand, Kalyan, on whether gold prices and tariff tensions are taking the shine off its business outlook. Our top story, President Trump says he's chosen Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Steven Myron to serve as a Federal Reserve governor. The appointment still needs to be confirmed by the Senate, but would add a voice who's echoed Trump's calls for urgent rate cuts. Myron will finish the rest of current Fed governor Adrian a cook less time, which ends in January. Trump says he's still looking for a permanent replacement. And Bloomberg has learned Fed Governor Christopher Waller is emerging as a top candidate to succeed Jerome Powell as the central bank's next chair. Sources say Trump's advisers are impressed with Wallace willingness to move on policy based on forecasting rather than current data. Wallace has met with Trump's team on the role, but not yet with the president. The dollar, meanwhile, revives gains on the Trump speak on Myron, adding fuel to expectations for a rate cut. The Bloomberg dollar index is now stuck in a six day losing streak. That's the longest since last March. Our next guest is in the camp of a weaker dollar and believes Dollar Asia will likely remain in an unstable equilibrium rate. Garg, head of Asia research at Citi Research, have be with us. So the catalysts for a weaker dollar pretty much is there. You know, so where does it go from here? Now, we do believe that, you know, there's still room for dollar to actually weaken many factors, I think. But the predominant one is going to be that we do expect that, you know, dollar data surprises were going to be weaker, especially relative to Asia. So, you know, when we look at, for instance, our own economic surprises index of us versus Asia or even the data change index, that tells you just the level of U.S. data was Asia. That tells you that things are, you know, shaping up towards a weaker dollar. The thing is, U.S. data is not definitive. One or two data do not make a trend. And if take a look at the labor number, for instance, it's still within 4 to 4.2%. Ain't too shabby. That's a fair argument. All I would say is that, you know, if you look at the headline payroll numbers, you know, take out any, you know, three month moving average, six month moving average, we are seeing a trend that's actually emerging for quite some number of months. That's number one. Second is if you look at just where the payroll growth is actually getting concentrated, it's getting considered. You know, it's narrowing down into only a few sectors like education and health care more recently. So that's another reason. And the third is, of course, you know, if you were to expect that the labor force participation would have remained the same as, what, a few months back then, we would have already seen a jump in unemployment rate. So I think I think to us the trend is quite clear. Even yesterday's, you know, the claims data that actually came out that made a new cyclical high. So, you know, we have to take a stand on our standards that the data will eventually, you know, sort of weaken further. And that should be a catalyst for the clarity that most other people were hit. I'm just wondering which Asian currencies would benefit on the back of that. I know you like the Korean one. It does seem like it has already bottomed out. Yeah. So, you know, so there are obviously various angles to actually look at. Asia, the framework that we've actually adopted more recently is to actually look at how Asian currencies are faring versus the tariffs that have been imposed on them. Now, obviously, different countries have different headline tariffs, but they also have different effective tariff rates because of various exemptions, sectoral tariffs, everything. And then, of course, you know, every country's goods exposure to us is quite different when you actually stack everything up and you actually see how much a currency should be weakening or the weakness is required to offset those negative impact. What you realize is that currencies like Indonesian rupiah and Korean one are the cheapest out there. So we very much like buying, you know, Indonesian rupiah. You know, to us, even Korean one is actually quite cheap. And yeah, I would come back and say it is cheap for a reason. If you take a look at the environment in Asia, there's certainly concerns about its fiscal position and perhaps the impact of the tariffs on the economy. Now, I think it's a fair point. I would say to us, fiscal concerns are overblown. There were concerns in maybe Q1 of the year and in this part of Q2. But, you know, the way that we've actually been seeing, especially the government expenditure data actually come out to us, the fiscal deficit for this year will still be around two and a half percent. But more importantly, what we are also starting to see is a little bit more balance in the GOP, you know, stuff of Indonesia. We are actually starting to see more exporters convert dollars. And to us, you know, rupiah is actually quite cheap. Foreign exposure to Indonesian assets is actually quite low and there is room for that to grow. So that's why we actually think that rupiah can at least rally to 16,000. But if you purely look at the tariff mat, to us it looks like it can very well go to 15.5 as well. What are the risks When you take a look at how historically the rupiah has performed, it gets settled together with the end basket. If there's any negative news, the rupiah gets hit. I agree. I think to us the. Biggest risk. Of course, as you mentioned, you know, if fiscal concerns were to actually come back, that would be the biggest risk. But I think apart from that, where Indonesia is still the most exposed is to commodity. So if commodity prices, for whatever reason actually weaken, especially the likes of, you know, palm oil or, you know, copper or coal or whatever it is. So that would probably be the biggest risk for Indonesian rupiah at this juncture. Okay. So you're liking the Korean one, you're liking the Indonesian rupiah, and you think the Indian rupee, which is currently hovering at record lows, is at fair value when some perhaps say that, you know, it can go lower? Yeah, I mean, interestingly, you know, there are obviously many who actually think that China's undies underperformed quite a bit and now it's actually quite cheap to us again, when we actually go back to our framework of looking, you know, where the tariffs are right now on India, again, what the goods exposure is in terms of goods exports to us, we actually think at 88 it's very much at fair value levels. And of course, depending on how, you know, the trade talks go from here on, we could either build further premia from here on or we could take out that premium. Of course, 88 some say is a resistance level, but what's your assumption based on 25% terms of 50? Currently we're looking at 50. Yeah. So right now our assumption is still that 25%. Of course, the 50, you know, will probably happen if of course there are no further negotiations or no more improvements in the trade talks. But that is still a few weeks away from here. And we can we know that, you know, in this particular backdrop, anything can happen just in 24 to 48 hours. So if we see 53 weeks from now, how would that change your assumptions on the Indian rupee? Yeah, inputting the same numbers. We actually think it could, you know, again, build some premia. You know, we could very well go to like 89 and beyond. But given that RBI has a lot of firepower to actually intervene, we actually think at least in the short term, they will try to actually cap that weakness. Okay. RBI may intervene and has shown the appetite to keep the currency pretty much supported. Do you see any other Asian central banks which are willing to jump in and support their currencies? We're seeing that in the U.S., for instance. Right. Well, interestingly, in previous this case, the way that we are actually seeing the behavior is that there seems to be a bias towards allowing R & B to strengthen. So, you know, yeah, if you actually look at days when R & B fixing needs to be weaker versus the days when R & B fixing needs to be stronger, what we've seen is the pass through of the days when R & B fixing needs to be stronger. That's actually greater as compared to the past through an R & B, fixing needs to be weaker. So to us, it seems like since May and evokes behavior or bias towards AMI, fixing seems to have changed. Before that, the bias was towards having a bit of a weaker R & B fixing. But since May and we are actually seeing a bit of a reversal of that. Why, though? Well, I, I think, you know, what's changed is a few things. One is if you see where China actually stands was is relative to the rest of the world. You know, one month back, we were talking about tariffs on China. 40% was the rest of the world, 10%. Right now, we are talking about 40% on China versus the rest of the world being anywhere between 15 to 20%. So the relative narrow differential has actually gone a little bit in favor of China. That's number one. Second is, again, you know, China has actually gotten this exemption of, you know, chips, hardware, as well as software exports. That's a pretty significant positive development. And then more recently, of course, you know, China has actually come out with this anti involution drive. You know, this Mega-dam project announcement. So there are lots of positive sentiment, positive vibes that are actually going on on China, and that's allowing the PBOC to sort of, you know, allow a little bit of an R & D. So in a way, that's been a reversal of sentiment when it comes to India and China. If you take a 12, 24 month period, how should you be positioning in terms of your exposure to the two markets to us? I think at the end of the day, you know, India is still a very fast growing economy. So six and a half percent, six and a half percent at the very least. Of course, it depends on how the scenario shapes up. But we all know, again, that, you know, in general, the trade exposure to India, GDP is actually quite low. It's a very consumption driven economy. So, again, to us, you know, India's growth is still going to be persisting quite good. And that actually, you know, to us tells us that, you know, one should still be exposed to Indian assets, you know, especially iron ore as well as equities. Of course, in the short term, you're going to have a bit of volatility in China's case. I think it's interesting that, of course, you know, we've seen a significant improvement in exports, but what we are still lacking is the consumption data still is quite weak, especially when you look at retail sales. The property sector continues to be quite weak. So we need to see more stuff happening over there for us to become overall positive on China. But that being said, again, this anti involution drive, you know, the fact that the with Mega-dam and of course in the external sector countries do quite well that is is a big balance but that is not a new sentiment we keep hearing. China needs to do more. We want to. See greater stimulus. And now there's going to talk about how the triple R could be cut further. I mean, in terms of stimulus, specifically, what might we see? I think the stimulus will have to really come the fiscal side. See, at the end of the day. There is this overcapacity that's actually built in the system that needs to be fiscals at some point of time. So we need to see that. So far, what's been happening is that there's been a bit of frontloading of fiscal stimulus. So we need to see actually and a bit more on the fiscal stimulus happening. So let's see if that actually happens. And I think that's the missing puzzle. The thing is, China has shown resilience. I remember breaking the trade data yesterday showing how exports, you know, were pretty strong and it didn't disappoint. It does seem like China has the ability to counter the expected slowdown. It does. I mean, so far, we've actually seen some of the high value exports be doing pretty well. So, you know, so far that's definitely been the case. But maybe a lot of it is also the frontloading that we've actually seen. You know, I think what really puzzles us is that this frontloading has actually continued for fairly long period of time. Now we are starting to see a little bit of that payback happening in the form of exports from Malaysia, weakening a little bit, exports from Singapore weakening a little bit. But let's see if it actually spills over to the rest of the Asian economies. So far, we haven't really seen any sort of an export back happening from Korea or Taiwan. So let's see. I mean, it's so far it's been resilient, but there are a few factors. But I think, you know, the front loading is definitely one big factor. Okay. So we've covered the currency space. Let's talk about the fixed income space, the bond market. You're liking the high yields. Obviously, Indonesia, one of them. Yes. Indonesia and Philippines have been both our top picks. In fact, if you actually look at, you know, how Asian fixed income has been evolving throughout this year, Right. Going into 2025, you know, disinflation narrative was very much entrenched in Asia. There was a lack of fiscal stimulus apart from Korea. There's no one really doing fiscal stimulus. And what we've noticed is that in general, this support the local support, the domestic support for Asian local currency bonds, that's actually improved quite significantly. Like, you'll be surprised to note that even in Indonesia's case, whereas previously it would be a lot more reliant on foreigners to actually fund its fiscal deficit. Our bond demand math actually shows that's no longer the case. Indonesia is now, you know, very much self-sufficient in that sense. To actually plug, you know, the fiscal deficit, you know, in terms of demand for onshore. So this is what actually makes us quite, you know, sort of put positive on duration. We still see inflation surprising the downside everywhere across Asia. There's still a lot of monetary policy support. And more importantly, again, the domestic demand situation across Asia is still pretty strong. You know, it wasn't too long ago that we saw euphoria that the Indian bond market would be included in the world index. And just wondering how how is that playing out? Is there still good appetite for for Indian bonds? I think the last one, one we've actually seen, you know, offshore sort of taking, you know, some money out from the Indian bond market. But we have to realize that, you know, India has always been a country, you know, where the capital account is closed, where the demand from the banking books, as well as the onshore real money, is completely sufficient to fund the supply as such. It's just the foreigners were an added alpha catalyst for Indian bond structure globally. So I don't think just the inclusion itself would have actually caused that much of an impact in terms of changing bond supply demand. But it might have actually held a little bit positively. But being, you know, India such a, you know, closed capital account country, you're not really worried about, you know, foreigners exiting. What catalysts might that be? So I think one of the biggest one is the fact that inflation continues surprise on the downside. Right. I mean, if you look at, again, headline inflation, that's actually Clintonites will look it depends on oil. But in India's case, because the retail prices are minister prices, you don't necessarily see the impact of changing oil prices on retail prices on a day to date. Of course, at some point of time, maybe there will be an adjustment, but not on a day to day. But regardless of that, the fact that even core inflation, you know, that actually has been very much below 4%. If you take out gold, of course, if you take the headline core inflation around 4% take out gold is around 3.7%. That tells you that there are still a lot of real rate cushion in Asia, as you said, for a country like India. Oil is imported. We had a breaking news just earlier talking about how Israel is looking at full occupation of Gaza. If the situation in the Middle East were to accelerate, become much worse than it is right now. I mean, how would this that perhaps shape your calculations? So to us, ultimately, it all boils down to what kind of an impact on oil. You know, it will have the fact that, you know, oil has been relatively stable throughout in the last 3 to 4 months despite even the escalating tensions with Iran. That tells us that, you know, the modular impact of this on oil has been diminishing. At the end of the day, we all know there's still a huge amount. Spare capacity that the oil market actually has. So to us, you know, as long as oil prices are sort of stable and that's what we are expecting, our commodities started just to expect oil prices to go down. As long as that's the case, Asia in general and India in particular will not be impacted. Would you say that perhaps there's war fatigue? It's no longer, you know, an issue that that bugs the market? I think that much definitely when you actually talk about the top two or three things that some markets mind, you know, I would say tariff is the top thing, right? So no longer I would say, you know, even though there are tensions lingering release, I don't think that's a top concern of the market. Right. Richard, good to have you with us. We had gone head of AM Asia strategy at Citi Research. Still ahead this hour, Israel's cabinet approves Vignesh Netanyahu's plan for a full military takeover of Gaza. Despite growing international alarm, we'll get a live update from Jerusalem. Welcome back. Israel's security cabinet has approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to seize Gaza City as Israeli leader attempts to orchestrate a final push to topple Hamas and end 22 months of fighting. From all is bringing reporter Dan Williams in Jerusalem. Dan, what do we know? What does a full occupation entail? Well, it's worth noting that occupation is not a word that appeared in the statement by the security cabinet. That's Israel's top decision making for effectively its war cabinet. The Israelis are talking about a seizure of Gaza City. That's really the last remaining block of Gaza territory yet to be conquered by the Israelis. They say this will effectively help crush Hamas, recover the hostages it still holds. They're not talking about occupation in terms of governance, although they're not really articulating what would follow. They simply want a government that's not Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority. So for now, it's being treated as a military advance and offensive with measures being taken to help the humanitarian situation there, which really is in dire straits in order to win what has been and what has become Israel's longest ever war. Dan, I can't see the international community actually approving this. I mean, they must be up in arms. There must be outrage. Well, Israel's no stranger to the disapproval of the international community. It has locked horns with them, specifically the Europeans. Also the United States, at least under the previous administration of Joe Biden. However, when it comes to the current administration of Donald Trump, the signals from Washington have been very supportive. In fact, there appears to be something of a tag team arrangement between Israel and the United States. Israel does the fighting. The United States does the feeding. By which I mean the U.S. is now determined to quadruple within two months the operating volume of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. That is a new network for distributing aid that was set up with Israel's blessing in the hope of sidelining traditional aid distribution by the U.N. and other agencies long accused by Israel and the United States of being too close to the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip. So for now, when it comes to U.S. power and its U.S. ally, Israel has support for this, although I think it's clear that the Trump administration is losing patience, as is much of the region. Certainly for Palestinians, it's been a source of major humanitarian distress. It's a huge strain on Israel's conscript military. And I think everyone in the region would like to see this war in their rearview mirror one way or another. The thing is, Dan, what's happened to mediation, whether it is the U.S. court or Egypt, where are we with DOD and is that still a possibility? That's an excellent question. Mediation formally stalled last month. There were efforts to achieve a third ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but the core differences between Israel Hamas were unbridgeable. Those core differences were that Hamas was open to a cease fire, but wasn't a guarantee that Israel would stop the war and withdraw all forces. Israel said it would not stop the war, withdraws forces. Certainly, while Hamas retains power and weaponry, Hamas has not given any indication it would disarm. It said perhaps it would be open to a power sharing in the future. Essentially, those were no longer hostage talks or truce talks. They were actually Hamas talks. There are talks about what, if anything, Hamas would be in a future Gaza Strip, as we know from the statement today. Israel is determined to see Hamas go from the Gaza Strip. And on that, too, it has the support of the United States. How might this end? Because we know both Israel and Hamas have different visions and how this war should end. Well to judge by the recent Israeli resolution, it will end with what Israel calls victory victory as we understand it. And again, Netanyahu has not articulated this in detail. It would entail some kind of white flag from Hamas, some sort of destruction of what remains of Hamas governance and the recovery of those 50 hostages. The question is how many of them will come back alive, According to Israel, 20 of them, and now alive. The rest died in captivity or taken by Hamas dead, having killed them across the border on October 7th, 2023. That attack which began the war. Now, many Israelis are worried that this final push will endanger those hostages, either as crossfire, casualties or because Hamas has threatened to execute them rather than see them rescued. But I think the Israelis are now saying all they all the hostages have to be recovered, dead or alive. This war has to be ended with what Israel can claim is a victory. Nonetheless, the coming days and weeks will be very bloody because the Gaza Strip, as I said, was largely untouched by Israeli ground forces. Hamas retains an infrastructure of bunkers and tunnels. It has, according to Israel, some 20,000 fighters, many of them new recruits. And they will not go quietly unless they decide on individual levels to surrender and cut deals for the release of individual hostages. This will be another bloody episode in the war. Israel hopes it will be the final episode of this war. Dan, thank you for the insights. Bloomberg's Dan Williams in Jerusalem. Let's do a check on oil which has been under pressure. In fact, we have oil had it for the biggest week lost since June. Taking a look at those numbers at this point in time. Where are we with those numbers on oil currently down about a 10th of 1% for Brent crude. Still the same exchange reporting better than expected full year profit. We'll speak with SGX President Michael Sen about that brightening outlook for listings. Keep it here with us. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back. You're watching INSIGHT. Here's a look at shares of Singapore Exchange, which had swung to losses after briefly touching a record high on full year profit that came in just ahead of Ali's estimates. The exchange operator also announcing plans for quarterly dividend hikes starting next year and saying it is positive about its IPO pipeline. Let's get more insight on SGX growth plans with the exchange president, Michael Sen. Good to have you with us. Congratulations. Thank you. Haslinda Amin is so optimistic. You have to be right. The IPO was dismal for 2020. For one IPO, you can only go better from here across the board. I mean, this is full year results firing on all cylinders. It's particularly useful to see this happen because we're in this new world order. And the question you have to ask yourself as a business, as a stock exchange, are you of service to someone? And the answer was pretty resounding of service to risk managers, investment managers, asset owners and corporates. So what's been very clear is that part of this has to do with Singapore itself, because the Singapore stock market has doubled in value in the past five years, similar to the S & P 500, where, say, the Hang Seng index is flat over five. It's actually flat over 18 years. So wealth is being created and capital is coming in. And we're seeing that reflected also in corporate saying I need to raise cash clusters are emerging. So the most important thing for us, it's not just companies coming to list, it's because of a certain need that's being met. And it's about infrastructure, largely Asian in nature for resilience, for the future. And this is climate resilience, security resilience, the basic foundational systems for society to organize itself. Recently we had a data center. Right now we have a cluster of three. So data centers are part of this new infrastructure. So we have visibility probably on 30 at the end of the pipeline, meaning 30 companies who've already paid for advisors and appointed them to get going and running at full pace at 30. Something will be very comfortable with. So optimistic on that. And of course every other business that we're in shipping commodities affects that's running at full track. But you've got to wonder whether those tariffs imposed by the US and some of the other countries, especially around the region, is also playing a part. I mean, Singapore at 10% could see inflows because of that. The first order benefit to the franchise, it's not so obvious because we aren't directly index to trade velocity. But the second order impact of these tariffs is very, very high. In the past 24 hours you've seen the price of the kilo bar of gold apparently change at the stroke of a pen. Locational pricing is something we do. It's deep in our DNA. What's the price of iron ore on a boat versus at the port? What's the price of the C5 Capesize route? What's the price of X traded in SGX in Singapore versus trading in Tokyo? So locational prices, what we do and locational query is what we do. So in an era of globalization or fragmentation, actually the need, the flight to quality is up, not down. That's what we've seen in the past year. So in terms of IPO, talk to us about, you know, what the expectations are and what kind of numbers, if it's not if it can be better than one, what is it we're looking at? And can we expect big IPOs? So I can't speak for big. What I can say is that the theme that buy seems to bind to almost all of them, which is infrastructure is big. It's not just on the supply side. The fact that it's meant to be infrastructure for the future. It's on the buy side because infrastructure in the portfolio, which is inflation linked and Asian linked and Singapore anchored, that's a very strong buy theme. That's why we've seen so much influence to Singapore. We very seldom talk about numbers, but I feel comfortable saying 30 that have mandated and paid for professional advisors to get the IPO going and typically would timeframe. Well, if they can all come within the coming year, I think that would be good. That's a market conditions thing. And so if I look back to five, ten, 15 years ago, this is a pretty good run rate growing at full chat for analysts to get up to speed, for them to go to market, for investors to get familiar. And all of this is happening in the context, of course, of the Singapore government review. Right before we get to that review, Ali talked about Dennis under Read you talking about NTT. Yes, it was pretty muted, tepid performance, though. Is that impacting sentiment? Not really. Rates aren't rates aren't as pop poppy things. Right. So the timeframes that this so let me pick an example of a serious use of of our market so Temasek Holdings you covered this recently reported their annual profits this goes to government budget. The majority of their profits come from SGX. So the wealth creation for serious people with serious obligations and serious responsibilities is what's driving this capital formation and the need for more supply, because the capital swinging over at the margin is quite significant. I mean, I talk about this all the time. The US, 5% of the world's population, 25% of the world's GDP, over 70% of market cap. I'm not saying it's going below 70. I'm saying if the differential 1% swings over to Asia and lands in a developed market in Asia, that impact is very, very large. Some say, though, it is challenging to revive the IPO market. Are there further measures that you can implement? Are we expecting any new initiatives? The focus of the way the government looked at this because this is now a whole of nation infrastructure, economic resilience thing is what is the right thing to do to support enterprise financing in Singapore? Because in an era of globalisation, self-reliance means that you must be able to finance your enterprises. That's where the jobs of the future, the innovation of the future is coming in. So both on the supply side, the regulatory side and the demand side, there's an entire program that's chaired by Minister Chea to get this going. And the one thing you know about Singapore is it's not a one shot wonder. We don't believe in silver bullets. Phase one is followed by phase two is followed by phase three, because this is part of the whole economic resilience program. And the capital markets are fundamental to economic resilience. Liquidity is the issue with Singapore, right? Yes. And if you take a look at markets like India, the U.S., that liquidity is actually driven a lot by the retail investors. Yes. What are the plans there? Can Singapore see a similar arrangement? If you sit back and look at how much money sits in Singapore, it's pretty huge. So actually the problem we have is not the problem other people have where, oh, there's not enough money or there's not enough middle income people. A vast majority of Singaporeans portfolios goes into many things globally. And therefore, the challenge we're trying to solve is to make sure that relevant supply comes to them in a place which is more resilient for them, closer to them. So the range of products we seek to introduce will be much broader. We've already seen huge success in ETFs as an example like world's largest sustainable climate ETF. Who would have thought would be here, right? The world's largest Chinese government bond ETF. Who would have thought it would be here? But it's still on and off because when you talk to people, investors, they say the issue with Singapore is liquidity. Yes. So it's not an issue until you have something which needs greater liquidity than you have. And one of the incremental measures that has had the most excitement from the Singapore government is the allocation of funds to managers who are adding to the research and liquidity ecosystem and are crowding more capital in. So on the basis of that, already you've seen our mid-cap sector significantly increase in liquidity, meaning turnover velocity as well as valuation. You always need catalysts of some sort to crowd more attention in. And this is before the first all has been deployed already using mid-caps. The number of mid-caps which trade for us, which is the 1 to 5 billion zone which makes it healthy, has gone from 70 something to 90 something just because more eyeballs have turned to them. You only mentioned about the equity market development program. I'm just wondering what's been the reaction? So what's on public record is 100 managers applied for it and of course, three have been mandated. The reaction of the other 97 is why not me? So phase two is coming up because this is, as I mentioned earlier, the Singapore government doesn't do wonderful things. There'll be phasing, there'll be deployment. And one very interesting thing is that extra criteria they have is it's not about just making returns of this money. It's making sure that you get research done. You get the companies to value up. You make sure that you focus on small and mid-cap stocks outside of retail, outside of index shares, and make sure you hire people. Make sure you crowd in third party money. So that crowding in effect is what Singapore has done so well across the board in whether it's health care, education, v-c that system of working, it's it's a method. Are you confident that perhaps in 1224 months the Singapore market would be seen, viewed, perceived differently from what it was before? Can it be viewed as more attractive than Hong Kong because there's always a competition between the two? I can give you some categorical statement. I am very confident that Singapore and Singapore Exchange Group will be relevant across all factors. I say this because in the past five years our share price has doubled, just like our stock market is based. So I have to add. But for five years or 18 years, starting from a base eight years ago, you know, Hong Kong as a market hasn't really moved. In fact, if I look at some of the capital formation that's happened, it's about Asia companies who temporarily cannot raise money in the market selling a $1 share for $0.65 in shares. And that's a great business to be in. Right. We don't have that business. We're in the business of turning $1 to $2, to $4 to $8 to $16 an across the board Singapore exchange group. And remember, I'm wearing effects today just to tell everyone, not just the stock market, where the world's largest fixed futures market for all Hong Kong currencies, Hong Kong R & B, Hong Kong dollar. So the need for a Singapore based market infrastructure to meet all these emerging needs which turn up from evening news, whether it's on soybeans, gold or tariffs that need for risk management is very, very high. Which businesses will drive growth in the next 12 months? We think that the two businesses which have seen the most incremental demand are currency hedging, more continuous for longer hours and commodity and shipping hedging together, because it's not just the cargo, it's the shipping route. So we are unique in exchanges because we own the Baltic Exchange that we offer side by side, both the world's leading markets for the cargo as well as for the ship that floats it from point A to point B. So that has been massive in interest. And that's not just about tariffs. That's actually been about pathways being shut or kinetic acts on shipping routes and on boats. You know, we talked about how Singapore is in a way benefiting from a challenging environment because it's seen as neutral, it's seen as safe. There's still risks. What do you deem as the biggest risk to the business? So the biggest risk for us is we spend a long time our operating track record of dealing with being a flight to quality infrastructure is such that we try to build ourselves and market ourselves as being when things go bad and uncertain, you should probably come to us because we have a practiced way of being sensible about it. The number one fear is something happens that is beyond our ability to easily think about and react. A lot of the sudden overnight moves have been in the nature of legal orders and executive orders, and that's already caused turmoil. You know, this company suddenly becomes sanctioned. You can't invest in it. You have to change your index. Those are non-kinetic things, but there could be cyber type incidents. A cable could be cut. Suddenly a matching engine could go down. And we have to think very, very hard in our gaming on preparation what flight to quality really means and the scope of those things is now broader, not narrow. All right, Mike, have you with us. Thank you. Has Lynn Michaelson, president of SGX Group. Let's do a check on the Japanese market's back from lunch break. I think in the bout already 12 minutes taking a look at where they are right now in the positive the Nikkei 225 up by more than 2%. A lot of optimism there given that the US has agreed to end stacking or universal tariffs cutting Carl Levin says well we have the tech stocks in particular getting a lift as well in terms of the yen one 4720 right now it is pretty much flood versus the USD. Well, plenty more ahead. Keep it here with us. This is Bloomberg. While India has just kicked off its trading day, we're seeing red pretty much across the board. The Sensex down about 2/10 of 1%. While President Trump has taken his trade brinksmanship against India to a new level by doubling an already high tariff rate of 25%. Collier Jewelers is the country's second most valuable jewellery brand, with over 316 stores in India, the Middle East and the US. Joining us now for an exclusive interview is executive director Ramesh Cleanroom. Ramesh, good to have you with us. I mean, we know that demand for jewellery in India was already falling before the tariffs. What impact will the tyres have? Well, thank you for the opportunity. And we do not have a direct impact for a tariff in India because except for the gold, prices can be a bit volatile. But otherwise our U.S. operations, we have retail stores across the US, but we have only two, which we have just started maybe six, seven months ago the first store started. So there is no direct impact and the revenue at the ground level in India for jewelry segment organized is very strong Over the last 810 quarters, the same store sales growth has been in double digits, strong double digit. It continues even in Q1, Q1, the revenue growth, this is Diesel's 18%, total revenue growth at 31%. So everything seems to be strong here. You seem optimistic, but we heard from the GM association in India saying that 50% tariff would mean a standstill of the jewelry industry in the country. No, maybe they are talking about exports because today energy, we are only intermittent. We don't even export for our own stores outside India because we have 37 showrooms in Middle East. We don't even export to those rooms. So we don't have an impact on tariff because we are not exporters. So are exporters limited to U.S. and we have only two showrooms there and very minimal. So is there a way is there a need to navigate the uncertainties? I didn't get to the. How are you navigating the uncertain environment in India, given the tariffs that will be imposed by the US? Although we have only limited things which we can do, right, So we will not be able to navigate uncertainties. But yes, if you look at the consumer point of view, the demand is strong. There is a shift from an to segment in our segment in jewelry to the organized segment. So we are also increasing our footprint across the country. They are 2 to 3 to four cities are growing in our country. So we don't see a mid-term long term demand issue at all for the segment, even as we speak, July have started off with. Hmm. We know that some drillers are moving their production to perhaps low tide countries the likes of the UAE. What do you make of such moves? He's going to be how we do showrooms. And the only thing what we are doing is any further expansion in the US. We will have to be mindful of the tariff and we will have to explore ways to get the products there from UAE. Right. And we we have already got the manufacturing unit in Dubai and we might expand it a bit for for for sending products to the US markets, that sort. Right. So you have presence in the U.S. How are your customers in the U.S. responding to those tariffs? The too early again because people knew that the narrative because the discussions are often on for the past, what, three, four or five months now, three months now. So we we as a brand were also prepared on dealing with our customers in that way. And for the two showrooms now, we get inventory from Dubai. So that does not impact at all. So no auto cancellations. It is business as usual for for for you. Yeah, because it's meaning customers knew that the price increase was. So gold, as you know, we are already 30 40% higher than the last one year. So gold price movement, this is also one of the reasons. That's it. So we have a we really have to see something in the US, but we are not for. When it comes to gold demand in India, it has been dented somewhat. Maybe not for you, but generally for the industry. When do you see a revival in gold demand coming back? Involvement has been strong because you look at the numbers of Acadian Jewelers, our our peer group. The same store sales growth itself has been in the range of 17, 18% over the last 810 quarters. So demand per it is very strong. And the only area where we should look at is the revenue growth within the organized player is more than the unorganised players might have a flat growth because the is there. Because I. When it comes to go, can you. Yeah. If you look at CAGR group for the last three years it has been 35%. Can you give us a sense of gold for jewelry versus gold as investment is what's coming through? When you take a look at the purchases. Look, we are retailers, so we actually talk to customers who come as a consumer to wear the product rather than investing in gold. So those are not RPG because we don't sell bullion and after we sell only jewelry and people buy gold coins also. But that is not predominantly only for investment. It's also saving for the customer. They might exchange the coin for jewelry even whenever there is a need for jewelry. Given the high gold prices, are you seeing any behavioural changes among your customers? The gold prices, as I told you, it has been volatile, It has been moving up, up for the past, what, three, five, seven years now? And consumers also know. So that is making them more happy rather than regretting it because they have a lot of gold jewellery at their home. And the additional jewellery which they are coming to buy now will be a smaller quantity than what they have at home. So for them it is an asset as well as a product which they can wear and enjoy. Hmm. Ramesh. One trend that is actually emerging in the world is not just about gold. It's also about diamond. But it is lab diamonds. I mean, what's your take on the impact on the industry, given that India actually deals with 90% of global diamond supply? So in India, again, consumers actually prefer diamond jewelry. Okay. More than solitaire. And solitaire is only a very small portion of our overall demand. In India, customers prefer diamond jewellery with small stones, which is not all it did. And in that in in in non solitaire small stones, the impact of labrum diamond is not there. The prices are almost stable, so we don't see any demand per say issue because of the lab grown. And as I told you, the lab grown diamond in India is a smaller market when compared to international markets. In international markets, a majority of the diamond jewellery sold is solitaire. Indian diamond exports, though, at a five year low. What would it take to reverse that? Though, as I told you, we are not exporters. So it is very unfair for me to comment on exporters because I can only talk about the local demand to consumers here in India. What is happening in the retail segment across the jewellery segment for export is a different ballgame when we are not a part of. Hmm. How optimistic are you about your business? What will drive? What will be the catalyst for growth? So growth, predominantly same store sales growth is there because of the shift from UNORGANISED organized. We have we have we have got new customers over the past three four years. The new customer growth has been significant and expansion across the country is also on the right track. We have an asset led model where we expand business and Robert going in the right direction. We have to leave it there, Ramesh. Ramesh Kalyan, Nariman Executive Director at Kalyan Jewellers.
