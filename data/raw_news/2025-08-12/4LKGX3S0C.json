  "content": "Attorneys for grassroots campaigners are again asking a judge to halt enforcement of parts of a new Florida law that restricts the state\u2019s process to get citizens\u2019 initiatives on the ballot\n\nCampaign groups urge judge to further limit new restrictions on getting measures on Florida's ballot\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Attorneys for grassroots campaigners are again asking a federal judge to halt enforcement of parts of a new Florida law that restricts the state\u2019s process to get citizens\u2019 initiatives on the ballot.\n\nTuesday's arguments before U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee were the latest attempt by attorneys for voter advocacy groups and campaigns for Medicaid expansion and recreational marijuana to carve away at a law that they argue unconstitutionally hamstrings citizens' abilities to amend Florida's constitution.\n\nSo far, Walker has issued mixed rulings in the case, freezing some portions of the law but allowing other parts to go into effect, even as the campaigns try to gather enough signatures from voters to qualify for the 2026 ballot.\n\nWalker had already blocked some provisions of the statute that bar noncitizens and residents of other states from gathering petitions to get a measure on the ballot. On Tuesday, attorneys came back to ask Walker to expand that ruling, barring state attorneys from enforcing that aspect of the law against their clients. Walker had previously blocked enforcement by the attorney general, secretary of state and local elections supervisors against the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to address a gap in the relief provided,\u201d said Glenn Burhans, an attorney for Smart & Safe Florida, the recreational marijuana campaign.\n\n\u201cIn our view, it makes for a cleaner record and a much more clear situation on the ground to make sure that the state attorneys are enjoined,\u201d Burhans added.\n\nAn attorney for Latino voter engagement group Poder Latinx also urged Walker to shield their members from prosecution under the noncitizen provision.\n\nIn this latest round of requests to the court, an attorney for the state of Florida argued Walker shouldn't reward what he described as vexatious, piecemeal motions.\n\n\"That\u2019s no way to run a railroad. And it\u2019s no way to run a case like this,\" said Mohammad Jazil, an attorney for Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd.\n\n\u201cThey should seek their strongest basis for relief the first time, or in this case the second time, and we should move on from there,\" Jazil said of the plaintiffs. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWalker declined to rule from the bench, saying he would issue an order on Tuesday.\n\nOther plaintiffs in the case are expected to make their own arguments for a preliminary injunction next month, with a trial scheduled to start in January.\n\nLegislatures in dozens of states have advanced bills recently to crack down on the public\u2019s ability to put measures up for a vote, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. Voting rights advocates say the trend betrays the promise of direct democracy.\n\nUnder Florida\u2019s law, an individual could be charged with a felony if they collect more than 25 signed ballot petitions, other than their own or those of immediate family members, and don\u2019t register with the state as a petition circulator. The law signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in May also gives campaigns just 10 days instead of the previous 30 to return signed petition forms to local elections officials. Petitioners could also face stiff fines if they don\u2019t return the petitions on time or send them to the wrong county.\n\nLawmakers argue that the restrictions are needed to reform a process they claim has been tainted by fraud. The Republican-controlled Legislature pushed the changes months after a majority of Florida voters supported ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, though the measures fell short of the 60% needed to pass.\n\nKate Payne is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "text": "GOP lawmakers create hurdles for citizen ballot initiatives\nGOP lawmakers create hurdles for citizen ballot initiatives\nLITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Arkansas voters have been active in recent years, passing ballot initiatives that legalized medical marijuana, raised the minimum wage and expanded casino gambling.\nThat hasn\u2019t gone over well with Republicans.\nArkansas\u2019 GOP-dominated Legislature has taken steps this year that will make it harder to put such proposals before voters, and they are not the only ones.\nFlorida, North Dakota, South Dakota and Utah also have enacted restrictions on the public\u2019s ability to place initiatives on the ballot. In Michigan, the state\u2019s top election official is being sued over Republican-enacted requirements that make it harder to qualify proposals for the ballot.\nIn all, lawmakers in 16 states introduced more than 120 bills this year that would weaken the initiative process, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. The moves worry advocates who say they undermine the idea of direct democracy and could effectively shut down the initiative process in some states.\n\u201cThis is a way to make sure that there is absolutely no way that anyone can do something that (Republican lawmakers) don\u2019t already approve,\u201d said Florida state Sen. Oscar Braynon, a Democrat who opposed state restrictions recently signed into law.\nIn Arkansas, the changes came after voters legalized medical marijuana in 2016 and last year approved raising the state\u2019s minimum wage to $12 an hour by 2021.\nThe state\u2019s governor signed into law legislation overhauling the way measures are approved for the ballot so that a proposed initiative and the signatures collected in favor of it are reviewed at the same time. The change, critics say, would mean groups could waste time and money circulating petitions only to find out afterward that there was a problem with the wording that would disqualify it from the ballot.\nArkansas lawmakers also placed on next year\u2019s ballot a measure that, if approved by voters, would impose additional restrictions. Those would include tripling the number of counties where initiative sponsors must collect a minimum number of signatures and eliminating a 30-day period groups have to gather additional signatures if they initially fall short. The lawmakers\u2019 ballot measure also would move up by several months the deadline for submitting petitions.\n\u201cEverything they have done has ... the ultimate goal to eliminate the petitioning process so that the people have no voice, and it is outrageous,\u201d said Melissa Fults, executive director of the Drug Policy Education Group, who plans to try and get a recreational marijuana proposal on next year\u2019s ballot.\nThe success of the medical marijuana initiative was celebrated by Arkansas residents such as Joanie Hopson, who was one of the first in line when retailers started selling marijuana last month. The 36-year-old said she suffers from a host of ailments, including muscle spasms, seizures and a connective tissue disorder, and cried when she was finally able to buy cannabis legally to ease her pain.\n\u201cWe were really on the verge of moving out of the state because I need my medicine,\u201d said Hopson, who lives in the community of East End, a short drive south of Little Rock.\nLawmakers pushing the restrictions said they are trying to rein in an initiative process that has been an easy target for out-of-state groups. Previous initiatives included unsuccessful attempts by pro-casino groups to give certain companies a gambling monopoly in the state.\nRepublican state Sen. Mat Pitsch, who co-sponsored the changes in Arkansas, said the state\u2019s constitution has been changed 20 times over the past seven elections \u2014 a number that also includes measures lawmakers themselves put before voters.\n\u201cWhen you change your constitution three times every other year, that\u2019s more like legislating than having a constitution,\u201d said Pitsch, who noted the proposal on next year\u2019s ballot also would raise the threshold for lawmakers to send measures to voters.\nA similar argument was used in Florida when the governor this month signed wide-ranging legislation that erects a number of hurdles to those trying to get initiatives before votes.\nThe new Florida laws require paid petition gatherers to register with the secretary of state, prohibit payments based on the number of signatures collected and levy fines if petitions aren\u2019t turned in within 30 days. The petitions also must include the name and permanent address of the signature-gatherer.\nGov. Ron DeSantis defended the bill, saying it is aimed at protecting the Florida Constitution from outsiders. The governor said he wants to take more steps to revise the process of changing the constitution.\n\u201cThis is not supposed to be driven by out-of-state special interests; it\u2019s supposed to be driven by Floridians, but that\u2019s really not what\u2019s happened,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cIf people really feel the need to do it, then you band together, you do your organizations, you do it. Right now, you just have one guy write a check and you pay these people per signature. It creates a lot of bad incentives.\u201d\nFlorida voters have approved a number of petition-driven amendments that Republicans don\u2019t like, including limits on class sizes, preschool education for all, medical marijuana legalization and, last fall, restoring voting rights for felons who have completed their sentences. In the works are petition drives for 2020 seeking to ban assault rifles and raise the minimum wage.\nIn Utah, where voters last year approved medical marijuana, Medicaid expansion and redistricting proposals, the state\u2019s Republican governor signed legislation delaying the implementation of successful initiatives to give lawmakers a chance to change them.\nRep. Brad Daw, the bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, said the change allows lawmakers to keep state agencies running smoothly by revising portions of voter-approved laws that conflict with other rules before they go into effect.\n\u201cThe fact is, the Legislature can make changes one way or another,\u201d he said.\nBut critics say they worry the changes will leave voters feeling powerless.\n\u201cWhen you pass a ballot measure, you want to see something change,\u201d said Yoram Bauman with Clean the Darn Air, which is pushing to get on the 2020 ballot with a proposed a carbon tax to curb pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cIf you have to wait an extra year to see something change, that\u2019s frustrating, especially when you feel like during that extra time the Legislature can come in and monkey with it.\u201d\nNot all changes are winning favor in Republican states. Idaho Gov. Brad Little vetoed proposals that would have made it tougher to qualify a measure for the ballot, saying he didn\u2019t believe the restrictions would stand up in court. The legislation was seen primarily as a reaction by the Republican-dominated Legislature to last year\u2019s voter approval of Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cWe argued that for a change to constitutional rights of this magnitude, the correct process is to take that to the voters as a constitutional amendment,\u201d said Rebecca Schroeder, executive director of Reclaim Idaho, the group behind the Medicaid expansion initiative.\nIn Arkansas, the fight over initiative restrictions may not be over, with groups opposing them preparing a lawsuit. David Couch, the attorney who sponsored the minimum wage and medical marijuana initiatives, also sees another path to fighting back \u2014 placing an initiative on next year\u2019s ballot that competes with the one pushed by the Legislature.\n___\nAssociated Press Writers Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Florida, Keith Ridler in Boise, Idaho, and Lindsay Whitehurst in Salt Lake City contributed to this report."

(AP) \u2014 Florida voters have long been able to use the citizens\u2019 initiative process to bypass the Republican-dominated Legislature and advance progressive policies such as raising the minimum wage, legalizing medical marijuana and restoring the voting rights of people with felony convictions.\nRepublican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law Friday creating new hurdles for citizen-driven initiatives, changes critics say would make it prohibitively expensive and effectively impossible for grassroots campaigners to get them onto the ballot.\nLegislatures in dozens of states have advanced bills recently to crack down on the public\u2019s ability to put measures up for a vote, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. Voting rights advocates say the trend betrays the promise of direct democracy.\nUnder Florida\u2019s measure, voters could be charged with a felony if they collect more than 25 signed ballot petitions, other than their own or those of immediate family members, and don\u2019t register with the state as a petition circulator.\nMonths before the bill advanced in the Legislature, Florida voters supported ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, though the measures fell short of the 60% needed to pass.\nDeSantis signed the measure Friday evening, hours after lawmakers gave the bill final approval. He marshaled state resources and the power of his office in an aggressive campaign to oppose the measures on the ballot last November.\n\u201cThis bill has been intentionally designed to make it impossible for any statewide citizen initiative to make it to the ballot ever again,\u201d said state Sen. Carlos Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, who called the measure \u201cthe final kill shot against direct democracy.\u201d\nThe bill\u2019s Republican sponsors argued the measure is meant to protect rather than restrict the citizens\u2019 initiative process, which Florida\u2019s Republican Senate president has repeatedly called \u201csacrosanct.\u201d Instead, they say the aim is to reform a process they see as tainted by outside petition-gatherers who they allege have forged petition signatures or misled voters.\n\u201cThis bill is not an attack on the citizen initiative process,\u201d said co-sponsor state Sen. Don Gaetz, a Panhandle Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on those who have corrupted it.\u201d\nA state election crimes unit created under the DeSantis administration in 2022 helped secure two dozen felony election-related convictions, according to a January report. State officers have made at least 17 arrests of paid petition circulators working on behalf of four different ballot initiatives, the agency says.\nThe measure \u201cdoes not address imaginary, hypothetical fraud, but known fraud,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Jennifer Bradley.\nOne of the reforms lawmakers said was needed aims to rein in the DeSantis administration, which used public funds to create ads opposing the 2024 measures and threatened television stations with criminal penalties for airing commercials in support of the proposals.\n\u201cThey engaged in behavior that will now be unlawful and will now be prevented,\u201d Gaetz said, under a provision that outlaws the use of public funds for political ads on any proposed constitutional amendment.\nUnder the law, more people will be banned from collecting petitions, including Floridians with felony convictions who haven\u2019t had their voting rights restored. Noncitizens and people who don\u2019t reside in Florida will also be prohibited from gathering signatures, in a state with a significant population of part-time workers and foreign-born residents.\nFloridians will have to provide their driver\u2019s license number, voter ID card number, or the last four digits of their Social Security number in order to fill out a petition. The form will ultimately become a public record.\nCampaigners will face shorter deadlines to return petitions to local election officials, and stiffer fines if they don\u2019t return them to the correct county \u2014 an issue advocates say can occur due to voter error in filling out the forms.\nFormer Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes, a frequent critic of his former colleagues in Tallahassee who now leads the nonprofit Florida Policy Project, criticized the bill in a post on X.\n\u201cIt should be difficult to change the constitution, but not impossible,\u201d Brandes wrote. \u201cUnless you\u2019re the Florida Legislature \u2014 then you just keep moving the goalpost until only you can keep score.\u201d\n___ Associated Press writer Mike Schneider in Orlando, Florida contributed to this report.

      "text": "Florida voters reject measures to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana\nFlorida voters reject measures to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida voters rejected ballot measures Tuesday to protect abortion rights and legalize marijuana, handing victories to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and solidifying the state\u2019s new reputation as a conservative stronghold.\nDeSantis used state resources and campaigned heavily against each issue, telling voters that whether they were for or against marijuana or abortion rights, the measures were flawed, poorly worded and would likely never be repealed if enshrined in the state constitution.\nBut DeSantis\u2019 campaign would have failed if it wasn\u2019t for former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, who 20 years ago successfully pushed the threshold to change the constitution to 60% support. Both measures had support from a majority of voters, but not enough to pass.\n\u201cWe fought the good fight, we kept the faith, and we finished the race. Thanks to @GovRonDeSantis and our great team for everything they sacrificed over the past months to protect our great state from amendments that sought to attack our families and way of life,\u201d DeSantis\u2019 chief of staff, James Uthmeier said on X, where DeSantis simply posted that both issues were defeated.\nStill, supporters of the amendment criticized DeSantis for using state resources, including television ads and a social media campaign, to fight the measures.\n\u201cThis is no longer the \u2018Free State of Florida\u2019\u201d said Florida Women\u2019s Freedom Coalition executive director Anna Hochkammer in a news release. \u201cThis is a state that strips humans of their freedoms and dignity. A state whose government pushed a taxpayer-funded campaign using government resources to intimidate voters, silence women, and undermine democracy.\u201d\nThe abortion measure would have prevented lawmakers from passing any law that penalized, prohibited, delayed or restricts abortion until fetal viability, which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks. The state\u2019s restrictive six-week abortion law still stands. Florida is one of the first states to reject abortion rights in a ballot measure since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\nThe marijuana measure would have allowed people 21 years old and older to possess about 3 ounces of marijuana, and it would have allowed businesses already growing and selling medical marijuana to sell it to them. This vote came at a time when federal officials are moving to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\nThe ballot measures needed approval from at least 60% of voters. In other states, abortion rights helped drive turnout and were a leading issue that allowed Democrats to retain multiple Senate seats in 2022.\nDeSantis and other state leaders spent months campaigning against the measures. Democrats heavily campaigned in support of both issues, hoping to inspire party supporters to the polls. Republican have a 1 million-voter registration edge over Democrats.\nAmong DeSantis\u2019 arguments against the marijuana initiative is that it would have hurt the state\u2019s tourism because of a weed stench in the air. But other Republican leaders, including Florida resident Donald Trump and former state GOP Chairman Sen. Joe Gruters, supported legalizing recreational marijuana.\nTrump went back and forth on how he would vote on the state\u2019s abortion rights initiative before finally saying he would oppose it."

      "text": "Supreme Court formally asked to overturn landmark same-sex marriage ruling\nKim Davis, a former clerk who refused gay couples, brought the appeal.\nTen years after the Supreme Court extended marriage rights to same-sex couples nationwide, the justices this fall will consider for the first time whether to take up a case that explicitly asks them to overturn that decision.\nKim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who was jailed for six days in 2015 after refusing to issue marriage licenses to a gay couple on religious grounds, is appealing a $100,000 jury verdict for emotional damages plus $260,000 for attorneys fees.\nIn a petition for writ of certiorari filed last month, Davis argues First Amendment protection for free exercise of religion immunizes her from personal liability for the denial of marriage licenses.\nMore fundamentally, she claims the high court's decision in Obergefell v Hodges -- extending marriage rights for same-sex couples under the 14th Amendment's due process protections -- was \"egregiously wrong.\"\n\"The mistake must be corrected,\" wrote Davis' attorney Mathew Staver in the petition. He calls Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in Obergefell \"legal fiction.\"\nThe petition appears to mark the first time since 2015 that the court has been formally asked to overturn the landmark marriage decision. Davis is seen as one of the only Americans currently with legal standing to bring a challenge to the precedent.\n\"If there ever was a case of exceptional importance,\" Staver wrote, \"the first individual in the Republic's history who was jailed for following her religious convictions regarding the historic definition of marriage, this should be it.\"\nLower courts have dismissed Davis' claims and most legal experts consider her bid a long shot. A federal appeals court panel concluded earlier this year that the former clerk \"cannot raise the First Amendment as a defense because she is being held liable for state action, which the First Amendment does not protect.\"\nDavis, as the Rowan County Clerk in 2015, was the sole authority tasked with issuing marriage licenses on behalf of the government under state law.\n\"Not a single judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals showed any interest in Davis's rehearing petition, and we are confident the Supreme Court will likewise agree that Davis's arguments do not merit further attention,\" said William Powell, attorney for David Ermold and David Moore, the now-married Kentucky couple that sued Davis for damages, in a statement to ABC News.\nA renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent\nDavis' appeal to the Supreme Court comes as conservative opponents of marriage rights for same-sex couples pursue a renewed campaign to reverse legal precedent and allow each state to set its own policy.\nAt the time Obergefell was decided in 2015, 35 states had statutory or constitutional bans on same-sex marriages, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Only eight states had enacted laws explicitly allowing the unions.\nSo far in 2025, at least nine states have either introduced legislation aimed at blocking new marriage licenses for LGBTQ people or passed resolutions urging the Supreme Court to reverse Obergefell at the earliest opportunity, according to the advocacy group Lambda Legal.\nIn June, the Southern Baptist Convention -- the nation's largest Protestant Christian denomination -- overwhelmingly voted to make \"overturning of laws and court rulings, including Obergefell v. Hodges, that defy God's design for marriage and family\" a top priority.\nSupport for equal marriage rights softening\nWhile a strong majority of Americans favor equal marriage rights, support appears to have softened in recent years, according to Gallup -- 60% of Americans supported same-sex marriages in 2015, rising to 70% support in 2025, but that level has plateaued since 2020.\nAmong Republicans, support has notably dipped over the past decade, down from 55% in 2021 to 41% this year, Gallup found.\nDavis' petition argues the issue of marriage should be treated the same way the court handled the issue of abortion in its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v Wade. She zeroes in on Justice Clarence Thomas' concurrence in that case, in which he explicitly called for revisiting Obergefell.\nThe justices \"should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\" Thomas wrote at the time, referring to the landmark decisions dealing with a fundamental right to privacy, due process and equal protection rights.\n\"It is hard to say where things will go, but this will be a long slog considering how popular same-sex marriage is now,\" said Josh Blackman, a prominent conservative constitutional scholar and professor at South Texas College of Law.\nBlackman predicts many members of the Supreme Court's conservative majority would want prospective challenges to Obergefell to percolate in lower courts before revisiting the debate.\nThe court is expected to formally consider Davis' petition this fall during a private conference when the justices discuss which cases to add to their docket. If the case is accepted, it would likely be scheduled for oral argument next spring and decided by the end of June 2026. The court could also decline the case, allowing a lower court ruling to stand and avoid entirely the request to revisit Obergefell.\n\"Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett seem wildly uninterested. Maybe Justice Neil Gorsuch, too,\" said Sarah Isgur, an ABC News legal analyst and host of the legal podcast Advisory Opinions.\n\"There is no world in which the court takes the case as a straight gay marriage case,\" Isgur added. \"It would have to come up as a lower court holding that Obergefell binds judges to accept some other kind of non-traditional marital arrangement.\"\nRuling wouldn't invalidate existing marriages\nIf the ruling were to be overturned at some point in the future, it would not invalidate marriages already performed, legal experts have pointed out. The 2022 Respect for Marriage Act requires the federal government and all states to recognize legal marriages of same-sex and interracial couples performed in any state -- even if there is a future change in the law.\nDavis first appealed the Supreme Court in 2019 seeking to have the damages suit against her tossed out, but her petition was rejected. Conservative Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito concurred with the decision at the time.\n\"This petition implicates important questions about the scope of our decision in Obergefell, but it does not cleanly present them,\" Thomas wrote in a statement.\nMany LGBTQ advocates say they are apprehensive about the shifting legal and political landscape around marriage rights.\nThere are an estimated 823,000 married same-sex couples in the U.S., including 591,000 that wed after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School. Nearly one in five of those married couples is parenting a child under 18.\nSince the Obergefell decision, the makeup of the Supreme Court has shifted rightward, now including three appointees of President Donald Trump and a 6-justice conservative supermajority.\nChief Justice John Roberts, among the current members of the court who dissented in Obergefell a decade ago, sharply criticized the ruling at the time as \"an act of will, not legal judgment\" with \"no basis in the Constitution.\" He also warned then that it \"creates serious questions about religious liberty.\"\nDavis invoked Roberts' words in her petition to the high court, hopeful that at least four justices will vote to accept her case and hear arguments next year."

      "text": "Florida will vote on marijuana, abortion in an election that will test GOP\u2019s dominance\nFlorida will vote on marijuana, abortion in an election that will test GOP\u2019s dominance\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida\u2019s election will test whether the state maintains its new reputation as a Republican stronghold, or whether Democrats make some gains by tapping into the support for abortion and marijuana ballot questions and the new energy Vice President Kamala Harris brings to the race.\nGone are the days when Florida was looked at as the biggest prize among swing states. After former President Barack Obama won Florida twice, former President Donald Trump carried the state by a whisker in 2016 and then by a much larger share in 2020. In 2022, Republicans took all five statewide seats on the ballot by landslide margins.\nStill, there is a lot of buzz over constitutional amendments that could protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, with both sides of each issue pumping millions of dollars into advertising. Democrats support the ballot measures and hope they boost turnout to give them at least a chance stopping Trump\u2019s third straight Florida victory and keeping U.S. Sen. Rick Scott from winning a second term.\nThe only statewide office on the ballot is Scott\u2019s Senate seat. Scott is being challenged by former Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Murcarsel-Powell in a race that\u2019s been overshadowed by the presidential election and the abortion and marijuana ballot questions.\nEven if Trump and Scott are victorious in Florida, Democratic Party Chairwoman Nikki Fried said the election will be a huge success if the amendments pass and the party flips enough legislative seats to take away the Republicans\u2019 supermajority.\n\u201cLook where we were in of November 2022. We had the largest loss that Florida Democrats have ever experienced,\u201d Fried said. \u201cNobody anticipated that we would even have this conversation today, that the polls are showing that we are tight, that there was even a possibility that Florida would be in play. Everybody counted us out.\u201d\nStill, it\u2019s an uphill climb. The amendments need support from at least 60% of voters, and there\u2019s enough money being spent against them that it could create doubts among voters who normally support the issues, said Florida-based Republican political strategist Jamie Miller.\n\u201cAs a general rule, amendments pass if there\u2019s no real effort against them and they fail when there are real efforts against them,\u201d Miller said.\nMiller also believes Democrats are motivated to vote against the Republicans they don\u2019t like rather than be inspired by their own candidates.\n\u201cI see excitement against Donald Trump and against Rick Scott, but that as a general rule in the state the size of Florida is not enough to get you across the line,\u201d he said.\nScott served two terms as governor, winning each with less than 50% of the vote. In 2018, he defeated incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a race decided by 0.2 percentage points. But Florida politics changed. The last time Scott was on the ballot, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the state. Republicans now have a million-voter advantage.\nScott, one of the richest members of Congress, pumped millions of dollars of his own money into the race, as he has with his previous three elections. Far outspent, and with little money coming in from national Democrats until the last few weeks of the race, Murcarsel-Powell struggled to gain attention.\nWhile Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis wasn\u2019t on the ballot, he spent time campaigning against the abortion rights and marijuana amendments. DeSantis even used state agencies to fight the amendment, with the Agency for Health Care Administration set up a website and aired TV ads providing information on abortion and the Department of Health tried to stop television stations from airing a pro-amendment ad.\nThe abortion amendment would protect the rights of women to have an abortion up to the point the fetus can survive outside the womb. Florida now bans abortion six weeks after conception, when many women don\u2019t realize they are pregnant.\nVoters overwhelming approved medical marijuana in 2016. This year they\u2019re being asked to legalize recreational marijuana. The marijuana industry has spent tens of millions of dollars on the campaign, while DeSantis has raised money against it and criticized it often during official events.\nVery few, if any, of Florida\u2019s 28 congressional seats are competitive, but the state will elect at least one new member to Congress. Former Senate President Mike Haridopolos is favored to replace retiring Republican Rep. Bill Posey. He\u2019s being challenged by Democrat Sandy Kennedy in a strong Republican district.\nRepublicans will maintain firm control of the Legislature. Democrats will consider it a major victory if they flip enough seats to remove the supermajority GOP hold in the House and Senate.\nOne of the legislative seats being heavily targeted is held by Republican Sen. Corey Simon, a former Florida State and NFL football star who is being challenged by nationally known civil rights lawyer Daryl Parks, who is the former partner of civil rights lawyer Ben Crump."

      "text": "Teacher arrested for Arkansas double murder admits to killing married couple: Police\nClinton and Cristen Brink were killed in a state park, police said.\nA 28-year-old teacher has admitted to murdering the married couple found stabbed to death on a walking trail in an Arkansas park over the weekend in what appears to be a \"completely random\" attack, police said.\nAndrew James McGann, 28, of Springdale, Arkansas, was charged with two counts of capital murder in the killings of 43-year-old Clinton David Brink and his wife, 41-year-old Cristen Amanda Brink, Arkansas State Police announced Wednesday evening.\nThe Brinks were \"fatally attacked\" while out hiking with their two daughters at Devil's Den State Park on July 26, police said. The \"horrific\" assault occurred about a half mile into the park, with the husband attacked first, police said.\nThe children, ages 7 and 9, were not harmed in the incident thanks to the actions of their mother, police said.\n\"We believe that the mother took them to safety, and then returned to help her husband,\" Maj. Stacie Rhoads with the Arkansas State Police said during a press briefing Thursday.\nFollowing a dayslong manhunt for the suspect, McGann was arrested shortly before 5 p.m. local time Wednesday at a barbershop in Springdale, about 30 miles north of the park, police said.\nDuring an interview with police, he admitted to killing the couple, Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar said during Thursday's press briefing.\nDNA from blood recovered from the crime scene also matched McGann's DNA, Hagar said. The suspect had sustained cuts on his hands during a struggle with the victims, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation.\nItems recovered from his residence were \"consistent with being involved in this particular crime,\" Hagar said.\nMcGann had recently moved to the area from Oklahoma and had been hired to work at a local school, officials said.\nHe was hired to teach in the Springdale Public Schools district this upcoming school year but had not yet begun employment, according to the district's superintendent, Jared Cleveland.\n\"This individual has not at any time come into contact with Springdale students or the families we serve,\" Cleveland said in a statement, adding that no additional information is available at this time due to the ongoing investigation.\n\"Our entire team extends our deepest condolences to the Brink family. Their children are especially in our thoughts and prayers,\" he said.\nMcGann was a fifth grade teacher in Broken Arrows, Oklahoma, during the 2023-2024 school year, the school district said. He passed required background checks, a Broken Arrow Public Schools spokesperson said.\nThe prior school year, he was employed at an elementary school in Flower Mound, Texas, the Lewisville Independent School District confirmed. He was placed on administrative leave in the spring of 2023 \"following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgment, and student favoritism,\" and he ultimately resigned, the school district said.\n\"An internal investigation found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students,\" the school district added.\nAsked about a motive in the double homicide, Hagar said it remains under investigation, though he did say it appeared to be a \"completely random event.\"\n\"We have no reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspects and our victims,\" Hagar said.\nThe victims died from stab wounds, and the murder weapon was a knife, Hagar said Thursday. Knives were recovered from the residence's home, but it is unclear if any was the murder weapon, Rhoads said.\nHagar said police received over 500 tips and credited the public's help with bringing the suspect into custody.\nArkansas State Police had also released a composite sketch and photo from behind of a man who was seen in Devil's Den State Park on Saturday, the day of the killings. Police asked for the public's help in identifying the man, who they said was wanted for questioning in connection with the double homicide.\nPolice previously said the suspect was seen leaving the area of the park in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda, with a license plate covered by tape, police said. The vehicle description was \"critical\" in identifying the suspect, Rhoads said.\nThough he took steps to conceal his identity, the suspect was \"very sloppy,\" Rhoads said.\nOnce they identified the suspect, McGann was arrested within an hour at the barbershop, she said.\nPolice do not believe the suspect was trying to alter his appearance in getting a haircut, according to Rhoads, saying, \"Could chalk that up to school starts next week.\"\nThe Brinks had recently moved to Prairie Grove from North Dakota, police said.\nThe children are safe and in the custody of relatives, according to police.\n\"Our entire state is grieving for the tragic loss and senseless and horrific crime that's taken place,\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"One of the worst experiences that certainly I've ever had was making a phone call to the Brink family earlier this week. Nothing like that should ever have taken place.\"\nHagar said the Brinks were a loving couple, and credited their two young daughters with helping in the case, saying they are \"in awe\" of them.\n\"The information that they were able to provide to start us down this path, to be able to make this arrest, it all started with those two little girls,\" he said. \"It's incredible.\"\nHagar said the couple has a third daughter who wasn't at the trail that day.\n\"It is my intention to use the full weight of my office to bring this defendant to justice for the Brinks family,\" Brandon Carter, the prosecuting attorney for Washington County, said at Thursday's press briefing.\nThe prosecutor's office will not be waiving the death penalty in the case, Carter said.\nMcGann is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Friday, with an arraignment expected next week.\nAll trails at Devil's Den State Park, which were closed following the killings, will remain closed for now, Arkansas Secretary of Parks Shay Lewis said.\nABC News' Sasha Pezenik contributed to this report."
