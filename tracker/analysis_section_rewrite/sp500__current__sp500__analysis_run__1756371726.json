      "feedback": "Your draft is a good first pass but it falls short of a world‑class, 0–3 week horizon analysis. First, the causal chain is too diffuse – you mix Fed policy, Hong Kong equities, Amazon, Nintendo, Apple, and HUTCHMED in one paragraph. Narrow to the most material drivers for the next 2–3 weeks: (1) Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks (source T7HLAX8QN) and the immediate market reaction; (2) Amazon’s pilot launch data (source OHZD469JB) and its first quarterly sales figures; (3) Nintendo’s Q3 earnings and Switch 2 inventory build‑ups (source K2JWRPXRV); and (4) Apple’s Q2 earnings guidance (source E9KQQQ0FK). For each, state a clear price target range, key support/resistance levels (e.g., Amazon near $140–$150, Nintendo near $70–$80, Apple near $190–$210), and the specific catalyst that will trigger a move (e.g., Amazon’s first‑quarter used‑car revenue >$X million). Quantify expectations: Amazon’s pilot could lift revenue by 5–7 % YoY; Nintendo’s Switch 2 sales could push the stock 8–12 % if Q3 beats $Y million; Apple’s earnings could support a 3–5 % upside if guidance >$Z per share. Cite each figure with the source ID (e.g., “Amazon’s pilot sales are expected to reach $X million (OHZD469JB)”). Include a brief invalidation scenario: if Powell signals a rate hike, risk‑seeking sentiment could reverse, pulling the Hang Seng below 25,600 and dragging Amazon and Nintendo down. Finally, add a “watch next” list: Fed’s Jackson Hole remarks, Amazon’s Q1 used‑car sales release, Nintendo’s Q3 earnings, Apple’s Q2 earnings, and HUTCHMED’s ASCO presentation. This focused, data‑driven, and citation‑rich rewrite will meet the 0–3 week horizon requirement and provide actionable, high‑signal guidance.",
