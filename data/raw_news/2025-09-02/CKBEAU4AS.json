  "content": "In an early season showdown between two of the top girls volleyball teams in the state, Redondo Union took control over the last two sets to handle Marymount, 25-23, 18-25, 25-21, 25-14 and prove it is a threat for its first Southern Section championship since 2019.\n\nThe squads entered their nonleague matchup with a 22-1 combined record this fall and could meet again down the road with the stakes even higher. The Sea Hawks\u2019 triumph was all the more impressive given that it was accomplished without libero Rowan DeVore (sidelined with flu) and senior twins Avery and Addi Junk, who are skipping the indoor season to concentrate on beach volleyball, which both are committed to play at Florida State.\n\nCal commit Abby Zimmerman was almost unstoppable, pounding a match-high 26 kills, Leah Blair (committed to play beach at Washington) had 10 kills and UC Irvine-bound Taylor Boice added seven kills for the home side. Setter Marlo Libbey had 33 assists and served three aces.\n\nZimmerman led her school to the beach title in the spring.\n\n\u201cIndoor is my favorite and we\u2019ve put in so much work, it would be great to go out on top my last year,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cThis was a solid match for us and if we can bring the same energy and fight every game we have a good chance.\u201d\n\nBoth programs were coming off successful trips to Hawaii. Redondo Union finished runner-up to national power Byron Nelson (Texas) for the second straight season at the Ann Kang Invitational, while Marymount did not drop a set on its way to the Hawaiian Island Labor Day Classic championship Saturday in Hilo.\n\nJunior hitter Makenna Barnes had 16 kills, Washington commit Sammy Destler added 14, Olivia Penske had 36 assists and Declan Eastman recorded 11 digs for the Sailors, who were trying to avenge a five-set defeat in the first round of the CIF SoCal Open Division regionals last fall.\n\n\u201cI play on the same club team as Abby and Taylor\u2026 we\u2019re best friends,\u201d Destler said. \u201cThis was a much-needed wake-up call for us. We have practice at 5:45 a.m. tomorrow and I have to like it. Redondo\u2019s a whole different level than the teams we saw in Hawaii.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s nonleague match not only featured many of the Southland\u2019s most talented players, but also two of its most successful coaches in Redondo Union\u2019s Tommy Chaffins (who passed the 900 career wins milestone last year) and Marymount\u2019s Cari Klein (who has led her Sailors to 30 or more victories in three of the last four seasons).\n\nKlein said the trip back from Hawaii had a little drama as the plane had engine problems and had to divert to Oahu.\n\nMarymount was off to its hottest start since 2021 when it finished 35-0 en route to its 10th section title and seventh state crown under Klein and the No. 1 national ranking.\n\nThe schedule only gets tougher for Redondo Union (14-1), which travels to reigning Division 1 champion Mater Dei on Thursday and hosts 2022 champion Sierra Canyon next Tuesday. Marymount (9-1) will try to shake off its first loss Thursday when it hosts the Sea Hawks\u2019 Bay League rival, Mira Costa, on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very close on and off the court and we bonded even more in Hawaii,\u201d Boice said. \u201cTonight we simply wanted it more.\u201d",

      "text": "Bishop Montgomery forfeits 2025 football season amid ties to booster who paid parents\n- Share via\nBishop Montgomery has forfeited the remainder of the 2025 football season and reported more rule violations amid statements by a booster about his past activities paying parents of transfer players, the school announced Tuesday night.\nMike Hall will be the interim football coach while the Archdiocese of Los Angeles investigates why five Bishop Montgomery transfer students were declared ineligible for two years by the Southern Section for violating CIF bylaw 202, which involves submitting false information. The school announced it reported additional violations of the CIF transfer policy within the football program and continues to investigate the football program.\n\u201cWe recognize the gravity of this situation and we are deeply sorry for the lapse in oversight that resulted in violations of CIF-SS regulations,\u201d a letter released Tuesday signed by Bishop Montgomery principal Michele Starkey and school president Patrick Lee read. \u201cWe are instituting corrective actions aimed at ensuring compliance and preventing such issues in the future.\u201d\nThe decision was handed down a day after Brett Steigh, a 1992 Narbonne High graduate, booster, local businessman and gambler, said during an appearance on the \u201cFattal Factor\u201d podcast that he paid parents to secure transfers for Narbonne and St. Bernard before currently \u201chelping\u201d Bishop Montgomery. Narbonne in Harbor City is part of the Los Angeles Unified School District, while the Archdiocese of Los Angeles operates St. Bernard in Playa del Rey and Bishop Montgomery in Torrance.\nWhile name, image and likeness policies allow for payment of players, recruiting transfer athletes and paying their parents as much as $50,000 remains a violation of the California Interscholastic Federation\u2019s undue influence rules.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t doing nothing that others aren\u2019t doing,\u201d Steigh said, alleging Orange County private schools, including national powerhouse Mater Dei, paid to secure transfer players.\nA Mater Dei spokesperson has not yet responded to a request for comment in response to the allegation.\nSteigh said he recruited players in 2018 and 2024 to Narbonne without the knowledge of the head coaches while paying parents to move. Both times, Narbonne was sanctioned by the City Section for rule violations.\nIf Bishop Montgomery were to cancel the remainder of its season, players on the team could seek hardship waivers to play elsewhere.\nHe said he met with St. Bernard President Carter Paysinger in 2020 and agreed to support that school after former Narbonne coach Manuel Douglas took over the program. Douglas told The Times on Tuesday the payments reached close to $1 million between funding tuition for incoming freshman football players and improvements at the school. Douglas said school administrators were aware of the contributions.\nDouglas and Steigh became the subject of FBI and IRS investigations after Douglas failed to report donations from Steigh and didn\u2019t pay taxes on them. Steigh said they didn\u2019t face any charges. Douglas resigned in 2020 and St. Bernard shut down its football program in 2021, 2022 and 2023.\nSteigh said he has now been \u201csupporting\u201d Bishop Montgomery with the knowledge of Lee.\nMore than 20 transfers joined Bishop Montgomery\u2019s football program during the offseason. After five Bishop Montgomery transfers were declared ineligible by the Southern Section, the school announced on Saturday it had fired head football coach Ed Hodgkiss.\nBishop Montgomery received numerous football transfers in the offseason. The Southern Section has reviewed the paperwork and declared five players ineligible.\nIn a text message to The Times, Lee denied any connection to Steigh.\n\u201cWhat he said was an outright lie,\u201d Lee said. \u201cNeither the principal nor I ever met this man, spoke to him, emailed him, texted him \u2014 nothing.\u201d\nThe City and Southern Section commissioners are aware of the statements Steigh made during the podcast, with one telling The Times they are reviewing them.\nSteigh said he agreed to appear on reporter Tarek Fattal\u2019s podcast because he felt it was wrong that Hodgkiss \u2014 the Bishop Montgomery football coach \u2014 was fired.\nBishop Montgomery pulls out of a scheduled Friday game against the Monarchs after problems in Hawaii.\n\u201cPat knew what the deal was and now he\u2019s backing away. Not fair,\u201d Steigh said, referring to the Bishop Montgomery president.\nHodgkiss told The Times he has been advised by legal counsel not to answer any questions.\nA Bishop Montgomery parent wrote in a letter to The Times that football transfers joining the program were given preferential treatment.\n\u201cReturning players were demoted, excluded from trips or quit,\u201d the parent wrote. \u201cArchdiocesan Catholic values appear secondary to short-term athletic exposure. Despite my June outreach to the school, no reply ever came.\u201d\nIn the spring, The Times asked Starkey, the Bishop Montgomery principal, if she was aware of any involvement by Steigh in Bishop Montgomery\u2019s program. She said no.\nWhen Steigh was asked during the podcast why he would risk players\u2019 eligibility by getting involved at Bishop Montgomery, he said he felt previous administrations he worked with didn\u2019t have the backbone to succeed at recruiting players.\n\u201cThey told us it wouldn\u2019t be ... sorry I shouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d Steigh said of Bishop Montgomery\u2019s leadership. \u201cThey\u2019re basically supporting to win right now.\u201d\nWhen pressed for more details, Steigh said, \u201cI can\u2019t comment on any players at Bishop Montgomery.\u201d\nHe said he has now decided to retire from supporting high school football programs.\nSteigh said he previously was a traditional booster at Narbonne, making donations to help pay for helmets, uniforms and a washing machine.\n\u201cIn 2018, I decided to play the game that everyone else was playing,\u201d Steigh said. \u201cThe head coach at the time did not want to do this. It was all on me. I lied to him. These players just showed up. Why? I wanted to compete with the private schools. I felt it was unfair public schools being left behind.\u201d\nFour coaches of Marine League schools forfeited games against Narbonne last season while demanding a City Section investigation into whether transfers were paid to play for the school.\n\u201cAll these rumors through all these years, it\u2019s all true,\u201d Steigh said. \u201cIt was all me.\u201d"
