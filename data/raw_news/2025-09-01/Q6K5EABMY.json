  "title": "Cheniere Energy Partners: The LP Vs. The Master (LNG) (NYSE:CQP)",
  "description": "Cheniere Energy offers better long-term return potential than CQP, which has a secure 5.9% yield but limited growth. Find out why CQP stock is a hold.",
  "content": "The LP units of Cheniere Energy Partners ( CQP ) are down ~18% from April's pre-\"Liberation Day\" high of nearly $68 (see chart below). That is in stark contrast to the stock price of the master of this MLP: Cheniere Energy (\n\nMichael Fitzsimmons is a retired electronics engineer and avid investor. He advises investors to construct a well-diversified portfolio built on a core foundation of a high-quality low-cost S&P500 fund. For investors who can tolerate short-term risks, he advises an over-weight position in the technology sector, which he believes is still in the early stages of a long-term secular bull-market. For dividend income, and as a 4th generation oil & gas man, Fitzsimmons suggests investors consider a position in large O&G companies that provide strong dividend income and dividend growth. Fitzsimmons' articles on portfolio management recommend a top-down capital allocation approach that is aligned with each individual investor's personal situation (i.e. age, retired/working, risk tolerance, income, net worth, goals, etc) and might include allocations into investment categories such as the S&P500, technology, dividend income, sector ETFs, growth, speculative growth, gold, and cash.\n\nAnalyst\u2019s Disclosure:I/we have no stock, option or similar derivative position in any of the companies mentioned, and no plans to initiate any such positions within the next 72 hours.
