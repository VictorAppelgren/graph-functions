  "content": "NKULAGIRIRE, Uganda (AP) \u2014 Past a smoldering pile of trash and two bleating goats, through a doorway beginning to buckle beneath the weight of the bricks above, is a darkened room where a skeletal, 70-year-old man lies on a pillowless bed above a floor littered with trash.\n\nThe lone window\u2019s shutters are closed but enough shards of sun make it through holes in the corroded roof to see Joseph Malagho\u2019s ribs poke at the skin of his torso and legs like twigs inside his olive green pants. As he struggles to sit up, leaves crinkle beneath him on a soiled sheet. His mattress sags. The air is thick and stale.\n\nMalagho has no illusions about the difficulty of growing old. But the fact that he is here at all is its own miracle.\n\nAcross Africa, millions who once faced the death sentence of an HIV infection have survived only to face something nearly as daunting: old age.\n\nAs infections have dropped markedly and antiretroviral drugs have reduced mortality, the turnaround of the AIDS crisis has helped build Africa\u2019s longevity revolution. Lives that were expected to be cut short instead continued decades more, changing the demographics of those facing the disease and fueling the rush of people encountering health systems that were never built for old age.\n\nMalagho isn\u2019t sure when he was infected, but he was diagnosed about five years ago. His health has steadily declined since. He has tuberculosis now, too, and can barely stand.\n\nThere is barely any soap for his wife to wash him with a rag. His lone source of entertainment, a small radio, has gone dead, and there\u2019s no money for batteries. He has lost most of his teeth and can\u2019t afford dentures, but there is little food to eat anyway.\n\nHe urinates into a small white bucket and his wife hurls it outside just as the first drops of rain begin to strafe the roof and start leaking to the space below.\n\nThe organization distributes food and medicine to many of its beneficiaries and helps repair homes, install water tanks and provide basic items, like a bed for seniors who are sleeping on dirt floors. But there are limits to what it can do and Nabanoba feels helpless as she stands before Malagho.\n\nShe promises him batteries for his radio and exits the home. Sometimes, after visiting him, colleagues will ask her why she\u2019s quiet and she\u2019ll slink off to cry.",

  "argos_summary": "In Uganda, a 70\u2011year\u2011old HIV survivor, Joseph Malagho, illustrates the new challenge of aging among people living with HIV, a demographic shift driven by effective antiretroviral therapy. While the drugs have turned a once\u2011death sentence into a chronic condition, many, like Malagho, now confront severe health decline, tuberculosis, and inadequate support for basic needs such as food, medicine, and housing. Local NGOs provide limited assistance\u2014food, medicine, and home repairs\u2014but the health system remains ill\u2011prepared for the growing elderly HIV population. The story highlights the broader demographic and systemic strain as Africa\u2019s HIV survivors age.",
