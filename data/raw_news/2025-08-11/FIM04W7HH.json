  "title": "Fleeing Texas Lawmakers May Put Protections for Women, Young Girls at Risk",
  "description": "Texas lawmakers' actions risk vital protections for women and young girls amidst political drama.",
  "content": "While many national media outlets are focused on the soap-operatic drama of Democrat lawmakers fleeing the state of Texas to deny a quorum to conduct business, one plotline is being overlooked.\n\nThose lawmakers are ostensibly abandoning their posts to prevent what they deem to be \u201cgerrymandering\u201d of U.S. House districts. Unencumbered by self-awareness or any sense of irony, some chose to visit Illinois, the home of some of the most absurdly gerrymandered congressional districts in America, as at least some have noted. Missing from the media coverage and the public\u2019s attention, though, is the fact that the fleeing lawmakers are jeopardizing two much-needed legislative efforts to protect women and young girls.\n\nThe first is HB 32 and its Senate companion, SB 7. These bills protect the privacy of women and young girls in intimate female spaces. The bill is a commonsense solution to the growing problem of men who assert a female identity demanding access to spaces where women change clothes, shower, sleep, and use the restroom. The Texas Legislature should join other states in ensuring that the law reflects reality: we are created male and female. And dignity for all means respecting this fact.\n\nOur sex is immutable and written into every cell of our body. And the differences between the two sexes necessitate separate restrooms, changing areas, and sleeping quarters to protect the safety and privacy of young girls and women. Yet the proposals also accommodate anyone who feels uncomfortable using multi-user facilities consistent with their sex by encouraging the creation of single-user spaces.\n\nWithout action, the Texas Legislature is sacrificing the safety and dignity of women and young girls in their most vulnerable spaces. This is an urgent issue, especially in prisons and shelters that house many women who have endured terrible abuse. Due to its size and population, Texas is an important \u201claboratory of democracy.\u201d Other states can observe policy decisions made in Texas and their impact, to inform policy decisions around the country. This is an important responsibility for Texas and a reason for all Americans to pay attention.\n\nTexas lawmakers and parents would never look their daughters in the eyes and tell them that they must expose themselves and be exposed to a man against their will. Yet failure to act on this bill would do just that. Texas strives to be a leader on the national stage on a host of issues but currently lags woefully behind on protecting women\u2019s privacy. Nineteen states have laws similar to the proposed legislation in Texas\u2014including Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida. Even the left-leaning U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the constitutionality of Idaho\u2019s girls\u2019 privacy law. It is past time for Texas to take action on this issue.\n\nThe second bill pending in the special session that would protect the safety of women and girls is the Mother and Child Protection Act, which addresses the well-documented dangers of abortion drugs. Despite strong pro-life laws, out-of-state abortionists are flooding Texas with abortion pills, exploiting loopholes in federal and state law to bypass our protections. According to a recent study by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, one in 10 women who take mifepristone (one of the two drugs used for chemical abortions that would be regulated by the bill) experience serious adverse effects. Those who do have little to no legal recourse.\n\nThis bill creates robust legal remedies for every child and mother injured by abortion drugs and extends liability across state lines to overcome out-of-state laws that \u201cshield\u201d abortion drug providers who unlawfully ship these compounds into Texas.\n\nThe measure imposes strict liability on every abortion drug distributor in the chain of distribution, including the drug manufacturers, but also provides an affirmative defense for those who unknowingly distributed the drugs and took reasonable precautions to avoid doing so. And women who take abortion drugs are exempted from liability.\n\nIn the rough and tumble world of Texas politics, partisan gamesmanship can often distract public attention and legislative action from issues with real-world impact. This special session is no exception. Texas lawmakers have a short window of opportunity to act on legislation to protect the health, safety, and privacy of women and girls. And that\u2019s exactly what they should do.\n\n\n\nLathan Watts is the vice president of public affairs for Alliance Defending Freedom (@ADFLegal) and its sister organization ADF Action.

      "text": "Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) likely thought the investigation into his mortgage payments would be annoying, but winnable. It\u2019d cost him a ton in legal fees, but he\u2019d come out unscathed\u2014that\u2019s how most political class types operate. Allegations of treason and fighting that charge, well, that\u2019s a whole new ballgame. Mr. Schiff better get a lawyer because the 302 report that FBI Director Kash Patel declassified tonight is wild.\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING NEWS: A Democrat whistleblower claims Adam Schiff authorized leaking classified information to smear Donald Trump.\n\u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) August 12, 2025\nThe Russia hoax scandal just got bigger. pic.twitter.com/Rgut8B3n9e\nAgain, it's no surprise that our suspicions about the Russian collusion hoax are now being corroborated by the trove of declassified documents released by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and now Director Patel, but the details remain jarring. Schiff\u2019s actions in this report, brought forward by a Democratic whistleblower, show a reckless disregard for handling classified information. The California liberal essentially announced to his staff he was going to leak sensitive information to smear Donald Trump. Some rightly said such an action was treasonous, whereas others urged it, adding they\u2019d never get caught. As the saying goes, everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth (via Fox News):\nThese allegations from the Dem whistleblower are WILD.\n\u2014 Clandestine (@WarClandestine) August 12, 2025\nSchiff called a staff meeting, told everyone he was going to leak classified intelligence to harm Trump, someone pointed out that\u2019s treason, other staffers said not to worry about it because they won\u2019t get caught\u2026\nWHAT?! pic.twitter.com/3OuiYb7k4g\nRecommended\nA Democratic whistleblower told the FBI that Adam Schiff approved leaking classified information in order to discredit President Donald Trump, according to newly-released documents.\nThe documents, which were obtained by Just The News, were recently handed over to Congress by FBI Director Kash Patel.\nThe whistleblower reportedly worked for Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee for over ten years, and reported Schiff's alleged behavior to the FBI in 2017.\nAccording to the report, the intelligence staffer called the leaking \"treasonous\" and \"illegal,\" in addition to being unethical. He was most recently interviewed by the FBI in 2023.\nThe staffer also said that he personally attended a meeting where Schiff greenlit the leak.\n\"When working in this capacity, [redacted staffer's name] was called to an all-staff meeting by SCHIFF,\" the documents state, per Just The News.\n[\u2026]\n\"[The whistleblower] stated this would be illegal and, upon hearing his concerns, unnamed members of the meeting reassured that they would not be caught leaking classified information,\" the report added.\nSchiff always came off as a sanctimonious goober when discussing this topic. He even reportedly worked with the Ukraine whistleblower to get the impeachment circus started. We\u2019re dealing with traitors who must be destroyed. I don\u2019t care about verdicts or convictions\u2014I want indictments.\nThe process is the punishment. Schiff will likely have to sell both homes to pay his legal bills.\nDear @AdamSchiff:\n\u2014 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Mike Davis \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@mrddmia) August 12, 2025\nDoes the U.S. Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause provide you congressional immunity from criminal prosecution under the Espionage Act?\nGuess we'll find out. https://t.co/GiSBWTEpbs\nEditor\u2019s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?
