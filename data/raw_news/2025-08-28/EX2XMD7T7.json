  "description": "Many Parker-Hannifin Corporation ( NYSE:PH ) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest...",
  "content": "Many Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nParker-Hannifin Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President & COO, Andrew Ross, for US$3.2m worth of shares, at about US$733 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$768, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 20% of Andrew Ross's holding.\n\nIn the last year Parker-Hannifin insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\n\nSee our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin\n\nI will like Parker-Hannifin better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Parker-Hannifin. In total, insiders dumped US$13m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Parker-Hannifin insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$228m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling.

  "argos_summary": "Parker\u2011Hannifin insiders have sold roughly $13\u202fmillion of shares in the last three months, with no purchases recorded, suggesting a possible view that the stock is overvalued or that the company\u2019s valuation is at a peak. The largest single sale was by President & COO Andrew Ross for $3.2\u202fmillion at $733 per share, below the current price of $768. The article also notes that Trump\u2019s 2025 \u201cunleash\u201d energy policy is expected to benefit midstream operators such as Williams, Kinder Morgan, and others by accelerating pipeline and storage projects. Overall, the insider activity signals caution for investors, while the broader energy sector may see upside from the new policy environment.",
