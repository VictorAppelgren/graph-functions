  "description": "The \"oracle\" cryptocurrency just secured a major partnership.",
  "content": "Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) is on the rise. As of 5:11 p.m. ET today, it was up 9.4% from Monday at 4:00 p.m. The rise comes as the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and Bitcoin gained 0.7%.\n\nChain Link, an \"oracle\" token that helps bridge the gap between real-world information and crypto blockchains, is teaming up with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe partnership will see ICE's consolidated feed, which pulls data from more than 300 exchanges and marketplaces worldwide, integrated into Chainlink's data streams., This will bring critical financial data to more than 2,000 blockchain applications and financial institutions that interact with the blockchain.\n\nCrypto projects now have access to data of the same quality and real-time speed that traditional finance organizations have enjoyed. Chain Link believes this will help lay the groundwork for large-scale tokenization of assets like precious metals and, more generally, blur the lines between traditional finance and crypto.\n\nICE's Global Data Delivery VP Maurisa Baumann said the partnership will bring \"trusted, structured multi-asset class data\" to crypto platforms and drive crypto adoption in capital markets.\n\nThings are looking up for Chainlink\n\nWhile Chainlink's price is still heavily tied to broader sentiment in the crypto world, this is a major step in ensuring it has long-term value outside of crypto. Institutional integration is key for crypto projects that want to grow beyond the limitations of the crypto market.",

      "text": "2025 Cryptocurrency Investor Trends Survey\nKEY POINTS\n- Bitcoin Hits $100K: Bitcoin reaching $100,000 boosts interest among existing crypto investors, especially young males.\n- Trump-Musk Influence: Trump's re-election and Musk's involvement lead 50% of respondents to expect positive crypto market performance in 2025.\n- Crypto Skepticism Barriers: Lack of knowledge, buying difficulties, and security concerns deter potential new investors.\nCryptocurrency is once again in the spotlight with Bitcoin hitting a record high of $109,500 in May and the Trump administration taking a friendlier approach to the industry.\nMotley Fool Money's 2025 Cryptocurrency Investor Trends Survey shows interest in crypto is strong -- 21% of respondents to Motley Fool Money's survey own crypto. That's 1 in 5 American adults who own crypto in 2025. This tracks with a separate survey conducted by the National Cryptocurrency Association and Harris Poll finding that 21% of U.S. adults (55 million people) own crypto.\nOverall, 42% of respondents to Motley Fool Money's crypto survey said they're likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next year -- in line with the general level of enthusiasm recorded in 2024.\nRead on to understand the most important trends in the crypto space, as the industry enters a pivotal moment.\nBitcoin hitting $100,000, Trump's return to office buoys crypto enthusiasm\nPresident Donald Trump's re-election and Bitcoin crossing $100,000 in December 2024 gave respondents, particularly those that already own cryptocurrency, reason to be bullish about the industry.\n- Bitcoin crossing $100,000: 48% percent of respondents said they're more likely to invest in crypto in light of Bitcoin being valued at more than $100,000 at one point in December 2024.\n- The Trump-Musk effect: 50% of all respondents say that the cryptocurrency market will perform positively in 2025 given President Trump's re-election and Elon Musk potentially serving as an advisor. Just 13% think crypto will do poorly in 2025, and the remaining 37% think the market won't change much.\nEnthusiasm shrinks and grows depending on respondents' generation, gender, and whether they've ever invested in crypto.\nBitcoin hit a new all-time record of $109,500 in May.\nHow Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is influencing investors\nThirty percent of respondents who have never invested in crypto say Bitcoin crossing $100,000 makes them more likely to invest in crypto, compared to 85% of those who currently own crypto and 83% who are invested in crypto through an ETF.\nA slight majority of male respondents, 54%, say Bitcoin hitting the $100,000 threshold makes them more likely to invest compared to 42% of female respondents. That division tracks with general sentiment towards cryptocurrency investing.\nYounger generations are more likely to be bullish on crypto due to Bitcoin's rise in 2024. Fifty-six percent of Gen Z and 62% of millennial respondents say they're more likely to buy crypto as a result, compared to 46% of Gen X and just 27% of baby boomers. Those results are again in line with how enthusiasm for crypto investing shakes out among generations.\nPotential crypto investors may be more willing to get off the sidelines with Bitcoin setting a new record high of $109,500 in late May.\nTrump and Musk's influence on how investors view crypto\nBitcoin jumped to over $109,000 the day after President Trump was sworn in for his second term, a reflection of the expectation that his administration will be friendly towards cryptocurrencies.\nThat view is shared by 50% of respondents in Motley Fool Money's 2025 Cryptocurrency Investor Trends Survey and an overwhelming share -- 82% -- of respondents that are current crypto investors. Just 13% of all respondents think crypto will do poorly in 2025.\nMen and younger generations are more optimistic about how cryptocurrency will perform with Trump in the Oval Office and Elon Musk being in his orbit. Sixty percent of male respondents said they think crypto will perform positively in 2025 in light of those factors, compared to 41% of female respondents. And nearly 60% of Gen Z and millennial respondents see crypto doing well in 2025 compared to 46% of Gen X and 39% of baby boomers.\nRespondents who devoted more of their portfolio to crypto are more bullish on how crypto will fare in 2025 with Trump and Musk in positions of power. Among crypto owners with 10% or less of their portfolio in crypto, 69% think 2025 will be a strong year for crypto. That percentage jumps to 83% among those whose portfolios are 10% to 25% crypto, and to 90% among those whose portfolios are at least 50% crypto.\n68% of crypto investors think Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025\nSixty-eight percent of respondents that are invested in cryptocurrency believe Bitcoin will essentially double in 2025 to hit $200,000.\nThose who don't own crypto are more skeptical -- 25% of respondents in that group think it's likely Bitcoin will reach $200,00, while 49% are uncertain and 26% think it's unlikely.\nAmong crypto investors, optimism grows dramatically based on how much of their portfolio is composed of cryptocurrency. Forty-six percent of respondents that own crypto and have 10% or less of their portfolio made up of crypto think Bitcoin will hit $200,000 in 2025 compared to 76% of those whose portfolios are 10% to 25% crypto and 90% of those whose portfolios are 75% crypto or more.\nAs with other measures of crypto bullishness, men and younger generations are more likely to think Bitcoin will cross the $200,000 threshold in 2025. Forty-three percent of male respondents said they think it would, compared to 37% of female respondents. 54% of Gen Z and 52% of millennial respondents believe Bitcoin will rise to $200,00 compared to 35% of Gen X and 21% of baby boomer respondents.\n42% say they're likely to buy crypto in the next year\nForty-two percent of respondents to Motley Fool Money's Cryptocurrency Investor Trends Survey said they are somewhat likely or very likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next year. That's a percentage lower than 2023's record high.\nTwenty percent said they are very likely, while 22% said they are somewhat likely.\nCrypto ownership by generation\nYounger generations are leading the way in crypto adoption. According to recent data, ownership is highest among Millennials and Gen Z, highlighting a generational shift in financial behavior and digital asset engagement. Here's how crypto ownership stacks up by generation:\n- Gen Z: 26%\n- Millennials: 37%\n- Gen X: 18%\n- Baby Boomers: 9%\nThe majority of those likely to buy crypto have already invested\nWhile interest in cryptocurrency among respondents is high, most of it is coming from respondents who already own cryptocurrency either directly or through an ETF. Those respondents were much more likely to say that they're likely to invest in crypto in the coming year.\nAmong respondents who have never owned cryptocurrency, just 2% said they're very likely to buy next year, and only 14% said they're somewhat likely. Eighty-four percent said they're unlikely to purchase crypto in the coming year.\nOn the other hand, 66% of respondents who currently own crypto and 67% who have invested in a crypto ETF said they're very likely to buy more this year.\nRespondents who previously owned cryptocurrency but don't hold any right now are somewhat interested in buying this year. Sixteen percent of that group say they're very likely to invest this year, 44% are somewhat likely, 26% are somewhat unlikely, and 14% are very unlikely.\nMen and younger respondents are more likely to buy crypto than women and older respondents\nMale respondents, particularly Gen Z and millennials, are much more likely than women to own cryptocurrency and be interested in investing in it in the future.\nThat demographic trend has been repeatedly observed, including by Pew, JPMorgan Chase, and Morning Consult.\nAs Bitcoin has rallied to a new high, the industry's ability to expand beyond the young male demographic will be instructive as to whether its growth is sustainable and if volatility can be reined in.\nRecord high 81% of crypto owners view it as investment\nA record high 81% of respondents who own cryptocurrency view crypto as an investment. Most respondents don't own crypto to make secure payments or because they think it will replace currencies -- despite those being among the most hyped alleged use cases for cryptocurrencies.\nWhether the shift in crypto owners' attitudes is a boon or dampener for the industry remains to be seen. Much of the initial attraction to crypto was driven by the idea that it could become a global currency and vehicle for secure payments. Those ideas have been slow to take hold while retail investors and now financial institutions increasingly see cryptocurrencies as just another investment class.\nThe top reasons why crypto skeptics won't invest\nThe most-cited reasons why respondents who don't own cryptocurrency haven't invested are not knowing what to do with it (36%), not understanding how to buy crypto (33%), and security concerns (31%).\nTwenty-two percent of respondents who don't own cryptocurrency haven't invested because they don't think it will generate a good return. That's despite Bitcoin hitting record highs. Nineteen percent think crypto is too expensive to buy.\nTwenty-three percent of non-investors won't buy crypto because they think it's a scam and another 22% haven't invested due to the lack of a clear regulatory framework for crypto. Those concerns are likely fueled by crypto's scandal-filled 2023 which may have tarnished its reputation for a slice of the public.\nNo single reason drives crypto skepticism, which suggests that the industry will have to overcome multiple barriers to attract new retail investors. The most-cited obstacles are fundamental and signal that there's a trust gap that will need to be bridged for new investors to enter the market.\n40% would consider investing in crypto through their retirement account\nForty percent of respondents would consider investing in cryptocurrency through their retirement account, down from 44% in 2024 despite Bitcoin hitting record levels.\nThe decline in interest may be attributable to crypto's volatility and the slew of scams, scandals, and security concerns that rocked the industry -- the most notable being the collapse of FTX and revelations of fraud perpetrated by its founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\nThe respondents most interested in adding crypto to their 401(k)s and IRAs are current and previous crypto investors, those with investment portfolios tilted towards crypto, millennials, Gen Z, and men. Non-owners, women, and older generations are least likely to be interested in putting crypto in their retirement funds.\nBeing able to store crypto in a bank account may encourage some to invest\nFifty-six percent of respondents, including 39% of those who have never owned crypto, said that being able to store crypto in their bank account would make them consider investing. That suggests that safety, security, and regulation are keys to bringing new investors into the crypto space.\nStill, the percentage of respondents who would consider buying crypto if they could put it in their bank account is down from 62% in 2022 and 70% in 2021, indicating that crypto's integration with more stable financial institutions isn't a golden ticket to adding investors.\n86% of crypto owners would consider a credit card with crypto rewards\nCrypto credit cards unsurprisingly draw serious interest from crypto investors and some interest from those who have never invested. Twenty-nine percent of that group would consider a credit card that provides crypto rewards.\nThat suggests that crypto credit cards could be an entry point for some crypto skeptics.\nThere are a limited number of crypto credit cards and they are unique in that rewards may be taxable if a gain is realized from them.\nConfidence in crypto understanding is on the decline\nEleven percent of respondents claim to understand how cryptocurrency works \"very well,\" down from 18% in 2024 and 24% in 2022. A record high 38% said they don't understand how crypto works at all, up from 33% in 2024 and 19% in 2022.\nCrypto owners, men, and millennials are most confident about their crypto knowledge, while women and older respondents were more likely to say they have no or little understanding. It would appear that those groups are following the wisdom of only investing in what they understand.\n69% think the government hasn't done enough to regulate crypto\nGovernment regulation of crypto is a hot button topic that divides crypto holders, 61% of whom believe there's enough regulation now, and 83% of non-owners believe that there isn't enough government regulation. Among all respondents, 69% think the government hasn't done enough to regulate cryptocurrencies.\nRespondents who previously owned crypto but don't currently hold any may feel as though they were spurned by insufficient regulation. Sixty-two percent of those respondents don't think there's enough regulation. This is one of the few topics for which that group breaks with current crypto investors.\nEven among crypto owners, those who are least invested want to see more government regulation. Among those whose portfolios are 10% or less crypto, 41% think the government has done enough to regulate cryptocurrencies. That percentage jumps to 64% among those whose portfolios are 10% to 25% crypto, and up to 74% for those whose portfolios are 25% to 50% crypto.\nThe debate over cryptocurrency regulation in the United States centers on whether crypto assets can be considered securities, which would subject them to the same regulations as stocks and other securities. In a blow to proponents of regulation, a district court of appeals in 2023 ruled that cryptocurrency functioned as a security when sold to institutions, but not when traded on exchanges.\nInterest in crypto remains, but the biggest boosters are already invested\nRetail investors surveyed by Motley Fool Money showed near-record interest in crypto, but there are signs that the industry is struggling to grow its pool of investors beyond Gen Z and millennial males.\nConsecutive surveys from Motley Fool Money show that Gen Z and millennial men remain most enthusiastic towards crypto while women, Gen X, and baby boomers are still skeptical of investing. That's despite two developments that could make investors more bullish about cryptocurrency's future: Bitcoin reaching the $100,000 threshold and President Trump returning to the White House with a promise of being a \"crypto president,\" accompanied by Elon Musk as a potential advisor.\nThose findings are consistent with survey results from Pew, which found that interest in crypto among new investors has remained stagnant for years, and that trust remains a significant obstacle to more widespread investment. Morning Consult's quarterly cryptocurrency adoption tracker also shows that the share of adults who own crypto has remained essentially level for years. A 2025 survey from the National Cryptocurrency Association and The Harris Poll found that 21% of American adults, roughly 55 million people, own crypto, and that ownership skews younger and male.\nIntegrating cryptocurrency with existing, trusted financial institutions and products like banks and credit cards could help some overcome their crypto skepticism, but isn't a silver bullet for mass adoption.\nSustainable, long-term, and less-volatile growth in the crypto industry may depend on whether it can correct its demographic imbalance and show would-be investors that crypto is secure, easy to buy, and has real value beyond speculation.\nSources\n- JPMorgan Chase (2022). \"The Dynamics and Demographics of U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use.\"\n- Morning Consult (2025). \"Tracking Trends in Cryptocurrency.\"\n- The National Cryptocurrency Association (2025). \"2025 State of the Crypto Holders Report.\"\n- Pew (2024). \"Majority of Americans aren't confident in the safety and reliability of cryptocurrency.\"\nMethodology\nMotley Fool Money distributed surveys via Pollfish on Jan. 3, 2025, March 6, 2024, May 25, 2022, and May 6, 2021. Results were post-stratified to generate nationally representative data based on age and gender. Pollfish employs organic random device engagement sampling, a method that recruits respondents through a randomized invitation process across various digital platforms. This technique helps to minimize selection bias and ensure a diverse participant pool. Each survey was composed of 2,000 adult Americans.\nOur Research Expert\nWe're firm believers in the Golden Rule, which is why editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed, approved, or endorsed by included advertisers.

      "text": "Chainlink (CRYPTO:LINK) is a decentralized blockchain oracle network. A blockchain oracle is a service that transfers real-world data to smart contracts (programs running on blockchains). Chainlink allows smart contracts to quickly and securely connect to data sources.\nIt's an important service, and it gives Chainlink a wide range of use cases across many different industries. Read our full Chainlink guide to learn more about how it works and why it's one of the best cryptocurrency investments.\nWhat makes Chainlink unique?\nWhat makes Chainlink unique?\nThe reason Chainlink is so useful is that it connects smart contracts on blockchains to real-world data and events.\nSmart contracts are blockchain programs that self-execute when specific conditions are met. They're one of the most widely used blockchain tools, and blockchain platforms capable of running smart contracts are extremely popular. But they have a limitation referred to as the blockchain oracle problem. They can't interact with off-chain data or any information not on the blockchain.\nBlockchain oracles solve that problem. An oracle is a bridge that brings a smart contract the data it needs. It's also important that the smart contract receives accurate data, and that's where the Chainlink Oracle Network comes in.\nChainlink is made up of various decentralized oracle networks. Each network consists of multiple blockchain oracles that retrieve and validate data. This allows smart contracts using Chainlink to get data from tens to hundreds of oracle nodes and aggregate the result instead of relying on a single oracle.\nBeyond connecting smart contracts to data, Chainlink's ambitious version 2.0 expands its set of services to include connecting smart contracts with off-chain computation, payments, and events. With the expansion of off-chain functionality, Chainlink sees the evolution of a whole new class of \"hybrid\" smart contracts -- and with Chainlink nodes in the middle of it all.\nChainlink also cleverly expands its ecosystem by enabling data providers to sell their data directly to blockchain applications (on any blockchain) simply by connecting their application programming interface (API).\nWhere Chainlink came from\nWhere Chainlink came from\nSergey Nazarov, Steve Ellis, and Ari Juels published the original Chainlink white paper and began developing the project in September 2017. They also held an initial coin offering (ICO) that month, selling 350 million LINK tokens (35% of the total supply) and raising $32 million.\nChainlink launched its network in May 2019. The project is managed by a corporation registered in the Cayman Islands, Smartcontract Chainlink, Ltd., and the Chainlink Labs organization.\nHow Chainlink works\nHow Chainlink works\nAlthough Chainlink is in a multi-year process of expanding its oracle features, the way it currently provides data to blockchain applications works like this: When a user needs off-chain data through Chainlink for their smart contract, they put out a request. The Chainlink protocol responds by creating a service-level agreement (SLA). The SLA includes three sub-contracts, each with its own function:\n- Chainlink Reputation Contract: Reviews oracles' reputation scores and discards any that are unreliable.\n- Chainlink Order-Matching Contract: Brings the request to oracles, takes bids, and selects the oracles that will handle the request.\n- Chainlink Aggregating Contract: Receives that data from the oracles and validates it. For example, if most oracles provide one response, but two provide other information, it will discard the responses of those two oracles.\nChainlink isn't limited to oracles that are part of its network. It can also gather data from outside oracles using its Chainlink Core software and external adapters. Here's how they work:\n- Chainlink Core: Reads the request and routes it to a Chainlink node.\n- External Adapter: Connects the node with an external data source and translates requests from a blockchain programming language to a real-world programming language.\nUsers pay Chainlink node operators (which deliver off-chain data) in LINK tokens. Node operators set the prices for their services.\nChainlink nodes also need to stake LINK, meaning they lock up those tokens on the blockchain as collateral. The amount of LINK a node has staked is one factor in its reputation score. If a node is unreliable or dishonest, the Chainlink protocol taxes its LINK stake. This helps ensure that nodes provide accurate information.\nPartnerships\nPartnerships\nBecause it provides such a valuable and essential service, Chainlink has built up a massive list of partners, including many of the biggest blockchain networks, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and crypto games. Here are some of the major blockchain networks that are using Chainlink:\n- Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH)\n- Cardano (ADA 8.49%)\n- Solana (CRYPTO:SOL)\n- Polkadot (DOT 7.16%)\n- Terra (CRYPTO:LUNA)\nOne of the most notable companies working with Chainlink is Alphabet (GOOGL 1.14%) (GOOG 1.25%), which decided to use Chainlink for its Google Cloud service. The partnership involves Google putting its BigQuery data on the blockchain through Chainlink.\nA major Chainlink partner in the crypto industry is the Binance crypto exchange. It uses Chainlink to connect its data to blockchain platforms.\nKeep in mind that those are just a small selection of some important connections made by Chainlink. The Chainlink ecosystem contains more than 1,000 partnerships and collaborations.\nCan I make passive income with Chainlink?\nCan I make passive income with Chainlink?\nYou can make passive income with Chainlink by lending your LINK tokens to a crypto lending program. If you're a U.S. resident, CoinLoan and Gemini are two platforms that support Chainlink lending. While Gemini is considered one of the top crypto exchanges, CoinLoan offers much higher interest rates on LINK.\nLending crypto has its risks. Like any other type of lending, you can lose your funds if a borrower defaults.\nUnique risks\nUnique risks\nTo Chainlink's credit, it doesn't have any glaring weaknesses or flaws. The price is volatile and it's part of a very new, unproven industry, but that's the case for all cryptocurrencies. If you're going to invest in any types of cryptocurrency, volatility and risk come with the territory.\nChainlink has gotten attention for its token distribution. A 2021 report found that 125 wallets held 81% of the total LINK supply, with Chainlink node operators holding 35% and the Chainlink team almost 25%.\nAlthough this can lead to worries that a small group of whales (investors who own large amounts of crypto) have too much control, that doesn't seem like the case here. The Chainlink team was open about token distribution from the beginning and how it would use its supply to fund development. A large part of the reason Chainlink has been so successful is because the team has had the funds necessary to expand.\nIs Chainlink a good investment?\nIs Chainlink a good investment?\nChainlink is a quality investment that's worth considering if you're building a cryptocurrency portfolio. It offers excellent utility, widespread adoption, and has a significant first-mover advantage compared to other decentralized oracle networks.\nSmart contracts on every blockchain network need (and will continue to need) real-world data. Chainlink provides an efficient and accurate oracle solution. The fact that there are already so many projects using the Chainlink network is a testament to its utility.\nAlso boding well for Chainlink's growing adoption is the fact that it\u2019s blockchain-agnostic and not tied to any single network. Chainlink also has shown initiative in proposing a global, open-source standard for cross-blockchain messaging, the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Whether or not CCIP becomes a popular global standard, its proposal is significant, and it puts Chainlink in a high-profile position as the blockchain industry continues to evolve.\nWhen you look at the oracle token market, it's apparent that Chainlink is in a very strong position. None of its competitors even come close in terms of size. As of May 2022, no other oracle token had even one-tenth of Chainlink's market cap or had broken into the top 100 cryptocurrencies.\nThat being said, it's also important to be cautious about any cryptocurrency investment. As mentioned earlier, prices are volatile, and they can rise or fall quickly. If you decide to invest in Chainlink, other projects, or cryptocurrency stocks, be cautious about how much you spend.\nRelated investing topics\nHow to buy Chainlink\nHow to buy Chainlink\nSince Chainlink is one of the larger cryptocurrencies, there are plenty of exchanges that list it. Here are a few of the most popular places for U.S. investors to buy Chainlink:\nIf you already have an account on a different crypto exchange, check for Chainlink there first. It's widely available, so you may not need to go anywhere new to find it.\nChainlink is popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, and it's easy to see why. No cryptocurrency is a sure thing, but, with the features it offers, Chainlink clearly has the potential for long-term success."

      "text": "Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, recently revealed that he has invested in cryptocurrency. And he's not the only wealthy American who has -- 68% of high-net-worth adults do, according to a recent Motley Fool survey. That's about 4.7 million Americans, each with a net worth of at least $1 million, who have invested in crypto.\nWhy have more than two-thirds of American millionaires invested in cryptocurrency?\nMost believe it will generate strong returns and that it's a hedge against inflation. A majority of millionaire cryptocurrency investors see it as a safe store of value or believe in the underlying philosophy of crypto, as well.\nHigh-net-worth crypto investors also believe that cryptocurrency is going to the moon and maybe further. Two-thirds have at least half of their portfolio in cryptocurrency and a similar percentage say cryptocurrency will make up a larger share of their portfolio in the next five years.\nBut not all American millionaires are on board with crypto.\nRead on for a deep dive into how high-net-worth investors are approaching cryptocurrency, including what they're buying, how long they hold, and what keeps some of them away from the crypto scene.\nKey findings\n- 68% of high-net-worth individuals -- roughly 4.7 million Americans, each with a net worth of at least $1 million -- own cryptocurrency.\n- Two-thirds of American millionaires who own cryptocurrency believe it will generate strong returns, 60% see it as a safe store of value, and 61% believe in the underlying philosophy of crypto.\n- Bitcoin is owned by 60% of high-net-worth individuals that have invested in cryptocurrency, while 55% own Ethereum.\n- 86% of high-net-worth cryptocurrency owners have invested in a memecoin like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu.\n- 71% of high-net-worth cryptocurrency owners would use a credit card that offered cryptocurrency rewards and 58% would use a bank account that stores cryptocurrency.\n- Two out of three millionaire cryptocurrency investors have at least half of their portfolio in cryptocurrency.\n- 59% of high-net-worth individuals who own cryptocurrency expect to allocate more of their portfolio to it over the next five years.\n- 81% of high-net-worth individuals who own cryptocurrency are likely to buy more in the next year. 50% of those that don't own cryptocurrency are likely to buy in the next year as well.\n- Lack of education about cryptocurrency is seen as the biggest barrier to investment by high-net-worth individuals.\nTwo-thirds of American millionaires hold cryptocurrency in search of strong returns\n68% of high-net-worth individuals (those with a net worth of $1 million or more), about 4.7 million Americans, own cryptocurrency.\nThe most cited reason for investing in cryptocurrency is a belief that cryptocurrency will generate strong returns.\nAbout 60% of American millionaire crypto investors bought cryptocurrency because they believe it's a safe store of value. A similar percentage invested because they believe in the underlying philosophy of cryptocurrency, such as decentralized finance.\nJust over 50% of high-net-worth individuals that have invested in cryptocurrency cited its potential to be a hedge against inflation.\n| Reason to invest in cryptocurrency | Percentage of millionaire crypto investors |\n|---|---|\n| I believe it will generate strong returns | 65.79% |\n| I believe in the underlying philosophy of cryptocurrency (e.g., decentralized finance) | 61.09% |\n| I believe it is a safe store of value | 60.28% |\n| I believe it is a hedge against inflation | 52.20% |\n| Other | 9.03% |\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the most popular cryptocurrencies among millionaires\nRoughly 60% of high-net-worth individuals that have invested in cryptocurrency own Bitcoin and 56% own Ethereum. These are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.\nMillionaires have branched out beyond mainstream cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin is owned by 48% of millionaire cryptocurrency investors, making it the third-most popular cryptocurrency among this group.\nRoughly one-third own Shiba Inu. A similar percentage own other non-meme cryptocurrencies, like Tether, Cardano, and Solana.\n| Coin owned | Percentage of millionaire crypto investors |\n|---|---|\n| Bitcoin | 59.99% |\n| Ethereum | 55.51% |\n| Dogecoin | 48.09% |\n| Binance Coin | 45.74% |\n| XRP | 37.67% |\n| Tether | 35.54% |\n| Cardano | 34.43% |\n| Solana | 34.21% |\n| Shiba Inu | 33.55% |\n| Polkadot | 31.86% |\n| Other | 8.22% |\n86% of millionaires who own cryptocurrency have purchased a memecoin like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu\nMore evidence for high-net-worth cryptocurrency investors' willingness to ride the memecoin craze is the fact that 86% of those who own cryptocurrency have at one point purchased a memecoin like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu.\nThe key difference between memecoins and more mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum is that memecoins have little real-world utility. Non-memecoins were developed to solve actual problems. Some memecoins, like Squid coin, have turned out to be outright crypto scams, with the creators of the cryptocurrency making off with $3.4 million while investors were left with nothing but losses.\n| Have you ever purchased a \"memecoin\" (e.g., Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Squid)? | Percentage of millionaire crypto investors |\n|---|---|\n| Yes | 86.42% |\n| No | 13.58% |\nMost high-net-worth cryptocurrency owners aren't fazed by recent scams\nCryptocurrency scams have made some millionaire investors, particularly those that don't own cryptocurrency, less interested in investing.\nAmong high-net-worth cryptocurrency investors who took our survey, just 24% said recent crypto scams have made them less interested in investing in cryptocurrency. 62% of high-net-worth crypto owners said they're more interested in investing in cryptocurrency because of recent high-profile scams.\nOn the other hand, 44% of American millionaires that don't own cryptocurrency said recent scams have made them less enthusiastic about investing in cryptocurrency. Just 37% said they were more interested in investing in crypto following high-profile scams.\nHow much have recent crypto scams (Walmart Litecoin, Squid coin, etc.) affected how you view crypto investments?\n| Group | I'm much more interested in investing | I'm a bit more interested in investing | They didn't affect my views on crypto | I'm a bit less interested in investing | I'm much less interested in investing |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Crypto owners | 47.76% | 13.96% | 15.87% | 9.18% | 13.23% |\n| Non-owners | 20.22% | 16.93% | 19.75% | 20.53% | 22.57% |\n| All | 38.97% | 14.91% | 17.11% | 12.81% | 16.21% |\n71% of millionaire crypto investors would use a credit card with cryptocurrency rewards, 58% would store crypto with a bank\nMost American millionaires who own cryptocurrency would likely use a credit card with crypto rewards and bank with an institution that allows storing cryptocurrency.\nThis tracks with the views of the broader American public, of which 65% said they would consider using a credit card that provides cryptocurrency rewards and 70% said they would consider buying crypto if they could store it in a bank account.\nMillionaires that don't own cryptocurrency are less interested in crypto credit card rewards or bank account support, but weren't entirely dismissive of them. 36% said they would likely use a credit card that provides crypto rewards and 40% said they'd be likely to use a bank with crypto support.\nWhich of the following would you be likely to use?\n| Groups | A credit card with cryptocurrency rewards | A bank that lets you store cryptocurrency in an account | None of the above |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Crypto owners | 70.76% | 58.34% | 8.30% |\n| Non-owners | 36.21% | 40.60% | 35.11% |\n| All | 59.73% | 52.68% | 16.86% |\nTwo out of three millionaires who own cryptocurrency have at least half of their portfolio in crypto\nMillionaires who own cryptocurrency aren't just testing the waters -- about two-thirds of them have at least half of their portfolio in cryptocurrency, according to our respondents.\nA quarter of millionaire cryptocurrency owners in our survey have between 50% and 74% of their portfolios in cryptocurrency. Another quarter have between 75% and 99% of their portfolio in cryptocurrency.\nAbout 16% of high-net-worth cryptocurrency owners have gone all-in on cryptocurrency.\n| How much of your portfolio is allocated to cryptocurrency? | Percentage of respondents |\n|---|---|\n| 1\u20139% | 7.42% |\n| 10\u201324% | 11.89% |\n| 25\u201349% | 14.54% |\n| 50\u201374% | 25.33% |\n| 75\u201399% | 24.89% |\n| 100% | 15.93% |\n71% of American millionaires say they're likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next year\nHigh-net-worth cryptocurrency owners want to continue investing in cryptocurrency -- 66% say they're very likely to buy more cryptocurrency in the next year and 16% say they're somewhat likely to do so.\nAbout half of the millionaires that don't own cryptocurrency may have a change of heart over the next year and make their first investments in cryptocurrency. 24% of that group said they are very likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next year, while 25% said they are somewhat likely to do so.\nHow likely are you to buy cryptocurrency in the next year?\n| Group | Very likely | Somewhat likely | Somewhat unlikely | Very unlikely |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Crypto owners | 66.27% | 15.58% | 8.16% | 9.99% |\n| Non-owners | 24.45% | 24.76% | 24.45% | 26.33% |\n| All | 52.93% | 18.51% | 13.36% | 15.21% |\n59% of high-net-worth individuals who own cryptocurrency expect to allocate more of their portfolio to it over the next five years\nMillionaires who own cryptocurrency aren't just likely to buy more in the next year, they also expect to have cryptocurrency make up a larger share of their portfolio over the next five years.\n59% of American millionaires who own crypto expect cryptocurrency to make up more of their portfolio in five years. 22% believe that cryptocurrency will make up the same percentage.\n19% anticipate that cryptocurrency will make up less of their portfolio over the next five years, a similar percentage of respondents who said they were unlikely to buy cryptocurrency over the next 12 months.\n| How do you anticipate cryptocurrency's role in your portfolio changing over the next five years? | Percentage of respondents |\n|---|---|\n| Crypto will make up more of my portfolio | 59.18% |\n| Crypto will make up the same percentage of my portfolio | 22.10% |\n| Crypto will make up less of my portfolio | 18.72% |\nMillionaires view cryptocurrency as riskier than other investments\nDespite the enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, millionaires view cryptocurrency as the riskiest type of investment regardless of whether they own cryptocurrency.\nHigh-net-worth individuals see NFTs as the second-most risky investment, followed by stocks, index funds, bonds, real estate, and finally options.\nCryptocurrency owners, on average, assigned NFTs and stocks the same amount of risk.\n| Asset | Cryptocurrency owners' risk ranking (1 being least risky) | Non-owners' risk ranking (1 being least risky) | Total |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Cryptocurrency | 2.43 | 2.26 | 2.38 |\n| NFTs | 2.14 | 2.15 | 2.15 |\n| Stocks | 2.14 | 2.13 | 2.13 |\n| Index funds | 1.84 | 1.94 | 1.87 |\n| Bonds | 1.84 | 1.86 | 1.85 |\n| Real estate | 1.85 | 1.76 | 1.82 |\n| Options | 1.75 | 1.9 | 1.8 |\nGen Z millionaires are the only generation that don't see cryptocurrency as the riskiest asset. Instead, they consider options to be riskier. This reflects Gen Z's overall view of cryptocurrency -- that it's a more stable investment than stocks or options.\nGen Z also considers NFTs to be less risky than index funds and bonds, and stocks to be less risky than all three of those assets. This may be a result of Gen Z beginning to invest in years when stocks and digital assets have had historically strong returns.\n| Asset | Risk assigned by Gen Z investors | Risk assigned by millennial investors | Risk assigned by Gen X investors | Risk assigned by baby boomer investors | Risk assigned by Silent Generation investors | Risk assigned by all generations |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Cryptocurrency | 2.06 | 2.45 | 2.40 | 2.38 | 2.53 | 2.38 |\n| NFTs | 1.98 | 2.18 | 2.10 | 2.30 | 2.53 | 2.15 |\n| Stocks | 1.97 | 2.18 | 2.21 | 1.84 | 2.13 | 2.13 |\n| Index funds | 2.00 | 1.82 | 1.83 | 2.12 | 2.27 | 1.87 |\n| Bonds | 1.99 | 1.82 | 1.87 | 1.79 | 1.13 | 1.85 |\n| Real estate | 1.93 | 1.83 | 1.79 | 1.70 | 1.33 | 1.82 |\n| Options | 2.07 | 1.72 | 1.8 | 1.87 | 2.07 | 1.80 |\nRoughly a third of millionaire crypto owners trade cryptocurrency at least once a day, but most want to hold for years\n35% of high-net-worth individuals who own cryptocurrency trade at least once a day. Another 21% trade once a week.\nTrading including buying and selling, so 35% of high-net-worth individuals aren't necessarily day trading cryptocurrency. But there's clearly enthusiasm among high-net-worth investors about cryptocurrency.\n| How often do you trade cryptocurrency? | Percentage of respondents |\n|---|---|\n| I make at least one trade a day | 34.73% |\n| I make at least one trade a week | 21.37% |\n| I make at least one trade a month | 13.73% |\n| I make at least one trade every six months | 10.65% |\n| I make at least one trade a year | 10.21% |\n| I haven't trade cryptocurrency in over a year | 9.32% |\nThe fact that about 91% of high-net-worth cryptocurrency owners want to hold their cryptocurrency investments for more than a year suggests that most are not interested in day trading cryptocurrency and view it as a long-, or at least medium-, term investment.\n| On average, how long do you keep a cryptocurrency investment? (If you haven't sold one yet, how long do you anticipate holding your investments?) | Percentage of respondents |\n|---|---|\n| Less than a year | 9.25% |\n| 1\u20132 years | 13.36% |\n| 2\u20133 years | 15.57% |\n| 3\u20134 years | 15.64% |\n| 4\u20135 years | 17.33% |\n| 5\u201310 years | 17.11% |\n| 10+ years | 11.75% |\nLack of education about cryptocurrency is seen as the biggest barrier to adoption among millionaires\nAsked what the largest barrier keeping people from investing in cryptocurrency is, about 24% of high-net-worth individuals cited a lack of education about cryptocurrency.\nAn uncertain regulatory environment and cryptocurrency having too few uses were the least cited barriers among all millionaires. Owners of cryptocurrency were less likely to point to uncertain regulation as a barrier to investment than non-owners.\nWhat's the biggest barrier keeping more people out of investing in cryptocurrency?\n| Group | Lack of education about cryptocurrency | Lack of support and cryptocurrency services from major financial institutions | Uncertain regulatory environment | Lack of belief in the value of cryptocurrency | Too few uses for cryptocurrency | Other |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Crypto owners | 23.44% | 22.70% | 11.83% | 22.26% | 14.84% | 4.92% |\n| Non-owners | 21.47% | 17.71% | 15.36% | 17.24% | 14.26% | 13.95% |\n| Total | 22.81% | 21.11% | 12.96% | 20.66% | 14.66% | 7.80% |\nCryptocurrency-focused websites are the most popular sources of information for high-net-worth individuals who own cryptocurrency\nAbout 59% of high-net-worth cryptocurrency investors get information on crypto investing from websites focused on cryptocurrency.\n54% high-net-worth cryptocurrency investors use social media for cryptocurrency information, making it the second most popular information source.\nPrint media is the least used source for cryptocurrency information.\n| Where do you get information on cryptocurrency? | Percentage of respondents |\n|---|---|\n| Cryptocurrency data and media websites (CoinDesk, Coin Metrics) | 58.66% |\n| Social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) | 53.89% |\n| Financial media (Seeking Alpha, NerdWallet, Investing.com) | 52.06% |\n| News media (CNN, Fox Business, NPR) | 48.09% |\n| Family and friends | 44.13% |\n| Financial advisor | 43.10% |\n| Print or broadcast media (newspaper, magazines, TV) | 42.58% |\n| Other | 7.93% |\nAre high-net-worth Americans ahead of the crypto curve?\nA recent poll from Pew found that just 16% of Americans own cryptocurrency, despite almost 90% having heard about it -- a far lower percentage than the 68% of high-net-worth individuals who own cryptocurrency.\nSo is it fair to say that high-net-worth Americans are ahead of the curve when it comes to cryptocurrency?\nIt's hard to tell. Cryptocurrency was invented just over a decade ago, regulation is still evolving, new tokens are being developed, and use cases are still being explored.\nMillionaire cryptocurrency investors are just starting to explore the fast-growing cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin and Ethereum are by far the most popular cryptocurrencies among millionaire investors, but there are countless other tokens that offer exposure to distinct aspects of the cryptocurrency world.\nThat said, millionaires are certainly enthusiastic about cryptocurrency. A majority want to buy more, make it a larger share of their portfolio, and hold for at least a year. Wealthy Americans want credit cards that offer cryptocurrency rewards and bank accounts where they can store cryptocurrency.\nHigh-net-worth Americans aren't the only group that sees cryptocurrency as a mainstay-almost half of Gen Z and Millennial investors own cryptocurrency. And over 20% of Americans are likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next year.\nCryptocurrency is new, volatile, and its landscape is fast changing. We expect attitudes toward it will continue to shift and evolve apace.\nSources\n- CNBC (2021). \"Tim Cook says he owns cryptocurrency and he's been 'interested in it for a while'.\"\n- Pew (2021). \"16% of Americans say they have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency.\"\nMethodology\nThe Motley Fool distributed this survey to 2,000 American adults with at least $1 million in net worth via Pollfish on November 3, 2021.\nRespondents were 43% female and 57% male."
