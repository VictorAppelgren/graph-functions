  "description": "The Justice Department is putting American companies on notice that they could be prosecuted if they choose to evade President Trump's tariffs, even as the legality of the president's 'Liberation Day' duties remain unsettled in US courts.",
  "content": "The Justice Department is putting American companies on notice that they could be prosecuted if they chose to evade President Trump's tariffs, even as the legality of the president's \"Liberation Day\" duties remain unsettled in US courts. The message came in a DOJ announcement earlier this month stipulating that prosecutors would step up investigations into suspiciously classified imports and charge those who misidentify products with fraud. \u201cWhile the DOJ has always taken some customs cases, this is a different, more aggressive, visible stance than they usually would,\u201d said Thompson Coburn trade lawyer Robert Shapiro. Read more: 5 ways to tariff-proof your finances The plan \u2014 to be carried out by the DOJ\u2019s new Market, Government, and Consumer Fraud Unit \u2014 marks a shift in enforcement tactics from prior administrations that relied mostly on policing misconduct through administrative proceedings, even during Trump\u2019s first term in office. The new Trump administration instead wants to prioritize criminal charges against companies and individuals that try to evade US tariffs. The overarching strategy was first outlined by Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, who wrote in a May memo that an increasing focus on white collar crime would include \"trade and customs fraudsters, including those who commit tariff evasion.\" U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during his 'Liberation Day' tariff announcement on April 2 in the Rose Garden at the White House. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) At the same time, the Trump administration finds itself in the unusual position of defending the legality of the duties it pledges to enforce. Oral arguments in a federal lawsuit challenging the president's tariffs are set to take place before the US Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., this Thursday. The small business importers challenging the legal standing of the duties already proved it was possible to temporarily derail Trump\u2019s global tariffs with a lower court victory in May. In a separate challenge, two toy manufacturers are scheduled to make their own arguments against Trump's tariffs before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Sept. 30, following their own lower court victory. 'We're going to raise the ante' Tariff violations can be prosecuted under civil or criminal laws. However, even fraud cases were often handled administratively by past administrations, according to Shapiro. \u201cI think the administration is just saying we're going to raise the ante on this,\u201d Shapiro said. University of Kansas School of Law professor Raj Bhala said laws against customs fraud have long been in force, but the appetite for the DOJ and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to clamp down on violations has increased.\n\nHistorically, Bhala and other trade lawyers said, prosecutors focused government resources on suspected tariff violations by US adversaries such as China, Iran, and North Korea, and particularly on export controls meant to keep controlled items from shipping to those countries. Producer-exporters, especially in China and other high-tariff regions, have been using evasion techniques for decades, mostly to skirt anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders, Bhala said. But now, under more imposing tariffs, incentives to evade duties have spiked \u201cenormously.\u201d Shipping cranes stand at the Port of Oakland in Oakland, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez) \u201cWhat is clear is that a lot of companies are looking for a way to limit the impact of the duties,\u201d Shapiro said. In this new tariff and enforcement environment, trade experts suspect that corporate America and its trading partners are on high alert. Erika Trujillo, a trade attorney with customs risk management firm SEIA Compliance Technologies, said the shift toward more enforcement happening at the DOJ and less through administrative procedures could increase politically motivated targeting of companies viewed as adverse to the Trump administration's interests. \u201cI do think trade restrictions were used as both a sword and a shield for foreign companies, or in terms of dealing with international trade,\u201d Trujillo said. Common tariff evasion techniques include misclassifying goods, falsely labeling a product\u2019s country of origin, making minor modifications to a product while it\u2019s in a lower-tariff jurisdiction to pass it off as manufactured there, and transhipping goods through lower-tariff jurisdictions. Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs \u201cIt's hard to imagine that any well-run company that has supply chains stretching across the globe \u2014 particularly in higher-tariff jurisdictions like China or Cambodia \u2014 would not be having vigorous discussions to ensure every step in the supply chain is properly documented and audited,\u201d Bhala said. Bhala cautions that the stakes are high for importers subject to US jurisdiction. The United States Department of Justice headquarters in Washington, D.C. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo \u201cThey're the importer of record and they\u2019re the ones who are liable for the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd false declarations are what we call \u2018go to jail stuff.\u2019\u201d For fraud, fines can also be assessed, up to the domestic value of the merchandise. For civil violations made based on negligent actions, maximum penalties are two times the underpayment of duties, in addition to original duties. For violations based on gross negligence, penalties increase to four times the underpayment of duties. For businesses looking to assess their risk, US Customs maintains an electronic system called the Automated Commercial Environment (ACT) that allows importers to view what their classification data looks like to customs. Small and midsize companies may find it more difficult to evaluate their compliance risks compared to multinational firms. \u201cIf you're an SME, you probably have one or two lawyers, and they're not necessarily trade specialists,\u201d Bhala said. Plus, there are different rules for thousands of products. For example, a typical NAFTA good, he explained, traverses the US-Canada border roughly four times. \u201cIt's really difficult for companies of that size to be dealing with this,\u201d Trujillo said. One major challenge is finding affordable internal expertise. Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, at right. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) \u201cAlmost every company I know is actively hiring for both customs and export controls, and sanctions. You're basically stuck going to law firms or other external consultancy, and the small and medium-sized firms are maybe not going to have the budget to pay $1,100 an hour.\u201d Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet For certain suspected violations like those made by mistake, Shapiro said it doesn\u2019t make economic sense for the DOJ to get involved. \u201cThey don't have the manpower for it,\u201d he said. But a new enforcement policy seems to fit the Trump administration\u2019s broader tariff agenda, he added. \u201cIf you're going to have this tariff policy, you're going to have to take a more aggressive stance, because it's a huge ocean of imports, and it\u2019s very hard for customs to enforce against everyone.\u201d Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "text": "A courtroom showdown over President Trump\u2019s tariffs is coming at the end of July, just one day before a series of steep duties are scheduled to take effect for dozens of countries around the world.\nBut it could still take a lot longer to permanently settle the legal question of whether the president has the authority to impose his wide-ranging tariffs, according to legal experts and even a participant in the current case.\n\"If we win,\" the Trump administration \u201ccould try to use other statutes\u201d to justify new tariffs, said Ilya Somin, a lawyer for the small business importers that successfully challenged Trump\u2019s tariffs before a lower court in May.\n\u201cAnd that would be a lengthy, complex discussion about what [the president] can do,\u201d added Somin, a law professor at George Mason University and constitutional studies chair at the Cato Institute.\nThe small business importers that proved it was possible to temporarily derail Trump\u2019s global tariffs with a lower court victory in May will make their arguments again on July 31 before the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C.\nIn a separate challenge, two toy manufacturers are scheduled to make their own arguments against Trump's tariffs before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Sept. 30, after also winning a lower court victory.\nThese legal challenges to Trump\u2019s escalating trade war don\u2019t necessarily pose an immediate danger to Trump\u2019s broader tariff plans for a few reasons, according to legal and trade experts.\nOne, even if he loses the current cases on appeal, Trump could turn to other statutes that administration officials believe allow him to also act unilaterally. Any lawsuits designed to stop those moves would likely stretch for months into 2026.\nAnother complicating factor for challengers is that the Supreme Court has made it more difficult for lower courts to issue a nationwide injunction against a presidential action. It did so in a ruling last month in a case stemming from a Trump executive order ending a longstanding US rule on birthright citizenship.\nThe court's decision could be relevant to the tariff cases since the small business importers were able to convince the US Court of International Trade to issue a nationwide injunction against Trump\u2019s tariffs in May after concluding he lacked authority to impose his duties by executive order under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA).\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit put that order on hold while it considers whether the president has the ultimate legal authority to impose the IEEPA duties, which are now scheduled to take effect on Aug. 1 unless countries are able to negotiate new deals in the coming weeks.\n\u201cI think trading partners should take the message and probably do take the message that they can't rely on the courts to protect them from tariff actions from the United States,\u201d said Greta Peisch, an international trade attorney and former general counsel for the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR).\nShe and other trade experts say the matter is likely to be taken up by the Supreme Court, though not necessarily on an expedited basis.\nPeisch also noted that the two cases now before appeals courts won\u2019t address the president\u2019s authority under other statutes that carve out exceptions to Congress\u2019s tariff power.\nThese alternative statutes include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to impose tariffs on a foreign nation so long as the US Trade Representative finds the nation has violated trade agreements or engaged in unfair trade practices.\nThey also include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers the president to impose tariffs on certain imports designated as a threat to the US economy, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 that empowers the president to impose tariffs on countries that unreasonably restrict US goods.\nThere are a lot of questions about how those other laws may work, Peisch said, because some haven't been challenged in court.\n\u201cI think what that means for negotiating partners and for importers, is that the outcome of the case and the timing is not something that they can certainly hang their hat on and depend on as something that's going to change the dynamics and the calculus in the next months, maybe even year,\u201d she said.\nOne loophole that the Supreme Court left in place that could work against Trump is that it has kept intact the ability of plaintiffs to seek a widespread block of presidential executive orders through class action lawsuits.\nSomin, the lawyer working with the importers challenging Trump\u2019s tariffs, said, \" We believe we don't need, necessarily, a class action to get a broad remedy here.\u201d A complete remedy \u201crequires a broad injunction barring these IEEPA tariffs entirely,\u201d Somin added.\nSomin also noted that if the president does turn to other statutes to impose tariffs, they could be more limited than the widespread duties justified under IEEPA.\n\u201cWhat I do not think you can do is start a gargantuan trade war with the entire world, which is what he has tried to use IEEPA to do,\u201d Somin said.\nBen Werschkul contributed to this article.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "text": "The Supreme Court is being asked by two toy companies to rule on the legal fight over President Trump's tariffs, giving the nation's highest court the chance to determine whether the president has the authority to enact some of his most aggressive trade policies.\nThat key question hangs in the balance after a three-judge panel at the US Court of International Trade (CIT) sided in May with a group of small businesses that argued Trump lacked authority to impose his \"Liberation Day\" duties under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA).\nTrump appealed that decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., which has allowed Trump's tariffs to stay in force while it considers whether the president has the ultimate legal authority to impose the duties. Oral arguments are scheduled to start on July 31.\nBut now two toy companies that filed a separate tariff lawsuit against Trump \u2014 Learning Resources and Hand2Mind \u2014 have asked the Supreme Court to consider their case and put it on a fast track.\nIn recent terms, this court has allowed prompt review in cases of similarly (or less) far-reaching political and economic Importance.\nAll of the challengers to Trump's tariffs are arguing that the administration's basis for the duties \u2014 a national emergency caused by illegal immigration and flows of illegal drugs from overseas \u2014 was unauthorized because it did not directly address the stated emergency.\n\"Whether the President has authority to impose tariffs ... is of such imperative importance that it warrants review now,\" the toy companies said in their Tuesday filing to the Supreme Court.\nThe toy companies have already won a victory before US District Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington, D.C., but the decision was narrow in scope.\nTrump appealed it, and now the companies want to skip that battle and go directly to the nation's highest court.\nRead more: 5 ways to tariff-proof your finances\nThe companies want the Supreme Court to decide on whether to take this case before its summer recess starts near the end of this month, setting up possible arguments in the fall.\nThey argue in their petition to the court that an analysis by JPMorgan shows the round of Trump tariffs at issue \"would hike taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year, the largest tax increase in recent memory by a longshot,\" and \"cause prices to surge\" by \"adding 2% to the Consumer Price Index.\"\nSince the beginning of the year, the tariff onslaught has caused \"the nation's overall average effective tariff rate\" to jump from \"2.5 percent\" to \"around 27 percent\" \u2014 more than a tenfold increase and \"the highest for the U.S. in more than a century.\""

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nTariffs may seem like a topic that only matters to economic policy wonks. But these import taxes affect you more than you think, even if you\u2019re not directly cutting the check.\nSince taking office in his second term, President Trump has imposed steep new tariffs on nearly all products imported into the U.S., ending decades of free trade policy and setting markets on a rocky course throughout 2025. Trump has made exceptions for certain products and set and extended dealmaking deadlines as his administration negotiates trade agreements with other countries.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nTrump says his tariffs will rebalance international trade in favor of U.S. producers and manufacturers.\nWe\u2019ll walk you through how tariffs work and what they mean for you and your wallet.\nWho really pays for tariffs?\nTrump has said that tariffs \u201care paid mostly by China,\u201d rather than by Americans. But that\u2019s not how tariffs work.\nThe company importing the goods \u2014 not the exporting company or country \u2014 directly pays the tariff. The duty is collected when the goods clear customs at the importing country\u2019s port of entry.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a [company] importing a good from another country, you\u2019re effectively buying that good in that country,\u201d said Michael Coon, an associate professor at the University of Tampa who studies international economics. \u201cSo you\u2019re paying whatever price they\u2019re charging in that country. Then it\u2019s your responsibility to get the goods into your country. If you want to get the goods into your country, then you have to pay the import tariffs.\u201d\nRead more: 5 ways to tariff-proof your finances\nSo let\u2019s say the U.S. levied a new tariff on laptops from China, and Amazon imports Chinese laptops. A broker representing Amazon would most likely pay the tax to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service when the goods enter the country.\nBut businesses almost always pass additional costs on to consumers. That means you, the customer buying the laptop, would typically end up paying the tariff, even if you don't know it. The cost would get passed down to you in the form of a higher price.\nSoon after Trump enacted tariffs on Canadian goods, Canadian energy company Irving Oil sent a letter to its customers in New England that their heating bills would reflect the increased cost.\nMany retailers and trade groups opposed Trump's original tariffs on Chinese goods, saying they\u2019d need to raise prices due to the extra cost. The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, a trade group that represents the U.S. footwear industry, estimated that an additional 15% tariff on imported shoes from China would increase the price of a $49.99 canvas sneaker to $60.98, while the price of a typical hunting boot would jump from $190 to $231.03.\nTariffs are often levied in hopes that consumers will substitute domestic products for foreign-made goods. However, a country imposing the tariffs may lack the infrastructure, natural resources, or cheap labor to produce comparable goods at the same cost, so buying local is often more expensive.\n\u201cEither we pay the higher price on the Chinese goods with the tariffs, or we pay the higher price to U.S. companies,\u201d Coon said.\nDo tariffs protect jobs?\nThe effect of tariffs on jobs is also hotly debated. Tariffs Trump introduced during his first term on steel and aluminum were politically popular. They prompted a few shuttered steel plants to reopen and were credited with creating several thousand jobs in the metals industry.\nBut the negative effects of tariffs can also spill over to employment. Sectors like agriculture, for example, were hard-hit by tariffs China imposed in response to U.S. tariffs during Trump's first term. For example, soybean exports dropped 63% in the first 10 months of 2018, while exports fell by 20%, according to the Congressional Research Service. The agricultural sector likely experienced some job losses as a result, some economists say. When tariffs are imposed on materials like steel and aluminum, industries that use those materials \u2014 like the manufacturing sector \u2014 face higher costs, which can negatively impact employment.\nThe jobs that are saved from tariffs often come at a high cost. The Peterson Institute for International Economics found that every job in the steel industry saved by the 2018-19 tariffs cost American consumers and businesses $900,000.\nDo tariffs affect inflation?\nTariffs can lead to higher prices, but the effect on inflation tends to be relatively minor.\n\u201cTariffs affect very specific sectors of the economy, and inflation is looking at the economy as a whole,\u201d Coon said. \u201cThe price of a few goods going up is not inflation.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s original tariffs were in effect well before shock waves from the COVID-19 pandemic caused inflation to soar. The Economic Policy Institute estimated in January 2022 \u2014 a time when inflation was still skyrocketing \u2014 that removing the tariffs would have offset no more than 7.2% of the run-up in consumer prices.\nRead more: What is inflation, and how does it affect you?\nWhat Trump is doing and promising in his second term\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump\u2019s platform included a call to \u201cstop outsourcing and turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower,\u201d and provide large tax cuts for American workers. Trump suggested that tax cuts could be funded by a 60% increase in tariffs on Chinese goods and a 10% hike on other trade partners. In a meeting with congressional Republicans, he even reportedly suggested eliminating the income tax and replacing it with higher tariffs.\nOnce in office, Trump moved quickly on tariffs but at more tempered levels. Weeks into his new term, he announced tariffs to take effect beginning Feb. 4 \u2014 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% on imports from China. Duties on oil imports from Canada would be lower at 10%.\nBut hours before the Canada and Mexico tariffs were set to take effect, Trump spoke to leaders of both countries and agreed to a one-month pause in exchange for pledges to enhance security at the southern and northern borders. Trump has cited the inflow of illegal drugs as part of his justification for imposing steep tariffs on longtime allies and trading partners.\nAs the March 4 deadline approached, Trump declared there was \"no room left\" to negotiate. At 12:01 a.m., the additional 10% levy on Chinese goods, as well as the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, went into effect. All three countries quickly responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own.\nBut the biggest bombshell was Trump's April 2 announcement of reciprocal tariffs, which are meant to make up for the tariffs and other barriers that countries impose on U.S. goods.\n\u201cReciprocal, that means they do it to us, we do it to them,\u201d Trump said in his announcement.\nTrump called for a universal 10% tariff on countries around the world, plus reciprocal tariffs of up to nearly 50% on dozens of trading partners. Canada and Mexico, two of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners, were not affected by the new measures. But they remain subject to tariffs of up to 25% with some products exempted. Chinese goods face a 30% levy.\nWhile exempting some products from tariffs, Trump has also singled out others for high duties including copper and pharmaceuticals.\nTrump ultimately imposed a 90-day pause on the sweeping duties to hammer out further deals and calm markets. As that July deadline approached, he pushed it out another month. Only July 8 and 9, he released nearly two dozen letters to trade partners, including a threat of a 50% tariff on Brazil.\nTariff FAQs\nWhat is a simple definition of a tariff?\nA tariff is a tax levied on goods imported from a foreign country that\u2019s often used to protect domestic industries and jobs.\nWhat are the different types of tariffs?\nThere are several different types of tariffs, but the most common are ad valorem and specific tariffs. An ad valorem tariff is a tax that\u2019s levied as a percentage of the imported product\u2019s value. The 25% tariff imposed on steel in 2018, along with many imported Chinese goods, is an example of an ad valorem tariff. A specific tariff is a flat tax charged on each imported good (e.g., $1,000 per vehicle or $50 per mobile device).\nWhy and how are tariffs used?\nHere are a few key reasons countries impose tariffs:\nProtecting local jobs and industries: For developed nations, tariffs \u2014 also known as customs duties or import duties \u2014 tend to be protectionist. That is, they\u2019re intended to give a price advantage to domestic goods, shielding a country\u2019s businesses and workers from cheaper foreign competition. The idea is that if foreign materials and products are more expensive, you\u2019ll buy more domestic goods. For example, Congress passed a sweeping range of tariff hikes, some as high as 60%, after the stock market crash of 1929 under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act to protect the farming industry.\nRevenue generation: Like any other taxes, tariffs also provide income for the government that levies them. In fact, tariffs were the primary source of revenue for the U.S. government during its early days until the federal income tax was established in the early 20th century. Today, tariffs are a minuscule source of income for many developed countries. Poorer countries often have far higher tariff rates than wealthier countries because their governments depend on them for revenue.\nNational security: A government may implement tariffs to avoid relying too heavily on different countries for goods deemed critical to security, like military supplies. Trump cited national security concerns when he hiked tariffs on steel and aluminum because both are used for weaponry and military equipment. Though Congress is typically tasked with levying tariffs and taxes, the president has the authority to enact them unilaterally in the name of defense.\nInfluence other countries\u2019 practices: The World Trade Organization (WTO) largely supports free trade policies, but it allows countries to enact trade barriers like tariffs in response to human rights concerns.\nTariffs can also be used to discourage certain trade practices like \u201cdumping,\u201d which is when companies export products to another country and sell them at artificially low prices to gain a competitive advantage. Former President Joe Biden, who kept most of Trump's early tariffs in place, accused China of dumping practices when he introduced new tariffs on about $18 billion worth of Chinese goods \u2014 including a 100% increase on electric vehicles (EVs) and a 50% increase on semiconductors. Biden said in an interview with Yahoo Finance in 2024 that China was \u201cnot making any money off them. They\u2019re doing it to put other people out of business.\u201d\nRetaliation: Sometimes, when one country imposes a tariff on another country's goods, the exporting country responds with retaliatory tariffs of its own. The Smoot-Hawley Act sparked a trade war as European nations passed retaliatory tariffs, and historians often blame the Smoot-Hawley tariffs for prolonging the Great Depression.\nMore recently, the U.S. tariffs Trump levied on Chinese goods were met with retaliatory tariffs. In April 2018, the Chinese government introduced tariffs of 15% and 25% on 94 food and agricultural products from the U.S. Meanwhile, China dropped its average tariff rate on imported goods from other countries between early 2018 and 2022. In the current unfolding trade war, Mexico and Canada have both vowed retaliatory tariffs, while China has appealed to the WTO."

      "text": "Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nIn recent months, news of the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive and ever-evolving tariff policy has been dominating headlines. And Americans are concerned about how higher tariffs will impact their ability to afford daily essentials.\nA baseline 10% tariff went into effect on April 5 for all affected imports into the U.S. In response, China raised its duties on imports of U.S. goods to 125% (from 84%), and tariffs on Chinese imports have skyrocketed to \"a 125% reciprocal tariff, a 20% tariff to address the fentanyl crisis, and Section 301 tariffs on specific goods, between 7.5% and 100%.\"\nThese tariffs increase the cost for businesses to bring foreign products into the country. So, to maintain profit margins, companies often pass those costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices. There\u2019s no telling how much higher these tariffs will go or how long they\u2019ll be in place, but there are steps you can take to reduce the impact these policies have on your wallet.\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nWhat are tariffs?\nIn short, tariffs are taxes imposed by the government on imported goods. They\u2019re usually charged as a percentage of the item's value and are paid by the importer when the product enters the country.\nAccording to recent estimates by the Center for American Progress, the typical American household can now expect to pay an average of $4,600 annually because of Trump\u2019s tariffs. A different analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale estimated that the annualized cost of Trump\u2019s new tariff scheme for the typical American family is $4,700.\nRead more: Trump's tariffs: What they mean for the economy and your wallet\n5 ways to tariff-proof your finances\nTariffs can be a frightening prospect for consumers because there\u2019s no way to predict how high tariffs will get and how deeply they will impact your personal finances. However, there are still steps you can take to prepare yourself and your wallet for the potential impacts.\n1. Prioritize your savings\nWhen prices rise, it may be harder to justify setting aside cash in a savings account. However, higher costs make it more important than ever to ensure you have a solid financial safety net.\n\u201cKeep building that emergency fund,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree. Most experts recommend saving up at least six months\u2019 worth of expenses. This financial cushion can help you absorb sudden increases in the cost of essentials as well as avoid going into debt if your monthly expenses outpace your budget or if an unexpected bill hits during a period of higher inflation.\n2. Cut back on nonessentials\nNow is a good time to reevaluate your budget and see where you can cut back, especially on nonessential purchases (aka discretionary spending). For example, you can freeze memberships you aren\u2019t using, downgrade subscriptions to versions with ads, or even try a no-spend challenge.\nReducing your discretionary spending \u2014 even if it\u2019s temporarily \u2014 can open up more cash flow to put toward essential bills, savings, and debt repayment.\nRead more: Your complete guide to budgeting for 2025\n3. Re-think debt repayment\nWith prices on the rise, it could make sense to adjust your debt repayment strategy.\n\u201cMoney you have to put toward paying down credit card debt or other high-interest debt is money that can\u2019t go toward putting food on the table, building an emergency fund, or reaching other financial goals,\u201d Schulz said. \u201cIt\u2019s also money that can\u2019t be used to offset rising prices.\u201d\nIn other words, aggressively paying down your debts may not be the best move right now, depending on how much extra money you have in your budget. Instead, Schultz suggested using a 0% balance transfer credit card or low-interest personal loan to consolidate those debts and decrease the amount of interest you\u2019re paying. Again, this can help improve your cash flow if money is tight.\n4. Shop smarter\nWhen tariffs are driving prices up, being intentional about what, where, and how you buy is key.\nFor example, you may consider stocking up on nonperishables and household staples before prices rise further. If you have a large family, it could make sense to join a warehouse club (such as Costco or Sam\u2019s Club) to save on the per-unit cost of frequently used items in your home.\nAdditionally, avoid spending on products that are impacted more heavily by higher tariffs, such as electronics, toys, and clothing. You can also use cash-back apps such as Rakuten, Honey, or Ibotta to earn back money on essentials.\n5. Speak to a professional\nIf you\u2019re struggling to manage your finances and aren\u2019t sure what your priorities should be, it can help to consult a financial planner. They can help you come up with a tailored plan to pay off debt, meet your savings goals, improve the return on your investments, and create a budget with these goals in mind.\n\u201cRegardless of whether tariffs are implemented, your goals are still your goals,\u201d Schulz said. For instance, you still need to invest in your retirement. You may also be saving money to buy a home, pay for your kid\u2019s college education, or pay for a wedding. \u201cThese things still matter, so don\u2019t let uncertainty around tariffs keep you from focusing on them,\u201d he said.\nRead more: What is a financial advisor, and what do they do?"

      "text": "An appeals court has ruled that President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs can stay in place for now while the legal fight over the levies proceeds. Yahoo Finance Senior Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan reports the details in the video above.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.\nAnd uh, now turning to the legal battle involving President Trump's tariffs, let's get to Alexis with the latest on that. So, a temporary reprieve.\nAnother reprieve, and this comes from a federal appeals court for the federal circuit in Washington, D.C. They said that Trump tariffs, these liberation day tariffs, uh that they can remain in place while the court considers the broader issue, right? And that is whether President Trump had authority under that emergency act to enact these tariffs by executive order. The court issued an expedited schedule. They want the parties, the challengers and both the Trump administration, to put their arguments out there, be prepared to go to oral argument on July 31st. The court said that this issue is of exceptional importance. Now, at a minimum, though, this stay, this reprieve, it buys the administration some additional negotiating time, right? Because if the administration is to reach some agreements country by country, to an extent, this becomes a moot issue, right? Maybe not for an appeals court, maybe not for a potential Supreme Court argument as to any president's authority under the act that the president used, the IEEPA. But if a deal is reached then there's some headway there for the administration. So, meanwhile, you can expect that this appeals court will go forward. Sometime after July 31st we'll get a decision from the court. And then the Trump administration has promised that if it doesn't get what it wants it will go to the Supreme Court. And asking for this stay, the Trump administration told the appeals court this: they said the trade court's injunction, that's the lower court here that invalidated the tariffs, that they uh, unilaterally diminished America's bargaining position, the administration said, during a sensitive trade negotiation time and encouraged other nations to hold our nation hostage. So for now, on pause and that timeline there we can expect something after July 31st.\nWhat are your thoughts, Alexis, on whether the Supreme Court would address this issue while it's on summer recess?\nYeah. You know, this is an issue that has not been taken up by the Supreme Court. They have not considered this particular emergency act and whether the president has this extent of authority. So, they very well might. We just don't know. But what it does, though, is the timing of this. It would put an appeal to the Supreme Court right in the center of the beginning right in the beginning really of its summer recess. So, that would mean that the court would have to decide on yet another stay, which the parties would ask for, which the administration would ask for, uh, that would bring them back in to issue some kind of emergency decision where we might not learn what their thoughts are on these broader issues."

  "argos_summary": "The Justice Department has warned American companies that they may face prosecution for evading President Trump's tariffs, as it shifts to a more aggressive enforcement stance. This includes increased investigations into misclassified imports and potential criminal charges for tariff evasion. Meanwhile, the legality of these tariffs is being challenged in court, with oral arguments scheduled, as small businesses argue that Trump's authority to impose such duties is questionable. The DOJ's new approach marks a significant change from previous administrations, focusing on criminal rather than administrative enforcement.",
