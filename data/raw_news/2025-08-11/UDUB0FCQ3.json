  "content": "With warm summer evenings the perfect opportunity to enjoy some backyard or garden entertainment, Bluetti has teamed up with two other brands to offer up to 10% off on their portable power, projector, or AR glasses.\n\nPairing Yaber\u2019s battery-powered projector with BLUETTI\u2019s power station provides nearly ten hours of non-stop viewing under the stars, while RayNeo AR glasses deliver an immersive personal entertainment experience.\n\nIn this campaign, dubbed A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, customers can enjoy up to 10% off any one or more of these market-leading products\u2014with one exclusive code that applies to all brands.\n\nAs the latest 1kWh model following the fan-favorite AC180 portable power station, the Elite 100 V2 Portable Power Station takes center stage this season as the campaign\u2019s power hub. It\u2019s upgraded with a smaller, lighter design to handle everything from backyard movie nights to gaming sessions in the wild. With a powerful 1,800W output, it effortlessly powers not only portable projectors but also AR glasses, game consoles, and other accessories \u2014 delivering extended playtime and enhanced comfort.\n\nWith 11 versatile output ports \u2014 including AC outlets, USB-C, and USB-A \u2014 the Elite 100 V2 keeps all your essentials running, from iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks to Switch controllers and projectors. It\u2019s just as ready for backyard hangouts as it is for remote off-grid adventures.\n\nTeaming up with BLUETTI, Yaber brings the cinema to your garden with the Yaber T2 Plus GTV, a projector featuring Google TV, Netflix, and Dolby Audio via JBL speakers. On its own, the projector runs for 2.5 hours \u2014 but when paired with the Elite 100 V2, you\u2019ll get up to 10 hours of uninterrupted movie magic.\n\nFor those moments when you\u2019re the only movie or gaming fan in the house (or on a plane, or in a hotel room\u2026), the RayNeo Air 3 AR Glasses deliver an amazing solo entertainment experience. Powered by the Elite 100 V2, they don\u2019t just last longer \u2014 your connected devices like a PC or Nintendo Switch do too. And with the Elite 100 V2\u2019s whisper-quiet 30-decibel operation, you can stay immersed without distractions.\n\nA Summer Collab That Saves You More\n\nThe best part? You don\u2019t have to grab all three to unlock savings. Whether you\u2019re eyeing one, two, or the full summer trio, just sign up to get an exclusive cross-brand code\u2014with up to 10% off on all three. Want more? Extra bonuses can be unlocked through the brands\u2019 official social channels.\n\n\n\nWant more ways to keep your summer powered? Check out portable power stations perfect for camping, along with reliable home battery backup solutions built for hurricane season and beyond.",

It\u2019s a comprehensive home energy management system that features high-tech components like grids, solar panels, batteries, and regulators.\nThe whole system is a blend of energy storage, power supply, backup power, and grid interaction. As it sounds, batteries store electricity when the electricity demand is low and supply power whenever needed. Modern home battery backup systems can automatically switch to backup mode in case of a power outage and keep your electronics running.\nWhen it comes to the functionality of a home battery backup, it depends on the type of system you have. You have a choice between solar backup systems, off-grid solar batteries, and standalone backup systems. While standalone batteries use AC electricity to fulfill the storage, solar ones utilize the sun\u2019s energy and come up as a sustainable option.\nSolar home battery backup systems convert sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity using solar panels. The batteries store the DC electricity, and the inverter converts it into usable alternating current (AC) electricity. If you have a grid-tied system, excessive power will go to the grid and allow you to redeem it as an energy bill credit.\nThe most obvious advantage of a reliable home battery backup is the consistent power supply. During electric outages, the power storage system takes over and provides the required amount of electricity. Also, sudden electric outages may damage your appliances or interrupt your daily processes. Home battery backup systems instantly give power to your appliances and maintain your comfort.\nWhen you have a secondary source of energy, you don\u2019t have to completely rely on utilities. With a home battery backup, you can utilize your energy storage whenever you want. It allows you to generate onsite, offset grid electricity purchases, and reduce your utility dependence.\nA home battery backup system based on solar energy can sustainably produce emission-free electricity. You can minimize the use of utility-scale electricity made from natural gas, coal, and other fossil fuels. Henceforth, you\u2019re contributing to environmental conservation while saving your money on bills.\nIf you live in areas that have time-of-use electricity rates, a home battery backup system can make your energy purchases smarter. Let\u2019s understand with an example. Suppose you\u2019re paying 30 cents per kWh during billing hours. You can utilize your stored energy at peak hours to use appliances with high energy demand. It will help you cut on the premium prices you\u2019re paying for electricity in peak hours.\nWe have noticed frequent power instability in regions like California and Texas. Surprisingly, over 1 million residents experienced power outages in California. BLUETTI understands this power instability and has innovated high-quality home battery backup systems. If you also live in one of the areas facing frequent power outages, our solutions worth your while.\nBLUETTI battery backup systems feature a specific UPS mode optimized to backup power within 20ms. It instantly switches to stored energy and ensures your essential devices keep working during the outage.\nAs every home has its unique requirements, we have crafted our products to be expandable. Our home battery backup system AC500 can connect up to six B300S batteries and provide a capacity of up to 18,432Wh.\nDespite having a massive battery capacity, battery can rapidly charge up to 80% in just 45 minutes. The credit goes to the Turbo Charge mode and AC+DC dual charging capacity. Also, it features an incredible max charging rate of 8000W.\nAs discussed above, AC500 can generate up to 5000W continuous output. Guess what? It\u2019s only with a single chase! At its peak and with support for 50A bypass, it can even generate up to 10000W, which is enough for all the devices and electronics you might have.\nInstallation of a regular home battery backup can cost anywhere from $3000 to $15000 in the US. Even after spending this much, you still have to experience installation complexity and alterations to your home\u2019s design. That\u2019s where BLUETTI\u2019s home battery backup systems with modular design shine!\nBLUETTI manufactures green storage solutions while keeping convenience and customer experience in mind. Our products support plug-and-play installation, which is convenient, transportable, and cost-effective.\nThanks to the modular battery design, BLUETTI home battery backup systems are easily scalable. You can easily add additional batteries for greater capacity, extended battery life, and power autonomy.\nWith an exclusive variety of products, BLUETTI gives you access to green energy on the go. Our home battery backup systems have a flexible application that enables you to detach one unit from the complete setup. Whether you\u2019re going camping or on a long trip, you can carry a part of your energy storage with you.\nWe have already discussed about the high prices of utilities in the above section. Well, there\u2019s more. There\u2019s a huge difference between peak and off-peak prices. While the price during peak hours is 30 cents per kWh, the off-peak price is just 30 cents per kWh. The integration of smart technologies in BLUETTI systems can help in saving on your electricity bills. Let\u2019s see how!\nBLUETTI home battery backup solutions spotlight a specific PV priority UPS mode. You can prioritize solar power usage and harness 3000W PV output. Not only will it help you reduce your utility bills, but this mode will also reduce your dependence on the grid.\nAlong with PV priority mode, our products also feature peak shaving technology. There\u2019s a Time-Controlled UPS Mode that allows you to charge your batteries during off-peak hours. When the costly peak hours start, you can use the stored energy and lower your cost.\nCustomization matters, and our user-defined settings set a benchmark. BLUETTI home battery backup systems have customizable UPS mode. It allows you to set PV charging and power supply times and amounts for maximum savings.\nRV trips and stays are fun, but standard power systems generally fail to meet electricity needs. Users end up opting for traditional gas generators, which are noisy, polluting, and harmful to the environment. With BLUETTI battery backup systems, you can overcome these obstacles and enjoy consistent power to your appliances without any daunting upgrades.\nWith an impressive 5000W AC output, BLUETTI AC500 can power the entire RV. Just connect it to RV\u2019s NEMA TT-30 charging cable, and you\u2019re good to go. Also, the solar home battery backup system features 12V, 30A DC output to power the DC loads of your RV.\nIf you hate gas generators for their noisy operation, our solar battery backup systems will thrill you. BLUETTI products operate below 40db and come with efficient LFP batteries for an environment-friendly operation.\nD480 quick charge module is advanced charging technology that supports fast charging while driving. Furthermore, our systems also support PV, RV charging stations, and EV charges for extended RV power during trips.\nSafety and security mean a lot when it comes to powering an entire home off the grid. BLUETTI products incorporate UL-certified LiFePO4 battery cells with 3000+ cycles. Besides that, battery management system (BMS) and Pure Sine Wave Output add multiple layers of protection and safety to sensitive electronics.\nAs the name describes, a home battery backup is a perfect residential backup. BLUETTI battery backup systems are expandable and offer high AC output. Therefore, you can keep your essential devices running during the outages.\nOutdoor adventures and RVs require a reliable electricity source on the go. Our home battery backup systems can also be installed in RVs to power electronics. Not to mention, the detachable design allows you to carry one unit of the primary system without compromising the performance.\nApart from trips, BLUETTI power backup systems are also perfect for professional usage.
