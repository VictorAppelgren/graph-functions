  "title": "How The Thursday Murder Club transformed a Hertfordshire village",
  "description": "The picturesque village is hoping the films crews will return.",
  "content": "A village used in the movie adaptation of The Thursday Murder Club book has been improved using money from the Netflix production crew. Helen Mirren was part of the team that filmed at Aldbury in Hertfordshire during July 2024. In that time, the village was transformed into Fairhaven, the setting of Richard Osman's 2020 murder mystery novel. Aldbury Parish Council has told the BBC that funds from the filming have gone towards improving the common, refurbishing a school playground and adding a duck house to the village pond.\n\nRay Warren, vice chair of the authority, wanted the production team to come back and film more. \"We didn't have a moment's problem with them,\" he said. \"It's one of those things where you have to balance the disruption to the village versus the benefit of having that income. \"I think generally speaking, most people in the village recognise that having them come in, spend money in the village with us, has been really, really helpful because we've ploughed all that back into the village.\"\n\nDuring filming, the production team altered the village to transform it into the fictional Fairhaven. The village hall was redecorated to look like a police station, fake signs were added, and nearly 40 white posts were installed in the common near the duck pond. While most of these additions were removed when filming was completed, the white posts remained because villagers liked them so much. Mr Warren said: \"They were a legacy from the filming. When they came in, they changed a lot of things in the village to make it look more authentic. \"So all those white posts were left behind for us... They were fantastic.\"\n\nCouncil clerk Gosia Turczyn watched as Miren filmed a scene outside the fake police station on the star's birthday. She recalled: \"When Helen Mirren had her car picking her up after shooting, we sang Happy Birthday... So, she received a small cake and then everyone sang her a Happy Birthday.\" Some villagers were also paid for use of their homes, and free coffee was given to residents.",

      "text": "Richard Osman: I'm terrible at playing detective\n- Published\nIn just four years, Richard Osman has transformed himself from a TV presenter and producer into a best-selling author.\nBut despite having a knack for writing cosy crime, he admits to the BBC he is \"terrible at playing detective\".\n\"My grandfather solved crimes for a living and my mum would watch any Sunday night crime drama, and within five minutes know who done it.\n\"I think I'm brilliant but I'm always wrong. My wife and I think we know who did it and then at the end we both don't get it right,\" Osman says.\nHis hugely popular Thursday Murder Club mystery novels follow a group of elderly amateur sleuths living in a peaceful retirement village. The first book has already been snapped up by director Steven Spielberg, who is producing an adaptation for Netflix.\nOsman has now turned his attention to a new crime series.\nWe Solve Murders, sees Steve and Amy, a retired ex-cop and his bodyguard daughter-in-law, jet set across the world to solve a string of murders.\nBut the crime-busting duo couldn't be more different.\n\"Steve\u2019s an ex-cop who just wants a quiet life, but he\u2019s reluctantly dragged into this adventure by Amy, who\u2019s got this energy and drive that pulls him along,\" explains Osman.\nWhile most people's relationship with their in-laws is civil at best, Osman wanted to turn the stereotype on its head and explore the idea of found families.\n\"I find the idea very moving,\" Osman says. \"I wanted to bring together two people who wouldn't naturally cross paths like Steve and Amy. They're an unlikely pair, but their relationship is filled with love and respect.\"\nAlthough the backdrops of private jets and luxurious destinations is a marked difference from the quaint Kent village setting of his first crime series, Osman says the book has the same \"warmth and type of characters\".\n'Found a use for ChatGPT'\nOne of the most humorous elements in Osman\u2019s latest novel involves the use of AI, with the murderer concealing his identity by asking ChatGPT to write his emails in the style of a friendly English gentleman.\n\"I have finally found a good use for ChatGPT, because I don't think there's been one before,\" Osman says.\nDespite pretending to use it in his books, Osman hasn't been tempted to see if it can help him write his next novel.\n\"It can certainly help you write a letter to your electricity company, but I'm sure it definitely can't write a book - it's so flat.\"\nHe doesn't worry about AI replacing roles in the arts as he says: \"AI is not going to write Succession anytime soon, or a Kate Atkinson novel. There's always going to be room for great culture that comes from the human heart rather than a machine's head.\"\nIn his new novel, Osman also touches on the world of social media influencers.\nThe murderer's victims are influencers - the kind flogging vitamin drinks and lip fillers in the search of fame and money, which Osman says makes them the perfect character.\n\"I was reading that influencers were being used to smuggle things because no one questions why they're going to Dubai or the Cayman Islands all the time with either no luggage, or lots of it.\n\"They spend their lives travelling around the world but actually if you look behind the curtain, they don't have any money so they are the perfect people to abuse if you're a criminal gang because you can always take advantage of someone like that.\"\nBut Osman says there's another side to the influencer lifestyle, one that can help those from less privileged backgrounds break into the media industry.\n\"If you're a young working-class kid and you've got talent, there's an avenue to money that didn't used to exist,\" he explains.\n\"Social media has given working-class talent a way to bypass the traditional gatekeepers of television.\"\nOsman says there were barely any working-class people in the TV industry when he joined and \"even fewer people now\".\nHe was fortunate to have attended university on a scholarship and received housing benefits to move to London, so he was able to take a low-paid job in the industry, but in today's world \"I would not be able to do what I do now\".\n\"Traditional media industry is in such decline that there's not an awful lot it can do to help working-class kids get jobs,\" Osman explains.\nInstead he says that young people are having \"to do it by themselves and lean into the world of self-promotion\".\nWhile there's a buzz around his new book, Osman's fans are most excited about what's next in store for The Thursday Murder Club.\n'Trust the process'\nThe book series has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, and all four of the books in the series have broken UK sales records.\nOsman is now in the process of writing the fifth book in the series - after spending time on the set of the upcoming film adaptation.\nThe Netflix film features a stellar cast including Helen Mirren, David Tennant and Pierce Brosnan, with Harry Potter director Chris Columbus calling the shots.\nOsman says he is just as excited as his fans to watch it. \"I go down on set and it's incredible, it feels like an absolute treat and I can't wait to see it.\"\nHe has also learnt to let go of any protectiveness he might feel around the story.\n\"You just have to give it all up and trust people,\" he says. \"I take care of the books because that's what I'm good at, and I leave the film to the people who can do that.\"\n\"Nobody wants me looking over Spielberg's shoulder telling him what to do.\"\nThe Pointless and House of Games star has achieved immense success in TV and now also in the world of fiction writing, but he never allows himself to get complacent.\n\"Every bit of success is gravy but I just always think 'I need to go and write the next thing now.'\"\nAnd, what is next for the 53-year-old?\n\"The fifth Thursday Murder Club is out next September and I try to do a book a year, so then there'll be a second We Solve Murders after that and the series will sort of piggyback each other for the next few years.\n\"Unless, of course, it's a total disaster, in which case this book was always designed to be a one-off!\"\nRelated topics\n- Published27 August 2020\n- Published13 May 2021\n- Published13 September 2021"

The filming, which featured Helen Mirren and other stars, also brought economic benefits and local hospitality, such as birthday celebrations for Mirren.

The village council expressed enthusiasm for future filming opportunities, balancing disruption with financial gains.",
