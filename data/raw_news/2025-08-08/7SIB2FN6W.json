  "description": "The measures will be in place for all future home fixtures at the Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium.",
  "content": "Derry City Football Club are changing the way fans access their stadium following violent scenes during a match against Bohemian FC last month. Rival fans must now enter and leave through different gates at the Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium during all future home fixtures, starting with their match against Cork City on Friday evening. The new measures are being introduced by the League of Ireland side following discussions with the match-night security team. It comes after what the police described as \"pre-arranged\" violence on the streets surrounding the stadium on 25 July, leaving a teenage boy and a man in his 20s needing hospital treatment.\n\nWatch: Footage of disorder in Londonderry on Friday night\n\nBoth Derry City and Bohemian FC issued a joint statement last week condemning the \"disgraceful\" scenes witnessed on Lecky Road and Lone Moor Road. During the trouble, masked groups armed with sticks, bats, and iron bars clashed before and after the match, damaging cars and terrifying residents. Footage shared on social media showed fans fleeing as fireworks exploded near the stands, and the game itself was paused briefly when a flare ignited part of the pitch. Derry City had previously confirmed that the club had been working closely with security teams and the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to review match-day procedures and prevent further incidents.\n\n'Ensure safety and enjoyment of everyone'\n\nIn a statement, the club stressed that the revised entry plan which reduces home and fans mixing is aimed at keeping everyone in the ground safe. \"We appreciate that these changes may impact supporters' usual routes to the stadium,\" Derry City said. \"However, these adjustments are essential to ensure the safety and enjoyment of everyone attending matches at Brandywell.\" Effective immediately, gate nine, which was previously a main point of entry for many home fans will be reserved exclusively for away supporters, club staff, officials and guests. Home fans must now use either gate 19 (accessed via Lone Moor Road) or Gate 5 (located at the bottom of Brandywell Road and Southend Park). To improve the flow of fans and reduce queues, the club has commissioned seven new turnstiles, with one on Lone Moor Road, two on Brandywell Road and four on Southend Park. Hand scanners will be available at all gates as a back-up for the remainder of the season.",

      "text": "Football clubs issue joint statement condemning violence\n- Published\nDerry City FC and Bohemian FC have issued a joint statement condemning violence that occurred before and after their League of Ireland clash on Friday evening.\nA teenage boy and a man in his 20s needed hospital treatment after two groups attacked each other with sticks, bats and iron bars and damaged cars and property near the Ryan McBride Brandywell stadium.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) are trying to identify those involved in the violence on the Lecky Road and Lone Moor Road, which they believe was \"pre-arranged\".\nBoth clubs expressed \"great regret\" that disturbances involving individuals with \"no interest in supporting either team\" endangered the safety of genuine fans.\nSafety of everyone 'paramount'\nDisorder broke out during and after the match, which had to be stopped at one point after a flare set fire to the pitch.\nFootage on social media also shows fans ducking and running as fireworks explode around them.\nThe Football Association of Ireland (FAI) said they were investigating the trouble.\n\"The safety of everyone - supporters, players and staff - is, and will always be, of paramount importance,\" the clubs said in their statement issued on Monday evening.\nDerry City confirmed it has been working closely with its security team to review matchday procedures for visiting supporters.\nBoth clubs are also collaborating with the FAI as investigations continue.\nThe clubs concluded by stating they will make no further comment while the investigation remains ongoing.\nMichael Kerrigan, chairman of Pride of Northside Derry City supporters' club said those involved had nothing to do with football.\nHe said the violence was \"sad to see\", especially after the magnificent spectacle of the Foyle Cup last week which, he said, was hugely successful and a \"superb showcase for the city\".\nDonna Brown, who lives near the stadium, said she and fellow residents tried to chase the crowd.\nMs Brown said it was a \"scary\" experience, especially for families with young children.\nOne neighbour, she said, had to take her young son to stay with his grandmother because he was \"petrified\".\nShe said two neighbours' cars were damaged and the situation quickly became \"far too dangerous\".\n'Genuine supporters suffered'\nSteven Egan is a lifelong Bohemians fan who travelled to Derry for the match and he believes the two clubs now have a collective responsibility to prevent a repeat of the violence.\nThe sides are due to meet again at Dalymount Park in Dublin on 12 September.\n\"There were some thugs, obviously, who came up who had arranged something and what happened wasn't anything to do with the club or the genuine supporters,\" he said.\n\"But I think the genuine supporters were the ones who suffered from the retaliation.\n\"Attacking two or three hundred supporters, including elderly supporters and children and there were some pregnant women in there as well, who were boxed in to a cage essentially, is not the way to do it and I think the club needs to have some way of protecting away supporters from those situations.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Ciara Ferguson told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme: \"The clubs need to hold these young people to account.\"\nShe said the priority now was to identify those who orchestrated and carried out the violence and bring them to justice.\n\"We saw masked youths armed with weapons fighting on the street and then turning on the PSNI,\" she said.\n\"It was just terrifying for local residents, including children, who witnessed these events but, ultimately, any footage that is available needs to be sent to the PSNI.\"\nSDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan, who was at the match, said it was \"imperative\" that both clubs meet and take measures to ensure there is no repeat of the violence.\nHe described the scenes outside the stadium as \"disgraceful\" and \"deeply upsetting\" for local people and \"genuine supporters\".\n\"Many of them were leaving early, they were afraid,\" he said.\n\"I've never experienced an atmosphere like it at the Brandywell or at any football match anywhere.\"\nHe said there was no place for violence or intimidation at a football match and described those involved as \"thugs\" and \"hangers-on\".\nDUP MP for East Londonderry, Gregory Campbell, said the violence raised questions about future policing at Brandywell stadium, where the PSNI do not have a regular presence inside.\n\"Lessons need to be learned and there needs to be lessons whether or not it's going to be search and seizure of suspected people en route to the game,\" said Campbell.\n\"This happens very occasionally where people use a football as an excuse for a riot and that's what appears to have happened on Friday night, so action has to be taken to prevent that.\"\n- Published26 July"

It's really just disgusting,\" the assembly member added.\nOfficers were in attendance and worked along with stadium staff to bring the disorder under control.\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Padraig Delargy condemned those behind the incident.\nHe said it was \"terrifying for local residents, including children, who witnessed this appalling violence\".\n\"It threatened the safety and well-being of local residents and stands in stark contrast to the fantastic work that is going on in the area through the F\u00e9ile and the redevelopment of Meenan Square,\" Delargy said.\nThe game ended in a 1-1 draw.\nBBC News NI has contacted Derry City FC and Bohemians FC for comment."
