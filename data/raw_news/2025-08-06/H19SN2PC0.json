  "content": "Meghan Markle has repurposed a closet staple for her 44th birthday celebrations at Hollywood hotspot Funke in Beverly Hills last night.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex picked the white, embellished Valentino shift dress - decorated flower appliqu\u00e9s - for the occasion, with Meghan previously wearing knee-skimming frock in 2021.\n\nShe last reached for the dress, which retails for around \u00a34,000, when Meghan and Harry attended the Global Citizen Live charity concert in New York's Central Park in September 2021.\n\nAt the time, Meghan styled her dark locks in a sophisticated, loose ponytail - but the mother-of-two literally and figuratively let her hair down when she decided to restyle the dress for her birthday party on Tuesday, August 4.\n\nThe actress-turned-royal shared a photo of herself with closed eyes as she blew out the candles on her birthday cake.\n\n'Blowing out the candles on a beautiful 24 hours, and thanking my husband, friends and family for making it so special,' she captioned the celebratory post.\n\n'To those of you I don\u2019t know, but who send love every day \u2014 thank you so much. Please know I feel it and appreciate it \u2764\ufe0f,' she added.\n\nShe also gave her followers a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the festivities while joking she was going to 'get a little foodie on' them, as she revealed her party was held at Funke - the celebrity-loved restaurant frequented by stars like Kim Kardashian, Michelle Obama, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, Jennifer Lopez and Matt Damon.\n\nThe acclaimed restaurant is led by head chef and co-owner Evan Funke, who had previously opened Felix Trattoria in Los Angeles.\n\nSince opening in January 2023, the restaurant has earned a coveted spot in the Michelin dining guide and was ranked at 25 on the 101 Best Restaurants in LA list by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn October, Funke served as the location for Hailey Bieber's Rhode Skin launch party, where she was joined by her husband Justin Bieber.\n\nA year earlier, Kim Kardashian brought her own birthday celebrations to Funke as she turned 43.\n\nIn Meghan's caption, she praised Funke and his team for creating one of 'the top five meals of my life.'\n\n'Extraordinary \ud83c\udf5d Thank you for a standout dining experience,' she gushed.\n\nThe Suits star was dressed in an elegant white ensemble decorated with rhinestones as she leaned forward to blow out her candles in her photo.\n\nHer gorgeous cake appeared to have been frosted with meringue that was torched to a pleasant brown shade and decorated on top with flowers.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Meghan shared a series of rare personal messages on social media after several of her closest friends from her 'Montecito moms' circle and her days as an actress on Suits were quick to share tributes for her birthday.\n\nClose pals including Meghan's costar in the legal drama Abigail Spencer, Kelly McKee Zajfen, Tracy Robbins, Jamie Kern Lima all took to Instagram on Monday to share gushing compliments, calling the Duchess 'pure magic' and describing her as 'like sunshine in a bottle'.\n\nAnd in a rare move from the Duchess, she commented on their posts in a mutual display of affection.\n\nMeghan's long-time pal Abigail was the first to share a tribute to the Duchess, calling her 'Champagne in human form' and a 'sister in this life and beyond'.\n\nAs Abigail was also celebrating her birthday yesterday, Meghan fired back: 'Thank you, sweet Abs! Right back at you, and happy birthday to YOU! 44/4' - her comment referring to them both turning 44 on the fourth day of the month.\n\nKelly McKee Zajfen, a former model and co-founder of Alliance of Moms, has been friends with Meghan for many years after first meeting with the Duchess's ex-husband, Trevor Engelson.\n\nShe shared an unseen black-and-white photograph of herself and the mother-of-two laughing together, while standing beside a fountain.\n\nIn the photo, Meghan was wearing a stylish chain print blend dress from Veronica Beard, retailing at $635.\n\n'You\u2019re pure magic!! A force of fun, light, and so much love. Thank you for being the kind of friend who makes everything better (and way more fun). Here\u2019s to the best trip around the \u2600\ufe0f yet!\n\n'(This captures us perfectly! \u2728\u2728) Love you so very much!'\n\nMeghan replied: 'Thank you!', adding heart, cake and champagne emojis.\n\nThe Duchess also featured in several new photos shared by her close pal Tracy Robbins, who lives in Montecito and is married to Paramount boss Brian Robbins - with the couple occasionally going on double dates with Meghan and Prince Harry.\n\nTracy showed a very light-hearted and laidback side to Meghan, as they were seen giggling while enjoying cocktails together.\n\nIn one candid snap, Meghan couldn't contain her laughter as some of the foam from her cocktail landed on her nose.\n\n'Happy birthday my dear @meghan Oh how I can laugh and dance with you like no other. You are sunshine in a bottle!' Tracy gushed.\n\n'Thank you for always making time to be such a loving and connected friend no matter what's going on in your life. You dance through this life with so much grace, light and love!'\n\nReferring to her husband Prince Harry, and children Prince Archie, six, and Princess Lilibet, four, she added: 'I hope your wee posse of 3 are smothering you with hugs and kisses today my dear! Happiest of birthdays M!'\n\nKeeping it simple, Meghan commented a selection of pink and red heart emojis.\n\nTracy also shared a photo of Meghan and her husband Brian backstage at Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter tour - which they attended together in May at the SoFi stadium in California.\n\nShe added: 'Happy birthday M! Brian and I adore you!'\n\nJamie Kern Lima, who hosted Meghan on her podcast earlier this year, shared on her story: 'Happy Birthday @meghan thank you for being love, light and such a great friend to everyone who has the gift of truly knowing you!!!'\n\nSeconds later, she shared another image, holding a rainbow fruit platter they had made behind the scenes of the podcast: 'Happy Birthday @meghan Wonder had so much fun making this for you! Can't wait to see what we learn on Season 2 of your show! Thank you for being love, light and such a generous friend to everyone you meet!'\n\nMeghan's make-up artist pal Daniel Martin, who helped get the Duchess ready for her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry, meanwhile shared a sweet snap of Meghan and her beagle Mia in the garden of her Montecito mansion, simply writing 'HBD sis!'\n\nRounding off the tributes was actress Kerry Washington, who has been friends with Meghan since 2013, and said: 'To this beautiful (inside and out) @meghan Love you so much!'\n\nMeghan's As Ever brand has posted a gushing birthday tribute as she turned 44.\n\nHer lifestyle company took to Instagram with a black and white snapshot of the mother-of-two wearing a sundress and hat as she beamed into the distance.\n\nThe caption enthused about Meghan and her role leading the company.\n\n'Celebrating the woman behind it all,' it read.\n\n'She pours her heart, vision and magic touch into every detail, and today, we raise a glass to her! Happy birthday to our founder.'\n\nIt was then re-shared on As Ever's Instagram Story alongside two champagne flutes clinking together in celebration.\n\nOn Sunday, the eve of her 44th birthday, Meghan took to social media to share a teaser for her lifestyle brand.\n\nThe Duchess shared a video of herself carrying a wicker basket filled with flowers and bottles of As Ever Napa Valley ros\u00e9 laid in white linen.\n\nWhile Meghan's face did not feature in the video, it showed her wearing a short white dress as she frolicked in the grass, thought to be at her Montecito estate near Santa Barbara, California.\n\nShe showed off her stack of rings on her left ring finger, including her engagement ring, wedding ring and an infinity ring, estimated to be worth around \u00a3210,000.\n\nShe also wore a gold Cartier Love Bracelet, which costs up to \u00a37,050, and a gold Cartier Tank Watch that once belonged to Princess Diana, both of which she regularly wears.\n\nThe clip later showed a view of Meghan's swinging feet as she sits atop a stone garden wall, clad in \u00a3720 tan-coloured Hermes Santorini sandals.\n\nThe words 'Coming soon...' appeared over the video to tease the launch of her new 2024 Napa Valley ros\u00e9.\n\nShared on the official As Ever Instagram page last night, the caption read: 'Goodness in a glass. Right around the corner...Cheers to August!'\n\nMeghan's latest post comes after she announced another product coming to her As Ever line - although some of her customers were baffled as to what was actually new.\n\nThe Duchess launched her lifestyle brand As Ever earlier this year, releasing the first products in April, which included a range of teas, a raspberry spread, and a limited-edition wildflower honey with honeycomb, amongst other things.\n\nShe followed it up with an apricot spread and another honey, and in July, she expanded into the world of alcohol when she dropped her own wine - the 2023 Napa Valley ros\u00e9.\n\nEach release has been met with fierce excitement from her fans, and every product has sold out pretty quickly.\n\nNow, the Duchess of Sussex's brand has announced its newest product... but it might not garner the same amount of enthusiasm since it's not very different from her last item.\n\nThe company revealed on Wednesday that following the buzz surrounding the 2023 Napa Valley ros\u00e9, it will be launching another wine, with a slight tweak - calling it the 2024 Napa Valley ros\u00e9.\n\nAnd it vowed that it will pretty much taste the same as As Ever's first wine.\n\n'It marries the same harmony of notes from our first blend and creates an elegant medley of delicate yet memorable flavor,' reads a press release.\n\n'You'll want to clink glasses with friends as the sun sets, toasting to a summer of joy.\n\n'Barefoot or in sandals, dressed up or dressed down, this ros\u00e9 may become your favorite accessory for alfresco lunches and dinners at dusk.'\n\nIn the release, As Ever listed some of the positive feedback customers had given the company over its first ros\u00e9, which included comments like, '10 out of 10,' 'perfect,' and 'elevated flavor'.\n\n'This affirmed all of the love, time and effort our team, and our founder, poured into curating this blend to evoke the sun drenched spirit of Napa Valley, and the breathtaking tenor of the California Coast,' As Ever added.\n\n'Thank you for filling our cup. Now it's time for us to fill your glass! We are pleased to share that our 2024 Napa Valley ros\u00e9 will be available for purchase next week.'\n\nThe brand also posted to Instagram with a series of images showing the new wine resting in beach sand.\n\nIt was uploaded alongside a caption that read: 'Oh, how we love seeing the world through rose colored glasses. Ros\u00e9 colored glasses? Perhaps even better.\n\n'Our new vintage of As Ever's beloved ros\u00e9 is available next week.\n\n'Stay tuned for more details and timing.'\n\nAs Ever's first wine went on sale on July 1 and sold out within the hour.\n\nCustomers were able to purchase three bottles for $90, six bottles for $159, and 12 bottles for $300.\n\nLast month, the Daily Mail exclusively revealed that the alcoholic beverage is made by Fairwinds Estate, a California winery that creates bespoke wines for celebrities.\n\nThe 2023 Napa Valley ros\u00e9 is described on the bottle as a 'delicately balanced ros\u00e9 with soft notes of stone fruit, gentle minerality, and a lasting finish.'\n\nIt has a 14.5 per cent alcohol by volume for the 750ML bottle.\n\nThe Daily Mail FEMAIL team tried the ros\u00e9 and while the wine was smooth, we couldn't easily detect the notes of stone fruit. In fact, it tasted quite bland, and almost watery.\n\nIn addition, the ros\u00e9 had some acidic notes, leaving a somewhat uncomfortable sensation at the back of our throats after swallowing.\n\nIn the end, the verdict was the wine lacked flavor and tasted affordable and ordinary. It wasn't terrible - but it certainly wasn't great.\n\nWe felt the ros\u00e9 just didn't taste like you bought it at a fancy vineyard, where it's supposed to be made, but rather, like a wine you would be served at a work happy hour.\n\nThe FEMAIL team also reviewed her initial set of products, and found that Meghan's raspberry spread was too thin, too sweet, and very runny.\n\nHer hibiscus tea was extremely bitter with heavy notes of floral, with one taste tester comparing it to 'drinking lip balm.'\n\n'It tasted like dirty dishwater,' another FEMAIL writer shared.\n\nSome of us couldn't even bear to swallow it, as one person even spat it back into the cup.\n\nAs for her honey, we didn't enjoy the 'waxy' taste of the honeycomb or the super strong wildflower aftertaste.",

      "text": "After nearly a year of anticipation, Meghan Markle has finally unveiled her As Ever product line to the world - but was it really worth the wait?\nThe short answer: not really.\nNow, let me just preface this by explaining that I really wanted to like these products. I actually think that Meghan has impeccable style, and, I'll admit, I did cave and buy her gel nail polish colors off her new ShopMy page.\nI have been excited for the launch ever since she sent my idol, Kris Jenner, a jar of her homemade jam last year under the old brand name American Riviera Orchard.\nAnd, after watching With Love, Meghan on Netflix, I was looking forward to the product launch even more.\nAfter seeing that gorgeous, rented kitchen on TV, I was waiting to 'mimic the magic of Montecito' in my New York City studio apartment, as she promised in her recent newsletter.\nFEMAIL managed to get our hands on all eight sold-out products to put them to the test - including the oversold wildflower honey that was nearly impossible to buy.\nIt was the last item in our order to arrive, despite expediting it.\nAfter nearly a year of anticipation, Meghan Markle has finally unveiled her As Ever product line to the world - but was it really worth the wait?\nFEMAIL managed to get our hands on all eight sold-out products to put them to the test - including the oversold wildflower honey that was nearly impossible to buy\nAfter seeing that gorgeous, rented kitchen on TV, I was waiting to 'mimic the magic of Montecito' in my New York City studio apartment, as she promised in her recent newsletter\nBut, as we tested of the products in her As Ever line, nothing really stood out as especially worth it or special.\nWe felt like the baking mixes were tedious and difficult to make, while the jam proved to be more of a dessert sauce than a raspberry spread.\nSo without further ado, here is FEMAIL's official ranking as we share what's actually worth buying, and what you can leave behind in a shopping cart in Montecito.\n8. Herbal Hibiscus Tea, $12\nBy far the worst product that The Duchess is selling under the As Ever brand, according to DailyMail.com, is her hibiscus tea.\nIn fact, we felt so strongly about it, that we would recommend she completely stop making this kind of tea and pivot to a new flavor.\nThe tea arrived in a cute, 0.9oz can complete with the signature gold branding and palm tree logo, and came with 12 sachets.\nThe one highlight of this product was the sachets it came in, which appeared to be packaged in chic nylon baggies, giving it an elevated look compared to regular paper tea bags that you would find in everyday brands.\nBy far the worst product that The Duchess is selling under the As Ever brand is her hibiscus tea\nBefore we even took a sip, the tea had turned a bright red color, which was quite unappetizing, as it looked like the color of red 40 dye\nOn the back of the jar, Meghan shared that she liked to let the tea steep in a mason jar outside in the sun, but unfortunately, since we're in a corporate office and not a sprawling California backyard, we didn't get the chance to do that.\nHowever, we did follow the rest her directions, as we poured boiling water into a mug and let the tea bag steep for seven minutes.\nUnfortunately, we wished we had stopped there.\nBefore we even took a sip, the tea had turned a bright red color, which was rather alarming.\nThe tea itself was extremely bitter tasting with heavy notes of floral, with one taste tester comparing it to 'drinking lip balm.'\n'It tasted like dirty dishwater,' one FEMAIL writer shared. 'All the flavor was in the smell, somehow. It was the idea of a flavor.'\nSome of us couldn't even bear to swallow it, and one person even spat it back into the cup.\nSafe to say, FEMAIL was not a fan of the hibiscus tea, as it had a stronger scent than taste.\nSome of us couldn't even bear to swallow it, and one person even spit it back into the cup\n7. Herbal Peppermint Tea, $12\nThe As Ever Herbal Peppermint Tea had all of the same features as the hibiscus tea, but just with a different flavor - it came in the same size box with 12 sachets.\nNow, the Peppermint Tea wasn't necessarily as terrible as the hibiscus, but it had the same problem: it tasted like the idea of a mint tea.\nWhen we held up the tea to your mouth before taking a sip, we were immediately hit with a huge whiff of peppermint, but the tea itself tasted pretty bland.\nThe tea failed to leave a peppermint flavor lingering in our mouths, and was just quite a weak taste all around.\n6. Herbal Lemon Ginger Tea, $12\nSimilar to the other two teas, the Herbal Lemon Ginger Tea was lacking in strength, but it had the best flavor compared to the peppermint and hibiscus.\nThe Herbal Ginger Lemon Tea was definitely lighter on the lemon side and a bit heavier on the ginger, but not in a way that was overwhelming.\nSimilar to the other two teas, the Herbal Lemon Ginger Tea was lacking in strength, but it had the best flavor compared to the peppermint and hibiscus\nIt tasted like a nice blend of the two ingredients, but again, it wasn't super flavorful.\nIt definitely wasn't terrible, but we think that for $12, there are definitely other teas to consider.\nHowever, if Meghan were to keep one tea out of the three, she should definitely stick with this one.\nWe drank it hot, but it would taste nice with some ice in it during the summer, too.\n5. Flower Sprinkles, $15\nOkay, if you've watched even one minute of Meghan's show on Netflix, you would know that flower sprinkles are her thing, perhaps even more than 'her jam.'\nThroughout the series, she loves to put these sprinkles, which are essentially a colorful mix of dried-out flower pieces, on everything.\nAnd, not only did Meghan use the flower sprinkles to top her frosted donuts and yogurt parfaits, but she also used it to garnish tea sandwiches and crudit\u00e9 platters.\nOkay, if you've watched even one minute of Meghan's show on Netflix, you would know that flower sprinkles are her thing, perhaps even more than 'her jam'\nAnd, not only did Meghan use the flower sprinkles to top her frosted donuts and yogurt parfaits, but she also used it to garnish tea sandwiches and crudit\u00e9 platters\nSince these sprinkles were really the star of With Love, Meghan, she decided to sell her own for $15.\nThe first thing that really struck us here was the price. You can find similar products on Amazon for under $10, or even on Etsy.\nMeghan's are sold in a compact, gold 0.17g jar, with a clear top so that customers can immediately get a peek into the sprinkles.\nIt's worth noting that the package of sprinkles wasn't quite filled to the top, more like halfway.\nThe As Ever Flower Sprinkles come in a mix of red, yellow, orange and blue, but they look more like confetti than petals as they didn't seem to have much shape.\nThey smell floral, too, even though they're edible - almost the same exact scent as the hibiscus tea.\nThe flower sprinkles were fine, but they definitely didn't look as pretty as Meghan made them seem on the show. We felt like they were kind of unnecessary, and didn't 'elevate' anything to look much different than it already did.\nIf we didn't know any better, we would think the flower sprinkles were some kind of weird potpourri mix from the 1980s, like the ones your aunt probably keeps in her bathroom.\nThe As Ever Flower Sprinkles come in a mix of red, yellow, orange and blue, but they look more like confetti than petals as they didn't seem to have much shape\nThe flower sprinkles were fine, but they definitely didn't look as pretty as Meghan made them seem on the show\n4. As Ever Crepe Mix, $14\nThankfully, Meghan also included some baked goods in her rolodex of As Ever products, like this $14 crepe mix that she said 'remind her of her time backpacking through France as a student.'\n'Biting into these streetside thin pancakes - filled with chocolate, fruit, fresh lemon and powdered sugar, or made savory with ham and cheese - they truly are a canvas for flavor. I wanted to bring that memory and experience to you at home. (Also, they're so easy to make!)' she wrote in a recent newsletter.\nUm, excuse me, Megs - we beg to differ.\nWe're not sure if it was our lack of baking skills or the recipe itself, but we ran into a ton of trouble.\nMaking the batter itself was easy, as all we needed to add was one large egg, one cup and two tablespoons of water, and two tablespoons of melted butter.\nHowever, the batter was extremely thick and sticky, meaning that every time we tried to scoop some onto the hot pan, it got stuck on our spoon.\nIt was also hard to thin out these crepes once they hit the pan, and they came out much thicker than normal.\nMaking the batter itself was easy, as all we needed to add was one large egg, one cup and two tablespoons of water, and two tablespoons of melted butter\nMaureen Callahan described the final product as something that 'resulted in a flavor and mouthfeel most akin to undercooked pancakes.'\nBesides their yummy vanilla smell, it was overall a sticky, messy, and frankly gross thing to whip up - at least, for us.\nWhen another DailyMail.com colleague attempted to make the mix, they also had some difficulty.\nOne person said it took them about six tries to get it right.\nColumnist Maureen Callahan described the final product as something that 'resulted in a flavor and mouthfeel most akin to undercooked pancakes.'\nOther taste testers described the flavors as 'nothing special' and 'bland,' suggesting that it would be easier and tastier to make them from scratch.\n'It's like they're either undercooked or burnt and no in between,' one Daily Mail writer said.\n3. Raspberry Spread in Keepsake Packaging, $14\nOf course, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of this entire launch was Meghan's Raspberry Spread, which came in a special Keepsake Packaging for $14 in the first drop.\nOf course, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of this entire launch was Meghan's Raspberry Spread, which came in a special Keepsake Packaging for $14 in the first drop.\nAs for the taste, it's extremely sweet - and we mean really sweet. It is reminiscent of a sugary, raspberry dessert sauce rather than a jam or spread that's meant to be eaten on a piece of toast\nThe confection, which Meghan has cheesily described as 'her jam' many times, has had much hype surrounding the launch, as she sent 50 jars last year to famous friends such as Chrissy Teigen under the company's former name, American Riviera Orchard.\nBut make no mistake - her brand has now been rebranded to As Ever, and the company claims that the raspberry fruit spread 'is inspired by the recipe Meghan crafted in her home kitchen.'\nThe Duchess previously explained in an episode of her Netflix show that her preserves can't technically be called jam, because 'jam is equal parts sugar and fruit.'\n'I just don't think you can taste the fruit that way,' she suggested on the show.\nPer Food & Wine, jam is regulated by the FDA, and it must come from a single fruit, containing at least 45 percent fruit and 55 percent sugar.\nHowever, despite all the hype surrounding the product, FEMAIL was not impressed.\nImmediately upon opening the jar, we were taken aback by its texture. The spread was very liquid and quite thin - a bit 'loose,' if you will. If we hadn't known better, we'd have thought it melted during its expedited journey to us.\nThat being said, it is described by the brand as including a hint of lemon and a 'fluid texture.'\nTypically, a jar of jam is thicker and sticks together, whereas when we stuck our spoon into Meghan's raspberry spread, its consistency dripped off the silverware like a sauce. It was unappealing to say the least\nThe flavor was also surprisingly strong, which meant we could taste the sour lemon in the spread, which Meghan had promised in the product's description\nTypically, a jar of jam is thicker and sticks together, whereas when we stuck our spoon into Meghan's raspberry spread, its consistency dripped off the silverware like a sauce. It was unappealing to say the least.\nAs for the taste, it's extremely sweet - and we mean really sweet. It is reminiscent of a sugary, raspberry dessert sauce rather than a jam or spread that's meant to be eaten on a piece of toast.\nThe flavor was also surprisingly strong, which meant we could taste the sour lemon in the spread, which Meghan had promised in the product's description.\nAfter trying it by the spoonful, which left us grimacing from the sweetness, we spread some on a toasted piece of sourdough, which is where things began to take a turn for the worse.\nIt was difficult to eat the spread with the toast, as it was so thin that it dribbled everywhere and made a mess. Our once nicely toasted piece of bread became a sopping wet disaster after just a few minutes.\nDrizzled over vanilla ice cream, a piece of pie, or a big stack of pancakes, the spread may work, and may even shine. But on its own, or eaten as one would expect to be able to enjoy jam, the product crumbled, or rather dripped, under the pressure.\n2. Limited-edition Wildflower Honey with Honeycomb\nFEMAIL was lucky enough to get our hands on Meghan's limited-edition, $28 Wildflower Honey with Honeycomb, a product that was so popular, it accidentally oversold.\nFEMAIL was quite divided on this product - while some of us thought it was great, others didn't like the 'waxy' taste of the honeycomb\nIL was lucky enough to get our hands on Meghan's limited-edition, $28 Wildflower Honey with Honeycomb, a product that was so popular, it accidentally oversold\nThe precious jar of honey was the last thing to arrive in our order, and came packaged in a 9oz jar with the signature As Ever branding on it.\nFEMAIL was quite divided on this product - while some of us thought it was great, others didn't like the 'waxy' taste of the honeycomb.\nOne thing's for sure, though, is that it definitely leaves a super strong wildflower aftertaste in your mouth.\nThough, overall, we think that the honey deserves second place, as it was pretty tasty and non-offensive. The honeycomb made it feel more decadent, even though it was a bit plastic tasting.\nIn terms of Meghan's offerings, this is the one that felt the most luxe - something we think she should stick with.\nBut for $28, you're probably better off finding some honey at your local farmer's market.\n1. Shortbread Cookie Mix With Flower Sprinkles, $14\nNow, for the grand finale and ultimate winner - the shortbread cookie mix with flower sprinkles.\nShe instructs to add two sticks of softened butter to the mix, and then let the dough chill in the fridge for a minimum of one hour\nAlthough we burned the first batch, the dough made a lot of cookies, the rest of which we baked to golden-brown perfection\nThese cookies were definitely a home run, as everyone from our team thoroughly enjoyed them.\nWhile we admit that the dough was quite annoying (actually, really annoying) to make - involving a one-hour chill time in the fridge and sharp flower sprinkles, the end result was the most worth it out of all the products that Meghan sells.\nShe instructs to add two sticks of softened butter to the mix, and then let the dough chill in the fridge for a minimum of one hour.\nThe dough was easy enough to mix up, but it was so hard to mold as it kept crumbling in our hands, which ended up being covered in slippery butter by the end.\nHowever, the slightly tedious process was worth it, as the shortbread cookie was pretty tasty.\nAlthough we burned the first batch, the dough made a lot of cookies, the rest of which we baked to golden-brown perfection.\nThe cookies tasted like any other shortbread cookie, nice and light and very buttery.\nThey were also very soft, which we appreciated, and they stayed extremely fresh overnight.\nAll in all, Meghan's As Ever line is nothing to write home about. It's fine, but definitely not worth the price tag unless you're a Meghan Markle fan\nThe final result truly tasted like a perfect shortbread cookie. This fun mix was where Meghan really shined.\nIt wasn't anything special, but it would be fun to make if you have little kids, as the packet of flower sprinkles poured into the dough add a fun and whimsical touch, even though it looks like potpourri.\nThe final verdict\nAll in all, Meghan's As Ever line is nothing to write home about. It's fine, but definitely not worth the price tag unless you're a Meghan Markle fan.\nA handful of the products, like the hibiscus tea, flower sprinkles and raspberry spread, miss the mark. Those items can definitely be improved in the next launch if Meghan continues with the line.\nBut besides those standouts, everything else is just okay. It's not good, it's not bad, it's just fine.\nA lot of the products are things that we've all seen before, and FEMAIL agrees that we wouldn't purchase any of these products again, including the shortbread cookies, even though they were the tastiest out of the bunch.\nMeghan might want to work on a re-brand going forward - what about an exclusive As Ever picnic basket filled with things to make a children's birthday party sparkle, as she demonstrated in the Netflix episode filmed with comedian Mindy Kaling? Or a baked donut mix with a vanilla glaze as seen on TV?\nBut hey, what do we know? After all, jam is her jam.\nAs Ever,\nFEMAIL"

      "text": "How 'feminist' Meghan Markle has reinvented herself as a 'new Martha Stewart', according to expert\nMeghan Markle, a self-proclaimed feminist, has reinvented her image as a homemaker and lifestyle influencer, according to royal experts.\nAs a member of the Royal Family, Meghan vowed to continue her work for women's advocacy even when she stepped down from official royal duties with Prince Harry.\nBut since the launch of her eight-part Netflix series and lifestyle brand, As Ever, Meghan has appeared to turn her public persona to jam and flower sprinkles.\nThese claims were made as part of Channel 5's Meghan: Duchess For Sale? which aired on July 6 and explored the Duchess's money-making ventures.\nJack Royston, Newsweek's royal correspondent, said: 'That was her big rebrand.\n'All of a sudden, she went from being the feminist who got angry that women were depicted as only being in the kitchen and then she reinvented herself as the traditional, at-home, in-the-kitchen cooking and hosting kind of image.'\nNick Ede, a brand culture expert, said: 'With Love, Meghan, is Meghan being the new Martha Stewart.\n'She loves home, she loves entertaining and she wants to show people how to elevate everyday situations by offering them lifestyle advice, showing them how to cook different meals and interviewing people that she finds interesting along the way.'\nMeghan Markle, a self-proclaimed feminist, has re-invented her image as a homemaker and lifestyle influencer, according to royal experts\nNick Ede, a brand culture expert, said: 'With Love, Meghan, is Meghan being the new Martha Stewart'\nMartha Stewart (pictured) is an American cook and lifestyle guru\nBefore marrying Harry, Meghan gave a speech to UN Women encouraging women to become leaders.\nMeghan spoke about her accidental road to becoming an advocate at a star-studded celebration in March 2015 for the 20th anniversary of the Beijing women's conference that adopted a roadmap to achieve equality for women, which is the framework for UN Women's activities.\nHer opening words drew loud applause and cheers: 'I am proud to be a woman and a feminist.'\nBut ten years later, Meghan's Netflix series focuses on 'tips and tricks' to be a better homemaker and host.\nThe show received more than 2.6million views in its first week and formed part of her reported $100million, five-year deal with Netflix.\nThrough Meghan's brand As Ever, which was briefly known as American Riviera Orchard and her Netflix series, it is clear that Meghan is still toeing the line between being a royal and being an influencer.\nThe similarity in styling between Meghan's As Ever products and King Charles' Highgrove and Sandringham brands stunned some royal observers.\nWhile Charles' brands send their proceeds to charity, Meghan's products feature a high price point and are not affiliated with a charity.\nMost recently, the Daily Mail exclusively revealed that the jam is manufactured by The Republic of Tea.\nThe company, which also makes her honey and tea bags, is headquartered in Larkspur, California, 350 miles away from Meghan's Montecito mansion.\nHowever its factory is 2,000 miles away in Illinois.\nBefore marrying Prince Harry, Meghan gave a speech to UN Women encouraging women to become leaders\nLike Stewart's many TV shows, With Love, Meghan focuses on 'tips and tricks' to be a better homemaker and host such as how to perfectly cut a pineapple\nThe similarity between As Ever products and King Charles' Highgrove and Sandringham brands stunned some royal observers\nA promotional image for As Ever's orange blossom honey - made by the same firm as her raspberry spread, it has been confirmed\nMeghan has also been accused of using the Sussex name to make money and promote her brand.\nIn With Love, Meghan the Duchess corrected Mindy Kaling with her title - a clip which was shared and chastised on social media.\n'It's so funny you keep saying Meghan Markle, you know I'm Sussex now,' she awkwardly responded.\nWhen Mindy appeared confused, Meghan continued: 'You have kids, and you go, \"No, I share my name with my children.\" I didn't realise how meaningful it would be, but it means so much to say, \"This is our family name. Our little family name.\"'\nAfter being corrected, Mindy replied: 'Well, now I know and I love it.'\nMeghan also sent a gift basket to podcast host Jamie Kern Lima, which included a note referencing her royal title, HRH The Duchess of Sussex.\nThis went directly against an agreement made with the late Queen after Meghan and Harry stepped down as senior working royals.\nHarry and Meghan previously agreed not to use their HRH titles for commercial purposes following their exit from the British Royal Family in 2020.\nThe gift basket was sent to Meghan's friend, CEO of IT Cosmetics Jamie, when she had in-laws staying and the Duchess wanted to help.\nA screenshot of the hamper has since circulated online after featuring on Jamie's podcast - and features the Duchess' homemade jam.\nMeghan's As Ever products including her \u00a36.95 jam launched in April and rapidly sold out\nMeghan's flower sprinkles, which were one of her As Ever sell-out products, featured in her series\nHalfway through the chat the host revealed Meghan sent her a gift box of food and the thank you card around a year ago.\nThe basket also includes two jars of Straus ice cream, some flowers, mint, and the note with Meghan's royal title embellished on it.\nRoyal fans have reacted furiously to the name on the card with one writing on X: 'I thought they couldn't use HRH?'\nJamie said the basket was sent to her home by Meghan 'about a year ago\u2026 to see if that helps lighten my load'.\nIt was reported that Meghan still calls herself Her Royal Highness to friends but has denied she is flouting a warning by the late Queen.\nMailOnline spoke with a royal expert who claimed that while Meghan called herself a feminist, it is Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, who has stepped up and dedicated her work to feminist causes.\nRichard Fitzwilliams said: 'Meghan is struggling to be an influencer, Sophie has influence in ways that really matter, which Meghan could have been.\n'Meghan has always boasted about how she promotes feminism.\nIn With Love, Meghan the Duchess corrected Mindy Kaling with her title - a clip which was shared and chastised on social media\nThe gift basket was sent to Meghan Markle's friend, CEO of IT Cosmetics Jamie Kern Lima, when she had in-laws staying and the Duchess wanted to help out\n'Yet contrast the occasional speech she makes in comfortable surroundings with the remarkable work of Sophie who actually visits areas of the world such as Chad which have been devastated by war and attempts to comfort the women who are victims of rape and exploitation.\n'While Meghan sends pots of jam to celebrities, it is the Duchess of Edinburgh who meets survivors of conflict-related sexual violence and displaced women in a landmark visit to Ukraine.'\nEarlier this year Meghan opened a ShopMy storefront to earn commission on products through affiliate links.\nBut despite the negativity Meghan has faced for her lifestyle content, this is not the first time she has made money through this style of content.\nMeghan began writing her blog, The Tig, in 2014, during a time when sites such as BuzzFeed and Zooey Deschanel's HelloGiggles were extremely popular.\nOnline archives show Meghan posted articles relating to beauty, travel, recipes, workouts and interviews with celebrities.\nBetween The Tig and her role as Rachel Zane in Suits, Meghan had built a fortune.\nNick Ede said in the Channel 5 documentary: 'The Tig was very similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and it felt that it was authentically Meghan.\n'She actually saw that you could monetise it. You could look at how you could do affiliate links.'\nIt's nothing new for bloggers to turn their page into their own personal brand.\nIt seemed almost inevitable that Meghan would follow the likes of Ree Drummond and Martha Stewart who turned their brand to homeware, TV shows and book deals.\nHowever, according to bestselling author Tom Bower, the content on The Tig did not always accurately reflect Meghan's personal life or, at times, even her values.\nIn his book, Revenge: Meghan, Harry And The War Between The Windsors, he writes: 'As a purely commercial venture she understood her market and how to compartmentalise between her real life and the fantasy life she offered her increasing number of followers.\nThe Duchess of Sussex launched her 'passion project', a website called The Tig, back in 2014\nIt seemed almost inevitable that Meghan would follow the likes of Ree Drummond and Martha Stewart (pictured) who turned their brand to homeware, TV shows and book deals\nEarlier this year Meghan opened a ShopMy storefront to earn commission on products through affiliate links\n'Conjuring fantasies was her unique selling point.'\nLikewise, Meghan has faced criticism for portraying an unrealistic lifestyle in her new show, where she wears glamorous, often white outfits while carrying out simple kitchen tasks.\nAccording to Bower, it took Meghan a year to 'successfully' become an influencer with The Tig.\nAs part of her strategy to capitalise on her celebrity status, the former actress closely studied Hollywood's elite to 'absorb and copy' their success.\nAnd it seems that she may have taken a similar approach with her Netflix series, since viewers drew several comparisons between the show and former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson's series, Pamela's Cooking With Love.\nWhen Meghan began dating Harry, The Tig stopped producing content and eventually ceased to exist.\nIt is likely that even if Meghan had not become a member of the Royal Family, she would still be making lifestyle content.\nBut perhaps the difference now is that Meghan had the opportunity to use her platform for good instead of simply fame and notoriety."

      "text": "Brooke Shields brands Meghan 'too precious and serious' as she recalls interrupting her in front of thousands of people\n- Meghan joined Brooke on a panel for International Women's Day last year\n- READ MORE: What REALLY happened with young Meghan's advert complaint?\nBrooke Shields has revealed she interrupted Meghan Markle live on stage in front of thousands of people - because, she says, the Duchess of Sussex was being 'too precious' in her speech about gender equality.\nThe 60-year-old Hollywood actress shared the anecdote on the latest episode of India Hicks' podcast, which was released over the weekend.\nBrooke was discussing the International Women's Day panel in Austin, Texas, from March 2024, where she had been joined by Meghan on stage.\nWhen the discussion began, and the former Suits star, 43, started answering Katie's opening question, Brooke said the tone quickly became overly serious.\n'Katie asks the first question to Meghan and talks about how at a young age, she was already advocating for women, etcetera, etcetera,' Brooke explained.\n'[Meghan] starts telling a story about how when she was 11... And she keeps saying, well, when I was 11, I saw this commercial and they were talking about washing dishes and only soap for washing dishes was for women.\n'And she said, 'I didn't think only women wash dishes. It wasn't fair. So I wrote to the company. And when I was 11, I wrote my first letter and when I was 11...' and she kept saying she was 11! She wrote to the company, they changed the text, they changed the commercial.'\nAt that point, Brooke said, she couldn't resist breaking the tension in the room - and the earnestness of Meghan's response.\nMeghan Markle was 'too precious' and 'serious' as she told an anecdote on a panel for International Women's Day last year (pictured), according to Brooke Shields\nHollywood actress Brooke, 60, said she felt she needed to make the tone of the conversation more 'relaxed'\n'I go, \"Excuse me, I'm so sorry. I've got to interrupt you there for one minute,\"\n'I was trying not to be rude, but I wanted to be funny because it was so serious.\n'I just want to give everybody here a context as to how we're different,' Brooke told the audience. 'I said, 'Well, when I was 11, I was playing a prostitute.'\n'The place went insane. And then luckily, it was more relaxed after that.'\nThe comment was a reference to Brooke's breakout role as a child star in the controversial 1978 film Pretty Baby, in which she played a child sex worker - a role that sparked debate at the time and has remained the subject of intense scrutiny in the decades since.\nIn Austin, the moment broke the ice, as the crowd broke out into laughter.\n'I was like, oh, I hope she doesn't think I'm rude. I'm not being rude,' Brooke added.\nIndia - daughter of Lady Pamela Mountbatten, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II, and the late interior designer David Hicks, agreed that lightening the serious mood Meghan created was the right thing to do. 'I think it's genius,' she said.\nReflecting on the exchange, Brooke added: 'It was just too precious. And I was like, they're not going to want to sit here for 45 minutes and listen to anybody be precious or serious.'\nMeghan had been sharing one of her favourite anecdotes - of when she wrote to Proctor & Gamble at the age of 11\nMeghan was a speaker on the panel at the South by Southwest Conference (SXSW) in Austin,Texas in March last year\nMeghan, The Duchess of Sussex, Katie Couric, Brooke Shields and Nancy Wang Yuen take part in the keynote 'Breaking Barrier, Shaping Narratives: How Women Lead On and Off the Screen'\nDespite the crowd's response, Brooke acknowledged that the moment might not have gone down quite so well with Meghan herself.\n'This was in front of [thousands of people]. I mean, it was crazy,' she said. 'And then afterwards, she was kind of like, oh, okay. And I was like, let's just have some fun with it.'\nBrooke added: 'I don't know if you'll have to cut this out.'\nMeghan had been telling an anecdote she's referred to on many occasions about fighting a 'sexist' Proctor & Gamble commercial when she was just 11 years old.\nAged 11, Meghan wrote to Procter & Gamble to object to sexism in a dish soap advert which included the line: 'Mothers around America are fighting greasy pots and pans.'\nShe asked them to change the advert to 'people all over America' and the company amended the language.\nShe subsequently appeared in an interview on Nick News in 1993, saying she was 'furious' at the advert for P&G's Ivory Clear.\nBeaming with pride, Meghan had happily agreed to share the story with the crowd - having mentioned it at multiple events over the years.\nThe 60-year-old Hollywood actress shared the anecdote on the latest episode of India Hicks' (pictured) podcast, which was released over the weekend\nMeghan appeared on Nick News after lobbying the manufacturing company to change a TV ad for dishwasher liquid in 1993\n'I was 11 years old, about 11 years old, and I had seen a commercial on TV for a dishwashing liquid, and the boys in my class at the time... you know it said, 'Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans,' and the boys said, 'Yeah that's where women belong, in the kitchen,' Meghan recalled.\n'And at 11, I just found that infuriating, and [so] I ended up writing lots of letters, I put pen to paper, and they ended up changing the commercial to 'people all over America'.\n'It's funny looking back at it now because it was before social media that had such a reach.\n'I was just an 11-year-old with a pen and paper, but it just goes to show that if you know there's something wrong and you're using your voice to advocate in the direction of what is right, that can really land and resonate, and make a huge change for a lot of people.\n'So, your voice is not small, it just needs to be heard.'\nIt's one of Meghan's go-to tales, which she has previously credited with starting her life's 'trajectory' of speaking up against 'inequality'.\nThe Duchess often uses the childhood tale in her speeches and interviews, despite some questions being raised about its validity.\nIndeed, when Meghan tried to reference the letter her 11-year-old self wrote to P&G in her 2017 Vanity Fair cover, it was reportedly cut after it failed to pass the magazine's fact-checking.\n2015: Markle recalled the incident during a speech at the United Nations - once again to mark International Women's Day\n2019: Meghan once again discussed the exchange during a panel discussion hosted by King's College London for the annual celebration of women\nShe referenced the notorious Procter & Gamble tale yet again in her 'Afro women and power talk' in August last year\n'I don't think it is right for kids to grow up thinking that mom does everything,' Markle told Nick News in 1993.\n'If you see something that you don't like or offended by on television or any other place, write letters and send them to the right people and you can really make a difference, not just for yourself but for lots of other people.'\nYoung Meghan sent the letter to famed civil rights lawyer Gloria Allred, then-first lady Hillary Clinton, and Nick News anchor Linda Ellerbee.\nAfter Ellerbee received the letter, she and a camera crew from her show went to meet Markle.\nMeghan said she received letters of encouragement back from all three, including Clinton, and said it felt 'amazing' during her 2015 speech at the UN.\nBut the account was allegedly stripped out of a Vanity Fair cover story in 2017 after 'fact checkers raised questions about its accuracy,' a biography claimed in 2022 - as no evidence could be found of Meghan receiving a response from Clinton.\nThe anecdote was cut from the cover story 'after consulting P&G and advertising historians,' according to Tom Bower's book Revenge: Meghan, Harry and the War Between the Windsors.\nIn an extract from the book printed in The Times, he added: 'They could also find no evidence, as Meghan claimed, that she received a reply from [Hilary] Clinton.\n'Unknown to Kashner, Thomas Markle knew Clinton and P&G had not replied to Meghan. The success of her 'campaign' was fictitious, invented by an adoring father.\nMeghan Markle left people baffled over the weekend after sharing her latest kitchen 'hack' in a previously unseen clip from her Netflix show, With Love, Meghan\nIt's also unclear whether Meghan's letter alone persuaded P&G to change the advert.\nNevertheless, it's a story Meghan loves to tell - and was the first subject of her Archetypes podcast with Spotify, spending four minutes on the recollection before turning to her guest, Serena Williams.\nRecalling the letter in 2018, she said: 'Truth be told, at 11 I don't think I even knew what sexism meant.'\nShe continued: 'I just knew that something struck me internally that was telling me it was wrong.\n'And using that as my moral compass and moving through from the age of 11, at that age I was able to change this commercial.'\nShe added: 'It really set up the trajectory for me to say, if there was a wrong, if there is a lack of justice, and there is an inequality, then someone needs to do something. And why not me?'\nIn 2015, she recalled the incident during a speech at the United Nations - again to mark International Women's Day.\n'I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt,' Markle said in the speech.\n'It just wasn't right and something needed to be done.'\nThe Duchess of Sussex, 43, took to her Instagram account on Friday to share the short video that 'didn't make it in', which showed her cutting up a pineapple\nShe said at the time that her father, Thomas Markle, had inspired her to bring about change.\n'He encouraged me to write letters, so I did \u2014 to the most powerful people I could think of,' Meghan shared.\nAnd, once again in 2019, she discussed the exchange during a panel discussion, alongside musician Annie Lennox and former Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard, hosted by King's College London for the annual celebration of women.\nMeghan, who was pregnant with son Archie at the time, dished: 'Truth be told, at 11 I don't think I even knew what sexism meant. I just knew that something struck me internally that was telling me it was wrong, and I knew that it was wrong.\n'And using that as my moral compass and moving through from the age of 11, at that age I was able to change this commercial.'\nShe added: 'It really set up the trajectory for me to say, if there was a wrong, if there is a lack of justice, and there is an inequality, then someone needs to do something. And why not me?'\nDespite the disagreement between P&G and a young Meghan, any rift seemed to be put to bed in 2021, when Meghan and Harry's Archewell Foundation joined forces with the US consumer goods giant.\nOver the weekend, Meghan shared an extra scene from her Netflix show, With Love, Meghan, that 'didn't make it' into the final edit.\nIn the video, filmed in a rented $8million mansion near her and Prince Harry's Montecito home, Meghan was joined by wellness therapist Randi Karin as she explained how to properly cut a pineapple.\nMeghan said: 'A trick that people do with pineapple instead of just cutting it. To make the perfect little bite, you follow the wedge.\n'Nature has given you all the cues on how to have a perfect taste of something.'\nShe then cut around the pattern on the outside of the pineapple, and used the skin to pull out a chunk of the fruit before taking a bite.\nKarin then followed her lead, managing to perfect the hack, and said: 'Oh, how fun is that!'\nHowever, royal watchers were less convinced and thought Meghan was just stating the obvious - while others noted the 'trick' has been around for years and regularly circulates on social media platforms such as Facebook and Pinterest.\nMeghan Markle had her new Netflix show 'renewed for a second season' just days after the first episodes were panned by critics and fans\nShe also revealed that season two of the show has finished filming and looks set to release this summer.\nMeghan took the opportunity to tease 'all the fun to come' with her brand As Ever - which sold out earlier this year, and has yet to restock.\nShe said: 'Great weekend to rewatch or catch up on the show as we gear up for Season 2 this summer and all the fun to come with As Ever.'\nNews of 'With Love, Meghan' being renewed for a second season came in March, shortly after the first eight episodes of series one released on Netflix.\nDespite the show being largely panned by media outlets on both sides of the Atlantic, the controversy that continues to surround Meghan is said to be the reason TV bosses were convinced to renew.\nThe episodes feature Meghan inviting famous friends to a California estate where she shares cooking, gardening and hosting tips.\nHowever, the series was slammed by reviewers as 'gormless lifestyle filler' with a 'tangible desperation' following its release.\nOthers said it shows the Duchess is 'attempting to cling to fame by any means possible', while another described how she was 'joylessly filling kids' party bags with seeds'.\nGuardian TV writer Stuart Heritage said the series was 'so pointless it might be the Sussexes' last TV show' and 'might also be the final thing she makes for Netflix'.\nThe Telegraph gave the show just two stars. In a review, they said the series was an 'exercise in narcissism, filled with extravagant brunches, celebrity pals and business plugs'."

Literally for years she has been like this,' she said.\n'But I really was there just to support her and surround her.

Right around the corner...Cheers to August!'\nMeghan's latest post comes after she announced another product coming to her As Ever line - although some of her customers were baffled as to what was actually new.\nThe Duchess launched her lifestyle brand As ever earlier this year, releasing the first products in April, which included a range of teas, a raspberry spread, and a limited-edition wildflower honey with honeycomb, amongst other things.\nMeghan Markle (pictured, left) and Abigail Spencer (pictured, right) are seen while appearing in an episode of Suits\nShe followed it up with an apricot spread and another honey, and in July, she expanded into the world of alcohol when she dropped her own wine - the 2023 Napa Valley Ros\u00e9.\nEach release has been met with fierce excitement from her fans, and every product has sold out pretty quickly.\nNow, the Duchess of Sussex's brand has announced its newest product... but it might not garner the same amount of enthusiasm since it's not very different from her last item.\nThe company revealed on Wednesday that following the buzz surrounding the 2023 Napa Valley Ros\u00e9, it will be launching another wine, with a slight tweak - calling it the 2024 Napa Valley Ros\u00e9.\nAnd it vowed that it will pretty much taste the same as As Ever's first wine.\n'It marries the same harmony of notes from our first blend and creates an elegant medley of delicate yet memorable flavor,' reads a press release.\n'You'll want to clink glasses with friends as the sun sets, toasting to a summer of joy.\n'Barefoot or in sandals, dressed up or dressed down, this ros\u00e9 may become your favorite accessory for alfresco lunches and dinners at dusk.'\nIn the video, Meghan swings her Hermes-clad feet while sitting on a while, her basket filled with flowers and bottles of wine\nMeghan described her new bottles as 'goodness in a glass'\nMeghan Markle tried to stir up excitement over her new product announcement but it might be hard for customers to spot what's new with this one\nThe company revealed on Wednesday that following the buzz surrounding the 2023 Napa Valley Ros\u00e9 (seen), it will be launching another wine, called the 2024 Napa Valley Ros\u00e9\nIn the release, As Ever listed some of the positive feedback customers had given the company over its first ros\u00e9, which included comments like, '10 out of 10,' 'perfect,' and 'elevated flavor'.\n'This affirmed all of the love, time and effort our team, and our founder, poured into curating this blend to evoke the sun drenched spirit of Napa Valley, and the breathtaking tenor of the California Coast,' As Ever added.\n'Thank you for filling our cup. Now it's time for us to fill your glass! We are pleased to share that our 2024 Napa Valley Ros\u00e9 will be available for purchase next week.'\nThe brand also posted to Instagram with a series of images showing the new wine resting in beach sand.\nIt was uploaded alongside a caption that read: 'Oh, how we love seeing the world through rose colored glasses. Ros\u00e9 colored glasses? Perhaps even better.\n'Our new vintage of As Ever's beloved ros\u00e9 is available next week.\n'It marries the same harmony of notes from our first blend and creates an elegant medley of delicate yet memorable flavor,' reads a press release. The new wine is seen\nThe 2023 Napa Valley Ros\u00e9 is described on the bottle as a 'delicately balanced ros\u00e9 with soft notes of stone fruit, gentle minerality, and a lasting finish'\nThe Daily Mail FEMAIL team tried the ros\u00e9 and while the wine was smooth, we couldn't easily detect the notes of stone fruit. In fact, it tasted quite bland, and almost water-y\n'Stay tuned for more details and timing.'\nAs Ever's first wine went on sale on July 1 and sold out within the hour.\nCustomers were able to purchase three bottles for $90, six bottles for $159, and 12 bottles for $300.\nLast month, Daily Mail exclusively revealed that the alcoholic beverage is made by Fairwinds Estate, a California winery that creates bespoke wines for celebrities.\nThe 2023 Napa Valley Ros\u00e9 is described on the bottle as a 'delicately balanced ros\u00e9 with soft notes of stone fruit, gentle minerality, and a lasting finish.'\nIt has a 14.5 percent alcohol by volume for the 750ML bottle.\nThe Daily Mail FEMAIL team tried the ros\u00e9 and while the wine was smooth, we couldn't easily detect the notes of stone fruit. In fact, it tasted quite bland, and almost water-y.\nIn addition, the ros\u00e9 had some acidic notes, leaving a somewhat uncomfortable sensation at the back of our throats after swallowing.\nIn the end, the verdict was the wine lacked flavor and tasted affordable and ordinary. It wasn't terrible - but it certainly wasn't great.\nMeghan, 43, launched her lifestyle brand earlier this year, releasing the first products in April, which included a range of teas, a raspberry spread, and a lwildflower honey with honeycomb\nThe FEMAIL team also reviewed her initial set of products , and found that Meghan's raspberry spread was too thin, too sweet, and very runny\nHer hibiscus tea was extremely bitter with heavy notes of floral, with one taste tester comparing it to 'drinking lip balm'\nAs for her honey, we didn't enjoy the 'waxy' taste of the honeycomb or the super strong wildflower aftertaste\nWe felt the ros\u00e9 just didn't taste like you bought it at a fancy vineyard, where it's supposed to be made, but rather, like a wine you would be served at a work happy hour.\nThe FEMAIL team also reviewed her initial set of products, and found that Meghan's raspberry spread was too thin, too sweet, and very runny.\nHer hibiscus tea was extremely bitter with heavy notes of floral, with one taste tester comparing it to 'drinking lip balm.'\n'It tasted like dirty dishwater,' another FEMAIL writer shared.\nSome of us couldn't even bear to swallow it, as one person even spat it back into the cup.\nAs for her honey, we didn't enjoy the 'waxy' taste of the honeycomb or the super strong wildflower aftertaste."

Email tips@dailymail.com\nJennifer Lopez showcased her business style as she stepped out for a dinner with her manager in Beverly Hills on Friday night.\nThe outing followed some fraught moments earlier in the day when the hitmaker, 55, attended the same event with her kids Emme and Max, 16, that her ex-husband Ben Affleck and his former wife Jennifer Garner, both 52, attended with their 15-year-old child Fin.\nFor her meet up with manager Bennie Medina and friends at the popular Funke restaurant, Lopez showcased her toned form and a glimpse at her taut tummy in a curve-clinging light bronze midi skirt with a matching long-sleeve turtleneck top.\nThe Billboard Icon Award winner stepped out in transparent open-toed mules and carried a small taupe shoulder bag.\nHer light brown hair was styled in straight layers, and her makeup appeared camera ready, but still natural thanks to a neutral lip.\nJennifer Lopez showcased her business style as she stepped out for a dinner with her manager in Beverly Hills on Friday night\nAs she exited the restaurant, the Hustlers star refused to answer any questions about former boyfriend Sean 'Diddy' Combs, and his current legal issues.\nThe music mogul, 54, is being held without bail as he awaits trial on charges of sex trafficking, prostitution, kidnapping, bribery and arson following an federal investigation into allegations filed by women who say they were his victims.\nAdditionally, there are at least 18 civil suits that have been filed seeking monetary remuneration from the producer for his alleged abuse.\nLast week, Lopez opened up about her split from Affleck in a conversation with Nikki Glaser for Interview Magazine, describing the separation as both 'sad' and 'scary.'\nThe singer also discussed taking time before jumping into another relationship in the future and explained, 'You have to be healthy. You have to be complete, if you want something that's more complete.'\n'You have to be good on your own. I thought I learned that, but I didn't. And then, this summer, I had to be like, \"I need to go off and be on my own. I want to prove to myself that I can do that.\"'\nThe multi-hyphenate then revealed whether she has any regrets in regards to her marriage with the Good Will Hunting star.\nLopez, 55, showcased her toned form and a glimpse at her taut tummy in a curve-clinging light bronze midi skirt and long-sleeve turtleneck top. The Billboard Icon Award winner stepped out in transparent open toed mules and carried a small taupe shoulder bag\nAs she exited the restaurant the Hustlers star refused to answer any questions about former boyfriend Sean 'Diddy' Combs, 54, who is being held on federal charges of sex trafficking, prostitution, kidnapping, bribery and arson\n'Not one second. That doesn't mean it didn't almost take me out for good. It almost did,' she stated. As far a future romance is concerned, Lopez revealed she is 'not looking for anybody.'\nLopez later candidly admitted that her split from Affleck was 'f***ing hard' and added, 'It feels lonely, unfamiliar, scary. It feels sad. It feels desperate.'\nThe actress will be seen on the big screen next in Unstoppable, which debuted in September at the Toronto International Film Festival. Variety said her portrayal of the mother of a disabled athlete 'may be the fullest screen performance she has ever given.'\nUnstoppable is currently on the film festival circuit but will debut in limited release on December 6."

      "text": "The Duchess of Sussex was plunged into a copycat row last night when a British author revealed she had sent a legal letter pointing out what she considered to be 'striking similarities' between Meghan's first children's TV show and her own work.\n'Pearl', announced by the Duchess in July 2021, was an animated series about a little girl 'as she learns to step into her power and finds inspiration from influential women throughout history'.\nIt was a key title in the $100m deal struck between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the streaming giant in 2020.\nMeghan was credited as Executive Producer alongside Sir Elton John's husband David Furnish but the show was killed less than a year later, with Meghan swiftly removing all references to it from the website of her production company Archewell.\nNow, globally published children's writer Mel Elliott, 51, from Hastings, has disclosed that she sent a legal letter suggesting a potential infringement of copyright in relation to her own creation - a little British girl called Pearl Power.\nThe author and illustrator then followed up with two further personal letters.\nLast night Mel said: 'Meghan is a feminist who sticks up for other women, so I was disappointed and confused to see how similar Netflix's proposed show \"Pearl\" was to my own Pearl Power who had been created seven years earlier.\n'Of course, I can't know if anyone on her team had seen it and been inspired by it, but the similarities were too great for me to ignore.\nPearl was Meghan's planned Netflix animated series about a little girl 'as she learns to step into her power and finds inspiration from influential women throughout history'\nMel's lawyers wrote to the Duchess, care of Archewell, in July 2021: 'The similarities between your proposed animation series and my client's work appear to be too many and too striking to be mere coincidence'\nBy the time Meghan's new show was announced, Mel had already written three Pearl Power books, published in 2014, 2015 and 2016\n'The world of arts and media are very competitive and I'm afraid it's quite common for powerful to people to rip off the work of less well-known creatives - although I'm not saying that's what happened here.\n'What saddened me most is that, having brought the similarities between my Pearl and Meghan's Pearl to the attention of Netflix and Archewell, my objection was never acknowledged - neither Netflix nor Archewell responded to me when I would have loved to have contributed and collaborated.'\nBy the time Meghan's new show was announced, Mel had already written three Pearl Power books, published in 2014, 2015 and 2016.\nThe third was a runaway success, translated into Japanese, Mandarin, Korean, French, Spanish, Italian and Dutch as well as being published in the UK and America.\nThe author and illustrator is also well known for her grown up colouring books which have a cult celebrity following.\nFans include Ryan Gosling who took his book onto the Ellen de Generes chat show, Victoria Beckham who bought one for her daughter Harper, and Kate Winslet who was pictured with one in Waterstones.\nHer work sells in household name stores ranging from WHSmith and Tesco in the UK, to Bloomingdales and Barnes and Noble in the US.\nShe started turning her Pearl Power character into an animated TV series in 2019, two years before Meghan's 2021 Netflix announcement. Pearl's first encounter was to be with tennis legend and women's sports equality campaigner Billie Jean King who publicly endorsed the project.\nMel, who has an MA from the Royal College of Art, wrote and illustrated her first Pearl Power book more than a decade ago as a tribute her own daughter Pearl, now 16 (pictured together)\n'Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life's daily challenges,' a quote from Meghan promoting her series read\nMel said: 'The world of arts and media are very competitive and I'm afraid it's quite common for powerful people to rip off the work of less well-known creatives \u2013 although I'm not saying that's what happened here'\n'The similarities between your proposed animation series and my client's work appear to be too many and too striking to be mere coincidence,'\nMel's lawyers wrote to the duchess, care of Archewell, in July 2021.\n'It also appears that there is a risk that your proposed series may infringe intellectual property rights belonging to my client and/or may give rise to a claim in passing off (or in the US, some form of unfair competition'.)\nNo remedial action was taken, and the duchess did not respond.\nSurprisingly however, given the high-profile nature of the show's launch and the heavyweight team assembled, no further details were shared by Archewell or the streaming platform.\nIn October 2021 and then again in February 2022, Mel says she sent personal letters to Archewell and Netflix, asking for updates but still heard nothing.\n'Pearl' was cancelled 10 weeks later at the start of May 2022. Netflix said it was one of several projects - including two other children's shows - which were being dropped because of falling subscriber numbers which necessitated cutbacks.\nThe company was said to have decided to pivot away from animation at the time the cuts were announced.\nMel Elliott's (pictured) revelations shed a new light on the mystery, because by the time Meghan announced her plans in a blaze of publicity, Mel had produced a trio of Pearl Power books and started work on an animation\nPearl always appears in a black dress with a white Peter Pan collar and a red bow, with red bows in her hair and on her shoes\nIn February, the mayoress of Porres in Majorca complained the logo for Meghan's new lifestyle brand, As Ever resembled her town's historic coat of arms, which features two swallows on either side of a palm tree. Pictured: On the show\nMel says: 'I am glad that Meghan's 'Pearl' show was dropped, and I hope that I had something to do with it.\n'But what I really wanted was for it to have gone ahead, and for me to have been acknowledged or invited to work as a collaborator on the series. Pearl was my dream project and now, annoyingly, if I reprise my own creation, it's going to look like I have copied the idea from someone else.'\nMel chose not to make her action public for fear of facing the wrath of Meghan's fans, who style themselves The Sussex Squad and relentlessly troll anyone who criticises the duchess.\nDiagnosed with breast cancer in 2019, she had recently endured surgery and brutal radiotherapy and felt too vulnerable to face any online attacks.\nToday however, she has spoken out after seeing the duchess projects' being subject to some unfortunate similarities with preexisting content ranging from a TV show to a Spanish coat of arms.\nEarlier this year, fans of Pamela Anderson accused Meghan of 'copying' the Baywatch legend's Cooking with Love show for her own cooking and lifestyle show With Love.\nAny similarities may have been coincidence and indeed, Jesse Fawcett, the co-creator, co-writer and executive producer of Pamela's series, shrugged off such concerns.\n'We take pride in planting the first seeds \u2013 creating original, distinctive programming that audiences love \u2013 and it's a compliment to see our work with Ms Anderson resonate so strongly,' he told the Mail.\nMel Elliottt, artist, writer and illustrator who had a legal dispute with Netflix and Archewell, when a story very similar to one of hers was announced as a project by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\nMel, whose work sells in stores ranging from WHSmith and Tesco in Britain to Bloomingdale's and Barnes & Noble in the US, says her test animation for Pearl Power was publicly visible on her website and her social media channels\nThen in February, the mayoress of Porres in Majorca complained the logo for Meghan's new lifestyle brand, As Ever resembled her town's historic coat of arms, which features two swallows on either side of a palm tree.\nThe design's distinct shape was created to be a personal and unique emblem for the brand and, according to reports, was subject to thorough global searches of registered trademarks, conducted during the design process.\nDespite this, the mayoress asked the duchess to change the As Ever branding\nMeanwhile in March, Meghan's newly announced 'Confessions of a Female Founder' podcast was found to share its title with another podcast which was launched by a female entrepreneur more than a year ago.\nFans pointed out the identical title - even though the host herself, clothing designer Kady Meite, declined to criticise the duchess. Ms Meite said: 'I completely understand why people are drawing connections, and I truly appreciate the support and understand their intention.\n'But I also understand coincidences as well. It is highly unlikely Meghan even came across my channel but I am flattered by the thought. I know firsthand what it feels like to have my work actually copied... this isn't that.'\nMel, who has an MA from the Royal College of Art, wrote and illustrated her first Pearl Power book more than a decade ago as a tribute her own daughter Pearl, now 16.\nMel introduced the historical element in January 2019 when she started early work on an animated TV series as a spin off from the print titles\nMel Elliott is still pursuing her own broad arts and media career as a writer, illustrator, designer, web designer, magazine editor and art director\nPearl always appears in a black dress with a white Peter Pan collar and a red bow, with red bows in her hair and on her shoes.\nThe original books did not feature Pearl meeting women in history, but were about female empowerment and equality, something Meghan has always championed.\nMel introduced the historical element in January 2019 when she started early work on an animated TV series as a spin off from the print titles.\nHer idea was for each episode to open with Pearl presenting a project about a famous woman to classmates and then have them heading off on a shared adventure.\nThe first test animation featuring Billie Jean King was publicly visible on Mel's website and her social media channels.\nAfter Billie Jean King, Mel planned to feature Pearl Power meeting the poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou, pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart, zoologist Jane Goodall, and Madonna, followed by other women from the worlds of science, arts, politics and sport.\nHer initial lawyer's letter stated: 'My client has been discussing this proposed series with her agent for more than two years.\n'Apart from being mentioned on her website, this is also mentioned on the website voyagemedia.com which is a website that enables creators to connect with film and TV producers.\nHer idea was for each episode to open with Pearl presenting a project about a famous woman to classmates and then have them heading off on a shared adventure\n'In that listing, my client says: 'I would love to turn Pearl Power into an animated series someday, educating children about inspirational women from modern history (as well as a few men).''\nThe Daily Telegraph reported Meghan was in conversation with Netflix about 'Pearl' prior to her departure from royal life and relocation to the US as early as 2018 prior to the Pearl animated series produced by Ms Elliot.\nDebuting her own project the duchess said: 'Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life's daily challenges.\n'I'm thrilled that Archewell Productions, partnered with the powerhouse platform of Netflix, and these incredible producers, will together bring you this new animated series, which celebrates extraordinary women throughout history.\nDavid Furnish and I have been eager to bring this special series to light, and I am delighted we are able to announce it today.'\nMegan Casey, director of original animation at Netflix described the duchess's project as: 'An exciting tale that weaves together fantasy and history, 'Pearl' focuses on a young girl who learns to step into her own power when she embarks on a heroic adventure and meets important women from history along the way.'\nAlthough Pearl was dropped, the Duke and Duchess are understood to have a strong relationship with Netflix. The streamer's Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria said in February the company remains 'excited' at the prospect of future collaborations.\nMel Elliott is still pursuing her own broad arts and media career as a writer, illustrator, designer, web designer, magazine editor and art director.\nShe says: 'I still believe Pearl Power would make a brilliant and inspirational cartoon series for kids so if any producers would like to work on this idea with me do get in touch!'\nHer fourth children's book will be published in May 2026 by Harper Collins while her debut novel 'Alice and Audrey', which is written from the perspective of mother and teenage daughter, is coming out soon. It is available to preorder on melelliott.com."

[wanting to] just hang out back there and have a drink. He says, \"Oh I saw you and I really wanted to talk to you.\"'\nBut she told him that if he wanted to stay behind the counter he had to help out, saying: 'He had trained as a bartender for a film years before so he started making drinks.\n'And he made a ton of money in tips that night, because of course everyone wanted to go and see him. So it turned into a really fun night and then 15 years later here we are'.\nMatt went on to pop the question to Luciana in September 2005 and they tied the knot just a few months later at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau on December 9."

      "text": "Meghan Markle's major As Ever mishap... and the 'careless' photo that made it worse\nOn June 20, Meghan Markle launched her second drop for her As Ever lifestyle brand - but due to an unfortunate mishap with the launch, experts think that it could have a major impact on the brand's future.\nThe Duchess released two new products in this latest collection, a $14 apricot fruit spread in her classic keepsake packaging, and a $28 limited-edition orange blossom honey.\nAlso included in the new drop was a restock of some of her classic items, like the infamous flower sprinkles, shortbread cookie mix and crepe mix.\nHowever, even though the products sold-out in less than an hour after their release, unfortunately for some customers, they got a sense of false hope as their order was promptly canceled and refunded days later.\nAs it turns out, the As Ever brand had oversold their product.\nSome shoppers who won the race to buy the apricot spread - not officially called jam because of its high fruit content - have been informed that their order cannot be fulfilled. However, they will be sent a free jar when it is back in stock.\nThe cancellation even happened to FEMAIL - as one of our orders placed for apricot spread received a refund over a week after the purchase was made.\nOther customers also reported receiving an email that explained why their orders were unable to be fulfilled.\nOn June 20, Meghan Markle launched her second drop for her As Ever lifestyle brand - but due to an unfortunate mishap with the launch, experts think that it could have a major effect on the brand's future\nSome customers have been promised a refund and a free jar when it is back in stock\nSome shoppers who won the race to buy the apricot spread - not officially called jam because of its high fruit content - have been informed that their order cannot be fulfilled. However, they will be sent a free jar when it is back in stock\n'Due to high demand, we are unable to fulfill your order of the apricot spread at this time. We are refunding the purchase of this item by the end of this week.\n'In addition to the refund, we want you to know that when the apricot spread is back in stock, you will be the first to receive it, free of charge.'\nBut this is not the first time such a thing has happened with her As Ever releases - during the first launch in April, the wildflower honey was also oversold to customers.\nSo, what's with all these stock issues, and how will it affect her brand?\nAccording to PR and branding specialist Natalie Trice, founder of Natalie Trice Publicity, overselling products sends a message of 'poor planning' and 'disorganization' - something that could potentially have major effects.\nTrice told the Daily Mail that this mistake could be 'damaging' for any brand - but it's worse for As Ever, because it's so 'high-profile.'\n'When people spend their money, and engage with a story or lifestyle, only to be let down at the point of fulfillment, it breeds frustration and skepticism,' Trice said.\n'While occasional overselling can happen, particularly with unexpected demand or celebrity brands, doing so again so soon suggests lessons haven't been learned,' she continued.\nBut this is not the first time such a thing has happened with her As Ever releases - during the first launch in April, the wildflower honey was also oversold to customers\nAccording to PR and branding specialist Natalie Trice, founder of Natalie Trice Publicity, overselling products sends a message of 'poor planning' and 'disorganization' - something that could potentially have major effects\nThe cancellation even happened to FEMAIL - as one of our orders placed for apricot spread received a refund over a week after the purchase was made\nThe PR expert also noted that Meghan's social media post this week, which showed her picking apricots, was 'careless at best' amid the sellout.\n'Meghan's brand has potential, but consumer goodwill is a limited resource,' Trice advised.\n'If customers feel like an afterthought or are let down repeatedly, they'll simply walk away, and the headlines will continue to overshadow the actual products and mission.'\nEvan Nierman, Founder and CEO of global PR firm Red Banyan, also seemed to agree, telling the Daily Mail that the overselling of products sends consumers a message that Meghan is 'still leading with image over execution.'\n'From the name to the rollout, As Ever was packaged to feel polished and elevated,' Nierman explained. 'But when customers get apologies instead of products, the brand starts to look like just another vanity project that wasn't ready for primetime.'\nHe explained that although problems with stock and overselling can definitely happen to any brand, the fact that it happened twice in a row with As Ever isn't exactly ideal.\n'Most seasoned brands build in safety stock and prepare for spikes in demand,' he offered.\n'Repeating the same error makes it feel like the team behind As Ever underestimated the basics or overestimated the buzz,' the expert added.\nNierman urged the brand and Meghan to 'stop hiding behind silence' and 'start showing leadership'\nCustomers who have had their orders canceled are being promised a free jar of the apricot spread, but according to both experts, there's more that the brand should be doing.\nTrice recommends that Meghan communicate clearly with her customers, and 'get the basics right' in the future.\nNierman urged the brand and Meghan to 'stop hiding behind silence' and 'start showing leadership.'\nHe believes she needs to make a statement regarding the oversell of stock.\n'A real statement, not a press release, that takes ownership would go a long way,' Nierman shared.\n'Pair it with a clean, high-quality next drop that actually delivers. No gimmicks, no overpromising.'\nThe Daily Mail has reached out for comment.\nMeghan's latest blunder came just days after she launched her As Ever ros\u00e9 wine, the first alcoholic beverage under her brand.\n'Pair it with a clean, high-quality next drop that actually delivers. No gimmicks, no overpromising'\nMeghan's latest blunder came just days after she launched her As Ever ros\u00e9 wine, the first alcoholic beverage under her brand\nOn Tuesday, the sales for the wine went live, with customers able to purchase three bottles for $90, six bottles for $159, and 12 bottles for $300.\nIf you bought the six bottle package, Meghan promised that you were receiving 12 per cent off, while a 12-pack gets you a 17 per cent saving.\nThe Daily Mail exclusively revealed this week that the alcoholic beverage is made by Fairwinds Estate, a California winery that creates bespoke wines for celebrities, as they've now added Meghan to their list of clients.\nMeghan specifically picked Fairwinds - 75 miles north of San Francisco and a six-hour drive from her home in Montecito - to show her support after the winery was almost totally destroyed in a devastating 2020 wildfire which caused $15 million worth of damage.\nA source said: 'She wanted to lean in and help a California business rebuild.'"

      "text": "Is Meghan Markle still selling the same dream? The Tig closed eight years ago but her Netflix show keeps the fantasy alive\nMeghan Markle's new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan, features the Duchess of Sussex welcoming famous friends to a stunning California estate, where she shares her cooking, gardening and hosting tips.\nThe show comes ahead of the launch of her brand, As Ever, also in partnership with Netflix, offering herbal teas, honey crepe mix, flower sprinkles, shortbread butter cookies, wildflower honey, and her signature raspberry jam.\nHowever, this isn't Meghan's first foray into the lifestyle scene.\nBefore marrying Prince Harry in 2018, she founded a successful blog called The Tig, which she ran for almost three years.\nA 'passion project' she developed while starring in the US drama series Suits, The Tig became a well-known platform where Meghan shared personal insights alongside content on travel, food, fashion and dining recommendations.\nHowever, according to bestselling author Tom Bowers, the content on The Tig did not always accurately reflect Meghan's personal life or, at times, even her values.\nIn his book, Revenge: Meghan, Harry And The War Between The Windsors, he writes: 'As a purely commercial venture she understood her market and how to compartmentalise between her real life and the fantasy life she offered her increasing number of followers.\n'Conjuring fantasies was her unique selling point.'\nBefore marrying Prince Harry, Meghan Markle founded a successful blog called The Tig, which she ran for almost three years\nWith Love, Meghan, features the Duchess of Sussex welcoming famous friends to a stunning California estate, where she shares her cooking, gardening and hosting tips\nLikewise, Meghan has faced criticism for portraying an unrealistic lifestyle in her new show, where she wears glamorous, often white, outfits while carrying out simple kitchen tasks.\nAccording to Mr Bower, it took Meghan a year to 'successfully' become an influencer with The Tig.\nAs part of her strategy to capitalise on her celebrity status, the former actress closely studied Hollywood's elite to 'absorb and copy' their success.\nAnd it seems that she may have taken a similar approach with her Netflix series, since viewers drew several comparisons between the show and former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson's series, Pamela's Cooking With Love.\nMeghan's blog, which launched in 2014 and closed eight years ago today, was named after her favourite Tignanello wine.\nEmbracing the role of editor-in-chief, she used the website to share her views on topics ranging from feminism to her passion for philanthropy.\nShe also shared recipes, make-up and beauty tips, travel advice, and interviews with celebrity friends, including Serena Williams and Priyanka Chopra.\nMeghan's daily routine involved leaving early for the studio, spending the day filming, then heading to the gym. In the evenings, she would browse the internet for inspiration.\nMeghan's blog, which launched in 2014 and closed eight years ago today, was named after her favourite Tignanello wine\nThe Duchess also appears to enjoy a tipple or two in her new Netflix series\nA candid snap of Meghan embracing nature appeared on The Tig, alongside her New Year's Resolution for 2016\nThe former actress showcases her outdoorsy Californian lifestyle in With Love, Meghan\nSuits co-star Abigail Spencer (centre) was among those Meghan managed to round up for the show\nShe reached out to luxury brands, requesting free products in exchange for promoting them, and sent numerous emails to celebrities requesting endorsements.\n'To build her credibility, she needed to be associated with stars - if possible with a photograph to prove their friendship,' pens Mr Bower.\n'The celebrity hunter's strength was to seize every opportunity and never take \"no\" for an answer.'\nMeghan first crossed paths with tennis supremo Serena Williams at a charity football match in New York in 2014.\nOn her blog, she described their meeting, saying they 'hit it off immediately, taking pictures, laughing', but their conversation wasn't about tennis or acting - it was about 'good old-fashioned girly stuff'.\nMeghan wrote about how they were 'united by their endless ambition', though no photos suggesting this ever surfaced.\nSimilarly, in her Netflix series, Meghan hosts actress and comedian Mindy Kaling, who she has only met in person once before, yet insists they are great friends.\nIn episode two, however, she didn't seem to appreciate Mindy calling her 'Meghan Markle'.\nMeghan first crossed paths with Serena Williams (centre) at a charity football match in New York in 2014\nMeghan launched The Tig while she was playing the character of Rachel Zane in the US drama series Suits\nAs part of her strategy to capitalise on her celebrity status, the former actress closely studied Hollywood's elite to 'absorb and copy' their success\nMeghan's husband, Prince Harry, only made a brief appearance at the end of the new Netflix series\n'It's so funny you keep saying Meghan Markle, you know I'm Sussex now,' she awkwardly responded.\nWhen Mindy appeared confused, Meghan continued: 'You have kids, and you go, \"No, I share my name with my children.\" I didn't realise how meaningful it would be, but it means so much to say, \"This is our family name. Our little family name.\"'\nAfter being corrected, Mindy replied: 'Well, now I know and I love it.'\nThis moment may reflect Meghan's 'tried and tested formula,' according to Mr Bower, of creating intimate, personal narratives that may not always align completely with the full truth.\nOn her defunct website, Meghan presented herself as a 'racy Hollywood figure', expressing her love for fine food, 'copious amounts of ros\u00e9, spicy tequila cocktails and neat Scotch.'\nIndeed, she certainly appears to enjoy a tipple or two in With Love, Meghan.\nShe also previously portrayed herself as a 'saintly hippy', criticising fancy restaurants while claiming to be great company, 'embracing every little second of it'.\nSimilarly, in her Netflix series, Meghan continually emphasises the 'joy' she associates with the show. 'We're not in the pursuit of perfection, we're in the pursuit of joy,' she insists.\nWhile running The Tig, Meghan met Cory Vitiello, a Toronto chef and restaurant owner, with a notable clientele.\nAfter dining at his restaurant with her Suits co-stars, she wrote an enthusiastic review on her blog, calling him 'my favourite chef'.\nCory began dating Meghan after ending his previous relationship. He introduced her to 'everyone' in Toronto, while the couple rented a three-bedroom home in the Annex district.\nMuch like Prince Harry, who only made a brief appearance at the end of With Love, Meghan, Cory never appeared on The Tig.\n'Keeping Cory anonymous was compatible for her own search for fame,' Mr Bowers explains.\nMeghan closed The Tig in 2017, shortly before announcing her engagement to Harry.\nShe described it as having 'evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity'."

      "text": "King Charles' goddaughter India Hicks mysteriously deletes video from her website of Hollywood star Brooke Shields criticising Meghan Markle for being 'too precious'\nThe King's goddaughter has mysteriously deleted a video of a Hollywood star being critical of Meghan Markle, MailOnline can reveal today.\nIndia Hicks, who was a bridesmaid at Charles and Diana's wedding, has removed footage of Brooke Shields calling the Duchess of Sussex 'precious' from her personal website.\nMs Hicks, a fashion model turned entrepreneur, is daughter of Lady Pamela Mountbatten, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II, and the late interior designer David Hicks. King Charles III is her godfather.\nIndia also hosts a podcast where she interviewed star Brooke Shields where she revealed she interrupted Meghan Markle live on stage in front of thousands of people.\nBrooke claimed she did this because the Duchess of Sussex was being 'too precious' in her speech about gender equality on International Women's Day.\nBut royal watchers have spotted that the clip, posted at the top of India's popular Substack and made headlines around the world, has been removed.\nBoth women have been targeted by Meghan's supporters - known as the Sussex Squad. There is no suggestion this has anything to do with the Duchess herself.\nSeveral Twitter trolls bizarrely accused both Brooke and India of being 'racist Karens' and 'b*tches' over the podcast anecdote.\nAnother wrote: 'Damn. Now I need to write f*** you on Brooke's social media. Apparently something about Meghan triggers the b*tch in some women'.\nIndia Hicks has mysteriously deleted a video of a Hollywood star being critical of Meghan Markle, MailOnline can reveal today. Meghan Markle was 'too precious' and 'serious' as she told an anecdote on a panel for International Women's Day last year (pictured), according to Brooke Shields\nHollywood actress Brooke, 60, said she felt she needed to make the tone of the conversation more 'relaxed' when she appeared to criticise the Duchess\nBefore: India's filmed interview with Brooke was at the centre of her popular substack\nAfter: India's Brooke Shields interview has been replaced by a feature on London life\nMailOnline has asked Ms Hicks to comment on why the video of her chat with Ms Shields has gone. It appears to have been replaced by a feature on London and its best patisseries.\nThe 60-year-old Hollywood actress shared the 'too precious' anecdote on the latest episode of India Hicks' podcast, which was released ten days ago.\nBrooke was discussing the International Women's Day panel in Austin, Texas, from March 2024, where she had been joined by Meghan on stage.\nWhen the discussion began, and the former Suits star, 43, started answering Katie's opening question, Brooke said the tone quickly became overly serious.\n'Katie asks the first question to Meghan and talks about how at a young age, she was already advocating for women, etcetera, etcetera,' Brooke explained.\n'[Meghan] starts telling a story about how when she was 11... And she keeps saying, well, when I was 11, I saw this commercial and they were talking about washing dishes and only soap for washing dishes was for women.\n'And she said, 'I didn't think only women wash dishes. It wasn't fair. So I wrote to the company. And when I was 11, I wrote my first letter and when I was 11...' and she kept saying she was 11! She wrote to the company, they changed the text, they changed the commercial.'\nAt that point, Brooke said, she couldn't resist breaking the tension in the room - and the earnestness of Meghan's response.\n'I go, \"Excuse me, I'm so sorry. I've got to interrupt you there for one minute,\"\n'I was trying not to be rude, but I wanted to be funny because it was so serious.\n'I just want to give everybody here a context as to how we're different,' Brooke told the audience. 'I said, 'Well, when I was 11, I was playing a prostitute.'\n'The place went insane. And then luckily, it was more relaxed after that.'\nThe comment was a reference to Brooke's breakout role as a child star in the controversial 1978 film Pretty Baby, in which she played a child sex worker - a role that sparked debate at the time and has remained the subject of intense scrutiny in the decades since.\nIn Austin, the moment broke the ice, as the crowd broke out into laughter.\n'I was like, oh, I hope she doesn't think I'm rude. I'm not being rude,' Brooke added.\nIndia - daughter of Lady Pamela Mountbatten, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II, and the late interior designer David Hicks, agreed that lightening the serious mood Meghan created was the right thing to do. 'I think it's genius,' she said.\nReflecting on the exchange, Brooke added: 'It was just too precious. And I was like, they're not going to want to sit here for 45 minutes and listen to anybody be precious or serious.'\nMeghan had been sharing one of her favourite anecdotes - of when she wrote to Proctor & Gamble at the age of 11\nMeghan was a speaker on the panel at the South by Southwest Conference (SXSW) in Austin,Texas in March last year\nMeghan, The Duchess of Sussex, Katie Couric, Brooke Shields and Nancy Wang Yuen take part in the keynote 'Breaking Barrier, Shaping Narratives: How Women Lead On and Off the Screen'\nDespite the crowd's response, Brooke acknowledged that the moment might not have gone down quite so well with Meghan herself.\n'This was in front of [thousands of people]. I mean, it was crazy,' she said. 'And then afterwards, she was kind of like, oh, okay. And I was like, let's just have some fun with it.'\nBrooke added: 'I don't know if you'll have to cut this out.'\nMeghan had been telling an anecdote she's referred to on many occasions about fighting a 'sexist' Proctor & Gamble commercial when she was just 11 years old.\nAged 11, Meghan wrote to Procter & Gamble to object to sexism in a dish soap advert which included the line: 'Mothers around America are fighting greasy pots and pans.'\nShe asked them to change the advert to 'people all over America' and the company amended the language.\nShe subsequently appeared in an interview on Nick News in 1993, saying she was 'furious' at the advert for P&G's Ivory Clear.\nBeaming with pride, Meghan had happily agreed to share the story with the crowd - having mentioned it at multiple events over the years."

I wasn't about reinvention,' he said.\n'I wanted to go with something on who she, she has a beautiful head of hair and is gorgeous, so it was just easy.\n'We worked really closely together but there was nothing contrived about it. We knew what we wanted to do. We wanted something that wasn't effortless and really timeless. As long as it didn't look contrived.'\nSerge said he was put at ease by Meghan's relaxed nature, particularly when handling the Diamond Bandeau tiara, which had been loaned to the bride by the Queen.\nHe said: 'You just have to kind of separate the two things because otherwise I would shake. I didn't want to shake with the history in that tiara.\n'The thing is working with Meghan, she makes everything so light and easy that you don't think about these things in that dramatic way.'\nHe added that he would like to work with Meghan in future, saying: 'They know where to find me'.\nMost watched News videos\n- Man with bob haircut throwing shapes in Ibiza sparks hilarious memes\n- Moment cyclist pushed into canal by furious dog walker\n- French farmers use manure to deal with squatters on their land\n- Bikini-clad women wrestle each other to the ground on Ukrainian beach\n- Pilot battles strong winds on landing in Leeds as Storm Floris hits\n- Terrifying moment flash flood wipes out village in India\n- Drag queens escorted from library by police after protest\n- Boat migrants tackled and detained by locals on Spanish beach\n- Confused toddler wanders city streets after mom leaves to go party\n- Stomach-churning moment brown SEWAGE explodes from airport ceiling\n- Plane struggles to land in Leeds as it battles Storm Floris\n- Mother of hostage Evyatar David speaks out as Hamas releases clip"

I didn't - I didn't really look, but I mean, I didn't invent cooking shows' adding that Markle 'is just doing her thing.'\nThe drama erupted when Prince Harry's wife gave People magazine some of her top domestic tips ahead of the release of With Love, Meghan, in March.\nThese included how to 'elevate' a normal dinner \u2013 such as after ordering a takeaway.\nPamela Anderson has finally spoken out on viral claims Meghan Markle 'ripped off' her cooking show with Netflix series, With Love, Meghan\nFans of the Baywatch bombshell, 58, were left incensed when the former working Royal, 44, debuted her latest TV venture - which bore eerie similarities to Pamela's Cooking With Love, which premiered earlier this year on Prime Video\nAnderson pictured on her show Cooking With Love wearing a similar straw hat to the one worn by Meghan in her upcoming programme\nCiting Chinese as a favorite delivery option, Markle told the US magazine: 'I like being able to do a hybrid, but even when I get a takeout I will try to plate it beautifully.'\nAnd discussing her new trademark As Ever \u2013 after she failed to secure copyright branding for her original name, American Riviera Orchard \u2013 she insisted: 'It's a learning curve.\n'I appreciate everyone who gave me the grace to make mistakes and figure it out and also be forgiving with myself through that.'\nThe two former TV stars live more than a thousand miles apart, yet both were smiling and giggling in brightly lit country kitchens, filming aspirational cooking with photogenic friends and famous celebrities.\nBoth are seen carrying wicker baskets of fruit and vegetables picked from their gardens, dancing with joy, and gleefully high-fiving their celebrity guests. Both series are even the same length: eight episodes.\nWhen Meghan's first episode was shown, it prompted withering complaints that she had copied Pamela's winning formula.\n'So similar it's freaky,' said one reviewer, while others branded Meghan's series 'inauthentic' and 'copycat'.\nMore charitable observers might put this down to coincidence, as neither show seems to deviate from the wholesome template of many an aspirational cookery program.\nAnderson, who was appearing alongside new love and co-star Liam Neeson responded: 'One.

Customers were able to purchase three bottles for $90, six bottles for $159, and 12 bottles for $300 - but it was sold out within the hour.\nIf you bought the six-bottle package, Meghan promised that you were receiving 12 percent off, while a 12-pack gets you a 17 percent saving.\nLast month, Daily Mail exclusively revealed that the alcoholic beverage is made by Fairwinds Estate, a California winery that creates bespoke wines for celebrities, as they've now added Meghan to their list of clients.\nMeghan's As Ever ros\u00e9 wine has finally arrived to our offices after weeks of anticipation - and it may have been a 'pour decision' on her end\nLast month, Daily Mail exclusively revealed that the alcoholic beverage is made by Fairwinds Estate, a California winery that creates bespoke wines for celebrities, as they've now added Meghan to their list of clients\nThe wine went on sale July 1 on her As Ever website, and was sold out within the hour. Customers able to purchase three bottles for $90, six bottles for $159, and 12 bottles for $300\nThe wine was shipped out to buyers on July 9, and the three bottles we ordered with expedited $60 shipping arrived at our offices July 10.\nThe brown cardboard box it arrived in was unassuming, unlike the typical white box that she has previously sent her As Ever orders in.\nUpon opening the package, we discovered our three bottles of wine nestled in between two egg crate cartons that were shaped like bottles. We'll give it to the Duchess - nothing broke on its way from California to New York, but for nearly $30 per bottle, we would hope that wouldn't be the case.\nEach bottle was wrapped in a piece of thin white tissue paper, which, frankly, felt a little cheap, and sealed with a gold-and-white sticker with the As Ever logo stamped on it.\nThe bottle featured a white sticker on the front which read 'As Ever' in the brand's signature gold script, the logo once again, and gold wrapping at the neck of the bottle - chic.\nBut enough about the packaging, let's get to the good stuff - the wine itself.\nNow, Meghan is no stranger to wine, as she named her once-popular lifestyle blog, The Tig, after Tiganello, an Italian red wine known to be the mom-of-two's favorite.\nHer As Ever ros\u00e9 is described on the bottle as a 'delicately balanced ros\u00e9 with soft notes of stone fruit, gentle minerality, and a lasting finish.' It also has a 14.5 per cent alcohol by volume for the 750ML bottle.\nThe brown cardboard box it shipped in was unassuming, unlike the typical white box that she has previously sent her As Ever orders in\nUpon opening the package, we discovered our three bottles of wine nestled in between two egg crate cartons that were shaped like bottles\nEach bottle was wrapped in a piece of thin white tissue paper, which, frankly, felt a little bit cheap, and sealed with a gold-and-white sticker with the As Ever logo stamped on it\nNow, Meghan is no stranger to wine, as she named her once-popular lifestyle blog, The Tig, after Tiganello, an Italian red wine that is the Duchess' favorite\nOur first sip left a lot to be desired, as it honestly didn't taste like much. The wine was smooth, but we couldn't easily detect the notes of stone fruit.\nIt also managed to taste quite bland, and almost water-y. Despite the lack of flavor, the ros\u00e9 managed to taste quite acidic, and like a really strong, alcoholic wine.\nMany sippers on the FEMAIL team agreed, and we noticed that it left a somewhat uncomfortable sensation at the back of our throats after swallowing.\nThe wine didn't taste like you bought it at a fancy vineyard, where it's supposed to be made. Instead, it tasted affordable and ordinary.\nIt's not bad, but it's not great. Overall, it was pretty commonplace, like a wine you would be served at a work happy hour.\nBut Meghan's wine wasn't the only thing FEMAIL tried from her recent As Ever drops.\nAnd, once we took a sip, it honestly didn't taste like much. It was smooth, but we couldn't easily detect the notes of stone fruit, that much is for sure\nMany sippers on the FEMAIL team agreed, and we noticed that it left a somewhat uncomfortable sensation at the back of our throats after swallowing and left a strong, acidic taste in our mouths well after tasting\nIn late June, the Duchess of Sussex finally released new pantry items under her As Ever lifestyle brand - an apricot spread and a limited-edition orange blossom honey.\nWe'd felt like her raspberry spread was too thin, sweet, and very runny - and we found that her apricot version was just as lackluster.\nPer Food & Wine, jam is regulated by the FDA, and it must come from a single fruit, containing at least 45 percent fruit and 55 percent sugar.\nWhat Meghan is selling under As Ever is not called a jam or a preserve - it's a spread, with ingredients of apricots, organic pure cane sugar, dried organic apricots, organic lemon juice concentrate, filtered water, and fruit pectin.\nWe bought the $14 apricot spread with keepsake packaging and expedited shipping, and it arrived to us promptly in packaging that Meghan hasn't changed up at all.\nLike the raspberry spread, it arrived in a small FedEx box, with the same 'handwritten' As Ever-branded postcard from Meghan herself sitting right on top of the huge amount of packing peanuts.\nAgain, all that the note said was 'enjoy.'\nThe raspberry spread was very liquid and quite thin - a bit 'loose,' if you will. If we hadn't known better, we'd have thought it melted during its expedited journey to us\nWhat Meghan is selling under As Ever is not called a jam or a preserve - it's a spread, with ingredients of apricots, organic pure cane sugar, dried organic apricots, organic lemon juice concentrate, filtered water, and fruit pectin\nThe 7.6oz jar came in a tan, cylinder-shaped package, embossed with the As Ever logo on its front, just like the raspberry spread - reminding us more of a luxury candle or party favor than packaging suited for an apricot spread.\nPretty much everything was the same as the raspberry spread, except for the jar's contents, of course.\nWhen we opened up the jar, we were immediately taken by how liquid-y and runny it was. It was quickly likened by our testers to 'baby food' and resembled a caramel sauce more than an apricot spread.\nWhen you think apricot spread, you think that it'll be gelatinous, or even have chunks of apricot in it. Meghan's As Ever spread was the total opposite - instead more wet and sugary.\nFortunately, the consistency is the spread's weakest point. We tried it on a piece of toasted sourdough bread first, and were pleasantly surprised by the taste.\nThis time around, Meghan definitely nailed the flavor, with the sweet apricot coming through immediately. It was pleasantly delicious, and we could also taste the tang of the organic lemon juice concentrate.\nHowever, it's definitely not a spread. Like the raspberry version, it's not so much a spread but a sauce.\nThe Duchess of Sussex finally released new items for her As Ever lifestyle brand, an apricot spread\nAnd, warning ahead: the apricot spread stood out when compared to the raspberry spread... and this one's a drip\nMeghan first released her line of lifestyle products in April, off the heels of her cooking show on Netflix , With Love, Meghan\nWhen we opened up the jar, we were immediately taken by how liquid-y- and runny it was. It almost looked like baby food or even a caramel sauce rather than an apricot spread\nThe product left our piece of bread soaking wet, as it immediately absorbed into the sourdough. Meghan suggests eating it with butter on bread, but that's not easy because the apricot mixture is so thin.\nThere's nothing that holds this spread together.\nAfter the sourdough, we tried it drizzled on a piece of brie cheese and toast, which wasn't such a great pairing. The sweet taste of the apricot spread overpowered the cheese, so you couldn't even taste the tang - instead, it was all about the fruity condiment.\nIf we could, we'd re-label the apricot spread a dessert sauce, because the taste is wonderful and it would be great on vanilla ice cream, on top of a pie, or even on a cheesecake.\nBut alone? It definitely needs some work on the texture.\nThis time around, Meghan nailed the taste, but the actual formula was a fruitless endeavor.\nOut of five stars, we would give it a two point five, as compared to the two we gave the raspberry spread. It gets an extra half-point for the taste, which is where the Duchess really shined.\nOut of five stars, we would give it a two point five, as compared to the two we gave the raspberry spread.

Meghan's As Ever spread was the total opposite of this, as it was purely just wet and sugary\nSo this time around, it's safe to say that we didn't necessarily have high hopes for this apricot spread, which Meghan released after teasing that she was putting some of her As Ever items 'on pause'\nFEMAIL also tried her new $28 orange blossom honey, which left much to be desired.\nThe honey didn't come with a honeycomb this time - which had made it slightly worth the price the first time around - and tasted like sweet, artificial orange.\nIt's not something that FEMAIL would buy again.\nAs of right now, it seems like As Ever is hanging on by a spread."

      "text": "In honor of the Fourth of July holiday, Meghan Markle posted a clip to her As Ever Instagram page showcasing a charcuterie board she had put together - but it has not gone down well with viewers.\nIn the clip, Meghan introduced her board as 'easy entertaining,' and decorated a wooden platter with various fruits, cheeses, and crackers, as well as her sold-out, $14 As Ever raspberry spread.\nShe looked summer-chic in an oversized, blue-and-white striped button down as she filmed from what appeared to be her own kitchen in Montecito, California.\nWhile she assembled the board, the Duchess, 43, carefully started off by arranging fruits like raspberries and cherries, then added some star-shaped cheese and blueberries, along with some crackers and slices of sourdough bread.\nTo finish things off, she took a brand-new container of her raspberry spread, which went on sale as part of the first As Ever drop in April, and scooped it into a small dish.\nHowever, the spread sold out within a half hour of it going on sale, leaving many fans dying to get their hands on it.\nAs she put the spread onto the board, she accidentally dropped a raspberry into it, laughing as she popped it into her mouth.\n'Happy 4th of July!' the caption of the video read.\nIn the clip, Meghan introduced her board as 'easy entertaining,' and decorated a wooden board with various fruits, cheeses, and crackers, as well as her sold-out, $14 As Ever raspberry spread\nTo finish things off, she took a brand-new container of her raspberry spread, which went on sale as part of the first As Ever drop in April, and scooped it into a small dish\nHowever, the spread sold out within a half hour of it going on sale, leaving many fans dying to get their hands on it\nMeghan also posted a similar clip to her personal Instagram page just minutes later, @meghan, where she showed followers an aerial view of her assembling the festive platter.\nOn Reddit, some royal fans slammed the video as 'basic,' as one person even compared her creation to an outdated post on Pinterest.\n'I love a board, especially a themed one, but bless her heart for thinking this is new and/or unique. Also, the faux calligraphy and the unnecessary flowers are eyeroll inducing,' one person wrote.\nAnother agreed, 'Cough! Let's go copy something from Pinterest, and hey make sure you get the jewelry into the shot... oh! yeah, got to show off the stupid handwriting.'\n'I think it looks good if my regular friend/neighbor did it. They're not trying to sell an elevated lifestyle brand.... it's embarrassing,' someone else typed.\nHer video comes just days after Daily Mail exclusively revealed that the jam is manufactured by The Republic of Tea.\nThe company, which also makes her honey and tea bags, is headquartered in Larkspur, California, 350 miles away from Meghan's Montecito mansion.\nHowever its factory is 2,000 miles away in Illinois.\nMeghan also posted a similar clip to her personal Instagram page just minutes later, @meghan, where she showed followers an aerial view of her assembling the festive platter\nOn Reddit, some royal fans slammed the video as 'basic,' as one person even compared her creation to an outdated post on Pinterest\nWhen the raspberry spread was first released in the Spring, FEMAIL was able to get our hands on it, and it's safe to say that we weren't big fans.\nThe Duchess previously explained in an episode of her Netflix show, With Love, Meghan, that her preserves can't technically be called jam, because 'jam is equal parts sugar and fruit.'\n'I just don\u2019t think you can taste the fruit that way,' she suggested on the show.\nWhen we tried the spread, we weren't too impressed with it's taste or texture.\nThe spread was very liquid and quite thin - a bit 'loose,' if you will. If we hadn't known better, we'd have thought it melted during its expedited journey to us.\nThat being said, it is described by the brand as including a hint of lemon and a 'fluid texture.'\nTypically, a jar of jam is thicker and sticks together, whereas when we stuck our spoon into Meghan's raspberry spread, its consistency dripped off the silverware like a sauce. It was unappealing to say the least.\nAs for the taste, it's extremely sweet - and we mean really sweet. It is reminiscent of a sugary, raspberry dessert sauce rather than a jam or spread that's meant to be eaten on a piece of toast.\nTypically, a jar of jam is thicker and sticks together, whereas when we stuck our spoon into Meghan's raspberry spread, its consistency dripped off the silverware like a sauce. It was unappealing to say the least\nIt's unclear if Meghan will ever be restocking the raspberry spread, but she shared more details about her business on an episode of her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, in May\nThe flavor was also surprisingly strong, which meant we could taste the sour lemon in the spread, which Meghan had promised in the product's description.\nThe jam performed even worse when we compared it to a store brand raspberry jelly, and a jar of Bonne Maman, which both had a completely different texture and taste than Meghan's spread.\nBoth of the jams were much thicker - so thick, in fact, that you could stick a spoon in both of them and it would stay upright.\nOut of five stars, we gave the raspberry spread a two.\nIt's unclear if Meghan will ever be restocking the raspberry spread, but she shared more details about her business on an episode of her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, in May.\nShe said that the April launch of As Ever goods including jam that a 'scarcity mentality at the beginning might be a hook for people,' comparing it to 'a sneaker drop.'\nBut Meghan feared it might be 'annoying' for customers, adding: 'I don't want you to eat that jam once every six months. I want that to be on your shelf all the time.'\nThe Duchess said: 'So for me at the moment, with As Ever, it was great. We planned for a year we get and then everything sells out in 45 minutes.\n'Yes, amazing, great news. Then what do you do? And then you say 'Ok, we planned as best as we could. Are we going to replenish and sell out again in an hour? Or is that annoying as a customer?\n'I'm looking at it saying \"Just pause. That happened. Let's wait until we are completely stable and we have everything we need.\"'"
