  "content": "Kovitz Investment Group Partners, LLC, an investment management company, released its \u201cKovitz Core Equity Strategy\u201d second-quarter 2025 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the strategy returned 7.9% compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 10.9% return. Equity markets saw notable volatility after the President's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement on April 2nd. The S&P 500 dropped 11% initially but later rallied 25% in the quarter after the tariffs were postponed by 90 days on April 9th. Additionally, you can review the fund\u2019s top 5 holdings to see its best picks for 2025.\n\nIn its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, Kovitz Core Equity Strategy highlighted stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions.

      "text": "Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript July 30, 2025\nMicrosoft Corporation beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $3.65, expectations were $3.37.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2025 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Neilson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJonathan Neilson: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today\u2019s call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today\u2019s call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company\u2019s fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today\u2019s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings press release and the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong close to what was a record fiscal year for us. All up, Microsoft Cloud surpassed $168 billion in annual revenue, up 23%. The rate of innovation and the speed of diffusion is unlike anything we have seen. To that end, we are building the most comprehensive suite of AI products and tech stack at massive scale. And to provide more context, I want to walk up the stack, starting with Azure. Azure surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, up 34%, driven by growth across all workloads. We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave and took share every quarter this year. We opened new DCs across 6 continents and now have over 400 data centers across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider.\nThere is a lot of talk in the industry about building the first gigawatt and multi-gigawatt data centers. We stood up more than 2 gigawatts of new capacity over the past 12 months alone. And we continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor. Every Azure region is now AI-first. All of our regions can now support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And we are driving and riding a set of compounding S curves across silicon, systems and models to continuously improve efficiency and performance for our customers. Take, for example, GPT4o family of models, which have the highest volume of inference tokens. Through software optimizations alone, we are delivering 90% more tokens for the same GPU compared to a year ago.\nBeyond the AI fleet, we continue to build our commercial cloud to address customers\u2019 unique data residency and sovereignty requirements. This quarter, we introduced the Microsoft Sovereign Cloud, the industry\u2019s most comprehensive solution spanning both public and private cloud deployments. All of this innovation is driving our strong results. We saw accelerating growth from migrations again this quarter. Nestle, for example, migrated more than 200 SAP instances, 10,000-plus servers, 1.2 petabytes of data to Azure with near 0 business disruption. That makes it one of the largest and most successful migrations in business history. The next big accelerator in the cloud will be Quantum, and I\u2019m excited about our progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world\u2019s first operational deployment of a Level 2 Quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing.\nThis is how we will continue to think and make investments, with decade-long arcs, while making progress every quarter. The next layer is data, which is foundational to every AI application. Microsoft Fabric is becoming the complete data and analytics platform for the AI era, spanning everything from SQL to no-SQL, to analytics workloads. It continues to gain momentum with revenue up 55% year-over-year and over 25,000 customers. It\u2019s the fastest-growing database product in our history. Fabric OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including semantic models from Power BI, and therefore, it is the best source of knowledge and grounding for AI applications and context engineering. Azure Databricks and Snowflake on Azure both accelerated as well.\nCosmos DB and Azure PostgreSQL are both powering mission- critical workloads at scale. OpenAI, for example, uses Cosmos DB in the hot path of every ChatGPT interaction, storing chat history, user profiles and conversational state. And Azure PostgreSQL stores metadata critical to the operation of ChatGPT as well as OpenAI\u2019s developer APIs. This year, we launched Azure AI Foundry to help customers design, customize and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Foundry features best-in-class tooling, management, observability and built-in controls for trustworthy AI. Customers increasingly want to use multiple AI models to meet their specific performance, cost and use case requirements. And with Foundry, they can provision inferencing throughput once and apply it across more models than any other hyperscaler, including models from OpenAI, DeepSeek, Meta, xAI\u2019s Grok and, very soon, Black Forest Labs and Mistral AI.\nWe sim-shipped 15 models from OpenAI alone on Foundry this year, providing same-day access to state-of-the-art models deeply integrated with our infrastructure and tools. And we are seeing accelerated adoption of our new Foundry Agent Service, which is now being used by 14,000 customers to build agents that automate complex tasks. For example, Nasdaq is using foundry to build agents that help customers prepare for Board meetings, cutting prep time by up to 25%. All up, 80% of Fortune 500 already use Foundry. And when we look narrowly at just the number of tokens served by Foundry APIs, we processed over 500 trillion this year, up over 7x. This is a good indicator of true platform diffusion beyond a few head apps and services. Talking about the app layer, these applications are becoming embedded in our daily work and life.\nOur family of Copilot apps has surpassed 100 million monthly active users across commercial and consumer. And when you take a broader look at the engagement of AI features across our products, we have over 800 million monthly active users. Microsoft 365 Copilot is becoming the new way to organize work and workflow and work artifacts. We rolled out our biggest update to Microsoft 365 Copilot to date this quarter, bringing together chat, search, create, notebooks as well as agents into one intuitive scaffolding. With this innovation and continued product improvements, we are seeing real momentum. Customers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite, with strong usage intensity as shown by our week-over-week retention.\nAnd we saw the largest quarter of seat adds since launch with a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. Barclays, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 100,000 employees globally following a successful initial deployment of 15,000. UBS is expanding its deployment to all of its employees after initially rolling it out to 55,000 of them. And Adobe, KPMG, Pfizer, Wells Fargo all purchased over 25,000 seats this quarter. Tens of thousands of organizations have already used our Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents in the first weeks of availability. And we have introduced group-level agents in Teams like Facilitator and Interpreter, which generate real-time translation and notes in meetings. Hundreds of partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday have built their own third-party agents that integrate with Copilot and Teams.\nWe are also seeing more customers use Copilot Studio to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot and build their own agents. This year, customers created 3 million agents using SharePoint and Copilot Studio. And with Copilot Tuning, they can easily create agents fine- tuned on their company\u2019s data, workflow and style that reflect their unique tone, language and expertise. We\u2019re also seeing great traction among specific roles and functions, starting with developers. GitHub Copilot continues to have great momentum in IDE with Agent Mode and new form factors like Coding Agent which is capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. We have 20 million GitHub Copilot users. GitHub Copilot enterprise customers increased 75% quarter-over-quarter as companies tailor Copilot to their own codebases, and 90% of the Fortune 100 now use GitHub Copilot.\nMore broadly, GitHub usage and repos are seeing explosive growth because of AI. AI projects on GitHub more than doubled over the last year. The surge in vibe coding projects and AI coding agents, whether it is Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or GitHub Copilot, are generating more pull requests and more repos on GitHub. And our Code Review Agent is being used heavily across the platform, performing millions of code reviews each month. In health care, we had a breakout year for Dragon Copilot. Customers used our ambient AI solutions to document over 13 million physician-patient encounters this quarter, up nearly 7x year-over-year. For example, at Mercyhealth system, more than 1,000 physicians are already using Copilot to reduce administrative burden, so that they can focus on providing better care.\nThey have saved more than 100,000 hours to date and plan to expand to all 5,000 providers. As one physician put it, \u201cThe best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years.\u201d And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks. More broadly, AI is driving a fundamental change in the biz apps market as customers shift from legacy systems to agentic business applications. Dynamics 365 took share this year. And we are winning customers in every industry, like Verizon with Sales, Domino\u2019s Pizza Group with ERP, 1-800-Flowers with Contact Center. When it comes to consumer apps, we are innovating across all surfaces. In fact, on Monday, we introduced Copilot Mode in Edge.\nIt\u2019s especially exciting to see the innovation coming back to browsers. Copilot Mode brings together Copilot composer, chat, discover, search and actions to build the next generation of browser for the AI age. Our Copilot consumer app also continued to see strong growth in engagement and successful sessions. And we are bringing Copilot to every Windows 11 PC. With Copilot Vision, you can share your screen with Copilot and get real-time insights and assistance on anything. And we are well positioned as we approach Windows 10 end of support in October, thanks to Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs, which offer customers compelling security as well as AI value. Talking about security, it underlies our cloud and AI infrastructure as well as our Copilots and agents.\nWe have launched over 100 new capabilities over the past year. Just last week, we added a modern data lake to our SIEM Microsoft Sentinel, bringing together customer data across our first-party tools as well as third-party ecosystem over 350 connectors. We are also extending the systems customers already use for governance, identity, security and management to protect every AI agent. Entra now extends identity permissions, policies and access controls to agents. Defender secures nearly 2 million general AI apps. Purview is used by 3/4 of the Microsoft 365 Copilot customers to protect their data. And all up, we now have nearly 1.5 million security customers and continue to take share across all major categories we serve. Before I wrap, I want to talk about 2 consumer businesses of ours with massive end-user reach: LinkedIn and Xbox.\nLinkedIn is home to 1.2 billion members with 4 consecutive years of double-digit member growth. All up, comments on LinkedIn rose over 30% and video uploads increased over 20% this year. We continue to bring AI to every part of LinkedIn experience, introducing agents across hiring as well as sales. When it comes to Gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. We are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter with successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger. 50 million people have played Black Ops 6; total hours surpassed $2 billion. Minecraft saw record monthly active usage in revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft Movie.\nAnd we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of gameplay stream via the cloud this year. And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time. In closing, we are going through a generational tech shift with AI, and I have never been more confident in Microsoft\u2019s opportunity to drive long-term growth and define what the future looks like. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results as well as the outlook.\nAmy E. Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This year, we delivered over $281 billion in revenue, up 15% year-over-year, which reflects the broad strength of our products and services. Operating income was over $128 billion, up 17% year-over-year as we invested against the expansive opportunity ahead. And in our largest quarter of the year, we significantly exceeded expectations with strong execution by our sales and partner teams. As Satya shared, we\u2019re innovating faster than ever to deliver new value to our customers. This quarter, revenue was $76.4 billion, up 18%, and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16%, and 15% in constant currency, while operating income increased 23%, and 22% in constant currency.\nAnd earnings per share was $3.65, an increase of 24%, and 22% in constant currency. For the first time, commercial bookings were over $100 billion, increasing 37%, and 30% in constant currency, on a strong prior year comparable. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, as well as an increase in the number of $10 million and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 helped drive these results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $368 billion, up 37% and 35% in constant currency. Roughly 35% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 49%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 98%.\nFX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 27%, and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68%, down 2 points year-over-year from the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by continued efficiency gains in Azure and M365 Commercial Cloud. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency, and operating margins increased 2 points year-over-year to 45%.\nBetter-than-expected revenue growth coupled with a focus on operating efficiently drove the margin expansion. At a total company level, head count at the end of June was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33.1 billion and grew 16%, and 14% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by M365 Commercial products in cloud services and M365 Consumer products in cloud services. M365 Commercial Cloud revenue was ahead of expectations and increased 18%, and 16% in constant currency, with 2 points of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Business trends remained relatively stable to the prior quarter when excluding the in-period revenue recognition, with ARPU growth again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot.\nPaid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 Commercial Products revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 Consumer cloud revenue was better than expected, increasing 20% driven by ARPU growth following the January price increase and subscriber growth of 8%. LinkedIn revenue increased 9%, and 8% in constant currency, with growth across all businesses, though Talent Solutions continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 23%, and 21% in constant currency, with strong execution in our core annuity sales motions leading to growth across all workloads.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by the efficiency gains noted earlier, even as we deliver more AI features across our products and scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 7%, and 6% in constant currency. And operating income increased 21%, and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $29.9 billion and grew 26%, and 25% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by Azure and our on-premises server business. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 39%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by accelerated growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers.\nAs a reminder, new cloud and AI workloads are built and scaled using the breadth of our services. Revenue from Azure AI services was generally in line with expectations. And while we brought additional data center capacity online this quarter, demand remains higher than supply. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2%, and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by transactional purchasing which also has higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue increased 7%, and 6% in constant currency, with growth in Enterprise Support Services partially offset by a decline in Industry Solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17%, and 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year- over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by Azure efficiency gains noted earlier.\nOperating expenses increased 6%, and 4% in constant currency. And operating income grew 23%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.5 billion and grew 9%, exceeding expectations, primarily due to Windows OEM as well as Xbox content and services. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, as inventory levels remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, driven by continued growth in both volume and revenue per search, as well as roughly 8 points of favorable impact from third-party partnerships, including the benefit of a low prior-year comparable. And in Gaming, revenue increased 10%. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13%, and 12% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass.\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 15%. Gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year with improvement across all businesses. Operating expenses increased 4%, and 3% in constant currency. Operating income increased 34%, and 33% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion, including $6.5 billion of finance leases where we recognize the full value at the time of lease commencement. Cash paid for PP&E was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half our spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong demand signals.\nCash flow from operations was $42.6 billion, up 15%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. And this quarter, free cash flow was $25.6 billion. Other income and expense was negative $1.7 billion, primarily due to losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $37 billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY \u201926.\nFirst, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth and COGS growth by approximately 2 points and to increase operating expense growth by 1 point. Next, building on the strong momentum we saw this past year, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth in FY \u201926. We will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operating expenses given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and AI offerings, and significant contracted backlog. Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, will moderate compared to FY \u201925 with a greater mix of short-lived assets. Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2.\nWe remain focused on delivering revenue growth and increasing our operational agility. And as a result, we expect operating margins to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. And finally, we expect our FY \u201926 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now to our outlook for the first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and roughly 1 point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by roughly 1 point. In Commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will again be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and long-term commitments to our platform.\nAs a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable on their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of continuing to scale our AI infrastructure. We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion, driven by the continued strong demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of USD 32.2 billion to USD 32.5 billion, or growth of 14% to 15%, with roughly 3 points of benefit from FX as noted earlier.\nIn M365 Commercial Cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. M365 Commercial Products revenue growth should be in the mid- to high single digits. As a reminder, M365 Commercial Products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the low 20s, driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens with continued growth across all workloads.\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of USD 30.1 billion to USD 30.4 billion, or growth of 25% to 26%, with roughly 1 point of benefit from FX as noted earlier. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which can have quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue bringing more data center capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity- constrained through the first half of our fiscal year. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings.\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be USD 12.4 billion to USD 12.9 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits. We expect the elevated inventory levels at the end of Q4 to come down through the quarter in Windows OEM, although the range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. Overall search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the low double digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits.\nAgainst a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid-single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of USD 24.3 billion to USD 24.5 billion, or growth of 21% to 22%, and operating expense of USD 15.7 billion to USD 15.8 billion, or growth of 5% to 6%. Other income and expense is estimated to be negative $1.3 billion, primarily due to investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. In closing, we finished the year with double-digit revenue and operating income growth and exceeded the FY \u201925 operating margin commitment we shared a year ago.\nOur focus remains on investing in security, quality and AI platform and product innovation that delivers value and opportunity to our customers. We are excited for FY \u201926. With that, let\u2019s go to Q&A, Jonathan.\nJonathan Neilson: Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move over to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nQ&A Session\nFollow Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nFollow Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Congratulations on a fantastic end to FY \u201925. I\u2019ve been covering Microsoft for a while, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a quarter where like everything came together this well. So congratulations on that execution. Maybe a little bit longer-term focused question to start out. You guys have always had software start-ups as customers and potentially emerging competitors. But the AI labs now feel different. Investors are ascribing valuations which assume these companies become major players in software. They\u2019re underwriting revenue forecasts measured in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions. And these start-ups have also grown to be some of your biggest customers, so they\u2019re contributing significantly to Microsoft today.\nSo it seems like there\u2019s a lot of potential opportunity in supporting those businesses, but also it\u2019s not certain that they\u2019re going to stay your customers as they scale. They could in-source some of that infrastructure. And they very likely emerge as potential competitors. So as managers of Microsoft, as managers of the capital, how do you guys manage that risk versus reward with these quickly emerging AI labs and these AI start-ups?\nSatya Nadella: Thanks, Keith, for the question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that different from even sort of the previous era. There\u2019s always been, I\u2019ll call it, head apps or head \u2014 new companies that emerge, that in fact are very needed in order to birth a new platform. Back in the day when I was getting started on Azure, I used to look over the lake and sort of see Netflix and Amazon, and I say, \u201cI wish Netflix ran on Azure.\u201d And in some sense, that\u2019s kind of what we now have, which is the largest AI workloads run on Azure. And when that happens, you learn the workload faster, you optimize the entire platform faster, everything from what you\u2019re doing \u2014 what we\u2019re doing with Cosmos DB for a chat interface like ChatGPT or Copilot, is, guess what, going to be the most relevant for any AI application going forward.\nThe entire data stack that we have now built is going to be optimized for what people describe as one of the hardest challenges of any AI application, called context engineering, right, which is how do you collect your data and then make sure that the context around the problems remain stable over a long period so that you get the intelligence to actually deliver the results you want. So these are workload results that are invaluable for us to learn to build both the products as well as the platform. And then broadly, they \u2014 or rather over time, there will be broad diffusion. In fact, one of the things that Amy and I track is not just the head app usage, but also what\u2019s the sort of all the Tier 2 applications that are being built. So that sort of \u2014 that speaks a little bit, Keith, to I think your question, is as long as we have head apps shaping the platform and then, after that, we have the broad diffusion happen, which in some sense both of those is what we are seeing.\nSo I feel very good about our being in decent standing going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark L. Moerdler: I\u2019d also give you my congratulations. Amazing. I didn\u2019t know how you were going to beat last quarter, and you did it. So congratulations. Satya and Amy, we\u2019re now 2-plus years into the GenAI revolution and adoption is still early and ramping. What do you think is the best way that software companies are going to be able to monetize AI for SaaS? Do you believe there are differences in monetization for horizontal, more general apps like M365 Copilot or Dynamics CRM Copilot versus very targeted capacities on the agentic side? And also, how should you think about the trajectory of SaaS AI margins over the long term?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. I\u2019ll start, and Amy, you should feel free to add. I mean if I just broaden out beyond just SaaS as a category, I think just like the server-to-cloud transition was an expansion of essentially usage of servers. That is essentially what happened with the cloud, right, which is we did a bunch of servers except that the expertise required, the capital required, the time required to bring up servers, build it out, scale it, was just all hard. And so therefore, the market was a certain size. Whereas with the cloud, you could sort of buy it with flexibility, you could burst and you could spin up and spin down, the expertise required came down, so it was just \u2014 orders of magnitude. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. So if you sort of even subscribe to this point of view that intelligence is basically log of compute, that means compute is going to grow and you\u2019ve got to use it as efficiently as possible to just keep creating intelligence.\nNow how does it manifest beyond just the infrastructure? I kind of, to Keith\u2019s earlier question, I talked a little bit about how the infrastructure is getting shaped, data layer is getting shaped, the app server is getting built. These are all classic categories of infrastructure that will continue, but there will be an order or 2 of magnitude more. So literally, like \u2014 in fact, one of the other things we track is every GPU requires storage and compute. That ratio is another thing that is really exponential for infrastructure growth. So when you go to the app layer, the SaaS apps themselves are now building in effectively agentic and chat interfaces with intelligence. And they\u2019re also building autonomous agents. Agents are kind of like applications, like a database application perhaps, but they are being used increasingly inside of a user interaction.\nI think a good example is GitHub Copilot. It got started as code completions on an IDE. Then we added the chat interface to it. Then we added the Agent Mode to it. And now we have an autonomous agent, which in fact works completely asynchronously, right? So all those 4 things are now part of essentially GitHub. And by the way, it also turns out that every other tool that is also doing any form of coding is adding more and more GitHub repos. So if I have to think about GitHub monetization, we have an opportunity around just monetizing GitHub Enterprise and then we have the ability to think about GitHub Copilot, and GitHub Copilot as with all these form factors. And so that\u2019s exactly the same thing that\u2019s happening with Microsoft 365. That\u2019s the same thing that\u2019s happening with Dynamics 365.\nSo you have to be very open to taking your data tier, your business logic tier and your UI tier and sort of being more expansive in it. As long as you do that, it\u2019s just that usage goes up, and that\u2019s what I think shows up in the results.\nAmy E. Hood: And I think, Mark, if you wanted to think about all the things and the layers that you talked about, is really we\u2019re seeing very similar monetization tools exist in this transition too, right? There\u2019s a per user logic, there\u2019s tiers of per user. Sometimes those tiers relate to consumption, sometimes there\u2019s pure consumption models. I think you\u2019ll continue to see a blending of these. Especially as the AI model capability grows, you\u2019ll end up with ways that teams are going to want to throttle that usage, use the best models for the best job. And I think the blending of these models will continue to be something we see on a go-forward basis.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Emil Keirstead: Satya and Amy, this is the second quarter in a row of pretty material Azure upside from what sounds like an acceleration in on-prem to Azure migration activity. I\u2019m just wondering if you can comment on the plethora of customer conversations you\u2019ve had, whether there are a couple of 2 or 3 specific catalysts that are driving that migration. And how durable a trend do you think that is?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. Just 3 things are really happening. One is the migrations. A good example would be what I referenced in my remarks with Nestle, with the SAP instances they moved, along with a lot of the data that\u2019s associated with it and a bunch of servers. So that\u2019s kind of a classic example. I think, whether it\u2019s VMware migrations or migrations of SAP, or even just our own server migrations, they\u2019re pretty healthy. And it turns out that we\u2019re still not anywhere close to the finish line, if at best, maybe in the middle innings of that. The second thing that\u2019s also happening is cloud-native applications that are scaling. This is even excluding all of the AI stuff, just the classic cloud native e-commerce company, let\u2019s say.\nThese are scaling in a big way. And some of those customers were not on Azure previously, but now they\u2019re increasingly there, because they have come for AI perhaps but they now stay for more than AI. And so to me, that\u2019s another thing you see in overall, what\u2019s happening across the Azure number. And then, of course, there are the new AI workloads. So those are 3 things that are all, in some sense, building on each other, but that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s driving our growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.\nBrent John Thill: Satya, back to the strength across the board in the quarter, was there anything that jumped out at you or surprised you that you didn\u2019t think you were going to see but you did see in the quarter? Just the magnitude of upside, I think, had shocked many here.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. I don\u2019t know, Brent, if anything really surprised us. But I think what we are noticing in our own build-out of these AI applications and in general is the platform is becoming more than, \u201cHere is the model and here is an API. Make some calls,\u201d right? I mean that, in some sense, was a bit of the state-of-the-art maybe even a year ago. Whereas now you have essentially these very stateful app patterns that are emerging that require quite a bit of rethinking of even the app stack. I mean take even the storage tier stuff, right, the degree of sophistication you have, and hey, how much of an index do you really want to build by preprocessing so that your prompt engineering, or context engineering as I call it, can be better and higher quality?\nSo I think all of that is emerging. So when I look at a product like Azure Search, Fabric and Cosmos DB, all of the things, the frameworks around it, are just becoming robust to build serious applications. And so that\u2019s what I feel great about, is the learning curve inside the company, outside the company, the diffusion of the stack, the speed with which that\u2019s emerging, that you can build applications, is much faster. I always go back and say, hey, when, I don\u2019t know, relational database came out, it took a while for people to build an ERP system, let\u2019s say. And this thing, we\u2019re kind of building pretty sophisticated applications at a very, very fast clip based on, I think, the degree of maturity that\u2019s emerging.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Congrats from me as well. I had one question on Copilot, and I\u2019m obviously a happy user here at Barclays. If you think about it, the one thing that we\u2019re all realizing is that Copilot is the AI part, but data is becoming more and more important. And then from there on, we can start thinking about agents. Where is the \u2014 what are you seeing in your customer conversations, Satya, about like that understanding that Copilot is actually just the starting point, and then, from there on, it\u2019s becoming like much, much broader?\nSatya Nadella: Yes. I think that that\u2019s right. Even inside of Copilot, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re seeing it, right? You now have Analyst and Researcher, to just talk about 2 examples, and of course, people, all the third-party agents. So yes, there is a lot more of it\u2019s just not request, respond. It\u2019s about spawning essentially applications that then go do work and come back. But the UI still remains very important, right, even for asynchronous work. To instruct the asynchronous work, you need UI. And to monitor asynchronous work, you need UI. Maybe different, it may not be a chat interface. And of course, you need a way to then inspect what the asynchronous work is, right? So even take the example I was giving on GitHub. Even if you\u2019re not using GitHub Copilot to create the core check-in or the pull request, interestingly enough, we\u2019re seeing massive increase to GitHub Copilot Code Review Agent even if you used maybe Claude Code or whatever else to write the code.\nSo that\u2019s I think what\u2019s happening across all of these systems. So you\u2019re absolutely right that you need \u2014 it starts with some kind of a UI that\u2019s more chat focused, but it quickly goes beyond it. And you see it in M365, you see it in Dynamics 365 and you see it in GitHub.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Gopalan Rangan: Amy, I want to acknowledge that, I think a few quarters ago, you said that you\u2019ll reach a point in time where you can accelerate Azure while slowing down CapEx. So you did it. But what is the outlook? When I look at the CapEx guidance for the upcoming quarter, certainly, I would view that as a positive indicator of the book of business you have for your cloud services. But how should we think about the shape of the curve of CapEx vis-a-vis Azure growth rate in the years ahead, particularly as I listen to Satya\u2019s comments on the AI stack consuming more and more infrastructure? Are we at a point where we\u2019re going to have to continue to do this and we magically wait for inference and applications to kick in and, therefore, create a richer gross margin mix? Congrats on the quarter.\nAmy E. Hood: Thanks, Kash. Let me back up and first say, when you think about the full year comments I\u2019ve made on CapEx as well as the Q1 guidance of over $30 billion, you first have to ground yourself in the fact that we have $368 billion of contracted backlog we need to deliver, not just across Azure but across the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud. So in terms of feeling good about the ROI and the growth rates and the correlation, I feel very good that the spend that we\u2019re making is correlated to basically contracted on the books business that we need to deliver and we need the teams to execute at their very best to get the capacity in place as quickly and effectively as they can. And so when you look, and we\u2019ve talked about the growth rate will decline year-over-year, but at its core, our investments, particularly in short-lived assets like servers, GPUs, CPUs, networking storage, is just really correlated to the backlog we see and the curve of demand.\nAnd I talked about, my gosh, in January and said I thought we\u2019d be in better supply demand shape by June. And now I\u2019m saying I hope I\u2019m in better shape by December. And that\u2019s not because we slowed CapEx. Even with accelerating the spend and trying to pull leases in and get CPUs and GPUs in the system as quickly as we can, we are still seeing demand improve. And so I am not as focused, Kash, on trying to pick a date at which revenue growth and CapEx growth will meet and cross. I\u2019m focused on building backlog, building business and delivering capacity, which we are seeing has a good ROI today in terms of our ability to get that done. So I don\u2019t want people to get overly focused on a pivot point. Because when you\u2019re in sort of these expansive moments, picking a data point usually means you\u2019re going to pick to be too conservative in terms of market share gain and in terms of winning.\nAnd so I tend to put my energy more there.\nSatya Nadella: Yes. I think one of the other things, Kash, is that \u2014 I think I said this in the previous earnings as well, which is the difference between a hoster and a hyperscaler is software. And the same is going to be true here. That GPT4o example I gave is all software, right, the optimization even in the last year. So we know how to use the software skills to take any piece of hardware and make it multiple x better. And so that\u2019s kind of where the yield will come. But as Amy said, while you\u2019re really going and building out the plant, you don\u2019t want to sort of serialize it. You just want to go in and paddle on all of these fronts, and that\u2019s sort of what will compound over time.\nAmy E. Hood: And I do think it\u2019s important, when Satya talks about the software layer, he is talking about, in his comments, to connect this back to the compounding S curves. And so I would remind people, that is something that we saw through the prior cloud transition, it\u2019s how we operated through that one. And the same sort of skills and logic done at an even faster pace is what will apply the same transition.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael James Turrin: Congrats from me as well on the metrics working in concert here. Amy, maybe on margin. Impressive to hear expectations for flat operating margin in the upcoming year as you absorb some of the mix shift towards Azure and some of the more AI-focused offerings. Can you speak in more detail just around your ability to manage those trade-offs and offset some of the mix shift? And I\u2019m wondering specifically just on any productivity gains you\u2019re seeing from leveraging AI internally that you\u2019d highlight, or anything else you\u2019d just mention underpinning the full year expectation there?\nAmy E. Hood: Thanks, Michael. I think really the area to focus on is, when you think about margin, I think sometimes people get a lot of energy around cost control as a driver of margin. The other driver is to focus on making sure you deliver a great product that\u2019s competitive and innovative and can take share, because that drives revenue. And revenue itself, and revenue growth as you all know better, even perhaps than I do, is a durable way to see margin improvement. It builds on itself. That being said, the second thing I would point to is really what I talked to Kash a little bit about before, Satya and I both mentioned it, is applying all of our skill set here to deliver efficiencies, whether that\u2019s at whatever layer of the stack that exists, the S curves compound, and we are doing that work and we\u2019re focused on it at the same time we\u2019re doing the build out.\nSo you\u2019ll see improvements there even as we continue to invest. And then, of course, it\u2019s about continuing to have great talent here focused on products and opportunities where we have the biggest markets and the most likelihood of success. And so when we have those 3 things happen and the energy is right and the focus is there, it gives me confidence in terms of margin delivery. But make no mistake, it starts and ends really with product, which is what we\u2019re really focused on here, and delivering that to customers.\nMichael James Turrin: That all sounds pretty good.\nJonathan Neilson: Thanks, Michael. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.\nSatya Nadella: Thank you.\nAmy E. Hood: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy?
