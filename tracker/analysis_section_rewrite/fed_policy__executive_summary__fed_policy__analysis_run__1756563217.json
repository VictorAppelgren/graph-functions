      "feedback": "Your draft exceeds the 4–6‑sentence limit and contains several drifted clauses that do not map cleanly to a canonical handle or a dated catalyst.  Condense the view into **5 bullet points** that each start with a clear handle (e.g., “DXY”), state the sign and magnitude (bp or %), and end with a single inline citation.  Remove the paragraph on “Trump’s attempts to influence Fed composition” unless you can tie it explicitly to a DXY‑relevant transmission (e.g., curve‑widening → DXY‑weakening) with a citation.  Drop the “earnings season” risk unless you can link it to a specific DXY catalyst (e.g., earnings‑driven Fed‑rate expectations).  Keep the catalyst list but re‑format it as a concise table or bullet list: (1) Aug 29–31 tariff announcement → DXY –200 bp; (2) Sep 10 CPI → DXY –200 bp if PCE < 3.0 %; (3) Sep 16 Fed meeting → DXY –200 bp if 25‑bp cut; (4) Sep 18–20 Fed cut implementation → DXY –200 bp.  Add a risk bullet that reads: “A Fed minute signaling a pause or a 70–100 bp DXY lift would compress equity valuations (7XH2DKEKV).”  Finally, ensure every bullet ends with a citation ID and that the overall tone is executive, decision‑useful, and free of generic platitudes.",
