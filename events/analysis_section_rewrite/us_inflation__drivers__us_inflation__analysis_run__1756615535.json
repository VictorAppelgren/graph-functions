      "feedback": "The draft correctly identifies the Fed cut as the engine for a 0.5–1 % DXY rally, but it needs tighter causal mapping, explicit numeric ranges, and cleaner source attribution. Replace the vague “temporary dip of roughly 200 bp” with a concrete figure (e.g., “DXY projected to dip to 95.8 on Aug 31, 86 % probability, driven by a 57‑bp steepening of the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread”) and attach the appropriate ID (Z7O1DCHS7). Explicitly map the view to the canonical handle `dxy` with sign +0.5‑1 % over a 3‑6‑month horizon and add a short‑term upside range of +50–100 bp tied to the Aug 30 PCE and Aug 31 NFP (cite 7XH2DKEKV). Clarify the transmission chain with numeric yields: Fed cut → 2‑yr yield ↓ ≈ 10 bp → 10‑yr yield ↑ ≈ 20 bp → steepening → real yield differential ↑ ≈ 10 bp → DXY ↑. Add risk mapping: a Fed rate hike → 10‑yr yield ↑, flattening → DXY ↓ (cite LF0UUL917); a 1‑2 % rise in the 30‑yr Treasury → mortgage rates ↑ 20–30 bp → credit tightening → DXY pressure (cite LF0UUL917). Include a watch‑list sentence: “Monitor September Fed meeting minutes, early‑August CPI, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, and 30‑yr Treasury yield for confirmation or reversal.” Remove any mention of the Jackson Hole symposium unless it directly feeds the Fed cut signal. Ensure every claim has an inline source ID and that the paragraph stays focused solely on `dxy` with no drift.",
