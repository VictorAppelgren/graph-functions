      "feedback": "Your draft wisely uses a 4-line mover structure (two Up, two Down) but to reach world-class quality you need tighter first-principles grounding, explicit probabilities anchored to concrete catalysts, and exact formatting adherence. Actionable edits: 1) Recast the Movers exactly as Up 0–3 weeks, Up 3–6 weeks, Down 0–3 weeks, Down 3–6 weeks, each with a crisp Driver/Mechanism, a concrete What to watch, and a probability that is numerically valued and anchored to evidence (e.g., near-term sentiment lift from the surprise Intel stake and governance overlay cited by XQWTVR71K; vesting milestones toward ~15% voting power cited by XQWTVR71K and OB27SL8WU). 2) Ground every driver in first principles (event → governance/capital allocation → stock reaction) and keep the causal chain tight; reduce narrative fluff and ensure each line ties directly to a trigger that is observable within the material. 3) Attach in-line IDs only to statements that rely on numeric facts or explicit claims (e.g., 368B backlog, 39% Azure growth, 16% FCF margin, 12–18% premium, 1.8–2.2% yields, the ~15% voting-power path) and avoid mixing broad cross-asset commentary into the Movers; keep those numbers in the base context but reference them in the Watch items where they inform the probability or risk. 4) For probabilities, provide explicit ranges and rationale (e.g., Up 0–3w: 60–75% given immediate sentiment lift from stake news (XQWTVR71K); Up 3–6w: 40–60% as vesting milestones approach; Down 0–3w: 25–40% due to potential stall or friction; Down 3–6w: 30–50% from policy/AI-cycle risk), and cite only when specifying facts. 5) The Trade/Outlook Plan must be a Swing Trade if Intel is tradable: supply a single-line or two lines with Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %; fill these with precise, near-term price anchors or well-defined -price-based- triggers (e.g., entry near current price with stop below swing low and target at a defined multiple of risk, tied to a stake-driven breakout) and assign a credible Probability % and Confidence % (rooted in the proximity and robustness of catalysts). 6) Eliminate non-mover background in the Movers section and ensure the four lines stay strictly within the required format; if you keep a longer base-case narrative, move it to a separate analysis section outside the Movers block but keep the four mover lines clean and interpretable. 7) Ensure consistency of the sourced facts by aligning all metric-driven claims (Azure 39%, backlog 368B, SHOP GMV 163B, etc.) to the same IDs and place them in the Watch or Base Context rather than as repetitive citations inside the four lines. 8) Finally, validate that the overall narrative remains horizon-consistent with the invariant regime framing (Regime A/B/C) and that the four lines collectively map to a coherent near-term price trajectory, with explicit invalidation and triggers tied to vesting milestones, governance signals, and policy dynamics.",
