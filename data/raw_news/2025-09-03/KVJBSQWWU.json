  "content": "Shares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) jumped 2.6% in the morning session after a court ruling ordered competitor Google to share some of its search data.\n\nThe ruling requires Google to provide rivals with access to certain search index and interaction data, a move that could significantly help Apple develop and enhance its own competitive AI chatbots and search tools. This legal development is seen as a major benefit for Apple's ambitions in the artificial intelligence space.\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple has substantially increased its shipment forecast for the upcoming iPhone Fold, signaling strong confidence in the new foldable smartphone. Furthermore, reports indicate Apple is accelerating the use of automation and robotics throughout its supply chain to reduce labor dependency and ensure consistent product quality.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $237.20, up 3.3% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nApple\u2019s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 28 days ago when the stock gained 5.7% as the company planned a new $100 billion commitment to American manufacturing.\n\nA White House official revealed the plan, which accelerated Apple's total domestic investment to $600 billion over the next four years. The company's CEO previously stated this investment aimed to drive innovation and create jobs in advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence.\n\nThis news built on recent positive momentum. An analyst at Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, citing strong App Store performance data. This positive sentiment also followed Apple's strong third-quarter results where the company topped analyst expectations for revenue and profit.\n\nApple is down 2.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $237.20 per share, it is still trading close to its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,962.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

      "text": "A Profitable Growth Stock Benefitting From The Rise of AI\nLattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ: LSCC) has long been one of the most exciting stocks on our watchlist because we think the company is benefitting from the rise of artificial intelligence.\nAs you can see from the chart below, the Lattice Semiconductor stock price dropped suddenly in October 2023. Just days later on 3 November 2023, we chose Lattice Semiconductor as the StockStory Edge stock of the month for November and emailed our detailed buy recommendation to members.\nAs our way of welcoming you aboard our free membership tier, we hope you enjoy this abridged version of our full recommendation, which is only available to members of StockStory Edge.\nWhat Does Lattice Semiconductor Do?\nLattice is a leading designer of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).\nField Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, are like a special kind of computer chip. You could think of them as like a LEGO set for building complex electronic systems. They are used for a variety of complex products like robots that work in distribution centers and cars with self-driving technology.\nNormally, computer chips are set to do one job and can't be changed. But FPGAs are different. After you buy them, you can change how they work to do different jobs. It's like having a LEGO set where you can first build a tiger, then take it apart and build a red panda, then take it apart and build a goldfish, all using the same pieces.\nFPGAs have emerged as a preferred solution for customers in rapidly evolving technological fields because their flexibility gives them significant cost and time advantages over legacy chips that can\u2019t be changed once manufactured. In AI research, for example, FPGAs\u2019 reprogrammable nature allows engineers to quickly change their algorithms without buying a new batch of chips that can cost millions of dollars.\nGiven its chips\u2019 customization abilities, Lattice collaborates intimately with customers to implement designs. The company achieves this through its team of field applications engineers and proprietary software solutions that allow for more user-friendly experiences. We like that it has a software solution because essential software can often earn very high profit margins.\nWe believe the demand for LSCC\u2019s FPGAs is durable. Its chips are critical components for dynamic, high-growth industries such as AI, industrial robotics, autonomous vehicles (i.e., self-driving technology), and 5G wireless infrastructure. We see a bigger role for these technologies in the future, and that means more demand for Lattice Semiconductor\u2019s products.\nRisks\nThe first risk is a potential semiconductor downturn. The industry is cyclical due to the interplay of global economic growth, inventories, and technological obsolescence. We believe Lattice is partially insulated from obsolescence because of the re-programmability of FPGAs, but there\u2019s no denying it\u2019s tethered to the macro, which is sometimes good, sometimes bad, and sometimes somewhere in between. Investing over the long term by holding high-quality companies over three to five years, however, can meaningfully negate this roller coaster.\nLike many semiconductor companies, Lattice is a \u201cfabless\u201d chip designer, meaning it doesn\u2019t manufacture, assemble, or test its chips in-house. Instead, it outsources these functions to partners like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) so that the company can focus on innovation. This means LSCC\u2019s supply chain could be disrupted if China blockaded Taiwan (or worse).\nFinally, there is competition. The company has a strong grip over the small-range FPGA market. The mid-range market is currently up for grabs, and we think Avant is a strong contender. On the other hand, AMD and Intel could also attack the mid-range market by providing customers with more tailored solutions. Thus far, the two giants have mostly set their sights on large-range FPGAs, which are mostly used for the highest-intensity applications.\nWhy We Like Lattice Semiconductors\nLattice is an exceptionally high-quality business and its best-in-class profit margins have always kept it near the top of our list. Semiconductors are cyclical businesses, so demand fluctuations are normal and temporary. We think Lattice can easily outlast any lulls in demand, thanks to strong free cash flow margins.\nOur view is that LSCC is the leader in a high-growth market, and its total addressable market is about to double.\n1. Lattice is benefitting from the rise of AI\nLattice is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI because its silicon is on almost every new AI server shipped globally today. That rate should increase as servers steadily consume more chips and the total number of servers grows with more businesses, organizations, and people using generative AI and large language models (like ChatGPT).\nAI will also bring an explosion in edge computing. Edge computing describes processing done on a server or device closer to the data source rather than in centralized data centers. Massive amounts of data must be analyzed at low latencies for AI to work at scale, and LSCC\u2019s FPGAs\u2013with their parallel processing capabilities that boost analytical speed and re-programmability that allows for easy adjustments to constantly changing AI algorithms\u2013are must-haves.\n2. Lattice has strong revenue and earnings per share growth\nLSCC is a 40-year-old company that has consistently done one thing well: designing FPGAs. Over the last five years, its revenue has grown from about $400 million to what will be $740+ million this year (13% annualized growth rate), and its EPS rose by almost 500% over the same period.\nAdditionally, Lattice\u2019s unique chips and intellectual property have enabled it to generate a robust 70% gross margin and 40% adjusted operating margin. This has led to heaps of free cash flow that the company has reinvested into product innovation. As of late, LSCC has even had excess cash to return to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In 2022, it repurchased $110 million of stock, the highest annual total in its history.\n3. New Product Platform\nFor most of its history, LSCC has focused on the small-range, power-efficient FPGA market for applications requiring simple logic functions. The company\u2019s Nexus product line, released in late 2019, made Lattice the #1 player in the global FPGA market by volume. These chips were so popular because they featured the smallest chip sizes and lowest power consumption in the industry (75% less power consumption than comparable products from AMD and Intel).\nDespite its success, Lattice is not standing still. Less than a year ago, the company entered the mid-range FPGA market with its Avant product line. These chips are leveraged in more rigorous use cases requiring edge computing (the \u201cE\u201d in Avant-E, see below) such as industrial robotics, autonomous vehicle networking, and machine vision (using cameras and computers to inspect and measure).\nWe think Avant is a game-changing development because its FPGAs boast 2x the bandwidth capabilities, 2.5x better power efficiency, and are up to 6x smaller than competing products from AMD and Intel. They are simply superior products.\n4. Experienced Leadership\nLattice is led by CEO James Anderson, who joined the company in September 2018. Luckily for investors, his prior two roles were in key leadership positions at AMD and Intel. Anderson\u2019s hiring was part of the complete turnover of Lattice\u2019s old management team, and seven executives were recruited to join him.\nTwo individuals worth calling out are Stephen Douglass (Chief Technology Officer) and Mark Nelson (SVP of Sales). Douglass joined from Xilinx, which was the largest FPGA company before being acquired by AMD in 2022, while Nelson joined from Intel. We believe the management team\u2019s deep knowledge of the industry and its closest competitors gives it an advantage.\nSumming it all up, our research suggests that LSCC\u2019s $660 million of revenue in 2022 can nearly double to about $1.2 billion in five years, a 13% annualized growth rate. With higher margins from Avant sales, efficiency from selling to existing customers, and continued share buybacks, that revenue growth can translate into nearly 20% EPS growth per annum. We believe this kind of growth should see the stock will reach $90 by the end of 2026.\nWith a bit of luck\u2013and the optimism of a bull market\u2013shareholders may well see a higher price.\nIf you enjoyed this abridged version of our Stock of the Month for November 2023 you\u2019ll love the full version.

      "text": "Apple (AAPL)\nApple piques our interest. It generates heaps of cash that are reinvested into the business, creating a virtuous cycle of returns.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy Apple Is Interesting\nCreator of the iPhone and App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.\n- Apple's revenue base is so large because nearly everyone in the U.S. has an iPhone, but this is a double-edged sword. Growth must now come from upgrades, a harder pitch that has resulted in sluggish top-line performance recently.\n- Still, Apple's devices have endured for decades, speaking to its brand, design ethos, and technological chops. Its success is rare in the world of consumer electronics, which is fraught because of commoditization, competition, and obsolescence risk.\n- The company may not have the best gross margin because of its hardware orientation, but it still manages to produce elite operating and free cash flow margins. This shows it doesn\u2019t need over-the-top marketing campaigns to convince people to buy its products.\nWhy Should You Watch Apple\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy Should You Watch Apple\nAt $236.80 per share, Apple trades at 30.8x forward price-to-earnings. While Apple\u2019s valuation multiple is lower than that of many consumer discretionary peers, we\u2019re waiting for an even cheaper price given its quality.\nFor now, this is one to add to your watchlist. We prefer owning businesses with better fundamentals that trade at similar multiples.\n3. Apple (AAPL) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\niPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 9.6% year on year to $94.04 billion. Its GAAP profit of $1.57 per share was 10.1% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nApple (AAPL) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $94.04 billion vs analyst estimates of $89.54 billion (5% beat)\n- Operating Profit (GAAP): $28.2 billion vs analyst estimates of $25.86 billion (9.1% beat)\n- EPS (GAAP): $1.57 vs analyst estimates of $1.43 (10.1% beat)\n- Products Revenue: $66.61 billion vs analyst estimates of $62.76 billion (6.1% beat)\n- Services Revenue: $27.42 billion vs analyst estimates of $26.81 billion (2.3% beat)\n- Gross Margin: 46.5%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Operating Margin: 30%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 26%, down from 31.1% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $3.12 trillion\nKey Topics & Areas Of Debate\nOn June 10, 2024, Apple held its Worldwide Developers Conference. The splashy announcement was Apple Intelligence, which combines GenAI with user-specific data to enhance personalization across its ecosystem. This new feature is powered by a combination of internally developed large-language models (LLMs) and OpenAI's GPT-4.0.\nThe holiday season will be a big test for Apple since the iPhone 16 was released on September 20, 2024 - backward compatibility with Apple Intelligence is limited, so the market is waiting to see if this integration will spur a large, multi-year device upgrade cycle. A potential upgrade cycle would lead to spikes in shipment volumes, which could also increase its higher-margin Services revenue.\nBefore the Apple Intelligence announcement, some investors were bemoaning Apple\u2019s seeming lack of participation in the AI wave. How did a company that introduced Siri in 2011 fail to introduce a ChatGPT-like platform before OpenAI? This is a critical juncture where the misstep could be forgotten if the company re-establishes itself as a major AI player.\nSamsung (KOSE:A005930) is Apple\u2019s main competitor in the worldwide smartphone market while its mobile operating system competes with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android. Regarding other devices and services, competitors include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in MacBooks, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in Apple TV, and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) in Apple Music.\n4. Company Overview\nCreator of the iPhone and App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.\nApple was founded in 1976 as a personal computer company by the visionary trio of Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The company\u2019s early history certainly had its ups and downs. The Macintosh\u2013introduced in 1984\u2013changed how consumers interact with computers, but the next year saw the departure of Steve Jobs.\nHe eventually returned in 1997 to lead the struggling Apple\u2019s resurgence. First, he revolutionized music with the iPod in 2001. Then, he redefined mobile communication with the iPhone in 2007.\nAlthough Jobs passed away in 2011, Apple is still a titan in personal technology today. Tim Cook, Jobs's successor, now leads the company and has helped transform it from a low-margin hardware maker into one that wraps its devices with high-margin software, which is included in its Services segment and encompasses app distribution (App Store), entertainment (Apple TV+, Apple Music), personal finance (Apple Pay), and advertising.\nThe key questions now are if Apple can continue expanding its Services products to boost margins, and if new technologies like Apple Intelligence can spur a device upgrade cycle.\n5. Revenue Growth\nApple (with its installed base of 2 billion+ devices) proves that huge, scaled companies can still grow. The company\u2019s revenue base of $273.9 billion five years ago has increased to $408.6 billion in the last year, translating into a decent 8.3% annualized growth rate.\nIn light of its big tech peers, however, Apple\u2019s growth trailed Amazon (15.8%), Alphabet (17.5%), and Microsoft (14.5%) over the same period. Comparing the four is relevant because investors often pit them against each other to derive their valuations. When adjusting for these benchmarks, we think Apple\u2019s price is fair.\nLong-term growth reigns supreme in fundamentals, but for big tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss emerging trends in AI. Apple\u2019s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 3.2% over the last two years was below its five-year trend.\nThis quarter, Apple reported year-on-year revenue growth of 9.6%, and its $94.04 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 5%. Looking ahead, sell-side This projection illustrates the market sees some success for its newer AI-enabling Apple Intelligence products. However, its anticipated growth is still a far cry from its heyday in the 2010s.\n6. Products: Steve Jobs\u2019s Legacy\nApple\u2019s Products segment includes everything from its flagship iPhone, iPad, and MacBook computers to AirPods and Apple Watch. We are closely monitoring whether the GenAI-powered Apple Intelligence, which was released in September 2024 but has limited interoperability with older devices, can spur an upgrade cycle for the company.\nProducts sales are by far the biggest chunk of Apple\u2019s revenue at 74.2%, and they grew by 6.4% annually over the last five years, slower than total revenue. Recently, sales have also decelerated, as revenue was flat over the last two years. Apple could really use that upgrade cycle right about now.\nThis quarter, Products sales were up 8.2% year on year, topping Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 6.1%. Holding aside expectations, the recently improved rate of change shows that more customers are upgrading their devices than before. We\u2019ll be watching to see if Apple Intelligence and iOS 18 can accelerate this trend. Wall Street seems to believe it won't move the needle.\n7. Services: Tim Cook\u2019s Touch\nThe App Store, iCloud, and Apple Music transformed Apple from a lower-margin hardware company into a software provider. If Apple Intelligence spurs an upgrade cycle, will it also open new software revenue streams (like a paid version of Siri) that boost profit margins?\nThis is the key question for the Services segment, which must continue mining its existing markets or venture into new ones such as health and wellness to grow.\nOver the last five years, Services revenue was a bright spot and grew at a strong 15.3% annualized rate, showing Apple is successfully locking customers further into its ecosystem. Services is now 25.8% of total revenue, up from 18.9% in 2020, and could become larger if its growth rate keeps exceeding Products.\nLike the rest of the business, however, Services revenue slightly decelerated if we look at its 13.3% annual growth rate for the last two years. Still, this growth is a welcome figure compared to the flat Products sales over the same period.\nThe Services segment\u2019s 13.3% revenue growth this quarter beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 2.3% and accelerated from last quarter\u2019s 11.6%. While just one quarter, the acceleration shows that Services (unlike Products) is finding monetization opportunities within Apple\u2019s ecosystem. It also means the company can afford to wait for the potential Apple Intelligence tailwind to materialize.\n8. Gross Margin\nApple\u2019s Products and Services segments have different margin structures. Products averaged a lower gross margin of 36.2% over the last five years due to its raw materials and procurement expenses while Services, consisting of software and subscriptions with little to no physical costs, averaged 72.3%.\nOn a consolidated basis, Apple\u2019s gross profit margin averaged 44.2%, predictably between Products and Services. Should the Services segment continue to grow its revenue faster than the Products segment as it has over the last two years, the company\u2019s gross margin could increase even if the underlying profitability of its individual product lines doesn\u2019t change.\nApple\u2019s gross margin was 46.5% in Q2, in line with the same quarter last year. That means for every $100 in revenue, $46.49 was left to invest in marketing, R&D, and general administrative overhead.\n9. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability for Apple. It\u2019s the portion of revenue left after accounting for all operating expenses \u2013 everything from the cost of sales we talked about earlier to salaries, product development, and administrative expenses.\nApple has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a consumer discretionary business, boasting an average operating of 30.4%. This was especially robust given its large hardware revenue component.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Apple\u2019s operating rose by 3.1 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. This expansion was also driven by the company\u2019s mix shift towards Services, and the rise could continue if Apple Intelligence results in more pricing power or if Products becomes an increasingly smaller part of the business.\nThis quarter, Apple generated an operating profit margin of 30%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s cost structure has recently been stable.\nIn the coming year, Wall Street expects Apple to maintain its trailing 12-month operating of 31.9%.\n10. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) alongside revenue and margins because it shows whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable and what else affects shareholder returns.\nApple\u2019s EPS grew at a spectacular 14.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 8.3% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nWe can take a deeper look into Apple\u2019s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Apple\u2019s operating was flat this quarter but expanded by 3.1 percentage points over the last five years. On top of that, its share count shrank by 14.2%. These are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth.\nLike with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business.\nFor Apple, its two-year annual EPS growth of 5.2% was lower than its five-year trend. This wasn\u2019t great, but at least the company was successful in other measures of financial health.\nIn Q2, Apple reported EPS at $1.57, up from $1.40 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Apple\u2019s full-year EPS of $6.59 to grow 12.7%.\n11. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nApple has shown terrific cash profitability, enabling it to reinvest, return capital to investors, and stay ahead of the competition while maintaining an ample cushion. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin was among the best in the consumer discretionary sector, averaging 26.3% over the last five years.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Apple\u2019s margin dropped by 3.8 percentage points during that time. Continued declines could signal it is in the middle of an investment cycle as it competes for the best AI chips to power its products.\nApple\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $24.41 billion in Q2, equivalent to a 26% margin. The company\u2019s cash profitability regressed as it was 5.2 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, suggesting its historical struggles have dragged on.\nOver the next year, analysts predict Apple\u2019s cash conversion will improve. Their consensus estimates imply its free cash flow margin of 23.5% for the last 12 months will increase to 28.5%, giving it options for capital deployment (investments, share buybacks, dividends).\n12. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nApple\u2019s five-year average ROIC was 92.5%, placing it among the best consumer discretionary companies. This illustrates its management team\u2019s ability to invest in highly profitable ventures and produce tangible results for shareholders.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Fortunately, Apple\u2019s ROIC has increased significantly over the last few years. This is a great sign when paired with its already strong returns. It could suggest its competitive advantage or profitable growth opportunities are expanding.\n13. Balance Sheet Assessment\nApple reported $55.37 billion of cash and $101.7 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $144.9 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Apple\u2019s 0.3\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $2.83 billion of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n14. Key Takeaways from Apple\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Apple blew past analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates, as Products and Services all beat. Zooming out, we think this was a good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 2.4% to $212.58 immediately following the results.\n15. Is Now The Time To Buy Apple?\nUpdated: September 2, 2025 at 10:01 PM EDT\nThe latest quarterly earnings matters, sure, but we actually think longer-term fundamentals and valuation matter more. Investors should consider all these pieces before deciding whether or not to invest in Apple.\nThere are a lot of things to like about Apple. To kick things off, its decent long-term revenue growth driven by the Services segment implies slightly more customers are subscribing to its high-margin software offerings. And while its falling cash profitability means it\u2019s investing heavily in AI to catch up with its competitors, its powerful free cash flow generation enables it to invest in growth initiatives like AI while returning capital to shareholders. On top of that, its strong operating margin suggests it has a highly efficient business model.\nApple\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio based on the next 12 months is 30.8x. This multiple tells us that a lot of good news is priced in. Apple is a good one to add to your watchlist - there are companies featuring superior fundamentals at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $235.00 on the company (compared to the current share price of $236.80)."

The rally was supported by analyst Ming\u2011Chi Kuo\u2019s upgraded iPhone Fold shipment outlook and reports of increased automation in Apple\u2019s supply chain. While the gain reflects positive sentiment, it is unlikely to materially alter Apple\u2019s long\u2011term fundamentals, which remain driven by its services segment and ongoing AI investments.",
