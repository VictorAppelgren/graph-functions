  "content": "\u2022 Cash Used in Operating Activities Reduced to $3.8 Million vs. $5.3 Million in the Prior Year, Reflecting Stronger Operating Discipline\n\n\n\nIRVINE, Calif., Aug. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biomerica, Inc. (NASDAQ: BMRA) today reported its financial results for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025 (Fiscal 2025).\n\nThe Company reported net sales of $5.3 million, compared to $5.4 million in the prior year. Revenue was modestly lower due to global tariff-related uncertainties, which caused certain international customers to delay orders, and a shift in product mix with fewer over-the-counter (OTC) retail sales during the fourth quarter. These headwinds were partially offset with increased sales from inFoods\u00ae IBS.\n\nGross profit for the year was $498,000, versus $611,000 in the prior year, reflecting the impact of the macro-economic events on revenue and product mix.\n\nCash used in operating activities improved significantly to $3.8 million, compared to $5.3 million in the prior year, a $1.5 million improvement driven by operating efficiencies and disciplined expense management.\n\nThrough disciplined cost management, Biomerica reduced selling, general and administrative expenses to $4.6 million, compared to $5.5 million in the prior year and reduced research and development expenses to $1.0 million, compared to $1.5 million in the prior year. In total, operating expenses declined by more than $1.3 million, delivering on the cost-reduction goals announced at the beginning of the fiscal year.\n\nAs a result, operating loss improved to $5.1 million, compared to $6.4 million in the prior year \u2013 a 19% year-over-year improvement, despite revenue headwinds.\n\nBiomerica is actively working in three key areas to drive revenue growth:\n\u2022 inFoods IBS Opportunities \u2013 Insurance Reimbursement: The American Medical Association CPT Editorial Panel has issued a Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (PLA) code for Biomerica\u2019s inFoods IBS test, advancing the pathway for reimbursement and broader access.\n\u2022 EZ Detect\u2122 and Other At-Home Tests in the MENA Region: Continued regulatory clearances and expanded distribution partnerships across the Middle East and North Africa; Biomerica is also pursuing insurance reimbursement for newly cleared products.\n\u2022 H. pylori Antigen Sales in the U.S. and Europe: The Company is in discussion for the evaluations of the Hp Detect\u2122 Stool Antigen ELISA test.\n\n\n\nPLA Code Submission: Biomerica submitted a Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (PLA) code application for its inFoods\u00ae IBS diagnostic product. Further, following year-end, the Company received a PLA code advancing the pathway for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and broader patient access.\n\nPeer-Reviewed Validation: Clinical study results for inFoods\u00ae IBS were published in June 2025 Gastroenterology, confirming statistically significant improvements in abdominal pain and bloating with patient-specific dietary guidance.\n\nIVDR Certification: The Company achieved EU IVDR certification for its food-intolerance diagnostic tests targeting Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, supporting future European commercialization.\n\nMENA Expansion: Following the year-end, the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Health and Prevention approved Biomerica\u2019s Fortel\u00ae PSA rapid screening test, expanding the Company\u2019s footprint in the Middle East.\n\nDirect-to-Consumer Launch: Biomerica introduced direct-to-consumer availability of inFoods\u00ae IBS, significantly broadening patient reach through telehealth and digital distribution channels.\n\nIntellectual Property Growth: Three new international patents were issued covering applications of the inFoods\u00ae technology platform in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Crohn\u2019s disease, and ulcerative colitis.\n\nAdvancement of inFoods\u00ae IBS: The inFoods\u00ae IBS diagnostic test has progressed significantly with the introduction of a new patient self-collection system. This system allows patients to collect their own blood samples at home using a simple finger-stick device, enabling nationwide access through telehealth and online medical providers. This innovation greatly expands the reach of inFoods\u00ae IBS to millions of IBS sufferers.\n\nBiomerica remains committed to advancing its financial position and driving long-term growth through innovative medical products and strategic partnerships.\n\nBiomerica, Inc. (www.biomerica.com) is a global biomedical technology company that develops, patents, manufactures and markets advanced diagnostic and therapeutic products used at the point-of-care (in home and in physicians' offices) and in hospital/clinical laboratories for detection and/or treatment of medical conditions and diseases. The Company's products are designed to enhance the health and well-being of people, while reducing total healthcare costs. Biomerica primarily focuses on gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases where the Company has multiple diagnostic and therapeutic products in development.\n\nAbout inFoods\u00ae \n\nThe inFoods\u00ae IBS test involves a simple blood collection procedure and is designed to assess a patient\u2019s above normal immunoreactivity to specific foods. Instead of difficult to manage broad dietary restrictions, physicians can now use the inFoods\u00ae IBS information to make targeted, patient-specific recommendations about specific foods that, when removed from the diet, may alleviate IBS symptoms such as pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation. Further information about Biomerica\u2019s patented inFoods\u00ae Technology Platform can be found at: https://biomerica.com/inFoods/our-technology/. The inFoods\u00ae IBS clinical study was performed at several prominent centers including Mayo Clinic, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Inc. - a Harvard Medical School Teaching Hospital, Houston Methodist Hospital, and the University of Michigan. The clinical results for improvement in the Abdominal Pain Intensity (API) responder endpoint of >30%, for IBS patients in the treatment diet arm had a statistically significant improvement over patients in the placebo diet arm (p-value of 0.0246). The improvement for patients in the treatment arm versus the placebo arm is considered clinically significant and is similar and, in some cases, better than the current drugs in the market.\n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \"safe harbor\" for forward-looking statements.
