  "content": "For the last three days, Xi Jinping has played host in one of China\u2019s busiest port cities, welcoming leaders from across Asia and the Middle East for a carefully choreographed summit designed to showcase his vision of a new world order.\n\nNow, the Chinese leader is set to exhibit a very different image with an ostentatious show of military might.\n\nOn Wednesday he will commandeer Beijing\u2019s main artery \u2013 the Avenue of Eternal Peace \u2013 for a major military parade showing off the country\u2019s cutting-edge hypersonic weapons, nuclear-capable missiles, and undersea drones, alongside thousands of goose-stepping soldiers.\n\nXi\u2019s message with his multi-day exercise of soft and hard power, is clear: China is a force that wants to reset global rules \u2013 and it\u2019s not afraid to challenge those of the West.\n\nHitting that message home is Xi\u2019s guest list for the gathering, a cohort of more than two dozen China-friendly world leaders topped by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which also includes Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nThat also makes the first time that the leaders of a quartet of nations Washington strategists warn are converging to form an anti-American \u201caxis of upheaval\u201d will be together in one event.\n\nFor the Western leaders desperately trying to ramp up pressure on Putin to end his war in Ukraine, those optics will appear stark.\n\nIran, North Korea, China and Russia are seen as an emerging anti-American axis by some observers in the West precisely because Tehran and Pyongyang have fed Moscow weapons and \u2013 in the case of Pyongyang \u2013 troops, while China has aided its war-torn economy and industry.\n\nAs Xi gives them seats by his side on a symbolic day for China, he is showing himself as the one global heavyweight who could stand a real chance to pressure Putin to end his war \u2013 and that he\u2019s not going to use that pull to play by the West\u2019s rules.\n\nFor Xi, China\u2019s longest-serving and most powerful leader in decades, the symbolism \u2013 and its timing \u2013 will be purposeful.\n\nUnder President Donald Trump, the US is shaking up its alliances and causing economic pain for countries around the world, including among friends and allies, with his global trade war. Xi sees an opportune moment to make what might be his most dramatic showing yet of his challenge to a world based on Western rules and sensibilities.\n\nAlready the optics are paying off for the Chinese leader.\n\nGlimpses of the leaders\u2019 activities in recent days have shown a powerful camaraderie among those gathered, with Modi and Putin greeting Xi animatedly, Modi embracing Putin, and leaders reaching out to greet the Russian leader as he walked walks shoulder to shoulder with Xi.\n\nThese moments are arguably as powerful outcomes as the statements made, signaling a convergence of leaders without the West.\n\n\u201cWhat Xi is trying to convey is certainty about China\u2019s role in international affairs. This is clearly signaling to people throughout the region that China has arrived as a great power and it\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d said Jonathan Czin, the Michael H. Armacost Chair in Foreign Policy Studies at Brookings.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a US ally or partner, sitting in a capital somewhere in the region, and you have real doubts about whether or not you can rely on the United States as a partner, that\u2019s an uncomfortable split screen to be viewing,\u201d he added.\n\nThroughout his pageantry and diplomacy of recent days, Xi has appeared well aware of the opening the shake-up of American foreign policy has given him.\n\nIn his speeches and meeting with leaders gathered for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Sunday and Monday \u2013 a cohort of leaders from as far afield as the Maldives to Mongolia \u2013 Xi played up a message that world is in a state of flux and chaos, and China is the responsible, stable power to guide it into the future.\n\n\u201cWe must) oppose the cold war mentality, block confrontation and bullying practices,\u201d Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared as he spoke to a room of gathered leaders Monday, using language that\u2019s long been China\u2019s code to describe what it sees as the US\u2019 behavior. He also pledged hundreds of millions in grants to SCO member states this year \u2013 and launched a push to reform the international system.\n\nThe message is not new, but Beijing is betting it lands differently after the leading global superpower has cut off its vast network of foreign aid, slapped crippling tariffs on developing countries, and raised questions among its allies and partners about whether it really has their backs.\n\nAs China\u2019s leader put it in a speech late Monday: \u201cThe house rules of a few countries should not be imposed upon others.\u201d\n\nAnd Xi has already seen benefits from the American shift.\n\nLook no further than India, whose Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen smiling and laughing as he spoke with Xi beside Putin on Monday \u2013 a significant show of warmth from a leader long wooed by US as an Asian counterweight to China.\n\nJust last month India was slapped up 50% tariffs on its exports to the US, half of those due as a penalty for its purchases of Russian oil, which the US sees as helping to fund Putin\u2019s war.\n\nAnd even for countries, like those in Southeast Asia, who have long looked warily at China\u2019s growing military power and assertiveness when it comes to its territorial claims in the South China Sea and over Taiwan, the shifting global dynamics could have an effect, observers say.\n\nIf there\u2019s a time to woo leaders that have long tried to hedge between the US and China, said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore, \u201cthe time is now.\u201d\n\nBut as much as Xi is using these his highly choreographed itinerary this week to pitch his leadership to a broad cohort of nations, he\u2019s also using it to push back on Western criticism of his longstanding ties with partners like North Korea, Russia and Iran \u2013 all seen as rogue actors by the West.\n\nIn the wake of Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, voices in Washington have warned of an emerging coordination between what\u2019s been alternatively dubbed an \u201caxis of upheaval\u201d or an \u201caxis of growing malign partnerships\u201d \u2013 though experts say so far there\u2019s been few signs of four-way coordination.\n\nAt least until now.\n\n\u201c(China\u2019s military parade) will be the first time that the leaders of China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran are all present in the same place,\u201d said Brian Hart, a fellow of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \u201cThere have been little or no quadrilateral engagements between the four countries, so this is a distinctive moment.\u201d\n\nChina has been careful to not be seen as explicitly endorsing these countries\u2019 aggression \u2013 for example it\u2019s widely seen to have sent large quantities of dual-use goods but not lethal weapons to Russia as it wages its war.\n\nBut as Xi gathers these players together, he wants to signal that he can set the rules around who \u201cshould be deemed acceptable by the international community, regardless of what the democratic West or the US may think,\u201d according to Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London.\n\nEven still, the optics may also appear less stark with Trump in the White House. Last month, he hosted Putin for an apparently friendly summit where he said he\u2019d \u201calways had a fantastic relationship\u201d with the warring leader and greeted him personally on the tarmac.\n\nThe American president also used a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung last month to discuss meeting again with Kim. Both would be peace efforts \u2013 but Trump is well known to praise these autocrats.\n\nBut Xi\u2019s message is part of a more sweeping vision for the Chinese leader, who may see no more fitting a moment to signal his alignments than the upcoming military parade, which commemorates the 80th anniversary Japan\u2019s surrender in World War II and China\u2019s role fighting the imperial power that waged a years-long and brutal invasion of its lands.\n\nLike Putin, Xi has looked to pull from that history to reshape a narrative that positions China and Russia, which fought in World War II as the Soviet Union, as guardians of a \u201cpost-war\u201d international order, distinct from the US-one they see as dominant now.\n\nIn Xi and Putin\u2019s eyes, a key cause of the war in Ukraine today \u2013 or even North Korea\u2019s bid to develop nuclear weapons \u2013 is not those countries\u2019 aggressions, but the US and its allies ignoring their \u201clegitimate security concerns.\u201d\n\nAnd more broadly, their rhetoric blames the US and the alliances and value systems it formed in the wake of World War II for global crises, confrontation and disparity in the world today.\n\nThis week, Xi is \u201cunapologetically defending a post\u2013World War II order that he sees as under assault by Western powers determined to block China\u2019s rise,\u201d said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment of International Peace in the US.\n\nAnd as he surveys the global landscape and calls leaders from near and far to his side, Zhao added, \u201cXi is pressing ahead with a campaign to delegitimize US leadership, weaken Western solidarity, and elevate China as a credible alternative.\u201d",

      "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be among more than two dozen foreign leaders to attend China\u2019s massive military parade next week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.\nThe parade, to be held in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square on September 3, is part of China\u2019s commemorations to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II following Japan\u2019s formal surrender.\nThe announcement, which places Putin and Kim at the top of Xi\u2019s guest list, sets the stage for an extraordinary photo-op with the three autocratic leaders standing side by side atop the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Beijing, in an unequivocal show of unity.\nNorth Korean state news agency KCNA confirmed Kim\u2019s attendance, in what would be the North Korean leader\u2019s first trip to China since 2019. Kim, who has only embarked on 10 foreign trips since assuming power in 2011, last left his isolated country in 2023 to meet Putin at a remote spaceport in Russia\u2019s far east.\nThe parade offers the reclusive head of the world\u2019s most heavily sanctioned regime a rare opportunity to appear alongside other world leaders who are gravitating toward an alternative world order Xi and Putin have pushed to create.\nConfirmation of Kim\u2019s attendance at the parade comes just days after US President Donald Trump said he would like to meet the North Korean leader this year.\nHardware and pageantry\nBeijing is projecting military strength at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty as Trump upends American alliances and partnerships. It also comes amid China\u2019s increasingly assertive posture toward Taiwan and its territorial disputes with neighboring countries.\nA total of 26 foreign heads of state and government will attend the parade, including Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Assistant Foreign Minister Hong Lei told a news conference in Beijing.\nNarendra Modi, the prime minister of Pakistan\u2019s arch-rival India, who will be in the Chinese city of Tianjin for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization this weekend, is not among the list of leaders attending the parade.\nMyanmar\u2019s junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, who is serving as that country\u2019s acting president after a military coup toppled an elected government in 2021 and plunged the country into a devastating civil war, will also attend.\nOther guests include Russia-friendly European leaders Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia\u2019s Robert Fico.\nNotably absent are leaders from major Western capitals, even though China was a crucial partner of the Allied powers in the Pacific Theater of World War II. The country\u2019s fight against Japan\u2019s full-scale invasion became a major front of the war in Asia, ending only in 1945 with Japan\u2019s surrender.\nConflict continued in China between communist and nationalist forces until the former eventually came out on top in 1949 leading to the creation of the People\u2019s Republic of China that Xi now helms.\nWednesday\u2019s 70-minute parade will feature more than 10,000 troops, over 100 aircraft and hundreds of pieces of ground equipment, showcasing China\u2019s growing military power under Xi, who has made the modernization of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) a central mission of his rule.\nThe tightly choreographed spectacle will offer a rare glimpse into China\u2019s fast-advancing military technology. Officials have said all equipment on display are domestically produced and currently in service, with many making their debut \u2013 ranging from cutting-edge drones, electronic jamming systems, hypersonic weapons, air-defense and missile-defense technologies to strategic missiles.\nBeijing has been the main political and economic patron for North Korea for decades, providing a crucial lifeline for its heavily sanctioned economy. North Korea is also China\u2019s only formal ally, with a mutual defense treaty signed in 1961.\nIn recent years, North Korea has forged closer ties with Russia amid Moscow\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine, complicating East Asia\u2019s geopolitical balance and China\u2019s efforts to maintain regional stability.\nXi, Putin\u2019s most powerful backer, has watched warily as the Russian leader and Kim forged a new alliance that saw North Korea sending troops to join Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Last year, Putin and Kim signed a landmark defense pact in Pyongyang and pledged to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked \u2013 a move that has rattled the US and its Asian allies.\nHong, the Chinese assistant foreign minister, hailed China and North Korea\u2019s \u201ctraditional friendship\u201d in the press conference Thursday, noting the two countries supported each other in the fight against Japan\u2019s invasion eight decades ago.\n\u201cChina is willing to continue to work hand in hand with North Korea to strengthen exchanges and cooperation, advance socialist construction, and closely collaborate in promoting regional peace and stability as well as safeguarding international fairness and justice\u201d Hong said.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

      "text": "A relationship frozen after a deadly clash high in the Himalayas five years ago appears to be thawing under the heat of US President Donald Trump\u2019s economic pressure.\nFor the first time since 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to China this week to attend a summit hosted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping, a visit that comes after Trump imposed punishing 50% tariffs on imports from India.\nIn a moment of geopolitical whiplash, the two leaders \u2013 whose soldiers fought a brutal hand-to-hand combat with fists, rocks and clubs at their disputed border in 2020 \u2013 could now shake hands, prioritizing economic stability over entrenched rivalry.\nAlongside Modi, world leaders from Russia, Pakistan, Iran and Central Asia will join Xi this weekend for what Beijing has said will be the largest summit yet of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a Moscow and Beijing-founded regional security club aimed at reshaping the global balance of power.\nIndia\u2019s presence at the event is the most telling example yet of the warming ties between the two Asian powers \u2013 a budding realignment that threatens to undo years-long US efforts to cultivate New Delhi as a counterweight against a rising and increasingly assertive China.\nWhile a thaw in India and China\u2019s fractious relationship was already underway, analysts say Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies are making the two leaders, who have built their political brands on a strong foundation of nationalism, explore a partnership of necessity.\nTrump\u2019s imposition of tariffs over India\u2019s purchases of Russian oil have been especially hard to swallow for Modi, who enjoyed a budding bromance with Trump during the US president\u2019s first term.\nThe threat of the levies \u201cinfused a certain amount of urgency\u201d in New Delhi\u2019s pivot toward stabilizing its relationship with Beijing, said Manoj Kewalramani, who heads Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution research center in the Indian city of Bengaluru. However he said it wasn\u2019t the \u201cprimary driver\u201d for a reset, with both India and China looking to stabilize their relationship for their own national interests.\nSuccessive White House administrations have worked to boost strategic ties with India through technology transfers and joint military drills, working with the world\u2019s largest democracy to counter an increasingly assertive China in the Indo-Pacific region.\nLosing India would be \u201cthe worst outcome\u201d for the US, analysts have said.\nFollowing a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Prime Minister Modi in New Delhi last week, both sides recognized the recent improvements in their strained relationship.\n\u201cIndia-China relations have made steady progress guided by respect for each other\u2019s interests and sensitivities,\u201d the Indian leader said. \u201cStable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity.\u201d\nThe view from Beijing, according to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, is that \u201cthis detente was definitely started by Trump.\u201d\n\u201cIndia is no longer able to pretend that it still has strong support from (Washington),\u201d Sun said. Therefore, Beijing\u2019s view is that because the US has \u201cdialed back\u201d India has to \u201crecalibrate its foreign policy and improve its relationship with China.\u201d\nBut analysts say the summit is unlikely to usher in a fundamental realignment.\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s not a reset in the sense that India is saying \u2018we are done with America.\u2019 That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d said Kewalramani.\n\u201cThe United States remains (India\u2019s) most important partner in the world, but China is our largest neighbor,\u201d Kewalramani said. \u201cWe have to live with it.\u201d\nFrom brotherhood to rivalry\nThe trajectory of India-China relations has evolved from one of post-colonial brotherhood to modern-day strategic rivalry.\nIndia was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1950, with that decade characterized by a shared vision of Asian solidarity. That nascent friendship was, however, shattered by the 1962 Sino-Indian War, a brief but brutal conflict that established a legacy of deep mistrust and an unresolved border dispute that remains the relationship\u2019s festering wound.\nIn the decades that followed, the countries\u2019 leaders took steps to build economic ties that saw bilateral trade grow, despite ongoing tensions at their shared border. But the deadly 2020 Galwan Valley clashes \u2013 which left at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers dead \u2013 violently upended this balance.\n\u201cThe 2020 clashes are not simply something India can put behind it,\u201d said Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cInstead, the aim here is to ensure no such episodes repeat, and that is where rebuilding the relationship rests on reaching a joint understanding on border stability.\u201d\nThere has been a gradual normalization of ties between India and China after Modi and Xi met on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia last October. The two sides agreed to restart direct flights cancelled since the Covid-19 pandemic, Beijing recently agreed to reopen two pilgrimage sites in western Tibet to Indians for the first time in five years, and both started re-issuing tourist visas for each other\u2019s citizens.\nA balancing act\nIndia\u2019s recalibration of ties with China is a textbook application of its policy of strategic autonomy, which prioritizes national interests over rigid bloc allegiance.\nAt the SCO summit, as well as China\u2019s Xi, Modi will be in the presence of the prime minister of traditional adversary Pakistan, with whom India recently engaged in a deadly conflict, as well as traditional partner Russia, whose continued oil sales to India since its invasion of Ukraine have irked the US and pushed Trump to slap 25% tariffs on Indian goods as punishment.\nThis engagement with a China-dominated bloc stands in stark contrast to India\u2019s deepening ties with the Quad \u2013 a security grouping with the US, Japan, and Australia \u2013 that is widely seen as a democratic counterweight to China\u2019s growing influence in the Indian Ocean.\nWith their border dispute locked in a stalemate, India is choosing to insulate its diplomatic and economic imperatives from the security conflict with China, according to Kewalramani from the Takshashila Institution.\n\u201cWhile both sides know there are structural challenges and this relationship will remain difficult, both sides realize that a deterioration to the extent that it happened is in neither\u2019s interest,\u201d he said.\nThe path to stability\nIndia\u2019s strategic recalibration toward China is rooted less in a softening security posture and more in economic necessity.\nLast year, China was India\u2019s second-largest trading partner after the US, with bilateral trade reaching $118 billion, according to data from India\u2019s department of commerce. India depends on China not just for finished goods like electronics, but for the essential intermediate products and raw materials that fuel its own industries.\nYet, this economic entanglement exists under the shadow of a tense military reality.\nAny talks between Modi and Xi would be complicated by the tens of thousands of troops still deployed at their disputed Himalayan border and this unresolved conflict remains the primary barrier to rebuilding confidence. Last week, the two sides agreed to 10 points of consensus on their border issue, including maintaining \u201cpeace and tranquility,\u201d according to a statement from China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nAs Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow in the Center for Asia Policy Studies in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, notes, it\u2019s \u201cnot clear that either side will really trust each other.\u201d\nThe major test, she said, is whether the rhetoric from the two leaders translates to de-escalation on the ground, something that has failed before.\nThe future of the India-China relationship will be defined by their ability to manage this delicate dance.\nThe future, said Asia Society\u2019s Aamer, will bring \u201cperhaps a more stable relationship, where competition isn\u2019t necessarily over, but conflict is at bay.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Simone McCarthy contributed reporting"

      "text": "Autocrats, populists, friends and foes, a strongman waging a war in Europe and the leader of the world\u2019s biggest democracy will all be hosted by Chinese leader Xi Jinping this weekend at a summit designed to showcase Beijing as a global leader capable of providing a counterweight to Western institutions.\nHeads of state and delegations from across Asia and the Middle East will meet from Sunday in the Chinese port city of Tianjin for the two-day summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional security grouping that has emerged as a cornerstone of Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s drive to rebalance global power in their favor.\nChinese officials have billed the summit as the SCO\u2019s largest yet, with the diplomacy and pageantry setting the stage for Xi to tout his country as a stable and powerful alternative leader at a time when the world\u2019s leading superpower the United States under President Donald Trump is shaking up its alliances and waging a global trade war.\nThe gathering also comes days ahead of a major military parade in Beijing that will offer a different message \u2013 that of China\u2019s rapidly developing military might, and draw autocrats like North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and Myanmar\u2019s Min Aung Hlaing alongside Putin and Russia-friendly European leaders Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia\u2019s Robert Fico.\nThe summit also gifts Russia\u2019s Putin some international spotlight, just two weeks after his Alaska summit with Trump, and as he continues to ignore international pressure to end his onslaught in Ukraine. Earlier this week Russia\u2019s forces carried out the second-biggest aerial attack since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor.\nPutin, who arrived to a red-carpet welcome in Tianjin on Sunday local time, praised the China-Russia partnership ahead of his trip as a \u201cstabilizing force\u201d for the world. In a written interview for Chinese state news agency Xinhua, he said they were \u201cunited in our vision of building a just, multipolar world order\u201d \u2013 an allusion to the two countries\u2019 efforts to revise what they see as a US-led world order unfairly stacked against them.\nSCO members \u2013 which include China, Russia, India, Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan \u2013 preside over vast swaths of global energy reserves and govern some 40% of the global population.\nLeaders including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have arrived in Tianjin, and Xi has been holding a flurry of bilateral meetings with his guests since Saturday.\n\u2018Architect and host\u2019\nThe guests at the summit have national rivalries between them and vast differences in political systems. And while this has sparked criticism of the group as too disparate to be effective, it also may serve to underscore Xi\u2019s message.\n\u201cBeijing wants to signal that China is the indispensable convener in Eurasia, capable of seating rivals at the same table and translating great-power competition into managed interdependence,\u201d said Rabia Akhtar, director of the Centre for Security, Strategy and Policy Research at the University of Lahore in Pakistan.\n\u201cThe optics are straightforward: China is not just a participant in regional order-making \u2013 it is a primary architect and host.\u201d\nModi\u2019s attendance at the gathering also adds heft to Xi\u2019s guest list. The Indian prime minister skipped last year\u2019s summit in Kazakhstan. Now, he has arrived in Tianjin against a backdrop of souring relations with Washington \u2013 and as Beijing and New Delhi have moved to ease their own frictions, a nascent realignment that could imperil US efforts to cultivate India as a counterweight against a rising China.\nDelegations are also expected from the SCO\u2019s 16 official partner and observer countries, which include Cambodia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait, as well as NATO member Turkey, among others, Chinese officials said ahead of the gathering.\nBeijing additionally invited a handful of Southeast Asian leaders. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is also expected to attend.\nAcross the city of Tianjin, banners in English, Russian and Chinese heralding the gathering lined highways. Officials heavily restricted traffic in the city center as Chinese leaders welcomed their guests with the ceremony and pomp typical of Chinese diplomacy at the highest level.\nThe location has pointed symbolism for China, as a port that was forced open by colonial powers in the 19th century, with those from Europe and Imperial Japan receiving land concessions \u2013 and a key city occupied by Japan during World War II.\nSome guests, including Putin, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, are slated to stay for the military parade in Beijing, where the ruling Communist Party will show off its military might and play up its role fighting Imperial Japan as part of the Allied Forces in World War II as the globe marks 80 years since the end of that war.\nWhat is the SCO?\nSince its formation in 2001 as a group focused on regional security cooperation between China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has expanded in its size and scope.\nSCO members conduct joint counter-terrorism drills, share intelligence on combatting \u201cterrorism, separatism, and extremism,\u201d and work to expand coordination across areas like education, trade and energy. They\u2019re also united in a call for a \u201cjust\u201d international order \u2013 or one not led by a single superpower and its allies.\nIran\u2019s inclusion in the group in 2023 and Belarus\u2019 a year later have been widely seen as an effort by Beijing and Moscow to the make the body more explicitly anti-West. It also is one facet of a tightening of bonds between Moscow, Beijing and Tehran that\u2019s raised alarm in Washington.\nNow, growing frictions and uncertainties between some countries and the US under Trump will loom over the gathering \u2013 a reality sure to be referenced prominently if indirectly in remarks by Xi to his guests in the days ahead.\nObservers will be watching whether this summit will produce momentum toward further economic integration between member countries, especially when it comes to regional trade or development finance, but expectations for practical developments are low.\n\u201cWithout deeply addressing what the mission of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization should be and how it can resolve internal sources of conflict both between members and between members with external countries, the SCO is just a showcase,\u201d said Shanghai-based foreign affairs analyst Shen Dingli.\nEven as the group regularly calls for \u201cavoiding bloc, ideological or confrontational approaches\u201d to addressing security threats, its summits have yet to produce a joint statement mentioning the war in Ukraine.\nSCO \u2013 and its lead members China and Russia \u2013 also appeared to have little role in de-escalating a four-day conflict between members India and Pakistan earlier this year.\nThe group did, however, \u201cstrongly condemn\u201d the military strikes carried out by the US and Israel on Iran this past June."

      "text": "Just days before Kim Jong Un is due to stand with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin to witness a display of China\u2019s military might, North Korea has released a propaganda film praising its troops\u2019 efforts fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine.\nThe 20-minute video, released by North Korean state media KCTV, showed heavily dramatized shots of soldiers on the snow-covered battlefield \u2013 handling weapons, holding meetings with Russian soldiers, and installing bombs on trees.\nIt also showed aerial footage purporting to show damage inflicted by North Korean soldiers, with clips of explosions and targeted strikes.\nOther parts of the video emphasized the soldiers\u2019 patriotism \u2013 with one shot appearing to show soldiers gazing at a framed portrait of Kim, and another showing a soldier pressing his cheek to the North Korean flag.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much of the footage is authentic, or whether it has been staged or manipulated, as is common in North Korean propaganda. CNN cannot independently verify when and where the videos were filmed.\n\u201cThey\u2019re presenting their participation in the Ukrainian war as a major exploit, as another confirmation of (North Korea\u2019s) military might and their loyalty to the party, state and the leader himself,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, a professor of Korean Studies at Kookmin University in Seoul.\nThe video offers a rosy view of the situation on the ground in a theatre that has become notorious for human wave attacks and horrific attrition rates on the Russian side. Western officials estimated that a third of the 12,000 North Korea troops believed to be part of the initial deployment were either killed or wounded.\nThe program, initially shrouded in secrecy, was later confirmed by both Pyongyang and Moscow. In recent weeks, Kim finally acknowledged the loss of troops, holding two events in August to meet bereaved families.\nLast Friday, he promised \u201ca beautiful life\u201d for the families of \u201cmartyrs\u201d who perished fighting for Russia, state media reported. Earlier in August, he said his \u201cheart aches,\u201d with state media photos showing the leader embracing sobbing families and kneeling before the portraits of deceased soldiers.\nThe propaganda video on Sunday paid tribute to these soldiers too, beginning with a statement that troops had participated in operations to \u201cliberate\u201d the Russian region of Kursk in October 2024 after Ukraine\u2019s surprise offensive. It also named some fallen soldiers and described how they had died.\nFor decades, North Korean propaganda has emphasized the significance of its military but \u201chad very little real actual stuff to talk about,\u201d said Lankov, pointing to its previous lack of real battlefield experience.\n\u201cNow, they\u2019ve had a real war where, generally speaking, North Korean soldiers were fighting quite well,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s likely to become a major topic of their domestic propaganda, domestic ideological education and indoctrination.\u201d\nNorth Korea has drawn closer to Russia since the war began, with experts warning that Moscow may be offering military and technological assistance to Pyongyang in exchange for its troops.\nVisit to Beijing\nBoth Kim and Russian leader Vladimir Putin will be in Beijing on Wednesday for a massive military parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II \u2013 setting the stage for a striking show of unity between the two autocrat leaders and China\u2019s Xi Jinping.\nThe trip will be Kim\u2019s first trip to China since 2019. Kim, who has only embarked on 10 foreign trips since assuming power in 2011, last left his isolated country in 2023 to meet Putin at a remote spaceport in Russia\u2019s far east.\nHong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said North Korea could have released the video ahead of the Beijing visit to portray Kim as \u201can important leader with a strategic position in Northeast Asia that is on par with Putin and Xi Jinping at the Victory Day (parade).\u201d\nIt would further the narrative that North Korea is \u201cforming a solidarity front with powerful countries on the diplomatic stage,\u201d Hong added.\nOn Sunday, Kim also examined missiles on a \u201cnewly inaugurated\u201d production line and learned about the \u201coverall condition of the state missile production capacity,\u201d state media KCNA reported on Monday.\nImages published by KCNA appeared to show Kim at an undisclosed location inspecting several dozen weapons in various stages of production and talking with uniformed officers.\nAccording to the KCNA report, North Korea had \u201csuccessfully fulfilled\u201d its five-year plan to expand its missile production capacity.\n\u201cVarious kinds of missiles were put into serial production,\u201d the agency reported, adding that Kim had ratified three new long-term plans \u201crelated to missile production capacity.\u201d\nNorth Korea has ramped up its weapons program in the last few years, rapidly modernizing its armed forces, developing new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach almost anywhere in the United States.\nKim has also ramped up his rhetoric, vowing recently to build up the country\u2019s nuclear program and threatening to use it to destroy South Korea if attacked."

      "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping made a veiled swipe at the United States on Monday as he criticized \u201cbullying practices\u201d and cast his country as a new leader of world governance, at a time when President Donald Trump\u2019s America First foreign policy is upending the globe.\n\u201cThe house rules of a few countries should not be imposed on others,\u201d Xi told more than 20 world leaders gathering at a two-day summit orchestrated to play-up China\u2019s global leadership and its close and enduring partnership with Russia, as the two neighbors seek to rebalance global power in their favor at the expense of the US and its allies.\nThe meeting of the Beijing- and Moscow- backed Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in the northern port city of Tianjin is China\u2019s biggest diplomatic event of the year, drawing political heavyweights including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\nAt the summit, Xi pledged 2 billion yuan ($280 million) in grants to SCO member states this year, and an additional 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in loans to an SCO banking consortium over the next three years.\n\u201cWe should leverage the strength of our mega-sized markets and economic complementarity between member states and improve trade and investment facilitation,\u201d the Chinese leader told his guests during opening remarks.\nLater in the day, Xi unveiled a brand new Global Governance Initiative, a sequel to his three earlier \u201cinitiatives\u201d on security, development and civilization that together serve as a loose outline for his vision of a reshaped international order.\n\u201cI look forward to working with all countries for a more just and equitable global governance system,\u201d Xi said, pledging to increase the representation and voice of developing countries and practice multilateralism \u2013 echoing longstanding calls from the Global South.\n\u201cWe should continue to dismantle walls, not erect them; seek integration, not decoupling,\u201d he added.\nXi\u2019s vision pushes back against what Beijing sees as the foundations of a US-led world order, opposing alliances like NATO \u2013 which in his view exist to enforce the West\u2019s rules-based system \u2013 and calling into question the concept of universal human rights, while seeking to reshape power at the United Nations and other bodies it sees as unfairly dominated by the West.\nWithout naming the United States directly, Xi vowed to oppose \u201chegemonism,\u201d \u201cCold War mentality\u201d and \u201cbullying practices\u201d \u2013 phrases often deployed by Beijing to criticize Washington.\nAs Trump alarms nations with his global trade war, withdrawals from international organizations, slashing of foreign aid and threats on social media, Beijing views the US as undermining the international order it worked to build \u2013 and sees an opportunity to ramp its own vision as an alternative.\n\u201cWe should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar of the world, and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization and make the global governance system more just and equitable,\u201d Xi said in his opening remarks.\nEchoing Xi\u2019s remarks, Putin said the SCO laid the groundwork for a \u201cnew system\u201d of security in Eurasia, positioning it as an alternative to Western-led alliances that he has long railed against.\nThe new system \u201cwould replace the outdated Eurocentric and Euro-Atlantic models, take into account the interests of the broadest possible range of countries, be truly balanced, and would not allow attempts by some states to ensure their security at the expense of others,\u201d Putin said.\nClose rapport\nThe summit is a showcase for closer ties between China and Russia, as well as the friendship struck up over the years by their two autocratic leaders.\nThe deep personal rapport between the two men was on show Sunday evening, when Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan hosted a welcome banquet for attending leaders.\nFootage released by Russian state news agency RIA showed Xi and Putin gesturing animatedly and smiling as they chatted at the event, showing a different side of the typically restrained Chinese leader \u2013 and his warm and relaxed demeanor with his Russian counterpart.\nThe SCO summit is also the leaders\u2019 first opportunity to meet since Putin\u2019s summit with Trump in Alaska in August \u2013 and comes as Putin resists Western pressure to end his onslaught in Ukraine.\nJust last week, Moscow\u2019s forces carried out their second largest aerial attack to date on Ukraine.\nOn Monday, Putin used his speech at the SCO summit to reiterate his talking points on the war in Ukraine, saying the crisis \u201cdid not arise as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, but rather as a consequence of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Ukraine, which was supported and provoked by the West.\u201d\nMoscow launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after Russia\u2019s troops previously seized the Crimea and swathes of eastern Ukraine.\nThe Russian leader praised efforts by China and India at facilitating the resolution of the crisis, and described the \u201cunderstanding\u201d reached with Trump at the Alaska meeting as \u201copening the way to peace in Ukraine.\u201d\n\u201cDuring the bilateral meetings scheduled for today and tomorrow, I will, of course, inform my colleagues in more detail and thoroughly about the results of the negotiations in Alaska,\u201d Putin said, adding that he had already informed Xi \u201cin detail\u201d during a lunch on Sunday.\nKremlin aide Yury Ushakov told Russian state media that Putin discussed Ukraine with world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, including Xi and Modi.\nUshakov downplayed the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, which was teased by Trump after he met the two leaders last month.\n\u201cEveryone is talking about a trilateral meeting, (or) about a meeting between Putin and Zelensky \u2026 But, as far as I know, there was no specific agreement between Putin and Trump about this,\u201d Ushakov told Russian state media journalist Pavel Zarubin on Monday.\nObservers said the Russian leader would have used the gathering to show that he\u2019s not alone on the global stage.\n\u201c(Putin) will seek to frame Russia\u2019s resilience and China\u2019s backing as evidence that Western sanctions and isolation have not worked,\u201d Li Mingjiang, an associate professor at Singapore\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said ahead of the gathering.\n\u201cAt the same time, he will try to deepen strategic alignment with Beijing, in particular to ensure Chinese supply of dual-use goods and equipment to Russia (and) to show that Moscow has strong partners even as Washington ramps up its push to end the war.\u201d\nUkraine war looms over summit\nChina has emerged as a key pillar of diplomatic and economic support for Putin\u2019s regime since the early days of the Ukraine invasion, even as it claims neutrality in the conflict.\nChinese firms have bought up swaths of discounted Russian oil and provided it with critical trade, including dual use goods that Western leaders say have powered Russia\u2019s defense industrial base. Beijing defends its \u201cnormal trade\u201d with Russia.\nTrump earlier this summer threatened to take aim at that partnership, saying China could face major tariffs on its goods if it continued to purchase fuel from Russia as it wages war.\nBut even as the US imposed such penalties on India last week, it has so far slow-rolled that threat as it seeks a broader trade agreement with Beijing.\nWhite House senior counselor for trade Peter Navarro said Monday that the show of unity between Russia, China and India is \u201ctroublesome.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the Modi to step up. I have great respect Modi. I love the Indian people,\u201d Navarro told reporters at the White House on Monday. \u201cIt was a shame to see Modi getting in bed, as the leader of the biggest democracy in the world, with the two biggest authoritarian dictators in the world, in Putin and Xi Jinping. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s whopping 50% tariff on India has soured ties with Modi \u2013 and accelerated a nascent and cautious rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing.\nThe Indian leader met with Xi on Sunday in his first trip to China in seven years, as both countries face stiff US tariffs and Western scrutiny over their relationships with Russia.\nOn Monday, Modi highlighted his ties with both his host and the Russian leader at the SCO summit, embracing Putin before the two walked over hand in hand to greet Xi. The three leaders then shared a conversation marked by smiles and laughter.\nModi and Putin also held a nearly hour-long private meeting in the Russian presidential limousine, the Aurus, while en route to their formal talks, according to Russian state media.\n\u201cIndia and Russia have always stood shoulder to shoulder even in the most difficult times,\u201d Modi said at the start of the meeting. \u201cWe have been in constant dialogue on the situation in Ukraine. We welcome all the recent efforts for peace.\u201d\nA readout from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said the two leaders discussed the latest developments concerning Ukraine. \u201c(Modi) reiterated his support for the recent initiatives that have been taken to address the conflict in Ukraine, and emphasized the need to expedite a cessation of the conflict, and find a durable peace settlement,\u201d the ministry said.\nObservers say that Xi sees the gathering \u2013 and a massive military parade that he\u2019ll host on Wednesday in Beijing, expected to be attended by Putin, North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un as well as some two dozen other leaders \u2013 as a critically timed diplomatic push.\nChinese officials touted this year\u2019s SCO as the largest yet, saying ahead of the event that 20 leaders from across Asia and the Middle East would join. In addition to Russia, China and India, SCO members include Iran, Pakistan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.\nCNN\u2019s Kit Maher and Darya Tarasova contributed reporting."

      "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed a relationship with Beijing at an \u201cunprecedentedly high level\u201d on Tuesday, as the two countries reportedly inked a long-stalled agreement to build a massive new pipeline to send natural gas to China via Mongolia.\nPutin and Xi Jinping spent hours together on Tuesday, meeting with Mongolia\u2019s president, sitting down for their own formal talks, and sipping tea at the Chinese leader\u2019s official residence \u2013 in the latest show of solidarity between the two strongmen seeking to present a new world order.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy company Gazprom announced that a legally binding agreement had been signed for the construction the massive Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline, which Moscow has been trying to push off the drawing board for years.\nThe deal is a major win for Putin, who has increasingly turned to China to replace Europe as its major gas buyer. It\u2019s also a collective show of defiance against US President Donald Trump, who is pushing countries to cut Russian energy imports as part of his attempt to end the war in Ukraine.\nThe new pipeline will supply 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually from western Russia to northern China. Analysts have previously said it could offset nearly half of the gas exports to Europe that Russia has lost since the Ukraine war began.\nThe deal includes a 30 year supply agreement and the price of supplies will be lower than Europe is charged, Gazprom CEO Aleksey Miller said, Russia\u2019s TASS news agency reported.\n\u201cIt will be the largest, most extensive, and most capital-intensive gas project in the world,\u201d Miller was quoted as saying by TASS.\nChina, though, has not yet confirmed the agreement.\nBeijing has long been seen as cautious about the mega-project, given its push for renewable energy transition and longstanding energy security concerns about being too reliant on a single supplier.\nChinese state media reports on the meeting of the leaders Russia, China and Mongolia make no mention of the pipeline. In subsequent talks between Xi and Putin, the Chinese leader said their countries should \u201cuse major projects to drive cooperation.\u201d\nAsked about the deal at a regular news conference Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said China and Russia have \u201cconsistently conducted practical cooperation in various fields, including energy,\u201d and asked reporters to \u201ccontact the relevant Chinese authorities for details.\u201d\n\u2018Old friend\u2019\nPutin and Xi sat down on Tuesday for their first formal talks since the Russian leader arrived in China on Sunday.\nThe meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing was the latest show of solidarity between the two strongmen as Putin shrugs off Western pressure to end its war on Ukraine, and Xi casts his country as a new leader of world governance, at a time when Trump\u2019s foreign policy is upending the globe.\nHarking back to Soviet ties with China during the World War II, Putin hailed \u201cthe memory of the brotherhood in arms, trust, mutual support, and firmness in defending common interests\u201d as the foundation of their countries\u2019 strategic alignment \u201cin the new era.\u201d\n\u201cWe were always together then, and we remain together now,\u201d Putin told Xi at the start of their bilateral sit-down.\nChina-Russia relations have \u201cwithstood the test of shifting international circumstances,\u201d Xi said, calling Putin an \u201cold friend.\u201d\n\u201cChina is willing to work together with Russia to support each other\u2019s development and revitalization, firmly uphold international fairness and justice, and build a just and reasonable global governance system,\u201d Xi said.\nAfter their formal meeting, Xi invited Putin to his residence in Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party\u2019s walled leadership compound in central Beijing, to continue discussions, according to Russian state media. China\u2019s state broadcaster said Xi and Putin had tea with a small group of aides around noon.\nThe close rapport between Xi and Putin was also on show throughout a two-day security summit in the Chinese port city of Tianjin that concluded Monday. During a banquet dinner Sunday evening, Xi warmly greeted Putin and was seen gesturing expressively in conversation with the Russian leader.\nPutin previously said that he discussed his recent negotiations in Alaska with Trump with Xi during summit activities Sunday. Putin met Trump last month in Alaska as the US pushes for Russia to end its war in Ukraine.\nThe Russian president\u2019s visit to China is also expected to bring him shoulder-to-shoulder with North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un. Both top a guest list of foreign dignitaries joining Xi at a massive military parade in the Chinese capital Wednesday.\nThe visit is the Russian leaders\u2019 longest to a single country since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to a Kremlin record of his overseas visits."

The event culminated in a massive military parade on September\u202f3, where Xi displayed hypersonic weapons and staged a symbolic unity with Putin, Kim Jong\u202fUn and the Iranian president. The gathering signals China\u2019s intent to reshape global rules, strengthen ties with Russia and its allies, and leverage its growing military and economic clout amid U.S. trade and sanctions pressure.",
