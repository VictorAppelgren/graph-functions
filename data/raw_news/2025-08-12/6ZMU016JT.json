  "title": "Texas shooter who killed 3 outside Target, including a child, randomly chose his victims, police say",
  "description": "Police say a Texas man fatally shot three people in a Target parking lot, including a child and her grandfather",
  "content": "The police chief said that although Nieneker had a history of mental health issues, she was unaware of any specific diagnosis. Sgt. Nathan Sexton said the firearm Nieneker used in the attacks was acquired through family.\n\nAfter shooting the Target employee, Nieneker shot the grandfather as he sat in the driver's seat of his sport utility vehicle, then fatally shot the little girl in the back seat before stealing the vehicle and driving away fast, police said.\n\n\u201cIt was a completely random choosing of the victims,\u201d Sexton said.\n\nPolice said the Target employee, Hector Leopoldo Martinez Machuca, 24, was taken to a hospital where he died. Adam Chow, 65, and his granddaughter were pronounced dead at the scene while Chow\u2019s wife sustained minor injuries. The name of the child was not released.\n\nOver the next hour, Nieneker tried to steal a water truck at a construction site, caused multiple vehicle crashes, wrecked Chow's vehicle and then stole a Volkswagen he'd crashed into, police said. He also tried to break into a Waymo self-driving vehicle, threw a brick through the home of an acquaintance and walked naked through a backyard.\n\nOfficers found Nieneker walking naked on a street after he ditched his clothes in a portable toilet, police said. He was holding a Bible and was subdued with a Taser when he would not comply with demands.\n\n\u201cHe said that he was Jesus,\u201d Sexton said.\n\nPolice received multiple 911 calls as the suspect made his way across the city.\n\nChris Ferran said he was driving on a highway when he saw an SUV fly past him, then smash into two vehicles and keep going. \u201cI\u2019m not letting anybody get away with this, so I chased him down and called 911,\u201d he said.\n\nFerran watched as the driver pulled into a construction site, got out of the SUV and ripped a worker out of a water truck. Ferran said the SUV\u2019s driver, who was clad in what looked like swim trunks and a Hawaiian shirt, was in the truck for a while. So Ferran started shooting a video.\n\nBut when the man got out of the water truck, Ferran realized he had a gun.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I saw that, I threw the phone down and I reversed and I was trying to get us out of there,\u201d said Ferran, who had his two daughters with him.\n\nJail records did not list an attorney for Nieneker on Tuesday.\n\nOnline court records show Nieneker was arrested several times in recent years in both Travis County, which includes Austin, and neighboring Williamson County.\n\nHis Travis County arrests include misdemeanors for criminal mischief and driving while intoxicated, and three arrests on felony domestic violence charges. He was convicted of a charge of assault causing bodily injury family violence in 2016 and briefly sentenced to jail.\n\nAnother charge within days of the 2016 episode was dismissed. It was not immediately clear if those two charges were related. Another charge of felony assault on a family or household member in 2019 was dismissed three years later when prosecutors could not locate the victim.\n\nWilliamson County records show repeated run-ins with law enforcement, including two cases of misdemeanor family violence in 2015 that were later dismissed. He was also convicted of possession of marijuana in 2012 and entered a no contest plea to a charge of criminal mischief in 2016.\n\nMonday's shooting came as back-to-school shopping was in full swing ahead of the upcoming academic year. It also comes about two weeks after an attack at a Walmart in Michigan in which a man stabbed 11 people. The suspect has been charged with terrorism and multiple counts of attempted murder.\n\nStengle contributed to this report from Dallas.

      "text": "Suspect in Michigan Walmart stabbings is charged with a rarely used state terrorism count\nSuspect in Michigan Walmart stabbings is charged with a rarely used state terrorism count\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 A Michigan prosecutor filed a terrorism charge Monday against a man accused of stabbing 11 people at a Walmart store. The charge has been rarely used in the state\u2019s courts since it was adopted more than 20 years ago during the national outrage over 9/11.\nGrand Traverse County Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg said she believes the charge fits because the weekend attack was intended to \u201cput fear in the entire community and to change how maybe we operate on a daily basis.\u201d\nBut proving that could be difficult. Bradford Gille, 42, has a history of mental health problems. A judge signed an order Friday, the day before the attack, telling police to find him and take him to a hospital because he was considered a risk to himself or others. Police said they were unable to find him.\nMoeggenberg also filed attempted murder charges, one for each Walmart stabbing victim. A not-guilty plea was entered for Gille, and bond was set at $100,000.\nTobacco companies are \u201cselling cigarettes with Fiberglas and chemicals in \u2019em just to kill off the population. You can\u2019t really accuse me of anything if you\u2019re doing that,\u201d Gille said in court.\nA look at Michigan\u2019s terrorism law:\nLawmakers respond to 9/11\nThe Michigan Legislature in 2002 created and amended a stack of anti-terrorism laws after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington.\nA terrorism crime is defined as an act \u201cintended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or influence or affect the conduct of government or a unit of government through intimidation or coercion.\u201d A conviction carries a sentence of up to life in prison.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the prosecutor being able to establish this,\u201d sad Margaret Raben, a Detroit-area lawyer who has served as president of a statewide association of defense attorneys. \u201cIt seems to have been a random thing, and the fact that he injured 11 people doesn\u2019t make it any less random.\u201d\nGille\u2019s mental health will be an issue. He\u2019ll likely be evaluated to determine if he understands the charges and can assist his lawyer. Experts will also determine if he can be held criminally responsible.\nGille seemed irritated during his court appearance. When asked if he had money for a lawyer, he told a magistrate: \u201cNot to give you.\u201d He suggested he was homeless, noting he had no mailing address.\nIn 2016, Gille was accused of smashing a cemetery vault that had not yet been covered with grass, one of many encounters with local police over many years. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity, according to Emmet County court records.\n\u201cHe never should have been out on the street. It was just sad,\u201d Karl Crawford, superintendent of Greenwood Cemetery in Petoskey, Michigan, told The Associated Press.\nSchool shooter convicted of terrorism\nThere\u2019s no dispute that a terrorism charge is rare in Michigan. Wayne County, the largest in the state, has never used it, according to Maria Miller, a spokesperson for the prosecutor.\nThe biggest case: the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in which four students were killed and more were wounded. Ethan Crumbley, who was 15 at the time of the shooting, pleaded guilty to terrorism, murder and other crimes, and is serving a life sentence. He had planned the attack.\nIt was the first time that a school shooter was convicted of terrorism in the United States, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said.\n\u201cThe sheer force of destruction, violence, trauma and murder the shooter caused that day did not stop at the doorway of Oxford High School. It was carried through the doors and out into the community,\u201d McDonald said.\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Corey Williams contributed."

      "text": "A man accused of stabbing 11 people at a Walmart is in Michigan authorities\u2019 custody\nA man accused of stabbing 11 people at a Walmart is in Michigan authorities\u2019 custody\nTRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Eleven people were stabbed at a Walmart in Traverse City on Saturday \u2014 with six in critical condition \u2014 in what a Michigan sheriff said appeared to be a random act. A suspect was in custody, authorities said.\nAround 4:45 p.m., a 42-year-old man entered the store and used a folding knife to stab 11 people, the Grand Traverse County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement on social media. A sheriff\u2019s deputy arrived within minutes and took the man into custody, and people in the store also helped apprehend the suspect and treat victims, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\nThe victims\u2019 ages weren\u2019t immediately released.\n\u201cEleven is 11 too many, but thank God it wasn\u2019t more,\u201d Sheriff Michael Shea told reporters.\nEmergency vehicles and uniformed first responders gathered in the parking lot of the shopping center that houses several other retail stores. Authorities also were seen interviewing employees, still wearing blue uniform vests and name tags, nearby as the response gave way to an investigation.\nTiffany DeFell, 36, who lives in Honor, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from Traverse City, said she was in the store\u2019s parking lot when she saw chaos erupt around her.\n\u201cIt was really scary. Me and my sister were just freaking out,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something you see out of the movies. It\u2019s not what you expect to see where you\u2019re living.\u201d\nMunson Healthcare said via social media that 11 people were being treated at the region\u2019s largest hospital in northern Michigan. Spokesperson Megan Brown said all were stabbing victims. Six people were critical and five were in serious condition late Saturday, she said.\nShea said the weapon involved appeared to be a folding-style knife. Shea said the suspect is believed to be a Michigan resident but declined to share further details. Michigan State Police had said earlier in the day that the suspect was in authorities\u2019 custody.\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer said: \u201cOur thoughts are with the victims and the community reeling from this brutal act of violence.\u201d\nWalmart said in a statement that it would continue to work closely with law enforcement in the investigation.\n\u201cViolence like this is unacceptable. Our thoughts are with those who were injured and we\u2019re thankful for the swift action of first responders,\u201d the statement said.\nFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a social media post that bureau officials were responding to \u201cprovide any necessary support.\u201d\nTraverse City is a popular vacation spot on the coast of Lake Michigan. It is known for its cherry festival, wineries and lighthouses and is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore."

Police said they had no apparent motive for the violent attack carried out with a 3 1/2 inch (nearly 9-centimeter) knife.\nThe actions of Kolakowski and some other men drew effusive praise from Grand Traverse County Sheriff Michael Shea. Overnight, the strangers became online celebrities for their heroics as a video showing the confrontation spread swiftly on social media.\nKolakowski said that as he followed the man out of the store, he saw him plunge his blade into an older woman outside. Having no weapon himself, Kolakowski grabbed a shopping cart, hoping to knock the man down as he gave chase.\n\u201cHe just ran right behind her and buried his knife into her back, right in front of me,\u201d Kolakowski said. \u201cHe pulled the knife out of her and went to take off, then stopped and hesitated and turned around like he was going to go after her again. That\u2019s when he noticed me with the grocery cart ... I just went as hard as I could and just got him on his ankles with the grocery cart from behind.\u201d\nKolakowski, a 39-year-old disabled veteran, was quickly joined by another man with a shopping cart, stopping the man later identified by authorities as Gille. A third man pointed a gun toward the man, repeatedly demanding he drop the knife.\nHe eventually put the knife down and Kolakowski said he jumped on the man, restraining him until police quickly arrived.\n\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t hesitate at all,\u201d said Kolakowski, speaking from his home in nearby Kent City. Though he was wary of being stabbed himself, he said, \u201cI just kept going.\u201d\nShea said the 11 victims were men and women ranging in age from 29 to 84, including one Walmart employee. All were expected to survive, officials said.\nAuthorities said Gille, 42, has a history of mental health problems and has been arrested or ticketed numerous times in the Petoskey, Michigan, area since 2001. He has also received jail sentences for assault and domestic violence-related offenses.\nIn 2017, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity after being charged with damaging a burial vault and tipping over grave markers at a Ptoskey cemetery. And police in Petoskey reported speaking twice with Gille in recent days about loitering.\nIn a statement Monday, the Petoskey Department of Public Safety said the agency sought and received a court order Friday to place Gille in protective custody, deeming him a risk to himself or others.\nBut they could not find him \u2014 until the Traverse City stabbings occurred.\nGille\u2019s mother told the Petoskey News-Review in 2007 that her son had been in a long-term cycle of mental illness. Beverly Gille at that time praised police and judges, whom she said were trying to help him.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine when he\u2019s on his medication,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cThe problem is his illness tells him that he is fine and doesn\u2019t need to take his medication.\u201d\nAt his arraignment Monday, Gille appeared agitated and seemed to suggest he was homeless. A not-guilty plea was entered for him, and bond was set at $100,000.\nKolakowski said that as he and the other shoppers surrounded the man in the Walmart parking lot, it was clear that something was not right. He described the man as wild-eyed and sweating heavily and describing those in the store as \u201cbad, like he was making an excuse why he stabbed everybody.\u201d\nKolakowski brother-in-law, Chris O\u2019Brien, who recorded the video, said the \u201ccrazy\u201d scene unfolded incredibly fast and that Kolakowski\u2019s actions surely prevented several more stabbings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s his courage that is the craziest part. It was something to witness,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA guy was stabbing people and we were just next on his list if we didn\u2019t do something right,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cMatt was determined to make sure it was stopping then and there and he sure as hell did that.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Ed White and Corey Williams contributed."
