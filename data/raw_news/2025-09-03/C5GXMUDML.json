  "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday warned that any Israeli move to annex the occupied West Bank would be a \u201cred line,\u201d without specifying its possible impact on the landmark normalization accord between the two countries,\n\nThe warning came as Israel pressed ahead with the initial stages of its latest major offensive in famine-stricken Gaza City. Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Wednesday killed at least 31 people, according to local hospitals.\n\nIsraelis were taking part in nationwide demonstrations to protest the call-up of 60,000 reserves for the expanded operation, which has sparked global condemnation and left the country increasingly isolated.\n\nThe demonstrators accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the fighting for political purposes instead of reaching a ceasefire deal with Hamas that would free hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war.\n\n\u201cWe have to take an extreme action so that someone will remember. There\u2019s no such thing as a state abandoning its citizens,\u201d Yael Kuperman, a protester near the Knesset told Israeli public broadcaster Kan.\n\nThe UAE was the driving force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, in which it and three other Arab countries forged ties with Israel. Trump has said he hopes to expand the accords in his second term, potentially to include regional power Saudi Arabia.\n\nAnwar Gargash, a senior Emirati diplomat, wrote on the social platform X that \u201cannexation is a red line.\u201d\n\nHe linked to a Times of Israel story that quoted Emirati diplomat Lana Nusseibeh as saying annexation would \u201cseverely undermine the vision and spirit of (Abraham) Accords, end the pursuit of regional integration and would alter the widely shared consensus on what the trajectory of this conflict should be \u2014 two states living side by side in peace, prosperity and security.\u201d\n\nThe two diplomats did not specifically say that Abu Dhabi would withdraw from the agreement, and the Emirati Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions seeking clarification.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories to form their future state. Israel\u2019s current government is staunchly opposed to Palestinian statehood and supports eventual annexation of much of the West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinians and much of the international community say that would prevent a two-state solution, which is widely seen internationally as the only way to resolve the decades-old conflict.\n\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-member bloc of which the UAE is a member, separately came out Wednesday with its own statement calling proposals to annex the West Bank \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\nIsraeli strikes on Gaza City killed at least 15 people, including two children and four women, according to Shifa Hospital and Al-Quds Hospital, where the bodies were taken. An additional 16 people were killed in southern Gaza, including 10 who were seeking humanitarian aid, according to Nasser Hospital.\n\nIsrael says it only targets militants and takes measures to spare civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in densely populated areas.\n\nIsrael says that Gaza City - the largest Palestinian city in either the besieged strip or the occupied West Bank - remains a Hamas stronghold above what military officials claim is a vast underground tunnel network, even after several major raids earlier in the war.\n\nIsrael has intensified air and ground assaults on the outskirts of Gaza City, particularly in western neighborhoods where people are being driven to flee toward the coast, according to humanitarian groups that coordinate assistance for the displaced.\n\nSite Management Cluster, one such group, said Wednesday that families were trapped by the prohibitively high cost of moving, logistical hurdles and a lack of places to go.\n\n\u201cPalestinians are also reluctant to move due to the fear of not being able to return or exhaustion from repeated displacement,\u201d it said.\n\nThe twin threats of combat and famine, Palestinians and aid workers say, are only growing more acute for families in Gaza City, many of whom have been displaced multiple times during the nearly two-year war.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that five adults and one child died from malnutrition over the past day, bringing the total toll to 367, including 131 children throughout the war.\n\nThe ministry reported on Tuesday that a total of 63,633 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, including more than 2,300 seeking aid, since the start of the war. Part of the Hamas-run government but staffed by medical professionals, the ministry doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count, but says women and children make up around half of the dead.\n\nU.N. agencies and many independent experts consider the ministry\u2019s figures to be the most reliable estimate of war casualties. Israel disputes them, but hasn\u2019t provided its own toll.\n\nHamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and took 251 people hostage. Forty-eight are still being held in Gaza, around 20 of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were returned in ceasefires or other deals.\n\nIn a letter sent as members of Parliament returned to work in the United Kingdom, three non-governmental organizations highlighted how more than 3,700 Palestinians were killed over the body\u2019s 34-day summer break.\n\nAmnesty International, Doctors Without Borders and Medical Aid for Palestinians accused Israel of genocide - a charge it has vehemently denied. The organizations demanded the British government take action, noting famine, a collapse of the health care system and the killing of Mariam Dagga, a visual journalist who had worked for The Associated Press and Doctors Without Borders.\n\n\u201cThis is not merely a humanitarian crisis - it is a full-blown and man-made human rights catastrophe,\u201d the statement said. \u201cExpressions of \u2018deep concern\u2019 are not enough.\u201d\n\nMetz reported from Jerusalem and Gambrell from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
