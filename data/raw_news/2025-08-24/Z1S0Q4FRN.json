  "title": "My Mom Needs Nursing Home Care \u2014Can She Cash Out Her Annuity To Pay Off Her Mortgage And Still Qualify For Medicaid In New York?",
  "description": "",
  "content": "Planning for long-term care is one of the hardest financial puzzles families face. In New York, one woman laid it out in plain terms on an aging-care forum: Can my mother cash out her annuity to pay off her mortgage and still qualify for Medicaid to cover the costs of a nursing home?\n\nShe explained that her mother may need care in just a couple of months. Cashing out the annuity would mean a withdrawal fee, but she had already accepted that. What worried her was Medicaid's strict asset limit. If her mother left the annuity in place, she said, it would push her nearly $30,000 over the threshold of $32,396 for a single applicant in 2025. \"We'd much rather see her pay off the mortgage with it than lose it to Medicaid altogether. If we do, is there still any risk Medicaid could penalize us for doing it?\"\n\u2022 Would You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early? The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform\n\u2022 Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years \u2014 This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\n\nThe replies came quickly. One person said flatly:\n\n\"You need to sell the house and all her possessions. Pay out of pocket until she runs out of money and then file Medicaid.\"\n\nOthers said the situation was more complicated. Another poster wrote:\n\n\"You really have to see an attorney experienced with New York Medicaid. That annuity in payout mode might be treated as income instead of an asset. But the state may also require being named as the beneficiary so it can recover costs later.\"\n\nThat advice came with another warning: once Medicaid begins paying for nursing-home care, almost all of her mother's monthly income will go to the facility. The only personal allowance left is about $50 a month, leaving the family to handle the mortgage, taxes, and upkeep themselves.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace\u2014Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nNew York's Medicaid rules are clear on one point: paying off legitimate debts, including a mortgage, is considered a proper spend-down of assets. It is not treated as a gift and does not trigger penalties.\n\nThe challenge lies in how the annuity is handled. If it's cashed out, the lump sum counts as a resource in that month. To qualify, the family must spend it down until her mother's resources fall below $32,396. Another option is to convert the annuity into a Medicaid-compliant contract \u2014 one that is irrevocable, pays out over her life expectancy, and names the state as the beneficiary. In that case, it's counted as income, but that income must then be paid toward nursing-home costs.\n\nFor the New York woman who asked the question, the answer is yes: her mother can use the annuity to pay off the mortgage without penalty. The key is ensuring her remaining resources are below the limit at the time of application. Whether she cashes it out or restructures it into a compliant annuity, the details matter \u2014 and getting professional advice can prevent costly mistakes when Medicaid coverage is on the line.\n\u2022 This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\u2022 The ECG Hasn't Changed in 100 Years \u2014 This AI Upgrade Could Help Detect Heart Disease Years Earlier",

      "text": "It's a question that many face in their golden years, often shrouded in uncertainty and anxiety: Can a nursing home take your savings, including assets like a $100,000 individual retirement account (IRA), personal savings, a house and other possessions?\nThis concern becomes particularly pressing as you plan for the unforeseen events of life, where the need for long-term care can arise unexpectedly.\nUnderstanding the financial implications of nursing home care is crucial for safeguarding your hard-earned assets while ensuring adequate care.\nDon't Miss:\n- You asked, we answered: Can living off interest from a $1 million investment support my retirement dreams?\n- Hot take: How to turn a $100,000 investment into $1 Million \u2014 and retire a millionaire.\nUnderstanding Medicaid And Asset Limits\nEntering a nursing home can bring significant financial implications. For those qualifying for Medicaid, which often covers nursing home costs, there exist strict asset limits. Savings and investments, including IRAs, might need to be spent down to meet these thresholds. However, Medicaid rules are not uniform and vary by state, necessitating a clear understanding of local regulations.\nAs an example, in Florida in 2024, a single senior applying for Medicaid to cover nursing home care must meet these criteria: 1) Monthly income below $2,829, 2) Assets under $2,000 and 3) A medical requirement for a nursing home level of care. IRAs are not listed as countable assets, which means they are typically excluded.\nOther assets, including bank accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds and annuities will count against the $2,000 asset limit in Florida. So, if you have $100,000 in an annuity or a savings account instead of an IRA, you may be required to spend down the assets or be denied coverage.\nTrending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\nRemember, this varies based on the state. According to SmartAsset, IRA-exempt states include:\n- California\n- District of Columbia\n- Florida\n- Georgia\n- Idaho\n- Kentucky\n- Mississippi\n- New York\n- North Dakota\n- Ohio\n- Rhode Island\n- South Carolina\n- Vermont\nImpact On Spouses And Joint Assets\nIf you have a spouse who is not entering the nursing home, the financial landscape changes. Medicaid includes provisions to prevent spousal impoverishment. These rules allow the nonnursing home spouse to retain a portion of the couple's assets and income.\n- Community Spouse Resource Allowance (CSRA): This is a set amount of the couple's combined assets that the nonnursing home spouse is allowed to keep. The exact amount varies by state but is designed to ensure the spouse living outside the nursing home maintains financial stability.\n- Monthly maintenance needs allowance: The nonnursing home spouse may also be entitled to a portion of the nursing home spouse's income to help meet living expenses. This allowance varies by state and is adjusted annually.\n- Joint assets consideration: When one spouse enters a nursing home, joint assets are generally considered in the Medicaid eligibility assessment. However, certain assets, typically including the primary home if the nonnursing home spouse resides there, are exempt from being counted.\nThe Status Of Your Primary Residence\nGenerally, Medicaid rules protect a primary residence, not counting it toward the asset limit if a spouse or a dependent relative resides there. The story doesn't end there. After the Medicaid recipient's death, the state may recover costs from the estate, which can include the home's value.\nLook-Back Period And Asset Transfer\nMedicaid scrutinizes asset transfers made below fair market value during a look-back period, which is typically five years. Attempts to transfer assets to circumvent nursing home costs can lead to penalties and delayed Medicaid eligibility, a critical factor to consider in financial planning.\nRole Of Long-Term Care Insurance\nIf you possess long-term care insurance, it may cover nursing home costs, potentially averting the need to spend down assets. This insurance can be a significant factor in financial planning for nursing home care.\nEstate Recovery And Asset Protection\nMedicaid may seek reimbursement from the deceased's estate, including homes or savings. This process varies from state to state, highlighting the importance of understanding local regulations.\nThe Importance Of Legal And Financial Planning\nNavigating the complexities of nursing home costs and asset protection underscores the importance of consulting with experts. An elder law attorney or a financial adviser can offer tailored strategies for asset protection while maintaining eligibility for benefits like Medicaid.\nWhile nursing homes do not directly take your savings, the costs and regulatory requirements associated with nursing home care can have a profound impact on your financial assets. Being prepared with a solid financial plan can provide peace of mind and security in your later years.\nRead Next: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved?

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nFirst-time real estate investors can face several hurdles when trying to get started: high upfront costs, dealing with tenants and maintenance, finding and closing on a suitable property, and the fear that your initial investment won\u2019t see a return, just to name a few.\nNow, there\u2019s a company that handles all the grunt work and provides a money-back guarantee on your initial investment.\nIntroducing mogul, the simplest way to own income-producing blue chip real estate.\nFounded by former Goldman Sachs executives who have closed more than $10 billion in deals, they handle the sourcing, underwriting, and day-to-day management of every property.\nTo remove first-time jitters, mogul gives new investors their First-$10k Protection Guarantee: If your initial investment of up to $10,000 loses value in the first year, mogul refunds every lost dollar.\nInvestors in mogul portfolios have earned an average annualized return of 18.8%, paid out as monthly rental income plus appreciation.\nStart building a diversified property portfolio in minutes while mogul absorbs the downside.\n\u2018If we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit\u2019\nAlex Blackwood and Joey Gumataotao, mogul\u2019s co-founders, routinely surpassed 15-20% annual returns when closing deals at Goldman Sachs. When they looked at other real estate investment platforms at the time, they found those companies would often brag to those investors about 4% annual returns on billions of dollars.\nAs Alex says on mogul\u2019s website, \u201cIf we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit immediately.\u201d\nTo date, properties in mogul\u2019s portfolio have generated an average 10-12% annual cash-on-cash yield that hit users\u2019 accounts as rent dividends each month. When long-term appreciation is included, historical performance rises to an 18.8% annualized returns, giving investors both regular income and capital growth\nPart of their success is due to the fact that mogul mogul approves fewer than one percent of properties reviewed. Each candidate asset must clear a 12% bear case hurdle rate before moving to the next level of diligence.\nYou can browse eligible properties on mogul\u2019s website and buy part or all of a house in under 30 seconds, or use the same data and tools available to top real estate firms to underwrite any property across the U.S.\nRent collections are aggregated and distributed to investors every month. At the same time, independent third-party valuations refresh inside your dashboard, letting you watch equity climb in real time while still enjoying depreciation and other pass-through tax advantages unique to real estate.\nMore than $1.2 million was invested on mogul last month.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A.

      "text": "We are in New York. We think she may have to go into long term care in the next couple of months. I know there will be a withdrawal fee for cashing out the annuity out which is fine. From what I've researched most debts like medical debt or mortgage can be paid using money from her resources. If she leaves the annuity in place it will count against her for Medicaid eligibility as puts her nearly $30k over NY's $31k allowable resource amount would be taken by Medicaid as I understand it. We would much rather see her pay off the mortgage with it then lose it to Medicaid altogether. If we do it is there still any risk Medicaid could penalize us for doing it even though Medicaid guidelines clearly say debt can be paid with resources?\nThis is done by States as a way for them to enable applicants to have higher income for their Share of Cost requirements paid to the NH (makes NH happier as less risk for them). Cashing out an annuity only is a positive for the insurance company and the insurance agent, everyone else is loosing out on a cash out.\nOP I have a ? for you\u2026\u2026 so you mention \u201cpay off the mortgage\u2026. loose it to Medicaid\u201d. So is the plan to be that your mom continues to keep her home even though she is going to need to go into a NH for care as being in her home cannot reasonably work for her level of care needed? And she will be filing for LTC Medicaid to pay for that NH stay? Right?\nIf this is the plan, realize that she is required to do a Share of Cost paid to the NH of her income each and every month. And all she will have for flexible $ is NYS Personal Needs Allowance which will be maybe $50 a mo. So although Medicaid totally allows them to keep their home, they will have zero $ to pay any of its costs from day 1 of LTC Medicaid filing to maybe a year or 2 after death to deal with Estate Recovery &/or probate. Could be more than 2 years. Ultimately this becomes the POAs problem to deal with and bankroll. Can you afford to do this?\nA fully owned house can be somewhat mothballed and left empty so costs are minimal, no repairs done / minimal maintenance and the elder retains their homestead exemption so they can have lower taxes and still be able to get traditional homeowners insurance. But a home with a mortgage has more costs and required to be fully insured however needed for your area. If there are 3 kids and those other 2 DNGAF to help you as the POA pay the costs of moms house, or help in upkeep, they don\u2019t have to; yet they each get their 1/3 as that\u2019s how moms will reads.\nThe Share of Cost mo. income requirement often comes as a total surprise to families. No way around the SOC requirements unless there is a community spouse or a legal dependent. Some States will allow a waiver of the mortgage amount for a limited time if the home is up for sale with a Realtor and MLS listing (so no FSBO nonsense) with the $ from the Act of Sale used as a spend down & maybe to repay costs paid as well.\nElder retaining ownership of their home can be done, LTC Medicaid allows for this & cannot require elder to sell their home. But imo POA needs to have an idea on how they will deal w/Estate Recovery, probate or if there is something unique abt the property for NYS real estate laws. Plus better have the time, $, sense of humor for an undetermined period of time and be ok on risk that it may not work out. It\u2019s like having a second home but one you do not yet own. Most of us cannot afford a second home.\nif the occupant was living there prior to the elder moving into a NH and was caregiver, they are usually ok on being there rent free as they will be all about filing the caregiver exemption to Estate Recovery. If the occupant are themselves disabled or low income, they usually can stay living there rent free because if they had to find a place it would mean State / Feds be paying for housing. But able bodied family living in the home = rent paid.\nElder keeping their home while on LTC Medicaid can be done. But the POA has to have imho a plan on how to deal with Estate Recovery and the $ & resources to cover property costs for an undetermined amount of time. If this is your intent, then mom using her annuity $ to pay off mortgage is to me a good move. Mortgages require proper insurance coverage and some degree of maintenance & visual upkeep or the mortgage co can call in the loan and do a foreclosure if you can\u2019t pay off the call in. No mortgage, then other than paying prop taxes and occasional yard work, you can leave the property in limbo.\nShe needs to spend down ALL assets. To go on Medicaid to go in a SNF. She cannot pay the mortgage, taxes and utilities so the house is vacant and subject to forclosure. Nor can she rent because it becomes a reportable asset. There is no way the home will be inherited once Medicaid is filed unless there is a buyer who is willing to pay market value. All of what she owns goes into her care before us taxpayers foot the bill. See a lawyer for options. She might get by with cashing the annuity, but SNF care is tax deductible as well while out of pocket.\nThe home should go on the market as soon as possible. I hear in NYC that it takes several months to even close once a buyer is found.\nThere are so many aspects to her situation. According to the assets you said she is viewed as single without a spouse that will live in house. Therefore her house counts in the asset category and will need to be sold. Unless you plan as income rental but that will need to go directly to facility. Or, if there is a life use agreement and was deeded. However, that is another question that requires expert advice that very few of us are expert on with so little information.\nThe list continues so the expense of an attorney is well worth it to assist you. The cost will count as an allowed spend down expense too.\nYou need to take all financial assets and 5 year lookback history, and current debts to an attorney, CELA Elder Law specialist, and discuss in an hour of time what options are best at this time.\nThe problem here is that a mistake would be CATASTROPHIC and something you cannot afford to make. And asking \"the man on the street\" these crucial questions can result in catastrophe that cannot be rolled back."

      "text": "In the United States, the concept of being rich is often a subject of discussion, curiosity and, sometimes, aspiration. Charles Schwab's 2023 Modern Wealth Survey provides insights into this topic, revealing that the average American equates being wealthy with a net worth of approximately $2.2 million.\nAlthough the most recent data from the Federal Reserve reveals the average American household is a millionaire with a net worth of $1.06 million, looking at the median or midpoint value portrays a more accurate picture. Based on the October report from the Federal Reserve, the median net worth of U.S. households overall is $192,900.\nHave over $100K in investable assets and want to make sure you retire with a multi-million nest egg? Speak to a professional \u2014 Take your free retirement quiz today and speak to a vetted fiduciary financial adviser.\nBut how spot-on are Americans\u2019 perceptions of wealth?\nTop 2% wealth: The top 2% of Americans have a net worth of about $2.472 million, aligning closely with the surveyed perception of wealth.\nTop 5% wealth: The next tier, the top 5%, has a net worth of around $1.03 million.\nTop 10% wealth: The top 10% of the population has a net worth of approximately $854,900.\nThese figures illustrate a dramatic wealth gradient in the U.S., indicating a substantial increase in net worth needed to move from the top 10% to the top 2%.\nUnderstanding Wealth Beyond Numbers\nWealth is not solely about the figures in your bank account or investment portfolio; it's also about how you perceive and use your resources. Here are some tips and perspectives to understand and potentially achieve wealth.\nSavings and spending habits: Being able to save, that is, spending less than you earn, is a foundational aspect of accumulating wealth. Establishing robust financial habits like budgeting and goal-setting can pave the way to wealth, regardless of the specific dollar amount.\nLiving below your means: In a world where consumerism is rampant, living below your means is a key principle. This might involve cutting unnecessary expenses, like reducing monthly subscriptions or dining out less frequently. Such habits not only bolster savings but also prepare you for financial emergencies.\nAffording desires: The ability to save and spend wisely often leads to the capacity to afford what you desire, whether it is a new vehicle or a vacation. Achieving financial goals is a strong indicator of wealth.\nLife goals over money: Wealth is not just about accumulating money but also about fulfilling life aspirations. Whether it's running a business, becoming debt-free or saving for retirement, having a clear vision is crucial.\nMoney as a tool: Viewing money as a means to improve your life, rather than a source of stress, can shift your approach to wealth. Small steps like allocating extra funds toward high-interest debt can help in building a brighter financial future.\nFlexibility and options: Wealth often equates to having choices \u2014 whether it's taking time off for family, investing in a business idea or learning a new skill. This flexibility is a significant indicator of wealth.\nPreparing for retirement: A key aspect of being wealthy is having a solid retirement plan. This involves understanding how much to save and starting early to build a financial foundation for the golden years.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\n- Finding a fiduciary financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area in 5 minutes.\n- Each advisor has been vetted by SmartAsset and is held to a fiduciary standard to act in your best interests. Get on the path toward achieving your financial goals!\nA Subjective Concept\nWhile having a net worth of about $2.2 million is seen as the benchmark for being rich in America, it's essential to remember that wealth is a subjective concept. Healthy financial habits and personal perspectives on money are crucial in defining and achieving wealth. By focusing on smart financial planning and aligning money with personal values and goals, people can navigate their path toward what they consider to be wealthy.\nFinancial advisors can provide tailored advice and strategies to help achieve specific financial goals. Leveraging their expertise, people can effectively pursue their unique definition of wealth, encompassing asset growth, retirement security and other financial aspirations.\nTake Action: Locate a financial advisor near you, for free.\n*Jeannine Mancini has written about personal finance and investment for the past 13 years in a variety of publications, including Zacks, The Nest and eHow.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nDespite heart disease being the leading cause of death worldwide, one of the most common early detection tools has a fundamental flaw. An electrocardiogram, sometimes called an ECG or EKG, is used to measure the heart\u2019s electrical activity to detect any rhythm-related issues, like arrhythmia or AFib.\nThe problem? The ECG doesn\u2019t detect other issues such as restricted blood flow to the heart or irregular heart rhythms, which if left untreated could cause severe or life-threatening complications.\nOne company believes they\u2019ve found the solution, and now you can join them to help bring earlier detection to people across the globe.\nHeartSciences has developed an AI-ECG that\u2019s being trialed in some of the country\u2019s top cardiology facilities to better diagnose and treat heart conditions that can go undetected by traditional devices.\nThe company has broad patents covering its technology. With Mayo Clinic as an early AI-ECG adopter and Medicare reimbursement already starting in January 2025, now\u02bcs your chance to invest before FDA submission and full-scale commercialization begins.\nA $32B Opportunity\nMore than 1 billion ECGs are administered annually worldwide, and the global ECG market is projected to reach $32B by 2034. As a result, healthcare systems will search for more advanced and accurate diagnostic tools, like HeartSciences MyoVista technology.\nTheir solution is rooted in AI-ECG algorithms developed using advanced convolutional neural networks (CNN), deep learning techniques, which are often trained on more than 120,000 ECG records. For example, its aortic stenosis algorithm, which has received FDA Breakthrough Device designation, has been shown in published data to detect aortic stenosis up to 24 months prior to traditional ECGs, and its diagnostic accuracy increased as the disease progressed.\nAortic stenosis is a condition in which your valve narrows, resulting in restricted blood flow to the rest of the body.\nOther algorithms include those to detect a weak heart pump or early stage cardiac dysfunction which is not possible using traditional ECGs, many heart disease patients are asymptomatic or the symptoms are so mild \u2014 such as fatigue and chest pains \u2014 that they are not recognized as a more serious condition, leading to delays in treatment and a higher risk of life-threatening complications.\nOnce these algorithms are cleared by the FDA, health systems and hospitals could utilize HeartSciences\u2019 MyoVista Insights cloud-based platform to check for heart disease much earlier and more cost effectively. The cloud software system could be integrated with existing ECG devices.\nHeartSciences\u2019 AI-ECG technology offers three key clinical advantages to diagnosing and treating heart disease:\n- Detection in asymptomatic or under-evaluated patients who may not yet show signs of disease.\n- Real-time or retrospective analysis using existing ECG data already captured during routine care.\n- Expanded access to early diagnosis, especially in underserved areas lacking specialized cardiac imaging or providers.\nTrusted by Top Healthcare Systems Worldwide\nHeartSciences\u2019 algorithm and technology have been developed with some of the top cardiology facilities and systems in the world, including Mount Sinai in NY and Rutgers University Hospital.\nBeta use and key opinion leader engagement have already started in the UK, Denmark, Australia, India, and Ireland.\nAdditionally, CPT codes for AI-ECG are already in place, Medicare reimbursement for the technology began in January 2025, and HeartSciences is expected to receive FDA approvals and be in revenue in 2026.\nEach $3.50 unit includes one convertible preferred share and one warrant to purchase an additional share of common stock. That\u2019s two potential shares of Nasdaq tradeable common stock equity per unit, with the added benefit of preferred stock protections until you want to convert and timing flexibility on the warrant. It\u2019s an investment structure often reserved for institutional insiders\u2014but available to everyday investors in this offering.\nHeartSciences has been rated a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d on Yahoo Finance, with the average analyst price 1-year target being over 500% potential upside to a $3.50 investment unit price.\nAn offering statement regarding this offering has been filed with the SEC. The SEC has qualified that offering statement, which only means that the company may make sales of the securities described by the offering statement. Additional information on the company and risk factors related to the offering can be found in the offering circular that is part of that offering statement and is available here.\nThis Regulation A+ offering is made available through Digital Offering, LLC.

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nCollect passive income from real estate without taking on the headaches of being a landlord. You can buy shares of rental properties with as little as $100 thanks to this investment platform backed by Jeff Bezos.\nWith over $124 million in funded properties and Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s trust behind it, it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at the disruption caused by Arrived, a company that lets users buy shares of America\u2019s top properties for as little as $100.\nIts business model, which has attracted over 500,000 investors so far, is straightforward: Arrived purchases single-family rentals in up-and-coming neighborhoods and grants its users the opportunity to buy shares of any individual property that gains their trust. Investors then earn passive income through rent while their shares appreciate in value.\nReal estate returns have historically outpaced those of stocks, with half the volatility. For reference, real estate prices in the U.S. have historically increased between 5% and 12% annually with the added benefit of consistent rental income. However, Arrived has a strict mechanism in place that\u2019s likely to tip the scales in investors\u2019 favor and secure annual rates on the higher end.\nLIMITED TIME FOR JUST $100\nThe Byers House\nOwn a piece of the Byers House, a vacation rental located at the iconic home of Joyce, Jonathan, and Will Byers, featured in Stranger Things and located in Fayetteville, GA, just 20 minutes from Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. This property was used to film the exterior scenes in the actual show and influenced the design for the interior sets, which were filmed in a nearby studio.\nThe company leverages data science, and its team has decades of experience scouring hundreds of markets across the country in search of single-family homes with the highest appreciation potential. To seal the deal, local real estate agents from the area are consulted to share hands-on insights often omitted by data analytics.\nThen, Arrived\u2019s investment committee gives the green light to the most promising properties, which are then put up online.\nOnce the property is listed, nonaccredited investors can purchase shares with a single click and secure a completely passive income stream, without the headaches usually associated with owning a rental. Arrived manages each property, handles maintenance requests and finds new tenants \u2014 cherrypicked with the same rigor that goes into the property\u2019s purchase to secure the most consistent yield for users.\nTwo types of rentals are offered to satisfy the unique goals of investors: the aforementioned regular rentals, which offer consistent passive income, and vacation rentals listed on Airbnb and similar websites, which offer higher-income opportunities. Investors can also minimize market volatility by investing in different properties from 27 different real estate markets across the country.\nDon't wait... Properties are selling out fast.\nYou can invest in these cash-flowing rental properties today and start getting rental income deposited right into your account.\nIf you take all of this into consideration, Bezos\u2019s considerable investment in the company comes as no surprise. The founder of Amazon financed the startup, both in the seed round and the Series A round. However, he won\u2019t be the only big name at future shareholders\u2019 meetings. Arrived\u2019s About Us page proudly displays the names of two other heads of companies: Uber Technologies Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Salesforce Inc. Co-CEO Marc Benioff, who also invested hefty sums into the company.\nSo far, over 250,000 investors have chosen to use Arrived\u2019s simple buying process to expand their portfolios with America\u2019s most promising single-family rentals. After a signup process that\u2019s fairly standard for online investment platforms, users can buy shares with a single click.\nIf you\u2019re looking to capitalize on America\u2019s soaring real estate prices without breaking the bank, Benzinga highly suggests checking it out.\nHold on!\nInvestors are seeing outstanding returns through curated real estate investment alerts. Sign up to get them sporadically and don\u2019t miss out on offers you\u2019d likely never hear about.\nDisclaimer: Please be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.
