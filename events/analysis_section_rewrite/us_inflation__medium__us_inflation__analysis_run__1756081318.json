      "feedback": "Strong breadth and ambition, but upgrade the piece by rebuilding it as a crisp 3–4‑part catalyst map anchored to a 3–6 month horizon and ending with a base case, 1–2 explicit alts, key risks, watch‑list signals, and a stated confidence level. Actionable edits: (1) restructure into a formal causal/ transmission chain: macro policy (the big, beautiful bill) affects deficits/debt and rate/inflation dynamics (cite EPJYXB7DX), which then feeds consumer inflation/real incomes and retail demand, while AI‑driven productivity (Range/U PV3X2MQ6/ILYC1M41F) provides a disinflationary offset and bolsters tax receipts; keep this chain tight with explicit arrows and short, testable hypotheses. (2) specify timing windows and path‑dependence: 4–8 weeks for initial policy signals and legislative movement, 6–12 weeks for observable macro price/yield responses, 3–6 months for distribution of benefits/choppiness in retail and private‑market activity (Pacaso/mogul) to begin signaling; state these as triggers and invalidations. (3) quantify where possible and reconcile conflicts: pull precise numbers (policy: roughly $3.4–4.4 trillion in tax/spending provisions; debt impact ≈ $3–4 trillion over the decade; Medicare/Medicaid offsets; AI productivity uplift 1–1.5% per Range), explicitly noting ranges when sources disagree and choosing a transparent mid‑point for the base case; avoid hedged phrases. (4) sharpen the channels with concrete, source‑backed signals: Great Value/Bimbo Sara Lee‑driven private‑label margins and Walmart pricing (YQOMV2HAJ) as household real‑income proxies; Douglas Tires price/mileage feedback as a consumer‑budget proxy (V8TEZOR8R); Barista FIRE as a labor‑flexibility trend informing consumer risk appetite and wealth‑platform monetization (ILYC1M41F/UPV3X2MQ6); healthcare/tech upside from HeartSciences (IL Y C1M41F) and private‑market real estate (Pacaso/mogul in UPV3X2MQ6/ILYC1M41F); (5) tighten the alts: Alt 1 policy‑driven growth and inflation re‑acceleration risk; Alt 2 policy drag/credit volatility from worsening debt dynamics; Alt 3 AI productivity underwhelms or fails to translate into pricing power; (6) fix alignment and coverage: every claim tied to a cited ID; explicitly note any conflicts between sources (e.g., Fox/U.S. debt numbers vs. CBO estimates) and justify the chosen base‑case anchor; (7) deliver as a compact, scannable arc rather than a long paragraph: after this edit, present the base case, alts, risks, and watch‑list signals in a short bullet‑style or numbered format, ensuring each item cites the primary source IDs (YQOMV2HAJ, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, V8TEZOR8R, HeartSciences) so readers can verify the linkage; (8) preserve the horizon/style constraint by keeping the 3–6 month focus, with a clear path‑dependency note and end‑state expectations. This will elevate depth, numeric rigor, source reconciliation, and actionable clarity without departing from the material.",
