      "feedback": "Your draft is too long, mixes unrelated earnings chatter, and lacks explicit magnitude ranges and inline citations for every claim. Trim it to **4–6 concise sentences** (or bullets) that focus solely on the canonical handles (spx, ust10y, dxy, gold) and the key catalysts (COP30, Sept 2025 Fed meeting, Aug 2025 tariff announcement, July 2025 blockchain‑GDP release). Remove all references to EPAM, CrowdStrike, Snowflake, etc., as they do not add macro‑level insight. For each handle, state the direction, a realistic range (e.g., ust10y +10–20 bp, spx –0.5 to –1 %, dxy +0.5–1 %, gold +1–2 %) and the horizon (next 3–6 months). Add inline citations for every quantitative estimate (ZV3QI3K19, VDO8D9T7M, D0R3LX8F7, XQMF22EFB). Explicitly outline the causal chain: ICJ opinion → legal‑risk premium → ust10y rise → discount‑rate lift → spx drag, with the Fed cut as a counter‑veto and the tariff announcement as a potential drag. Include the invalidation trigger (U.S. court ruling on enforceability) and watch items (COP30 outcome, Fed statement, tariff news, blockchain GDP release). Finish with a single sentence stating a **moderate confidence** rating. This will satisfy the 4–6 sentence rule, keep the focus on the asset, and provide a defensible, actionable house view.",
