  "description": "Trump's tariffs on India may have the unintended effect of driving a long-time U.S. ally into the arms of America's biggest geopolitical adversaries.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s increased tariffs on India as punishment for purchasing Russian oil may have the unintended effect of driving a long-time U.S. ally into the arms of America\u2019s biggest geopolitical adversaries.\n\nTrump moved to double tariffs on India from 25% to 50% on Wednesday, citing India\u2019s continued acquisition of Russian oil as the main reason for the duty hikes. However, India has signaled that it will not stop buying from Moscow, and further tariffs may end up incentivizing India to become closer with Russia and China at the expense of America\u2019s interests, foreign policy experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n\u201cImposing these tariffs on India, knowing fully well that India imports the majority of its oil, means that it is going to be very difficult for India to suddenly shut off and cut off any oil supplies that it is purchasing,\u201d Dr. Aparna Pande, director of the Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute, told the DCNF. \u201cWe send the message to India that: is the U.S. really dependable? Or should India go back to its own policy of hedging its bets and therefore managing their relationship with China, managing it with Russia and no longer becoming closely aligned with the United States?\u201d (RELATED: Trump Doubles Tariffs On Major Ally For Buying Putin\u2019s Oil)\n\nNew Delhi is a prolific purchaser of Russian petrol products, importing around 1.75 million barrels per day on average between January and June of this year, according to trade data obtained by Reuters on Aug. 2.\n\nIndia is one of the U.S. largest growing trading partners, with the two nations exchanging $212.3 billion worth of goods and services in 2024, up over 8% from 2023, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. India is also a frequent customer of U.S. defense companies, buying a total of $24 billion since 2008, according to the State Department.\n\nHowever, sources told Reuters on Monday that India is planning to pause its purchases of U.S. defense equipment due to the new tariffs.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is this is a massive setback for the grand strategy that I thought we were all invested in, including Trump in the first term, which was to create India as a viable bulwark and counterweight to China\u2019s rise in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Brandon Weichert, senior national security editor at the National Interest, told the DCNF.\n\nIndia is a founding member state of BRICS, an economic alliance between numerous countries led primarily by Russia, South Africa, India, China and Brazil. Pande believes that the new tariffs could make India lean more on its BRICS partners, and push the nation further away from U.S. cooperation.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s relationship with Russia is actually decades old,\u201d Pande told the DCNF. \u201cIndia has pushed back against China, any regional organization, whether it\u2019s BRICS, the [Shanghai Cooperation Organization] or G20. India always seeks to push back against the Chinese or Russian interests, which helps the American interest.\u201d\n\nTrade negotiations between the U.S. and India are ongoing despite the new tariff hikes. However, the implicit trust between the two nations may be completely lost, and take decades to recover, Weichert told the DCNF.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get the alliance we could have gotten, because the Indians will never feel that they can trust us,\u201d Weichert told the DCNF.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, U.S. and Indian relations were cordial, with both nations securing economic and military partnerships. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi even hosted Trump during his inaugural visit to India, which drew over 100,000 attendees.\n\nHowever, Trump has been a longtime critic of India\u2019s tariffs on American goods, saying back in 2019 that India was having a \u201cfield day\u201d with the U.S. in an unbalanced trade relationship.\n\n\u201cThe way this is unfolding, this looks much like probably the most difficult challenge to U.S.-India relations since the nuclear tests of 1998,\u201d Sarang Shidore, director of the global south program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told the DCNF.\n\nThe State Department and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs did not respond to the DCNF\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

India remains one of Russia\u2019s prime customers for oil, importing around 1.75 million barrels per day between January and June of this year, according to Reuters.\nTrump has been attempting to put an economic squeeze on Russia amid stalling negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his war in Ukraine.

      "text": "HomeRemarks and Releases \u2013 Bureau of Political-Military Affairs ...U.S. Security Cooperation With India hide U.S. Security Cooperation With India Fact Sheet Bureau of Political-Military Affairs January 20, 2025 India plays a vital role in achieving our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. Working alongside interagency partners, the Political-Military Affairs (PM) Bureau advances the defense trade relationship and broader security partnership between the United States and India. In 2016, the United States designated India as a Major Defense Partner. Commensurate with this designation, in 2018, India was elevated to Strategic Trade Authorization tier 1 status, which allows India to receive license-free access to a wide range of military and dual-use technologies regulated by the Department of Commerce. U.S.-India defense trade cooperation continues to expand with the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), Communications, Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), and the Industrial Security Agreement (ISA) now in place. The PM Bureau supported the increase in total defense trade with India from near zero in 2008 to over $20 billion in 2020. The PM Bureau is committed to further streamlining U.S.-India defense sales we facilitate through both the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) processes. These sales support thousands of jobs in both countries and help ensure the health of both countries\u2019 defense industrial bases. FMS sales notified to Congress are listed here , and recent and significant prior sales include: MH-60R Seahawk helicopters ($2.8 billion), Apache helicopters ($796 million), and the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure ($189 million). India was the first non-treaty partner to be offered a Missile Technology Control Regime Category-1 Unmanned Aerial System \u2013 the Sea Guardian UAS manufactured by General Atomics. PM continues to support advocacy for the Lockheed Martin F-21 and Boeing\u2019s F/A-18 Super Hornet and F-15EX Eagle as part of India\u2019s future fighter aircraft acquisitions. A potential selection of any of these platforms would enhance India\u2019s military capabilities, increase U.S.-India military interoperability, and protect shared security interests in the Indo-Pacific region Since 2015, the United States also authorized India over $3 billion in defense articles via the DCS process, which licenses the export of the defense equipment, services, and related manufacturing technologies controlled under the 21 categories of the U.S. Munitions List (USML). The top DCS categories to India during this period were military electronics (USML category XI); fire control, laser, imaging, and guidance equipment (category XII); and aircraft and related articles. The PM Bureau is the U.S. government lead for building peacekeeping cooperation with India. India is consistently among the top five contributors of military and police personnel to UN peacekeeping operations, with over 5,000 personnel deployed at any given time. From 2016 to 2019, India and the United States jointly taught the UN Peacekeeping Course for African Partners. These courses, conducted in New Delhi and organized for officers from 23 African troop and police contributing countries, were co-sponsored by the U.S. Global Peace Operations Initiative, and taught by U.S., Indian, and African course alumni. The United States and India are now looking to expand collaboration on peacekeeping cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners. This enduring element of cooperation speaks to the strength of the U.S.-India security partnership and our mutual commitment to uphold the ideals on which the United Nations was founded. The PM Bureau also supports increasing maritime security cooperation with India and other Indian Ocean partners. In 2019, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India became eligible for funding under DoD\u2019s Maritime Security Initiative, which conducts partner capacity building in the Indo-Pacific. Also, since the Bay of Bengal Initiative was established in 2018, we provided more than $145 million in Foreign Military Financing for maritime capacity building in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Maldives to enhance the capacity of civilian and military actors with maritime equities to prevent, detect, and respond promptly to illicit activities within their own areas of responsibility and throughout the Bay of Bengal. PM continues to work closely with partners in the region to coordinate capacity building and security assistance efforts to eliminate redundancies and address critical gaps as we work to build the maritime safety and security capacity of our partners. India participates in the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program, and received at least $1 million of IMET funding annually since 2003. IMET provides professional military education and training to military students and is key to establishing lasting relationships with future leaders. IMET courses increase military professionalization, enhance interoperability with U.S. forces, offer instruction on the law of armed conflict and human rights, provide technical and operational training, and create a deeper understanding of the United States. Indian IMET graduates tend to go on to achieve high rank in the Indian military, creating a common understanding and opportunities to increase interoperability between the U.S. and Indian militaries. In November 2019, the United States and India conducted Tiger Triumph, the first-ever tri-service (ground, naval, and air forces) exercise between the two countries. During the weeklong exercise, U.S. Marines and sailors partnered with forces from all three of India\u2019s armed services to rehearse disaster response and humanitarian aid delivery. India also participates in the U.S.-led Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise and trilateral Malabar exercise with the United States and Japan. These military exercises enhance U.S.-India relations and help create a more stable and secure Indo-Pacific region.

      "text": "AHMEDABAD, India \u2014 Donald Trump was cheered by more than 100,000 Indians at the opening of the world's largest cricket stadium on Monday, promising \"an incredible trade deal\" and \"the most feared military equipment on the planet\" at his biggest rally abroad.\nIndians wore cardboard Trump masks and \"Namaste Trump\" hats to welcome the U.S. president at the huge new Motera stadium in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's own political homeland, the western city of Ahmedabad.\nModi, a nationalist who won re-election last year and has shifted his country firmly to the right with policies that his critics decry as authoritarian and ethnically divisive, touts his relationship with Trump as proof of his own global standing.\nU.S. officials have described Trump's visit as a way to counter China's rise as a superpower.\n\"You have done a great honor to our country. We will remember you forever, from this day onwards India will always hold a special place in our hearts,\" Trump said to thunderous applause.\nIndia is one of the few big countries in world where Trump's personal approval rating is above 50%. It has built up ties with the United States in recent years as Washington's relationship has become strained with India's foe Pakistan.\n\"As we continue to build our defense cooperation, the United States looks forward to providing India with some of the best and most feared military equipment on the planet,\" Trump said.\nTrump said the two countries will sign deals on Tuesday to sell military helicopters worth $3 billion and that the United States must become the premier defense partner of India, which relied on Russian equipment during the Cold War. Reuters reported earlier that India has cleared the purchase of 24 helicopters from Lockheed Martin worth $2.6 billion.\nBut in a sign of the underlying political tensions in India, violent protests broke out in Delhi - where Trump is due on Tuesday - over a new citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims and is a further attempt to undermine the secular foundations of India's democracy.\nVehicles were set on fire in the eastern part of Delhi, metal barricades torn down, and thick smoke billowed through the air as thousands of those who are supporting the new law clashed with those opposing it.\nIn his speech Trump extolled India's rise as a stable and prosperous democracy as one of the achievements of the century. \"You have done it as a tolerant country. And you have done it as a great, free country,\" he said.\nTrump planned to raise the issue of religious freedoms in India with Modi, an administration official said last week.\nVERY BIG DEALS\nIn Ahmedabad, Modi embraced Trump as he stepped off Air Force One, along with his wife, Melania.\nFolk dancers carrying colorful umbrellas danced alongside the red carpet as drummers, trumpeters and other musicians performed at the airport to welcome Trump and the U.S. delegation. Crowds lined the route along his cavalcade, many taking pictures on their phones.\nThe two sides did not manage to hammer out a trade deal ahead of the visit, with differences remaining over agriculture, medical devices, digital trade and proposed new tariffs. Trump said he was going to discuss economic ties with Modi, describing him as a tough negotiator.\n\"We will be making very, very major, among the biggest ever made, trade deals. We are in the early stages of discussion for an incredible trade agreement to reduce barriers of investment between the United States and India,\" he said.\n\"And I am optimistic that working together, the prime minister and I can reach a fantastic deal that's good and even great for both of our countries - except that he is a very tough negotiator.\"\nModi, who has built a personal rapport with Trump, is pulling out the stops for the president although prospects for even a limited trade deal during the visit are seen as slim.\n\"There is so much that we share, shared values and ideals ... shared opportunities and challenges, shared hopes and aspirations,\" said Modi at the rally.\nTrump, who faces his own re-election campaign this year, has frequently praised Modi for his crowd-pulling power.\nLast year, Trump held a \"Howdy Modi\" rally with Modi in Houston, drawing 50,000 people, mainly Indian Americans. At the time, Trump likened Modi to Elvis Presley as a draw for crowds.\nLater, Trump and his entourage which includes daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner flew to Agra to see the Taj Mahal at sunset. Children lined the route cheering and waving flags as his convoy drove past.\nTrump and Melania posed for pictures at the Taj, the 17th century monument to love. \"It's incredible,\" he told reporters.\n(Additional reporting by Neha Dasgupta, Euan Rocha in New Delhi, Zeba Siddiqui in Agra; Writing by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Giles Elgood and Peter Graff)"
