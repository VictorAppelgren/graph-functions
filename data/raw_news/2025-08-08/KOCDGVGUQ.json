  "content": "Explore Select Medical Holdings's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nSelect Medical Holdings Corporation's (NYSE:SEM) earnings announcement last week was disappointing for investors, despite the decent profit numbers. We did some digging and actually think they are being unnecessarily pessimistic.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nThe Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit\n\nTo properly understand Select Medical Holdings' profit results, we need to consider the US$29m expense attributed to unusual items. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And, after all, that's exactly what the accounting terminology implies. If Select Medical Holdings doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.\n\nThat might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.\n\nOur Take On Select Medical Holdings' Profit Performance\n\nUnusual items (expenses) detracted from Select Medical Holdings' earnings over the last year, but we might see an improvement next year. Because of this, we think Select Medical Holdings' earnings potential is at least as good as it seems, and maybe even better! And one can definitely find a positive in the fact that it made a profit this year, despite losing money last year. Of course, we've only just scratched the surface when it comes to analysing its earnings; one could also consider margins, forecast growth, and return on investment, among other factors. Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Select Medical Holdings (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.\n\nToday we've zoomed in on a single data point to better understand the nature of Select Medical Holdings' profit. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company. For example, many people consider a high return on equity as an indication of favorable business economics, while others like to 'follow the money' and search out stocks that insiders are buying. While it might take a little research on your behalf, you may find this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks with significant insider holdings to be useful.\n\nHave feedback on this article?
