  "title": "Trump admin rips George Washington University in DC as 'deliberately indifferent' to antisemitism",
  "description": "The Trump Justice Department found George Washington University in violation of federal civil rights law, citing an indifference to antisemitic harassment.",
  "content": "The Trump administration on Tuesday shredded George Washington University as \"deliberately indifferent\" to what the Department of Justice considers a \"hostile educational environment for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty.\"\n\nThe DOJ announced that its Civil Rights Division has concluded its investigation into \"incidents of antisemitic discrimination and harassment of Jewish and Israeli students\" and found the Washington, D.C.-based university violated federal civil rights law.\n\n\"Every student has the right to equal educational opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse,\" Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. \"No one is above the law, and universities that promulgate antisemitic discrimination will face legal consequences.\"\n\nIn a letter to George Washington University President Ellen Granberg, Dhillon said the DOJ finds that \"despite actual notice of the abuses occurring on its campus, GWU was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its students and faculty, in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" The DOJ is moving to enforcement and is seeking \"immediate remediation.\"\n\nThe Justice Department, which provides direct federal financial assistance to GWU, said it was offering the university an opportunity to resolve the matter through a \"voluntary resolution agreement.\" The state goal is \"to ensure immediate remediation of these issues and related reforms to prevent the recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and abuse.\"\n\nUnlike Harvard and Columbia \u2013 which have both clashed with the Trump administration over anti-Israel demonstrations in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks \u2013 George Washington University is a private institution. However, due to its location in the nation's capital, federal agencies and global embassies, George Washington University is more exposed to federal oversight and political influence.\n\nThe DOJ announcement comes a day after President Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the D.C. police department, citing rampant violent crime in the nation's capital.\n\nThe federal civil rights investigation found GWU students and faculty \"were subjected to a hostile educational environment that was objectively offensive, severe, and pervasive,\" Dhillon wrote. \"The antisemitic, hate-based misconduct by GWU students directed at Jewish GWU students, faculty, and employees was, in a word, shocking. The behavior was demonstrably abhorrent, immoral, and, most importantly, illegal.\"\n\nDuring final exams and graduation ceremonies in April and May 2024, Dhillon said, members of the university community engaged in \"antisemitic, disruptive protests that included the establishment of an \u2018encampment\u2019 in GWU's University Yard.\"\n\nThe DOJ said the university received \"no less than eight complaints\" during that timeframe alleging that demonstrators were discriminating against Jewish and Israeli students. Jewish students, parents and alumni also contacted university leadership to voice \"reasonable fears for their safety\" as protesters continued their anti-Israel campus encampment. The DOJ also received reports of antisemitic discrimination at George Washington University's campus.\n\nTRUMP RAMPS UP HEAT ON HARVARD: HERE ARE 5 REASONS FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S OWN INVESTIGATION\n\n\"The purpose of the agitators' efforts was to frighten, intimidate, and deny Jewish, Israeli, and American-Israeli students free and unfettered access to GWU's educational environment,\" Dhillon wrote. \"This is the definition of hostility and a \u2018hostile environment\u2019.\"\n\nThe investigation also found \"numerous incidents\" of Jewish students being harassed, abused, intimidated and assaulted by protesters,\" Dhillon wrote. \"To be clear, Jewish students were afraid to attend class, to be observed, or, worse, to be \u2018caught\u2019 and perhaps physically beaten on GWU's campus.\"\n\nDhillon cited one Jewish student who described being \"surrounded, harassed, threatened, and then ordered to leave the area immediately by antisemitic protesters after exiting the Law School, which is adjacent to University Yard.\" Her letter said GWU's Assistant Dean of Students instructed the Jewish student to leave because his presence was \"antagonizing and provoking the crowd.\"\n\nThe assistant attorney general said other Jewish students provided similar accounts of harassment and intimidation by protesters when they tried to cross the campus through University Yard.\n\n\"Protesters surrounded them, yelled antisemitic slurs in their faces, and forced them to flee,\" Dhillon wrote. \"A Jewish student who quietly held up an Israeli flag on University Yard was confronted and surrounded by protesters with their arms linked together for the purpose of restricting the Jewish student's movements.\"\n\nThroughout the encounter, Dhillon said, the protesters shouted slurs and a university police officer standing nearby \"did nothing to prevent or intervene in the incident and instead told the student to leave University Yard for his own safety.\"\n\nDhillon said another Jewish student who stood holding an Israeli flag across the street from the encampment was harassed by protesters who screamed \"F--- you, Zionist go die,\" \"there is only one solution, Intifada revolution,\" \"Hamas are freedom fighters,\" and \"Zionists go to hell!\" She said a university police officer also told that student to leave the area.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to George Washington University for comment but did not immediately hear back.",

      "text": "New Yorkers are expressing skepticism after Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani appeared to try to distance himself from the phrase \"globalize the intifada,\" after spending months refusing to condemn the phrase many interpret as a call for violence against Jewish people.\nThe New York Times reported that Mamdani, who is Muslim and a self-professed socialist who has been highly critical of the state of Israel, told city business leaders that he would not use the phrase and that he would \"discourage\" others from doing so.\nThe Times reported that Mamdani told some 150 business executives present at the meeting, which took place in the Rockefeller Center, that while many use the phrase to express solidarity with Palestinians, others see it as a call to antisemitic violence.\nThis comes after Mamdani refused to condemn intifada language throughout his campaign for the Democratic mayoral nomination. During an interview on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" in June, Mamdani said, \"My concern is, to start to walk down the line of language and making clear what language I believe is permissible or impermissible, takes me into a place similar to that of the president, who is looking to do those very kinds of things, putting people in jail for writing an op-ed, putting them in jail for protesting.\"\nAOC WELCOMES SOCIALIST MAMDANI TO NATION'S CAPITAL AS DEM LEADERS WITHHOLD ENDORSEMENTS\nHe said that \"ultimately, it is not language that I use. It is language, I understand there are concerns about, and what I will do is showcase my vision for the city through my words and my actions.\"\nNow, weeks after winning the Democratic nomination and facing general election voters, he appears to finally be backing away from the intifada language.\nJoe Borelli, a former Republican New York City Council member, responded to the shift, telling Fox News Digital it is \"hard to imagine any change of heart being genuine when it occurs right after you\u2019ve won a primary and have to pivot for the general, which happens to include a heck of a lot of Jews.\"\nRory Lancman, a Democrat and former New York City councilmember and state assemblyman, told Fox News Digital that \"a putative mayor of New York City needs to be able to repudiate calls for 'intifada' without ambiguity or qualification as morally repugnant and unacceptable.\"\n'EXISTENTIAL THREAT': JEWISH LEADERS WARN OF NYC 'MASS EXODUS' IF ZOHRAN MAMDANI WINS IN NOVEMBER\n\"There is no 'threading the needle' or middle ground on this issue, or, for that matter, on the issue of whether Israel should be extinguished as a Jewish state,\" Lancman went on.\n\"These are basic, straightforward 'good vs. evil' questions that Mr. Mamdani struggles with because, frankly, he's on the wrong side of that equation,\" said Lancman.\nMeanwhile, Christopher Hahn, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told Fox News Digital that \"while Mandani has made statements that show he is not an anti-Semite some of his past statements can be construed that way.\"\nHahn said that if Mamdani \"hopes to be mayor he needs to make it very clear, early and often, he is not anti-Semitic.\"\n\"If he doesn\u2019t his opponents will try to paint him as one,\" said Hahn.\nTRUMP SAYS CUOMO'S GOT A 'GOOD SHOT' OF BEATING MAMDANI IN NYC MAYOR ELECTION\nTop Democratic leaders have also been demanding that Mamdani condemn calls to globalize the intifada.\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said during an interview with WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer in late June that the phrase is received by the public as a call to \"slaughter the Jews,\" and that Mamdani needed to understand how the word is received by the Jewish community.\n\"It doesn't matter what meaning you have in your brain. It is not how the word is received. When you use a word like intifada \u2014 to many Jewish Americans and Jewish New Yorkers, that means you are permissive of violence against Jews,\" said Gillibrand.\nHouse Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has also said the mayoral candidate would have to clarify this position on the phrase.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Globalizing the intifada, by way of example, is not an acceptable phrase,\" Jeffries said. \"He\u2019s going to have to clarify his position on that as he moves forward.\"\nHe added, \"With respect to the Jewish communities that I represent, I think our nominee is going to have to convince folks that he is prepared to aggressively address the rise in antisemitism in the city of New York, which has been an unacceptable development.\"\nMamdani is running to unseat current New York City Mayor Eric Adams who is running for re-election as an independent. He is also facing off against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whom he defeated in the Democratic Primary and who is also running as an independent. Activist Curtis Sliwa is also running for mayor as a Republican.\nFox News Digital's Hanna Panreck contributed to this report."

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner.

They also defaced a statue of the campus's namesake, former President George Washington, with Palestinian iconography, which includes slamming \"Free Palestine\" stickers onto the statue.\nThe raucous crowd are demanding that the university divest itself of all companies that trade with Israel, as well as reveal all the university's investment information to students \u2014 and now, they do not want the university to call D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to clear the encampment.\n\"We are very disciplined and organized. We\u2019ve instructed all of our participants not to engage with agitators. Not to engage with police,\" student organizer Reem Lababdi told 7News. \"We have a peaceful study. We have political education. We have religious services. There is absolutely no reason for MPD to get involved.\"\nThe anti-Israel encampment has vowed not to disperse until their demands are met.\n\"They made it abundantly clear that, unless the school complies 100% with their demands, they will not be leaving,\" Skyler Sieradzky, a senior at George Washington University, told Fox News.\nSieradzky said she participated in a counterprotest where she and others stood silently and held an Israeli flag. The anti-Israel protesters responded to their demonstration by harassing and spitting at her, she said.\nUniversity President Ellen Granberg said over the weekend that the ongoing encampment was unlawful.\n\"I fully support and encourage our community to speak out and engage in controversial and critical dialogues on these crucial issues \u2014 as long as they occur within the limits of our university's policies and the District's laws,\" she said in a letter shared online. \"However, what is currently happening at GW is not a peaceful protest protected by the First Amendment or our university\u2019s policies.\"\nShe added: \"The demonstration, like many around the country, has grown into what can only be classified as an illegal and potentially dangerous occupation of GW property.\"\nGranberg said the university has asked for support from the MPD to provide security assistance on and around the campus.\nLast week, House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, R-Ky, announced that his committee would hold a full committee hearing titled \"Oversight of D.C.\u2019s Response to Unlawful Activity and Antisemitism,\" which will examine the university and city leaders' response to the anti-Israel demonstration.\nThe committee has invited DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and MPD Chief Pamela Smith to testify on how they responded to \"the ongoing radical, antisemitic, and unlawful protests occurring at George Washington University and surrounding public lands.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The House Oversight Committee is deeply concerned over reports indicating the D.C.

According to The Hill, Burck was fired after Trump posted on Truth Social.\nJEWISH HARVARD STUDENTS SPEAK OUT AFTER UNIVERSITY SUES TRUMP ADMIN OVER FUNDING FREEZE\nHarvard has become a target of Trump\u2019s broader crackdown on universities, much of which is in response to last year\u2019s anti-Israel unrest that erupted on campuses across the country.\nOn April 11, the Trump administration sent a letter to Harvard University President Dr. Alan Garber and Harvard Corporation Lead Member Penny Pritzker outlining the institution\u2019s failures and a list of demands from the White House. In the letter, the administration accused Harvard of failing to uphold civil rights laws and to foster an \"environment that produces intellectual creativity.\"\nThe Trump administration threatened to pull federal funding if Harvard did not reform governance and leadership, as well as its hiring and admissions practices by August 2025. The letter emphasized the need for Harvard to change its international admissions process to avoid admitting students who are \"hostile\" to American values or support terrorism or antisemitism.\nHarvard refused to comply with the demands, with Garber saying that \"no government\u2026 should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\" The university later filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its \"unlawful\" freezing of funds.\nHARVARD PRESIDENT SAYS HE HAS 'NO CHOICE' BUT TO FIGHT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\nThe Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard, and is reportedly looking to slash another billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nWhile Harvard appeared to be quick to reject the Trump administration\u2019s proposal, the New York Times reported that the university\u2019s leaders and major donors pushed for the school to make a deal.\n\"For weeks leading up to the April 11 letter, the corporation took a very different stance toward the Trump administration. At the urging of some of its biggest donors, the corporation frantically tried to cut a deal with Mr. Trump,\" the NYT reported.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn December 2023, Harvard was criticized over its handling of antisemitism and anti-Israel unrest on its campus following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 massacre and the war that followed. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. \u2014 a Trump ally \u2014 grilled the university\u2019s then-President Claudine Gay over whether \"calling for the genocide of Jews\" constituted bullying and harassment. Gay famously said that it depended on the \"context,\" a sentiment echoed by the other Ivy League presidents who were questioned. Less than a month after the hearing, Gay resigned from her position. However, she remains employed by the university."

The students have encamped on GWU's University Yard, one of the school's few green spaces on an urban campus that is nestled in Northwest D.C.\n\"Since you are skipping classes (if you are actually a student), why not go volunteer to help in Gaza?\" Roth asked. \"Many American Jews have gone to help in Israel on farms and kibbutzes to provide missing labor as so many Israelis have been called up to military service. If you really want to help, why don't you go where you really could make a difference for the people you profess to be supporting?\"\nThe professor also told students that they are \"supporting rape, as your signs \u2018resistance by any means necessary\u2019 state.\"\n\"You are supporting gender inequality and lack of any LGBTQ rights,\" she wrote. \"You are supporting a named terrorist organization. Your call for an intifada revolution is a call for more innocent lives to be lost.\"\nCOLUMBIA LAW STUDENT GROUP REPORTEDLY DECLARES NO JEW IS SAFE UNTIL 'EVERYONE IS SAFE'\n\"You call each other comrades,\" Roth said. \"I spent a lot of time in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. I can promise you that most people in the world prefer capitalism over communism.\"\n\"You are not on the right side of history like you think you will be. No one with hate in their heart ever is,\" Roth added.\nGWU President Ellen Granberg issued a statement condemning the protests on Sunday.\n\"I fully support and encourage our community to speak out and engage in controversial and critical dialogues on these crucial issues\u2014as long as they occur within the limits of our university's policies and the District's laws,\" she wrote. \"However, what is currently happening at GW is not a peaceful protest protected by the First Amendment or our university\u2019s policies. The demonstration, like many around the country, has grown into what can only be classified as an illegal and potentially dangerous occupation of GW property.\"\nProf. Roth told Fox News Digital in a statement that she does not speak for the law school or GWU at large.\n\"Personally, it is scary for me to see the father of this country and namesake of GW dressed like a terrorist,\" Prof. Roth said, responding to the defacing of the George Washington statue on GWU's campus.\n\"I support free speech, I support the right to protest (peacefully) but I do not support students and others violating multiple rules of the University including destruction of property,\" she wrote.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nGWU did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital."

      "text": "The Trump administration escalated its war with Harvard University on Tuesday, announcing it will claw back the university's remaining $100 million in federal funding \u2014 effectively ending all financial ties with the Ivy League institution.\n\"The government is out of business with Harvard University, fully,\" a senior administration official told Fox News Digital.\nAt the center of the fight are accusations of Harvard failing to combat a campus culture of antisemitism. While the university accuses the White House of overreach and insists it is defending free speech, its own internal investigation appears to have handed Trump officials ammunition.\nEarlier this year, Harvard President Alan Gerber called the 2023\u20132024 academic year \"disappointing and painful\" as he unveiled the results of two separate task forces: one examining antisemitism and the other focused on anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias.\nThe report from the antisemitism task force painted a bleak picture of life for Jewish and Israeli students on campus.\nMany said they felt ostracized, harassed online and unsupported by the university. Some students told investigators they had been pressured by peers, and even the faculty, to disavow ties to Israel to prove they were \"one of the good ones.\" Others chose to hide their Jewish identity altogether.\nHere is a look back at more findings of the report, released April 29.\n1. Hostile environment for Jewish students\nJewish, Arab and Muslim students at Harvard reported feeling ostracized, pushed to the margins by their peers and experiencing online harassment.\nJewish and Israeli students told the antisemitism task force the university\u2019s response to complaints was \"unclear and unconscionably slow.\"\nSome Jewish students, according to the report, had been told by peers and even faculty members they were associated with \"something offensive, and, in some cases, that their very presence was an offense.\"\nSome decided to conceal their identities from classmates, while others were asked to renounce any ties to Israel to prove they were \"one of the good ones.\"\nTRUMP SAYS HARVARD'S FOREIGN STUDENTS ARE FROM COUNTRIES PAYING 'NOTHING' FOR THEIR EDUCATION\n\"No other group was constantly told that their history was a sham, that they or their co-religionists or co-ethnics were supremacists and oppressors, and that they had no right to the protections offered by anti-bias norms,\" read one section of the report. \"Many Jewish students told us they feel like objects of suspicion.\"\nOne Jewish graduate student told the task force, \"Jews are now being treated like Republicans were when I was in college.\"\nThat statement \"of course points to another problem with which elite universities have been struggling,\" the report said.\nAt times, the anti-Muslim and antisemitism task force reports were seemingly at odds with each other. Muslim and pro-Palestinian students reported a widespread fear of doxxing, or having their personal identifying information shared publicly with the intent to intimidate or harm them. They reported often seeing pictures of their faces on the sides of trucks driven around campus by pro-Israel groups.\nForty-seven percent of Muslim students reported feeling physically unsafe on campus during the 2023\u20132024 school year, compared with 15% of Jewish respondents.\nThe antisemitism report called for a set of rules to govern permissible behaviors for instructors in classrooms, while the anti-Muslim and Arab bias task force called for the university to do more to protect academic freedom and free speech.\nJUDGE TEMPORARILY PAUSES TRUMP MOVE TO CANCEL HARVARD STUDENT VISA POLICY AFTER LAWSUIT\n2. Academic biases\nThe antisemitism report found Harvard classes often portrayed \"partisan and one-sided pedagogy\" that failed to account for Jewish and Israeli perspectives, particularly within the university's divinity school and school of public health.\nThe task force also documented instances when faculty canceled or ended class early on the day of a pro-Gaza protest or \"gave time at the end of class for students to promote various solidarity groups\" like the Palestine Solidarity Committee.\nThe report recommended expanding courses on antisemitism, Judaism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to foster a more inclusive and comprehensive academic environment.\n\"Anti-Zionist views seem built into some classes,\" one student noted.\nFox News Digital has reached out to Harvard for comment on the report.\n3. Political divides worsening\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the report found that at the university \"pro-Israel organizers and pro-Palestinian organizers had disagreed strongly yet often worked together to build bridges and to imagine jointly a better future for the region.\"\n\"Those efforts started to fade in the 2000s amidst the Second Intifada and through the Israel-Hamas wars of the 2010s, and by the time Hamas crashed through the Israeli border fence in 2023 the conditions at Harvard (as in the Middle East itself) were very different,\" the report read.\nSome pro-Palestinian campus organizers viewed bridge-building activities \"as a form of betrayal,\" the report found.\nThe report found that many students, including Jewish ones, had \"sympathy\" for Israel\u2019s \"massive military response\" that followed the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.\nHowever, campus protests \"crossed a line from a call for freedom and security for Palestinians and Jews alike to a stereotyped notion: that Israel is not a state, but rather a \u2018settler colony\u2019 of white Europeans who have no real connection with the land they had stolen, that epitomized aggression, and was bereft of virtues.\"\n4. Admissions process led to dwindling Jewish population\nThe report found that changes in Harvard\u2019s admissions policies meant that by 2023, the Jewish student community was much smaller than it was in the early 2010s.\nThe hostility that some students had felt, the report found, was \"degrading\" to the university, and some Jewish students turned down offers of admission to Harvard over it.\nSome Jewish students vying for doctorate degrees said they decided to leave for private industry jobs because of the perception that academia is \"unfriendly to Jews.\"\nSome non-Jewish faculty members told the task force that Jewish candidates had turned down post-doctoral fellowships at Harvard and Jewish medical school students shied away from residencies at Harvard hospitals \"because of the deep politicization of the climate.\"\nThe task force determined Harvard should change its admissions policy to reflect \"what campus should look like: people listening to each other.\"\n5. Lack of educational oversight\nThe task force also found a lack of oversight over seemingly university-endorsed educational content.\nThe Harvard Chan School of Public Health, for example, launched a Palestinian program in 2022 that is run by a \"leadership collective\" of five individuals, none of whom hold a tenure-track faculty appointment at Harvard.\n\"The use of the Harvard brand for a research or teaching project creates expectations among Harvard faculty, staff, students, and the broader public. Programs operating without the guidance and oversight of Harvard\u2019s regular faculty with expertise risk falling short of these expectations,\" the task force found.\nIn another example, the task force found the coursework for a master's degree in Religion and Public Life to be misrepresented. The program is advertised as offering students a better understanding of religion to illuminate a range of contemporary issues.\nBoth faculty and students did not expect the program to be as focused on the Israel\u2013Palestinian issue as it was, and some students found \"program offerings and materials disproportionately presented Israelis and Jews as guilty of monstrous historical crimes, which require both repentance and redress.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe program \"appears to have focused on non-mainstream Jewish religious perspectives that lack widespread support within the Jewish diaspora or in Israel.\" It also linked Jews to \"two great sins,\" according to the task force: the creation of the state of Israel and participation in White supremacy, which staff \"appeared to embrace openly.\""

The DOJ's findings highlighted a hostile educational environment, with reports of harassment and intimidation directed at Jewish students during protests on campus. The administration is seeking immediate remediation and has offered GWU a chance for a voluntary resolution to address these issues.",
