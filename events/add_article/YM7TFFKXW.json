      "summary": "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook faces two criminal referrals from housing regulator Bill Pulte for alleged mortgage fraud on three properties, claiming misrepresentation of second homes and rental status to secure favorable loan terms. Cook admitted to manufacturing documents and cited a 'clerical error' but has not refuted the allegations. The case has prompted President Trump to remove her from the Fed Board, citing the referrals, while Cook sues Trump, the Fed, and Powell. The controversy highlights potential conflicts of interest and regulatory oversight failures.",
