      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world‑class, overhaul into a tight 3–6 month scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and a transparent causal chain; tighten alignment to horizon (3–6 months) and quote concrete milestones from the sources rather than broad statements. Concrete edits: (1) Build a formal scenario tree with a base case plus 1–2 explicit alts (e.g., “Tariff enforcement accelerates on DOJ probe and court rulings dampen cross‑border flow” and “UK DCTS Asia cumulation advances faster than expected”); attach timing windows from sources (DOJ enforcement actions and July 31, 2025 oral arguments; potential Supreme Court action; UK DCTS milestones “early 2026” but with interim policy signals) and path dependence (e.g., what happens if a deal is reached country‑by‑country vs. if no deal is reached); (2) Quantify transmission channels: tariff costs and pass‑through (Goodyear notes annualized tariff costs ~$300–$350m with about $4 per tire pass‑through; add the ~1,800 planned layoffs as a labor/margin shock), and apparel/UK flow shifts (Sri Lanka DCTS allowing 100% inputs with zero tariff into the UK; June 2025 UK apparel exports +5.2% to $439.39m; Sri Lanka employs 350k directly, 1m in the chain); cite (AJTHKYXQ3), (AJTHKYXQ3/Goodyear context via AJTHKYXQ3), (WLXM1819K). (3) Strengthen the causal chain from policy to market: show how tariff enforcement risk raises compliance costs, disrupts lead times, and pressures capex/margins, versus how UK DCTS cumulation could re‑weight sourcing toward Sri Lanka, with cross‑border flow implications for UK and global apparel pricing (cite WLXM1819K; OFY11YO0I; AJTHKYXQ3). (4) Add timing windows and invalidations: specify near‑term watch‑points (DOJ Market/Gov/Consumer Fraud unit actions and July 31, 2025 hearings; Supreme Court fast‑track risk) and invalidate the base case if none materialize by e.g., Q4 2025 or if UK DCTS milestones slip beyond early 2026; (5) Integrate a pricing/valuation lens: convert impact into implied margins or price shields; use the $4/tire pass‑through as a proxy for consumer price impact and mention that 1,800 layoffs imply labor cost dynamics; (6) Reconcile conflicts and avoid over‑generalizations: acknowledge that DCTS timing is outside the 3–6 month window but emphasize the momentum from the Asia Cumulation Group (WLXM1819K); (7) Improve citation discipline: place after each factual claim (OFY11YO0I for DOJ enforcement; WLXM1819K/JAAF data for UK/DCTS; AJTHKYXQ3 for Goodyear/macroeffects; 55GVT420Q for tech‑tariff/price context) and avoid non‑source material claims. This will yield a crisp base case with clearly delimited triggers, a pair of plausible alts, a concise risk/watch list, and a defensible confidence assessment.",
