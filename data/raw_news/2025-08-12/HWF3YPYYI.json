  "content": "Even $6K in crypto can get you kidnapped, warns expert originally appeared on TheStreet.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to feel the spotlight due to growing interest from institutional investors, a new threat is putting the lives of crypto owners in danger, like murder.\n\nAccording to Alena Vranova, a founder of a Czech-based security tech company, SatoshiLabs, at least one person gets kidnapped every week for their crypto wallet keys.\n\n\"Every week, there is a Bitcoiner, at least one in the world, who gets kidnapped, tortured, extorted, and sometimes even worse,\" Vranova told attendees, as per reports.\n\nVranova also says that the attacks are not just limited to high-profile individuals, but victims with even $6000 have been targeted. She also adds, \"We have seen people murdered for $50,000 in crypto.\"\n\n\"We currently have more than 80 million Bitcoiner and crypto user identities leaked online; 2.2 million out of those contain home addresses,\" Vranova said. She explains that these information leaks allow criminals to target victims and their families.\n\nJoin the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.\n\nCommonly known as '$5 wrench attacks', the perpetrators resort to old tactics of physical force to obtain users' wallet keys, which are crucial to accessing their funds. The term was popularized by a comic that showed how a basic item like a wrench could destroy even the most powerful cryptographic security.\n\nInterestingly, just months prior, on May 28, French police arrested over 20 individuals following multiple plots to kidnap crypto entrepreneurs and their families. In the same month, The Wall Street Journal reported five abductions linked to wrench attacks.\n\nThe trend of one person being kidnapped per week was predicted by Jameson Lopp.\n\nLopp is the Chief Security Officer and co-founder of a self-custody solution called Casa. On May 24, Lopp said, \"My prediction that we'll average 1 attack per week this year is looking on target,\" on X.\n\nExperts recommend avoiding sharing cryptocurrency and personal information, using multisig wallets to prevent theft, and storing money in cold storage with keys in many locations to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nEven $6K in crypto can get you kidnapped, warns expert first appeared on TheStreet on Aug 12, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 12, 2025, where it first appeared.",

      "text": "Arrests over French cryptocurrency kidnapping plots\nFrench police have arrested more than 20 people following a number of kidnapping plots targeting cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and their families.\nAuthorities said the arrests were in connection with investigations into a recent abduction attempt in Nantes and the attempted kidnapping of a woman and child in Paris in May.\nThe incidents have raised concerns about the safety of those with cryptocurrency fortunes which could make them a target for criminals seeking ransom payments.\nEarlier this month French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau vowed to bolster security around the country's crypto executives and their families.\nA total of 24 people have been taken into custody, French media report.\nThe arrests were connected to an unsuccessful attempt by a masked gang to abduct the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency chief in Paris on 13 May.\nThe pair were described by French media as relatives of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium.\nArrests were also made over a kidnapping attempt against a person with ties to the crypto sector which was foiled by police in the Nantes region of western France on Monday, local media outlets reported.\nPolice intervened before the attack was carried out, police sources said.\nOther incidents of kidnappings or attempted kidnappings have taken place across the country in recent months, including the case of the father of a cryptocurrency millionaire who was bundled into a van by men in balaclavas in Paris on 1 May.\nLe Parisien newspaper said his kidnappers demanded his wealthy son pay a \u20ac5-7m ransom (\u00a34.2-5.9m).\nThe victim had one finger missing when he was rescued by police days later in a house in Palaiseau, south of Paris, according to French media.\nThese incidents follow the kidnapping of David Balland, co-founder of the cryptocurrency firm Ledger, who was abducted with his wife at their home in central France in January.\nThe pair were rescued by police within days and Mr Balland also had a finger cut off, French media reported.\nThe criminals had demanded a \u20ac10m ransom. Six men and a woman were previously arrested in connection with that case.\nIn response to the spate of attacks against those with links to the cryptocurrency sector, Retailleau held an emergency meeting with industry leaders in mid-May.\nIn the meeting, he promised the \"entire state apparatus\" was \"fully mobilised to track down the perpetrators and instigators of this violence and put them out of action\", according to French media reports."

      "text": "In This Article:\n\u2018Never selling\u2019 investor outlines ambitious Bitcoin price targets originally appeared on TheStreet.\nSiddarth Bharwani, Joint Managing Director and CFO of Jetking, told TheStreet Roundtable that the classic Bitcoin cycle theory is \u201cgetting slightly disrupted\u201d as geopolitical turmoil fails to dent the market.\nJetking designated Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset in December 2024. Under Siddarth Bharwani\u2019s phased plan, the company aims to hold 210 Bitcoin by the end of 2025 and amass 18,000 Bitcoin by 2030.\n\u201cThe world went through a storm in the last six months and Bitcoin did not have a very extreme reaction,\u201d he said, contrasting today\u2019s stability with the 60% \u2013 70% COVID-era sell-off.\nCycle theory disrupted\nBharwani argues that Bitcoin\u2019s drivers are shifting. \u201c2010 to 2020 was all the community and retail driving Bitcoin. 2020 to 2030 is going to be corporations driving Bitcoin. And 2030 onwards will be countries driving Bitcoin,\u201d he said.\nThat evolution reflects growing institutional involvement, which he believes will \u201cstart getting slightly less volatile than it was before.\u201d\nAs evidence, he pointed to recent tariff wars and conflicts in the Middle East failing to provoke sharp price swings. \u201cIf you see the world went through a storm, Bitcoin was still chilling,\u201d he said, underscoring the asset\u2019s maturing market dynamics.\nPrice outlook\nWhen asked where Bitcoin tops in the current cycle, Bharwani offered a short-term target of about $150,000 to $160,000. \u201cI don\u2019t think the market cap will move three or four times in this year,\u201d he noted, though he acknowledged higher moves over a longer horizon.\nLooking further ahead, he forecast that by the 2032 halving cycle \u2014 \u201ctwo cycles away\u201d \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization could reach $9 trillion to $10 trillion, implying a price of roughly $600,000 to $700,000.\nLong-term holders know that protecting coins through each cycle\u2019s volatility is essential. Hardware wallets like Ledger offer security and offline custody for investors committed to holding Bitcoin through every market cycle.\n\u201cThat is conservative,\u201d he said, contrasting his view with more bullish predictions of $2 million or $3 million.\n\u2018Never selling\u2019 investor outlines ambitious Bitcoin price targets first appeared on TheStreet on Jul 1, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jul 1, 2025, where it first appeared."

      "text": "What is a cold wallet? Ledger Stax review originally appeared on TheStreet.\nCold wallets have revolutionized crypto security by keeping your private keys offline and away from hackers. They\u2019re the digital equivalent of a safe deposit box, robust, reliable, and designed for peace of mind.\nToday, we\u2019re exploring Ledger\u2019s latest innovation in this space: the Ledger Stax, a sleek, magnetized, curved e-ink powerhouse that takes your crypto protection to the next level.\nDesigned in collaboration with Tony Fadell, the inventor of the iPod, it features a first-of-its-kind 3.7-inch curved e-ink touchscreen that wraps around the edge, combining aesthetic elegance with high-contrast readability and ultra-low power consumption.\nThis isn\u2019t just a cosmetic upgrade. The e-ink display allows you to scroll through transactions and addresses with minimal battery drain, giving you up to ten hours of active use on a single charge and weeks on standby.\nWhat is a cold wallet?\nBefore diving further into the device, let\u2019s start by understanding hardware wallets. Hardware wallets are a form of cold storage, keeping your private keys offline and safe from online threats. In contrast, hot wallets, like mobile apps or web services, are always connected and vulnerable to hacks, phishing, and malware.\nA device like the Ledger Stax uses a secure element to store and sign transactions internally, so even if it\u2019s plugged into an infected computer, your keys never leave the protected chip.\nUnboxing\nOpening the box, you\u2019ll find the Ledger Stax device itself, a magnetic protective shell, three recovery phrase sheets, a quick-start guide, and a USB-C to USB-C cable.\nPowering on the Stax reveals the Ledger logo, and provides an overview of the basic functions of the device. As an extra touch, you can personalize your Stax by assigning it a name like \u2018Home Stax,\u2019 \u2018Travel Stax,\u2019 or whatever helps you differentiate multiple wallets.\nThe device then prompts you to choose a PIN between four and eight digits. This PIN guards against unauthorized use: after three incorrect attempts, the device wipes itself to thwart brute-force attacks.\nRight after the pin selection, you can choose how you\u2019d like to set up your Ledger Stax. You can either restore a previous wallet or start a new one. Now comes the most critical step: generating your 24-word secret recovery phrase. These words are the only backup of your private keys.\nWrite each word in the exact order on the provided sheets, store them offline in separate secure locations, never photograph or copy them digitally, and never share them with anyone. Anyone with your phrase can take your funds."

She added:\n\u201cWhat seems to be a problem only for Bitcoin OGs is not really the case. We have seen cases of kidnappings for as little as $6,000 worth of crypto, and we have seen people murdered for $50,000 in crypto.\u201d\nThe rise in wrench attacks against crypto holders is a disturbing trend, with physical attacks against Bitcoiners in 2025 on track to double the worst year on record, prompting personal safety countermeasures from investors, developers, and industry executives.\nRelated: Wrench attacks drive crypto investors to centralized custodians\nCentralized data leaks magnify the wrench attack threat\nData leaks from centralized crypto exchanges, which collect sensitive user information under Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, and other centralized software providers who collect client data, allow violent criminals to target crypto holders and their families.\n\u201cWe currently have more than 80 million Bitcoiner and crypto user identities leaked online; 2.2 million out of those contain home addresses,\u201d Vranova said.\nThese attacks are correlated with Bitcoin prices, and the frequency of the attacks rises during bull markets, she added.\nIn May, crypto exchange Coinbase disclosed a data breach that leaked the information of a small subset of Coinbase customers, which included home addresses and other identifying information.\nIn June, a report from Cybernews uncovered databases containing more than 16 billion leaked user login credentials from platforms like Apple, Facebook, and Google.\nThe password leak negatively impacts crypto holders, who will now be subject to increased phishing, social engineering, hacking, identity theft, and other types of targeted scams designed to steal user data and funds.\nMagazine: Bitcoiner sex trap extortion?
