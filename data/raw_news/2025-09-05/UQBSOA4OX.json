  "title": "Lifesum App Review: Tracks Calories and Nutrients Without the Stress or Shame",
  "description": "There are a lot of good reasons to track your food intake, but too many apps turn it into something scary and negative. Lifesum makes things more positive.",
  "content": "Lifesum helps you track food intake without making you feel bad.\n\nWe may earn a commission from links on this page. Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication.\n\nLifesum is my favorite calorie- and nutrient-tracking app because it doesn't stress me out. It actually feels positive to use, which keeps me coming back to it.\n\nIt took me years to realize how unhealthy that was, so I became very dubious of all food-monitoring apps. Last year, a friend I respect posted a screenshot of something that looked like a nutrient-tracker, but didn't have any red text or otherwise intimidating graphics. Rather, it was all pastel rainbows and it showed how much protein, fiber, and calories she'd consumed that day. She told me it was called Lifesum , that it had helped her relationship with food, and that she recommended it fully. A little distrustfully, I downloaded it, vowing to delete it the moment it made me feel bad about myself, but it never did. Instead, I've been a faithful user ever since.\n\nI downloaded my first calorie-tracking app when I was 20 years old and it came with features that did unquantifiable damage to my psyche, like the ability to predict what I would weigh in five weeks if I ate a certain amount of calories every day. It did not track protein or other nutrients and any day I went over my relatively arbitrary calorie allotment, all the numbers on the screen turned red, shaming me into doing \"better\" the next day or putting on my sneakers for a late-night run that could help me get the numbers back to green before bed.\n\nI am a Millennial woman who grew up in the glossy magazine and reality television era, so I've been besieged by the insidious messaging of diet culture my entire life. I'm no stranger to fad diets, spending way too much time on cardio, or crying in the fitting room of a department store\u2014nor am I a stranger to calorie-counting apps, which have always seemed to make all of those other things much worse.\n\nLifesum, available on iOS and Android, tracks the food you eat, the calories you burn, and even the water you drink on an average day. Some of this, like your calorie expenditure, can be inputted automatically by your phone. I synced my Apple Watch to it when I downloaded it so all the workouts, walking, and daily activities picked up by Apple Health are reflected instantly in Lifesum. It's your responsibility to input your food and water, but the app makes all of that easy, which we'll get to.\n\nUnlike other apps I've tested out, Lifesum doesn't just take a little bit of information about your height and weight, then spit out an arbitrary calorie goal for you to stick to. Instead, you take a \"Life quiz,\" which asks how often you eat certain things like vegetables and seafood, then indicate your goals, whether they're related to weight loss, muscle building, or something else. The quiz is thorough and can be retaken whenever you want so you can compare your resulting \"Life score\" over time. From there, the app helps you build out custom goals that include how many calories you'd like to consume per day, how much fiber, and how much protein.\n\nWhen you input a food that is in line with your goals, it shows you a little smiley face. It's pretty quaint. A food that isn't aligned as well with your goals will result in a neutral face or even a frowny one, but it's not that off-putting to me. It's still kind of cute, if anything, and the app also produces text telling you to, say, try to get in more fiber on your next meal.\n\nThere's real value in Lifesum's data. You can tap See Stats from the Diary tab at any time to see an overview of how you're doing not just on a given day, but that week in terms of meeting your dietary goals. On the bottom of the screen, you can tap Progress to see more details, as well as suggestions for how you could be doing better for the week. Because mine is linked to my Apple Watch, even things like how long and how well I sleep are factored into the overall Life Score I get every week. Right now, my salt, alcohol, and refined grain intake are optimal, my sugar and saturated fat intake are good, my unsaturated fat, protein, and veggie intake are imbalanced, and I'm \"off-track\" with processed food and fruit. Altogether, my sleep, exercise, and food intake have combined to give me a Life Score of 70 out of 150. I'm having an off week, for sure, so seeing it laid out like this\u2014again, in pastel colors and with no shaming\u2014is actually pretty helpful.\n\nHow Lifesum does that\n\nTracking intake with Lifesum is really easy. I have a widget on my phone's home screen that lets me quickly add in any time I drink water, for instance. To input food information, you start by tapping the + in the middle of the bottom-row menu on the app. Then, you get multiple options: Barcode, Quick Track, Image, Text, and Voice.\n\nBarcode is the easiest to use and the input method I'm most familiar with from other apps, plus it seems to be the most accurate. You just use your phone's camera to scan the barcode of whatever you ate, adjust the serving size, and track it. Quick Track shows your most commonly consumed foods so you can just reenter them every time you eat them. Image, Text, and Voice, on the other hand, rely on Lifesum's AI and are a little less accurate. You can type out or say what you ate and the app will estimate the nutritional value of it, or you can snap a photo and it'll do the same thing.\n\nObviously, you shouldn't expect Lifesum to get these completely correct, but I don't really mind that. I don't want to know my calories or even my grams of protein down to the exact number; that just creates an unhealthy thought process for me. Rather, I like to know the general neighborhood my numbers are in. Getting too granular with it can be demoralizing, to say nothing of how damaging it can be if you're not careful. Last night, I snapped a pic of my supper\u2014salmon, rice, greens, sweet potato, and corn\u2014and didn't fuss much about whether the app got every calculation correct. How could it when it didn't know the portions or how the foods were prepared? It recognized I ate starches, veggies, and seafood, and that was enough for me.\n\nI've also noticed the search function can be a little wonky. Say, for instance, I eat a David protein bar. I'll type in, \"David cake batter bar,\" but that'll only work sometimes. The AI gets a little free-wheeling with its Internet-searching. Sometimes, it thinks I ate a slice of cake. Other times, it identifies the David brand but there's a big discrepancy between the nutrients on the label and the ones the app tries to enter into my food diary. I'm just careful to double-check and keep going about my day.\n\nI enjoy tracking my health data and have been getting more and more fastidious about my exercise and nutrition, so this app fits into my daily routine really well. It's very simple to navigate and I never feel like I'm spending way too much time searching for foods. I love that I can change my goals at any time, that it takes so much more than calories into account, and that it never shames me for missing a day or going over a calorie or fat goal. I have used so many of its competitors and been left feeling bad about myself, which doesn't really motivate me to stick with my goals. This one does.\n\nFor me, the price is also right. It's $99.99 per year, $29.99 every three months, or $7.49 per month. I choose the quarterly option and have renewed happily every time my three months is up. You can access the food tracking for free, but if you want recipes, meal plans, detailed macro tracking, and integration with your phone's Health app, you'll need to pay.",

      "text": "I use apps for everything from obtaining free stuff to earning extra income. I also use them for some extra help on the health and fitness journey I've been undertaking for the last year and a half. I was always active\u2014I teach spin classes, consistently ride my Peloton, and have always frequented the gym\u2014but something really took hold of me at the end of 2023 and made me want to get, like, super active. Naturally, I downloaded all the apps I thought could help me as I set out to keep track of my protein intake, devise the perfect schedule of workout splits, and monitor all my biodata. Here are the ones I liked best.\nFor cardio: the Peloton app\nYou don't need a Peloton Bike, Tread, or Row to enjoy the benefits of the Peloton app, which I've written about before. For about $24 per month, you can access cycling, rowing, and running classes that work just fine on non-Peloton equipment, plus walking, yoga, stretching, and even meditation classes. I follow along with these all the time, like when I'm walking outside, running on a treadmill at the gym, or just sitting in my living room, since the app works not only on my iPhone, but on my Roku, too.\nI like this app a lot better than having to always come up with my own cardio routine or following the advice of a random fitness influencer\u2014the variety is massive and the instructors are so professional. With the big-name brand comes expertise and some assurance that you're actually getting useful, efficient, and safe instruction. The instructors' cues are always clear and direct, new classes get uploaded every day, and I feel like I get a lot more out of this than I would if I just hopped on a rowing machine and worked out based on my own mood.\nIf you're not into the Peloton app or you want to shop around, there is another I recommend but don't personally use frequently: Les Mills+. It provides cardio and strength classes with straightforward instruction and plenty of beats, plus it contains quality educational material that can help you understand what you're doing on your fitness journey. Check out my full review and my breakdown of how it differs from Peloton.\nFor strength training: Strong\nPeloton also has a Strength+ app that I enjoy, but if I had to choose between that or Strong as my preferred weight-lifting helper, I'd go with Strong. Available on iOS and Android, the app relatively bare-bones, which is why I like it. It keeps track of my lifts, allowing me to enter the exercise I'm doing, the weight I'm using, how many sets and reps I'm doing, and whether or not I do a drop set or train to failure. It then keeps track of all that information so the next time I go to do, say, a lat pulldown, Strong tells me how many reps and sets I did last time and what weight I used.\nI used to keep track of this information in a note on my phone, then move it into a spreadsheet when I got home. This was unbelievably ineffective. Strong keeps track of the frequency of my workouts, links to my Apple Health seamlessly (which is a benefit I also appreciate from the Peloton app), and comes with extra features I don't even use, like a tab to jot down the circumference of various body parts as they ideally grow and change. I happily pay $29.99 per year to unlock unlimited custom routines, but you can use the free version if all you want is to mark down a few details about your workouts.\nFor nutrition: Lifesum\nI am a Millennial woman and, as such, have put in my time in the MyFitnessPal trenches for well over a decade. That app has had its claws in my generation for far too long and a few months ago, I finally broke free when I switched over to Lifesum. It was like a totally different world.\nMFP has had and still has a lot of features that nutrition pros and eating disorder advocates worry are a little dangerous, like a pop-up notification that tells you what you'd weigh in five weeks if you consistently ate the same amount of calories you ate that day and numbers that turn red when you've exceeded your calorie goal for the day. Lifesum, on iOS and Android, is much gentler and is focused more on whole nutrition than calories. When I exceed my calorie goal for the day, there is no red number making me feel bad; the pastel rainbow background is as soothing and encouraging as it is on a day I eat at my goal. If I input a food that is, say, high in fat or calories, though, the app does show me a frowny emoji. If I input something nutritious, I am rewarded with a smiley face. These are much less intimidating than red numbers and they still keep me on track just fine.\nWhen you sign up for Lifesum, you take a quiz to get a \"life score\" and it asks you about how much you tend to eat from different categories, like seafood and fruit. You set macronutrient goals, activity goals, and calorie goals, but the app isn't pushy if you don't meet them on a given day. You are not rewarded for maintaining a \"streak.\" The whole thing is so pleasant that it actually encourages me to use it, which is hardly a difficult chore because Lifesum gives you plenty of options for use: I have a widget on my home screen that lets me input water intake and track my macros without opening the app, I can use my camera lens as a barcode scanner or to snap a pic of my meal and let the app estimate the calories, or I can type what I ate into an AI chatbox and allow it to estimate my calories and nutrients based off that. These are not perfect calculations, of course, and it only works well if you're super specific in your descriptions, but it's almost freeing to not be bound by extreme strictness. My Apple Health data, including my workouts and my weight, is entered in for me and Lifesum adjusts my recommended intakes based on that information and the goals I set. It's $99.99 per year, $29.99 every three months, or $7.49 per month.\nOther phone-based fitness considerations\nI like to let my phone and other devices do a lot of work for me when I can, so I'm constantly wearing my Apple Watch, which delivers data on how much I'm walking, standing, moving, sleeping, and generally exerting straight to my Apple Health app, which in turn spreads that information over to Lifesum and my other apps. All the apps listed here connect seamlessly with my Apple Health app, which is important to me; I want everything in one place and all of it working together in sync.\nI also use a smart scale to weigh myself and that, too, delivers information for Apple Health to spread around. You can absolutely get too into monitoring your own progress and fitness, so I recommend only getting these sorts of devices if you can exercise some reasonable caution. But overall, the ability to track and access data without doing too much work is really helpful. This is the scale I use, and I love it:\nAfter I weigh myself, that weight is recorded in Apple Health and distributed to the other apps, making it easier for Peloton to make accurate estimates of my burned calories based on my weight, easier for Lifesum to make estimates of my nutritional needs based on it, etc.\nAll of this said, you don't want to spend too much time fiddling with your phone\u2014especially during mealtime or when you're at the gym. The apps above are not time-suckers; Lifesum, especially, works quickly thanks to its barcode scanner and picture-assessing capabilities.\nStill, don't get so wrapped up in tracking and planning that you neglect the actual eating or exercising. If you're spending a little too much time poring over your nutrition app or scrolling fitness influencers' pages without actually replicating the exercises they're showing you, check out the Steppin app, which works with your phone's pedometer and blocks pre-determined apps, only letting you access them if you are willing to trade time you earned by walking."

      "text": "A little over a month ago, I got back into a familiar routine, one I\u2019ve drifted in and out of for well over a decade: I started hyperfocusing on my health \u201cdata,\u201d tracking workouts and rest on an Apple Watch, calories in and out on an app, and my weight and body composition on a smart scale. I\u2019ve relished in doing this sort of thing, off and on, for my entire adult life, because it gives me a sense of insight and control\u2014but this time, I wondered if spending all day, every day thinking about my \u201chealth\u201d was really that, well, healthy.\nHere\u2019s what I learned after another month in the data trenches and a few chats with experts.\nTracking workouts: pros and cons\nWhat I use: Apple Watch Series 8 ($299.99)\nThe primary function I use my new Apple Watch for is tracking my workouts. I teach cycling, so I have good reason to wonder how effective my classes really are, since other people are paying to come to them. Outside of that, I also just want to know, realistically, how much I\u2019m really accomplishing when I spend an hour on the elliptical machine, half-assedly moving my feet while delighting in my 14th Gossip Girl rewatch.\nThis has been my most beneficial tracking endeavor by far, because while we know that the calories-burned data can be a little sketchy, it still helps me visualize (very roughly) how much energy I\u2019ve expended and when I am likely to use up the most. I do my best when I\u2019m gamifying the mundane parts of my life, so \u201cclosing my rings\u201d\u2014that is, meeting my activity, exercise, and standing goals for the day and seeing that reflected in a little badge on my watch\u2014motivates me a lot. Whether I\u2019m actually torching 400 calories on the stationary bike, as my watch claims, is immaterial because without the prospect of failing to close my rings to push me on a night when I'm feeling tired, I might not be doing it at all.\nTeddy Savage, Lead National Trainer for Planet Fitness, agrees that wearables or workout-tracking apps \u201cadd tremendous value to any fitness journey.\u201d He says that in addition to tracking things like your heart rate or calories burned, using these can enhance personal accountability and help you monitor progress and celebrate milestones\u2014plus set manageable goals that keep you connected to your \u201cwhy.\u201d That\u2019s certainly been true for me. After about a week of tracking my workouts and daily activity, I noticed I could easily do more, so I increased my daily movement and exercise goals, making the rings harder to close.\nThere are some downsides, however. As Savage says, \u201cSometimes over-analyzing can lead to running in quicksand because you start chasing the numbers instead of the tangible benefits you can \u2018feel\u2019 that are the most impactful reasons for moving your body. Plotting a pathway forward by tracking your progress can be a great thing as long as you don\u2019t lose your way focusing too much on the numbers and not enough on your mojo.\u201d There, I\u2019m guilty, too: When I\u2019m gamifying my activity, I\u2019m in it for the reward of closing the rings and getting little \u201cawards\u201d from my apps. To do those things, yes, I have to engage in healthy activity, but that\u2019s not really my goal when I\u2019m doing it. The healthy stuff is a means to an end and the end is making my numbers go up, up, up.\nTracking calories: pros and cons\nWhat I use: MyFitnessPal (free, with in-app purchases)\nI\u2019ve recommended MyFitnessPal before because of its ease of use in tracking how many calories (or, if you pay for the upgraded version, various macros and nutrients) you\u2019re eating every day. I first downloaded it in 2012, the first time I went on a \u201cfitness journey,\u201d but in retrospect, I was really on a myopic \u201cweight loss journey\u201d and didn\u2019t care much about my overall health nearly as much as I cared about my overall look. I was diligent about my food entry to the point where I vividly recall a friend getting upset with me for logging my consumption of a single saltine cracker\u2014and that should be evidence enough of the two main issues with this sort of data tracking: First, it only works if you actually log every morsel you consume, but second, it\u2019s easy to get carried away and start a deeply unhealthy relationship to food.\nLaura Silver, a Brooklyn-based nutritionist who often works with people who fall into that second category, says that while research shows that tracking this way can lead to better eating habits and more accountability, it\u2019s not ideal for much else. At the very least, it\u2019s damn near impossible to determine if the food you\u2019re logging really matches up with the nutrients in the app. Consider all the different sizes, cuts, and preparation styles for the humble chicken breast. Even if you weigh yours and account for whatever you cooked it in, you can\u2019t be sure the calories and nutrients you really consumed are reflected in the amount the app claims you ate. At worst, you can start obsessing\u2014which doesn\u2019t leave much room for a healthy relationship with food, nor an understanding of how your body works. As Silver points out, if you allot yourself 2,000 calories per day on the app, you\u2019re operating on the incorrect assumption your body \u201cresets\u201d at midnight, requiring another 2,000 calories from 12 a.m. to 12 a.m. Consider that anything, from whether you\u2019re menstruating to fighting a cold, can impact how many you really need, and it\u2019s not as linear as the 24-hour app cycle makes it seem at all. When you restrict too much, she adds, your body starts adjusting, learning to function with that lower amount of calories, and your weight loss will stop. If you\u2019ve hit \u201cobsessive\u201d with your tracking, you can dig yourself in deeper after that.\nUltimately, she advises that \u201cwe\u2019re not machines.\u201d Bodies aren\u2019t as easy to define in numbers and absolutes as apps make it seem. I\u2019d be launching stones out of a glass house if I told you to avoid food tracking with an app altogether, but at least consider why you want to do it before you start. If you want to take careful notes about when you tend to consume certain types and amounts of food, make better eating choices, and visualize your habits, these apps are good, science-backed tools. For anything else, though, consider chatting with an expert, whether it\u2019s a nutritionist like Silver or a trainer like Savage, to determine your body\u2019s unique needs and how consciously monitoring your eating can help (or hinder) your personal goals. Silver, for instance, is a proponent of intuitive eating, not obsessive tracking.\nAs for me, after another month of dedicated MFP inputs, I think I\u2019m going to call this one off. I felt the urge this week to log a single Ferrero-Rocher candy after I ate it, which momentarily zapped the fun out of my Christmas revelry. The whole point of keeping track of data is to better yourself; marking down the consumption of a 72-calorie chocolate confection might be a way to stay on top of my nutrients, but it\u2019s not a way to stay happy\u2014so it\u2019s not really a path to true betterment at all.\nTracking weight: Pros and cons\nWhat I use: iHealth Nexus Smart Scale ($39.99)\nMy relationship with this device is contentious. On the day I unboxed it, I jumped on it, eager to glean insight into not only my weight, but BMI, body fat percentage, bodily water percentage, muscle mass, and bone mass\u2014plus have that information immediately entered into my Apple Health and various other tracking apps, with which the scale syncs easily. I reminded myself that BMIs are a poor measure of health overall and that research has shown that for all the hype, these things aren\u2019t always very accurate when measuring body composition. Nevertheless, I was demoralized by my results across all seven measurements. To be clear, the data I got on the first night put me in a funk, which is not really conducive to betterment. Silver cautions against calorie tracking apps because it's easy to stop using them when the first burst of determination wears off or you start feeling bad about something. The same can be said for the smart scale. After I stopped moping, I vowed to show the scale who's boss and work hard for better results on future readings. That sort of thinking is unsustainable; it's much better to have measured, long-term goals that are in favor of your own betterment, not the besting of a machine or the achievement of hitting a certain number.\nIn the weeks that I\u2019ve been using it, I\u2019ve stopped paying attention to the body composition stats at all, aware that they\u2019re likely garbage and just another number to get hung up on. That definitely reduces most of the utility of the device, but not all of it. I\u2019ve also started resisting the urge to weigh myself constantly, knowing that weight fluctuates through the day based on a number of factors. Now, I do it once in the morning, and here\u2019s where the only real benefit of a smart scale kicks in: In addition to sharing my data with the apps I granted permission to, it makes a little chart for me to monitor my weight changes over time. I\u2019m a visual person, so I really like that. Day to day, little changes, but over the course of a week or month, the dip or upward turn of a line is more meaningful. If anything, the smart scale reminds me that changing and becoming healthier are long-term events made up of little habit tweaks. It took me weeks to land on that sort of motivational outlook after my disastrous first night with the machine, so if you\u2019re going to start tracking your weight (or other metrics) like this, keep it in mind.\nThat\u2019s what Savage says, too: \u201cSmart scales allow you to put all the puzzle pieces together to get a clearer vision of the bigger picture when it comes to weight management.\u201d\nA month of data tracking in review\nAfter four solid weeks attached to my devices and routines, the following definitely happened:\nI paid more attention to the nutritional value of my food.\nI lost a little weight.\nI was more consistent with visits to the gym or rides on the Peloton.\nI tricked myself into walking more and taking the bus less.\nI got a little too into the numbers game and had to remind myself to chill out.\nI recommend data tracking if you\u2019re looking to visualize your habits and behaviors, then make meaningful change based on your new insights, but not if you\u2019re someone who can easily get wrapped up in minutiae, obsessions, or the quick dopamine hit of reaching a daily goal with no concern for longer-term progress. Frankly, these things make it too easy to get carried away if you\u2019re not careful. I\u2019m sticking with my watch and my scale (though ignoring a vast chunk of what the scale claims to reveal about me), but probably uninstalling MyFitnessPal. If you plan to incorporate any tracking software or hardware of your own, consider keeping a journal with it, too, and tracking how you feel after a workout, after dinner, and after using the devices. Keep data of your data! And if you\u2019re feeling negative about any of it, reassess and consider offloading whatever isn\u2019t making you feel good. Gaining more awareness about your body and habits is cool, but feeling like you have to write down everything you consume or get to the gym on a day when you just have no time is not.\n\u201cFitness is all about making the experience personalized and enjoyable,\u201d says Savage. \u201cThe more you can find out about yourself, the more you can create the most beneficial and holistic fitness routine for both your physical and mental health. When adding wearables and fitness apps into your routine and monitoring the data, its important to remind yourself that the numbers should only be seen as the breadcrumbs that lead you to the next step along your fitness journey and should never turn into the end-all-be-all of your efforts or successes.\u201d"
