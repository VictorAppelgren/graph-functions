  "title": "Jeremy Clarkson issues furious statement as he addresses 'moving abroad'",
  "description": "Former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has addressed reports that he is \"fleeing the UK\" with a furious statement",
  "content": "Jeremy Clarkson has furiously denied reports that he is \"moving abroad\" in a scathing Instagram statement. The former Top Gear presenter didn't hold back on social media and took a screenshot of a news report that said that the Clarkson's Farm star discussed \"moving abroad to flee the UK\" after his \"worst ever year\". The Who Wants To Be A Millionaire host denied the report and simply said: \"Utter horses***. I never said any such thing, you clickbait t***s.\" One of his followers joked in the comments section: \"Maybe it\u2019s abroad in Kaleb terms, so maybe Yorkshire?\" A second person also quipped: \"Ah yes, the man single-handedly fighting for the British farmer and keeping his local economy alive through sheer force of will is going to just give up.\" A third person also similarly echoed: \"I didn\u2019t think it sounded like you. Yes, times might be hard, but you\u2019ve done so much for farming, I couldn\u2019t begin to imagine you\u2019d bail!\"\n\nJeremy recently wrote in his latest column in The Times about how \"awful\" Britain is right now, but he insisted that people shouldn't leave. He listed several countries, such as Dubai, Portugal, and Denmark, but in the end, he concluded that citizens should remain in Britain to be with friends and family. He said: \"And that brings me right back to the beginning. If you move abroad, in three-and-a-half years you will be living in another country, and God knows what it will be like there then. Whereas if you stay here, in three-and-a-half years you\u2019ll be surrounded by your friends and family. And the horror of Starmer will have gone.\"\n\nClarkson has recently emerged as an unexpected champion for British farmers through his popular Prime Video show, Clarkson\u2019s Farm, which is now filming its fifth season. Last year, he went to Westminster, along with thousands of farmers, to protest the government's upcoming changes to how agricultural property is taxed. Jeremy demanded the Labour Party \"back down\" for fear of the so-called \"tractor tax\" - a proposed 20 per cent tax increase on inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31 million - being \"the end\" for farmers. When quizzed on how bad the policy could be for farmers, he said: \"It's the end.\"",
