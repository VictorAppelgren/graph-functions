  "title": "Meghan Markle could see sales rise by giving Kardashians wine, says expert",
  "description": "An expert believes that the duchess could see wine sales increase after the Kardashians received some As Ever wine and shared it on Instagram.",
  "content": "Meghan Markle could see her As Ever wine sales increase after sending some to members of the Kardashian family, an expert has said. The Duchess of Sussex, 44, restocked her As Ever Napa Valley Ros\u00e9 wine last week, much to the delight of her fans. This was also much to the delight of Kris Jenner, who posted on her Instagram that she had received some As Ever wine from Meghan. Another Kardashian to get their hands on the goods was Khloe\u0301 Kardashian, Kris\u2019 daughter. With the famous Kardashian family being well-known globally, one expert believes that Meghan could see sales increase as a result of the celebrities having her As Ever wine.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, brand and culture expert Nick Ede said that Meghan has used the \u201coldest trick in the book\u201d. He said: \u201cIt looks like the Kardashian clan have all received wine from Meghan, as Kris Jenner posted today on her Instagram stories. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the world\u2019s second most famous family supporting Meghan and her brand, for her it's great to see the Kardashians are supporting their Montecito neighbour and with their power and influence we should see sales of the wine continue to rise. \u201cIt\u2019s the oldest trick in the book to gift celebrities and friends your products in the hope that they will post or repost. To have the seal of approval from Kris, who loves a rose, is great for the AS EVER brand as a whole and could be a sign of things to come.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThis association is another positive step in the evolution of Meghan to become a celebrity influencer who can drive sales and maximise on her relationships to build her business.\u201d Meghan\u2019s latest restock of her As Ever wine has yet to sell out, leading to some believing that it is a sign of less success. However, Mr Ede previously told Express.co.uk that instead it is a \u201cgood thing\u201d as it suggests the brand has resolved its stock issues, with every other launch selling out in just hours. He said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing that the new wine drop hasn\u2019t sold out yet \u2013 it shows that they have solved the problem with stock issues \u2013 no one wants to come and buy something that\u2019s constantly sold out!\u201d",
