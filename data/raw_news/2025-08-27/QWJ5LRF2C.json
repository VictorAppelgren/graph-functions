  "description": "One of the simplest ways to improve your Kindle is by manually updating it.",
  "content": "I got my first Kindle earlier this year, and I've really been enjoying it. Although it's not perfect or as open a platform as I would like, it suits my needs, allowing me to conveniently read the books I want, anytime and anywhere, and comfortably thanks to its E Ink display. One thing I especially appreciate about Amazon's Kindle devices is how frequently they receive updates.\n\nEarlier this summer, Amazon released an update for its Kindle devices that added new spacing options, and recently, it released another update that introduced a new Assistive Reader feature, which reads your books aloud, and an accessibility feature that enlarges the font across the entire Kindle user interface to make it easier to see.\n\nWhile these updates are helpful, and I appreciate that Amazon is rolling them out, I've noticed my Kindle always takes a long time to actually receive them. When a Kindle update was released in June, my device took weeks to get it, even though it was always connected to the internet and fully charged. Even when I went to the software updates screen and tried to start the update, I saw a pop-up saying it was already up-to-date, even though I knew it wasn't, since others had received the update and it was listed on Amazon's website.\n\nTo fix this, I decided to learn how to manually update my Kindle. This means downloading the update directly from Amazon and starting the process myself, instead of waiting for it to happen automatically. To my surprise, the process was very simple, and it made my Kindle much easier to use.\n\nIf you're interested in learning how to update your Kindle yourself, it's a relatively easy process that doesn't require you to be a tech guru, and by doing so, you'll gain access to all the latest features on your Kindle.\n\nIt's important to note that Amazon officially supports this, so there are no hacks or tricks involved. The updates are officially available for download on Amazon's website, and Kindle devices are designed to allow users to safely update them themselves.\n\nTo get started, you'll need your Kindle, a computer, and a USB-C cable (the cable that came with your Kindle). Once you have all those assembled, here's what to do:\n\n1. On your computer (Mac or Windows works), visit Amazon's official website for Kindle updates, located here.\n\n2. Locate your Kindle under the listed devices on Amazon's site and download the latest update. For instance, I have an 11th-generation Kindle, so I downloaded the latest version for that model. Remember where you downloaded it to on your computer.\n\n3. Once you've downloaded the update file, connect your Kindle to your computer with a USB-C cable. When connected, your Kindle should appear as an external drive labeled \"Kindle.\"\n\n4. Drag and drop the update file you just downloaded into the \"Kindle\" drive.\n\n5. Once the file has transferred successfully to your Kindle, disconnect it from your computer. On my Kindle, I simply tapped Disconnect on the screen.\n\n6. On your Kindle home screen, tap the Menu icon (the three dots) and choose Settings.\n\n7. Then, tap the Menu icon again and choose Update Your Kindle.\n\nOnce you start installing the latest update on your Kindle, you'll see a progress bar appear on the display along with a message that indicates it's updating. When it's finished, your Kindle will restart, and you'll be able to enjoy the latest update.\n\nAt the time of writing, the latest update, version 5.18.4.0.1, introduces a new Assistive Reader feature that essentially turns supported Kindle books into audiobooks, with a generic AI voice reading them aloud that you can follow along with. If it's been a while since your Kindle was updated, there are also new options to customize how books appear, so if you want to adjust the amount of space between each character, word, and paragraph exactly to your liking, you can.\n\nNow that I know how to update my Kindle manually, I'll do this every time a new update is released instead of waiting forever for it to arrive automatically. I enjoy testing the latest features that enhance my Kindle, and manually updating it allows me to do that faster. Now, you can too.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Amazon is removing the 'Download & Transfer via USB' option for Kindle books starting Feb 26.\n- It's unclear if this change affects all Kindle models and all countries.\n- Kindle users can still read books on multiple devices, but can't download their Kindle books to a PC via USB, making it harder to backup Kindle books they've purchased.\nIf you have a Kindle e-reader and download the books you buy onto your PC, that process is about to become more complex.\nAccording to Kindle users on Reddit, Amazon is removing the ability to download and transfer Kindle books via USB. This means the only way to send Kindle books in the future will be over a Wi-Fi connection. It's currently unclear whether this affects just some Kindle models or all of them. The change will reportedly take effect on February 26.\nAmazon is sending out the following warning message to some users when they download a book: \"Starting February 26, 2025, the 'Download & Transfer via USB' option will no longer be available. You can still send Kindle books to your Wi-Fi enabled devices by selecting the 'Deliver or Remove from Device' option.\" You can check out the original Reddit thread below.\nAmazon Kindle (2024)\nAmazon's new entry-level Kindle weighs just 158g and comes packed with premium Kindle features, such as a 300ppi glare-free display, and a 25 percent brighter front light.\nThe Kindle-like smartphone you've been waiting for actually exists\nA new smartphone from the Minimal Company is shipping soon that has an E Ink display and a physical keyboard.\nWhat this means for Kindle devices\nIt's possible the change isn't worldwide\nIt's important to note that this update does not affect your ability to read your Kindle books on multiple devices. It just means you can't download a purchased Kindle book and transfer it to your PC via USB, making it harder for Kindle users to back up books they own onto their PC for safekeeping. However, this change may not happen everywhere yet.\nKindle users in the UK and Canada report on Reddit not seeing this message pop up when downloading a book, just US Kindle owners. It's possible this update could have a gradual rollout, but that\u2019s not certain. One Reddit user in the US who owns multiple Kindle devices says the message pops up before they select a device, leading them to believe the update isn't device-specific.\nIt's unclear why Amazon is doing this exactly. One possibility is that the company may be trying to lock down its Kindle ecosystem even more than it already is. However, there is a fix for that. Interestingly, the day the 'Download & Transfer via USB' option is reportedly no longer available on Kindles is the same day Amazon is holding a devices and services event in New York City, which could just be a coincidence.\nHow I jailbreak my Kindle to access thousands of books\nWith a little work you can set your own custom screensavers and even add new reading apps."

      "text": "Summary\n- Amazon's latest Kindle update offers new spacing options for paragraphs, words, and characters, enhancing readability on the device.\n- To access the new spacing options, update your Kindle to software version 5.18.3 or higher, then navigate to Font settings and choose Spacing.\n- Before this update, Amazon only had three line spacing options available. Now there are plenty.\nI bought my very first Kindle e-reader about five months ago, and so far, I've loved using it for reading. It's much less distracting than my iPad or phone, and since the Kindle store has a huge selection of books, I can easily find whatever I'm looking for. Additionally, as a Prime member, Amazon offers a free book each month through its First Reads program, which is a nice bonus.\nOf course, one of the highlight features of Amazon's Kindle series is its E Ink displays, which give the screen a paper-like look. This makes reading not only easier on your eyes, but the display is also much more visible in the daylight, allowing you to enjoy reading outside just as you would with a regular book. On an iPad, that isn't always easy, especially on bright summer days.\nAdditionally, I appreciate the many customization options available on my Kindle. You can choose between different themes, fonts, layout styles, and more to tailor your reading experience and make it more enjoyable for you.\nWith that in mind, recently, Amazon released an update for the Kindle that went largely unnoticed. The update, version 5.18.3, was made available for 11th and 12th generation Kindles, as well as the Kindle Colorsoft and Kindle Scribe, earlier this summer. In the update notes, Amazon only stated that it updated the Kindle with \"Performance improvements, bug fixes, and other general enhancements,\" omitting the fact that it also added some fantastic new spacing options that make reading on the device significantly easier. Here's how I've taken advantage of this new hidden setting, and how it can benefit you as well.\nAmazon Kindle (2024)\n- Storage\n- 16GB\n- Screen Size\n- 6-inch E Ink (300ppi)\n- Connections\n- USB-C\n- Battery\n- Up to 6 weeks\nAmazon's base-level Kindle ships with 16GB of storage, a 6-inch E Ink display, and a ruggedized exterior shell that can withstand the elements.\n- Size\n- 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32-inches\n- Weight\n- 5.56oz (157g)\nAmazon's latest Kindle update makes reading easier for everyone\nAmazon has added new spacing options for text and paragraphs with its latest Kindle software update.\nHow to use your Kindle's new spacing options\nYou'll find them under the Spacing tab in Font options\nBefore I explain how to use these new Kindle spacing settings, make sure your Kindle is updated and has this feature. It was added with the 5.18.3 software update in June, but the latest version is 5.18.4, released in July. To determine which version your Kindle is running, navigate to Settings > Device Options > Software Updates. When you select this, it will display your current version and update it if necessary. As long as it says 5.18.3 or higher, you're all set.\nThat said, prior to this new Kindle software update, there were only three line spacing options on the Kindle. Now, there is a plethora of options, and you can customize not only line spacing but also paragraph spacing, word spacing, and character spacing to various levels (as shown in the image above). So, if you prefer your words to be closer together or further apart, you can adjust that, and also fine-tune the character spacing to exactly how you like it.\nTo check out these new spacing options, follow these steps:\n1. Open a book on your Kindle.\n2. Tap the top of the screen to reveal the toolbar.\n3. In the toolbar, select the \"Aa\" option.\n4. Select Fonts from the options that appear.\n5. Then choose Spacing.\n6. You'll now see all the different spacing options available for you to choose from, including: Line spacing, Paragraph spacing, Word spacing, and Character spacing.\nEach space option has five different settings. The default, which is none, and then four levels to choose from. The higher the number, the more spaced out the option you've selected will be, with larger gaps. I recommend trying each setting until you find the one that works best for you. Luckily, you can preview how it looks in your book above the settings.\n...with the new Kindle spacing options, reading without my glasses is much easier...\nI've been using these new settings for about a month now, and they've had a really positive impact on my reading experience. I initially started wearing glasses for distance, but over time, my near vision also got worse, so now I struggle to see my tablet or iPhone up close without my glasses. Luckily, with the new Kindle spacing options, reading without my glasses is much easier, which is nice when I'm in bed and accidentally fall asleep while reading, something that happens quite often. Besides changing the spacing options on my Kindle, I've also slightly adjusted the font size, making the text larger, which helps a lot as well. If you've been struggling to read with the default spacing options on your Kindle, it's definitely worth giving these new settings a shot.\nIf you're looking for more Kindle insights, Pocket-lint recently covered the new Kindle Colorsoft and how many books you can actually store on your Kindle.

      "text": "Summary\n- Amazon's latest Kindle update adds two new handy features that make using its e-readers easier.\n- An Assistive Reader feature has been added, which reads your books aloud to you and highlights the text as it goes along.\n- A new larger font option has also been added under accessibility, which increases the size of user-interface elements, menus, and the Kindle Store.\nEarlier this summer, Amazon released a new update for its Kindle e-reader devices, adding features to make reading even easier. These include new options for spacing between characters, words, and paragraphs. Now, Amazon has dropped another update for its Kindle e-readers, introducing additional accessibility features.\nThe update, version 5.18.4.0.1, is now available for 11th and 12th-generation Kindle e-readers. In typical Amazon fashion, the release notes simply say, \"Performance improvements, bug fixes, and other general enhancements\" were included in the update, but they don't mention that two new features have been added: Assistive Reader and a larger font setting for the interface.\nThe new font option, found under Accessibility in settings, enlarges the font size for all elements and text on your Kindle e-reader. This includes the user interface, menus, and the Kindle Store (via Good E Reader). The only thing that remains unchanged is the font size while reading an e-book, likely because e-books have their own separate font setting, which you can adjust by tapping the \"Aa\" menu on the toolbar and selecting Fonts. For users with a vision impairment, this feature will be particularly helpful in making their Kindle easier to navigate.\nAmazon Kindle (2024)\n- Storage\n- 16GB\n- Screen Size\n- 6-inch E Ink (300ppi)\n- Connections\n- USB-C\n- Battery\n- Up to 6 weeks\nAmazon's base-level Kindle ships with 16GB of storage, a 6-inch E Ink display, and a ruggedized exterior shell that can withstand the elements.\nAmazon has reintroduced Assistive Reader to its Kindle devices\nAssistive Reader reads your e-books aloud and highlights the text as it goes\nThe second feature Amazon introduced with this update is called Assistive Reader, and it is actually the second time it has appeared on Kindle devices. According to Good E Reader, Amazon initially added this feature in July but removed it a few days later. Amazon did not officially explain why it made this change, but it is presumed to be due to bugs that needed to be fixed.\nThat said, with the latest Kindle update, it seems that the Assistive Reader is back, making reading on Kindle devices more accessible. What Assistive Reader does is read aloud your e-book to you, and while you're listening, the text being read to you is highlighted on your screen. The voice reading it is reportedly just an AI voice, so it's not as sophisticated as audiobooks, but it's still useful nonetheless.\nWith Assistive Reader enabled, you can play, pause, and control the speed of the narration, and rewind by 30 seconds if you miss something using the player controls at the bottom of the screen. If you open a navigation menu or stop to create notes or highlights, Assistive Reader automatically pauses and resumes where you left off when you finish.\nIt's worth noting you'll need Bluetooth headphones or earbuds connected to use Assistive Reader, as Kindle e-readers don't have speakers.\nTo use Assistive Reader, an e-book must support \"Enhanced Typesetting.\" To check if your e-book supports it, Amazon recommends visiting the Kindle Store, finding your book, and looking for \"Enhanced Typesetting: Enabled\" in its features list.\nIf your e-book supports Assistive Reader, you can turn it on in the reading settings menu. Simply tap the screen, select \"Aa\" at the top, then choose \"More,\" and enable Assistive Reader. It's worth noting you'll need Bluetooth headphones or earbuds connected to use Assistive Reader, as Kindle e-readers don't have speakers.\nAssistive Reader first debuted on the Kindle App for iOS last year, so it's great to see it now available on Kindle e-readers. To try out the new feature, you'll need the latest Kindle update, version 5.18.4.0.1. You can check for updates by navigating to Settings > Device options > Software updates on your Kindle, or by manually downloading and installing it."

      "text": "Summary\n- If you're a first-time Kindle user, there are lots of programs and features to check out, like Kindle Unlimited and the reading toolbar.\n- You can get a free monthly ebook through Amazon's First Reads program if you're a Prime member. The Send to Kindle Chrome extension is a great way to read news articles on your Kindle.\n- Check with your local library and see if they offer ebooks you can borrow to read on your Kindle.\nI recently took the plunge and finally got my first Kindle. I had been thinking about it for a long time, and one of the main driving forces behind my decision was to get back into reading. While I still love picking up and reading physical books, there's no denying that having an extensive collection of digital books at your fingertips is a game-changer for anyone looking to improve their reading habits.\nBefore I got my Kindle, I had read a lot about the devices and their functionality, so I already had a good idea of what I wanted to try. Since this is my first e-reader, when I booted it up for the first time, it was a blank slate, with no books or anything on it. Here are the five things I did to enhance my Kindle experience as a first-time user.\nAmazon Kindle (2024)\n- Storage\n- 16GB\n- Screen Size\n- 6-inch E Ink (300ppi)\n- Connections\n- USB-C\n- Size\n- 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32-inches\n- Weight\n- 5.56oz (157g)\n- Battery\n- Up to 6 weeks\nAmazon's base-level Kindle ships with 16GB of storage, a 6-inch E Ink display, and a ruggedized exterior shell that can withstand the elements.\nI found a great way to easily clean my Kindle\nKeep your Kindle looking brand new by cleaning it this way.\n5 Try Kindle Unlimited\nFirst-time users can get a free trial\nIf you've never tried Kindle Unlimited before, one of the first things I recommend doing when you get your Kindle is trying out the service. Amazon offers a one-month free trial for new users, and it's a great way to explore many of the titles you can read on your Kindle. Kindle Unlimited has over four million digital books, so there are lots to choose from.\nOne of the first ebooks I wanted to read on my Kindle was part of Kindle Unlimited, so I was able to start reading it without paying a dime by taking advantage of the free trial. It's important to note that with Kindle Unlimited, when you claim a book, it's the equivalent of borrowing it; you don't own it. So, if your subscription ends, you lose access to any of the books through it. Kindle Unlimited has a few other perks, such as a selection of popular magazines and audiobooks. Kindle Unlimited costs $12 a month, so if you try the free trial and decide you don't like it, remember to cancel it before it charges you at the end of it.\nThis new Color E-Paper tech lasts up to 200 days on a single charge\nSamsung is launching a new 32-inch Color E-Paper display panel, and it's a compelling and flexible product with several theoretical use cases.\n4 Open the reading toolbar\nChange the font size and layout of your ebooks\nOnce you choose the first book you want to read on your Kindle, I recommend exploring the settings menu to optimize your reading experience before you begin. After you open a book, tap the top of the screen to access the reading toolbar, which will then appear on your screen. Tapping the \"Aa\" icon allows you to adjust how the book appears on your screen. You can change the theme, font, layout, and more. By default, my font size was set to five, but I decreased it to four, which I found more preferable since it added more words to the page.\nAdjusting the layout enables you to change the book's orientation, alignment, margins, and spacing, but I kept all these settings at default because they appeared fine to me. You can always experiment with it to discover what you like. There is also a navigation option, which lets you jump to any chapter or section of the book. This is handy if you've already started reading a physical copy of a book and want to get to the same section on your Kindle.\nI touched grass and now space gray laptops make me sad\nIf this earthy hardware trend took off, I'd be thrilled.\n3 Check out Amazon's First Reads program\nPrime members get to choose a free ebook every month\nIf you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon's First Reads program is another excellent way to discover books to read on your Kindle. Every month, Amazon presents a fresh collection of curated ebooks through its First Reads program. Prime members can select one complimentary ebook and receive a bonus short read from this collection, which means you can enjoy two free ebooks each month.\nIf you're on the Kindle Store, you can find the books under \"This Month's First Read Picks\" on the homepage or visit Amazon's site on another device to view them. If you're not a Prime member, you can still look at the books, but it will cost you $2 to pick one out instead of being free. If you're a Prime member, this is a handy way to get a free ebook at the start of every month. If you've never subscribed to Prime, like Kindle Unlimited, a free trial should be available to check it out for faster shipping and free ebooks. Prime costs $15 per month or $139 annually.\nDon't miss out: April's free Kindle e-book for Prime members is here\nIt's now April, which means Amazon Prime members can claim their free Kindle e-book for the month.\n2 Try out Send to Kindle\nSend news articles to read on your Kindle\nIf you have files that you want to send to your Kindle, such as PDFs and images, you can do so on Amazon's website through the Send to Kindle page. If you use the Chrome web browser, Amazon also offers an extension called Send to Kindle for Google Chrome, which allows you to send news articles and blog posts to your Kindle device.\nOnce you download the extension from the Chrome Web Store, open it and log into your Amazon account, and you're ready to go. I recommend pinning the extension for easier access. Once you find something online that you want to read on your Kindle, click on the extension and select Preview and Send. It will analyze the website and show you a preview of how it will look on your Kindle. If you're satisfied with the preview, click send, and it will appear in your Kindle library for you to read. It's that simple.\nSo far, I've used it to send news stories that I want to read on my Kindle later in the day, and the extension does an excellent job of converting them into a readable format for Kindles.\nFree streaming is becoming a threat to Disney+, Netflix and Max\nPlus a new deal on Sling TV, The Last of Us gets a part 3 and more.\n1 Borrow library books for your Kindle\nYou can also search for free ebooks on the Kindle Store\nAnother great way to find more reading material for your Kindle is to check if your local library offers ebooks. Many libraries in the US have adapted to the changing times and have started providing a digital collection of ebooks for members to borrow. Some libraries utilize an app called Libby, which allows you to borrow available ebooks, audiobooks, magazines, and more from your local library for free.\nThe Libby app is available on both iOS and Android. You can inquire with your local library to find out which app they use and how to begin borrowing ebooks for your Kindle through them. If you want to find more free ebooks, an easy method to locate them is simply by searching for \"free books\" in the Kindle Store.\nThis new Amazon Kindle feature harnesses AI in an actually useful way\nAI-generated book recaps are on the way to an Amazon Kindle near you - I just hope the results prove accurate and dependable."

The latest update (5.18.4.0.1) adds Assistive Reader, which reads books aloud with highlighted text, and a larger font option for the interface, while earlier updates introduced expanded spacing controls for characters, words, and paragraphs. These accessibility improvements help users with visual impairments and those who prefer customized text layout.
