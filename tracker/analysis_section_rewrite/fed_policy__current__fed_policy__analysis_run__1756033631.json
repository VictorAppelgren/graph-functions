      "feedback": "Actionable upgrade: drop non‑essential politics chatter and anchor the 0–3 week view in a tight, three‑scenario framework (base, bull, bear) with explicit catalysts, thresholds and invalidation rules; ground every assertion to a causal chain: policy path signals → rate expectations → risk appetite → price action on rate‑sensitive names like Opendoor and Lucid. Improve rigor by citing a small, focused set of sources (K0WFSW29E for BOJ Jackson Hole dynamics and wage/ labour‑supply risks; H9WSBYP3D for Opendoor’s high‑beta momentum move; 5JQEA5Z1T for Lucid governance/news and valuation backdrop) and embed numbers after key claims (OPEN price ~$5.01, 52‑wk high ~$5.08; OPEN beta ~2.92; LCID price ~$2.03, 52‑wk high ~$4.43; LCID TTM revenue ~$929m, gross margin −$922m, net margin −329%, debt/ equity 53.2%, future growth forecasts from Simply Wall St). Spec the thresholds: open above OPEN’s $5.08 resistance with close above that level adds momentum risk, while a drop below ~$5.00 weakens the setup; for Lucid, a break of $2.50–$3.00 could trigger near‑term upside bets, but a drop under $2.00 risks a deeper pullback given profitability headwinds; tie these to explicit invalidations (e.g., hawkish Fed/BOJ surprises or a sharp deterioration in growth data) that would flip the scenario to bear. Add a concise monitoring grid: Jackson Hole commentary and any surprises on Fed/BoJ policy; wage/price data from US/Japan; near‑term rate‑cut pricing shifts; and updates on Lucid’s governance moves or reverse split headlines. Recast the narrative as: base case—data‑dependent risk‑on with rate‑cut prospects intact; upside—persistent dovish/synchronized policy signals and favorable financing conditions; downside—hawkish surprises or worsening fundamentals for OPEN/LCID catalyzing risk‑off. Ensure coherence by eliminating duplicative or speculative lines, tighten prose to scannable sentences, and place after‑statement citations immediately beside the corresponding data point. This will produce a world‑class, testable, numbers‑driven near‑term view.",
