  "title": "Theodore Friedman, Lawyer Who Triumphed Over Disbarment, Dies at 94",
  "description": "A zealous New York personal injury lawyer, he won many news-making cases before his professional fall. He was reinstated after 16 years.",
  "content": "The negligence lawyer Theodore H. Friedman in 1994, the year his license to practice was revoked after he was accused of professional misconduct. It was restored in 2010.\n\nA zealous New York personal injury lawyer, he won many news-making cases before his professional fall. He was reinstated after 16 years.\n\nTheodore H. Friedman, a high-flying negligence lawyer whose ferocious advocacy ground opponents down, and who was disbarred for unethical conduct \u2014 but who won back his law license 16 years later by advocating just as ferociously for himself \u2014 died on July 30 at his home in Inverness, Calif., north of San Francisco. He was 94. The cause was heart disease, said Benjamin Meyers, a law associate of Mr. Friedman\u2019s. Before his license to practice was revoked in 1994, Mr. Friedman was one of New York\u2019s most prominent personal injury lawyers in the 1970s and \u201980s. He was known for doggedly raising the same objections at trial after being overruled, for dressing down judges and opposing lawyers, and for reminding fellow officers of the court that he had a Harvard law degree and they did not. He once told Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, \u201cYou\u2019re either corrupt or ignorant, and it doesn\u2019t matter which.\u201d Mr. Friedman\u2019s aggressiveness won clients big payments, including $11 million for the family of the singer-songwriter Harry Chapin, who was killed in a car accident, and $854,000 for Virginia O\u2019Hare, whose plastic surgeon left her navel off-center during a tummy tuck.\n\n\u201cTeddy was born in the Bronx, and he never forgot it,\u201d William M. Kimball, a lawyer who lost several cases to Mr. Friedman, told The New York Times in 1994. \u201cHe had one of those aggressive inferiority complexes that propel people to considerable distances and considerable heights.\u201d The author Malcolm Gladwell interviewed Mr. Friedman for a 2008 book, \u201cOutliers,\u201d that looked at how some people achieve extraordinary success in life. Mr. Friedman\u2019s disbarment exposed an underside to his turn-it-to-11 style of lawyering. Accused of 23 counts of professional misconduct \u2014 including intentional dishonesty, filing a false affidavit and soliciting false testimony from a witness \u2014 he lost his law license after a special referee affirmed 14 of the charges. He was disbarred by the Appellate Division of the First Department, a state court that oversees civil and criminal appeals in Manhattan and the Bronx.\n\nHis disbarment was seen by some in the legal community as unfair, by others as a comeuppance for sleaze, and by still others as a cautionary tale about the limits of overzealous advocacy. In his defense, Mr. Friedman submitted 67 letters attesting to his good character from prominent jurists, including the chief judge of New York\u2019s Court of Appeals, and from the journalists Calvin Trillin, Murray Kempton and Mr. Zion. The sheaf of letters, The Times reported at the time, portrayed Mr. Friedman and his wife, Eve Preminger, a judge on New York Surrogate\u2019s Court, \u201cas a lively, sought-after couple in social circles on the Upper West Side and Fire Island.\u201d Mr. Kempton, in a 1988 Newsday column, had hailed Mr. Friedman as an avenging angel for suing the city on behalf of wronged citizens, including a man who fell to his death in an elevator shaft of a city-owned building. \u201cLife in New York is a succession of officially tolerated outrages upon the unwary, and there is no one to punish those responsible except the negligence lawyer,\u201d Mr. Kempton thundered. In 1962, Mr. Friedman married Ms. Preminger, a niece of the movie director Otto Preminger, who had been one of the few women in her graduating class two years earlier at Columbia Law School. She died two weeks after her husband, on Aug. 12, after 63 years of marriage.\n\nIt was Mr. Friedman\u2019s suit against New York City in the case of the elevator death that compounded his own legal troubles. He was indicted by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office on a charge of attempting to bribe a witness in the case. A jury acquitted him in 1988, but his ethics came under the scrutiny of the disciplinary committee of the Manhattan appellate court. The committee folded a second case into its investigation. In that case, from 1982, Mr. Friedman had been accused of disobeying a federal judge\u2019s order not to give a document to the jury as it deliberated. The judge in that case, Pierre N. Leval, found that Mr. Friedman \u201csurreptitiously included\u201d the document for the jury anyway and lied about it in a sworn statement. Both ethics cases were investigated by the special state court referee, Donald J. Sullivan, who wrote that Mr. Friedman had become \u201cconsumed with the will to win at any price.\u201d Mr. Sullivan recommended that Mr. Friedman\u2019s law license be suspended for two years. But the five-judge Appellate Division overruled him, voting unanimously to disbar Mr. Friedman.\n\nTheodore Herzl Friedman was born on May 3, 1931, the younger of two children of Avram and Mary (Kerewsky) Friedman, both of whom were born in Ukraine. His mother was a garment worker, union organizer and member of the Communist Party. His father was a Zionist who moved to the British Mandate of Palestine and then immigrated to the United States to further his education. Ted, as he was known, graduated from the competitive Bronx High School of Science and in 1953 from the University of Michigan; he helped pay for college by working in auto factories. He received a law degree from Harvard in 1956. He is survived by two daughters, Sarah Solomon and Wendy Futterman, and five grandchildren. In addition to his home in Inverness, he had a residence in Manhattan. Mr. Friedman, who once belonged to a club for negligence lawyers who had won seven-figure verdicts, campaigned to regain his license and means of support with the same single-mindedness he had used in advocating on behalf of clients. He filed three petitions for reinstatement to the bar \u2014 in 1999, 2003 and 2006 \u2014 but the Appellate Division denied each one.",
