  "description": "Social-media users were amused by the unique keepsake left behind, with one saying, \"this tickles my brain in the best way.\"",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nA post about a surprising\u2014and crass\u2014gift left behind by a home's former resident has gone viral, capturing the attention of tens of thousands on Reddit.\n\nShared by user u/Avg_White_Guy on July 31, the image uploaded with the post shows what appears to be a small sticker in the shape of a hand with only the middle finger extended. The title of the post read: \"My wife and I bought a home last week. The previous owner left us a gift in the bathroom drawer.\" Since it was shared, the post has received over 29,000 upvotes.\n\nIn a later comment, the user said the sticker was discovered while settling into their new home. \"Randomly seeing this gave me quite the laugh,\" the user later added.\n\nIn a follow-up comment, the poster wrote: \"The previous owners in our house were actually quite nice. They left all the appliances, a child's play set in the backyard, and they even had two flower beds, full of growing vegetables and fruits.\"\n\nThe poster added that the families have something in common. \"Like us, they are another young couple with little kids. I saw it and it put a big grin on my face. F*** you too, Eddie. F*** you too.\"\n\nBuying a home has become an increasingly elusive goal for many Americans. According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, the United States is facing a housing crisis, intensified by high mortgage rates and an unprecedented surge in home prices across most of the country. In its 2024 report, the center found that millions of would-be homeowners have been \"priced out of the market by elevated home prices and interest rates.\" The price surge has affected 97 of the top 100 housing markets, with some of the steepest increases seen in the Northeast and Midwest regions. The report said: \"Nearly 20 million homeowners as of last measure in 2022 are cost burdened, spending more than 30 percent of income on housing and utilities. This includes 9 million who are severely burdened, spending more than 50 percent of household income on these costs.\" The affordability crisis is particularly difficult for younger families, who face rising living expenses and stagnant wage growth. Amid these pressures, even lighthearted moments\u2014like discovering a vulgar sticker in a bathroom drawer\u2014offer some comedic relief. The offbeat humor struck a chord online, and many Reddit users were amused by the gift left behind. U/thatcatqueen said, \"This tickles my brain in the best way,\" and u/Honeyalmondbagel posted: \"That's kinda sweet.\" U/boxxkicker wrote: \"Seems like some folks I'd share a beer with.\" U/CrabmasterJone commented, \"It's things like this in life that give me an audible laugh,\" and u/Herb_Alman agreed: \"It's the little things \u2026\" Newsweek has contacted the original poster for comment via the Reddit messaging system.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nHousing in about a dozen major metro areas is becoming more affordable as a boosted national inventory is being countered by increases in median home prices plus rising mortgage and interest rates.\nWhy It Matters\nHousing affordability has been a central concern for Americans as home prices and mortgage rates have surged in recent years.\nUnderstanding the shifts in housing affordability is crucial for both prospective homeowners and policymakers grappling with the persistent gap between median household income and the cost of homeownership. The nationwide trend remains challenging, with the typical buyer still needing to earn about $25,000 more than the median household to afford a median-priced home, according to Redfin's housing market analysis.\nWhat To Know\nNew data from real estate and brokerage firm Redfin released August 6 shows some signs of relief for 11 major U.S. metropolitan areas, many of them Sun Belt cities that previously saw rapid price growth during the pandemic.\nRedfin's analysis of Multiple Listing Service (MLS) data as of June 2025 showed that the annual income required to purchase a median-priced home fell year over year in 11 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas.\nThe largest drop was in Oakland, California, where the required income declined 4.6 percent to $244,073. Other cities with notable decreases include West Palm Beach, Florida (-3.7 percent); Jacksonville, Florida (-3.5 percent); San Diego (-3.2 percent); and Tampa, Florida (-2.1 percent).\nRounding out the list are Atlanta, Phoenix, St. Louis, Orlando, Sacramento, California, and Dallas, each with measurable improvements in affordability over the past year.\nThe trend in these metros was attributed to falling home prices\u2014largely a result of a pandemic-era building surge that increased housing supply.\nSimilar declines were observed in the other highlighted cities. Florida stood out, with four metros\u2014West Palm Beach, Jacksonville, Tampa, and Orlando\u2014making the list, a shift attributed to reduced prices amid higher insurance, HOA costs, and a rise in natural disasters impacting the market.\nDespite these improvements, affordability gaps persist. The typical U.S. homebuyer still needs to earn $112,131 per year to afford the median-priced home\u2014about $25,000 more than the median household earns.\nNationwide, an estimated 39 percent of household income goes to housing, above the 30 percent threshold considered affordable, but slightly down from 40.5 percent a year ago. About 34.6 percent of home listings are considered affordable to the typical household, a minor improvement compared to the previous year.\nConversely, some of America's most affordable metros faced increased difficulty, with the income needed to buy rising rapidly.\nDetroit saw a 9.9 percent increase, though at $57,432, it remains the lowest required income among major metros. Other Rust Belt cities such as Cleveland, Newark, Chicago and Pittsburgh also reported increases, as influxes of buyers drive up prices despite their historic affordability.\nFortune reported that Midwestern cities like Detroit and Cleveland still offer median home prices around half the national average, supporting migration from higher-cost coastal regions.\nHigh Rates, Little Ingenuity\nAndrew Lieb, a real estate litigator, told Newsweek via email that the two main issues on home affordability are mortgage rates and insurance costs.\n\"While mortgage rates are impacting everyone, insurance is very location specific,\" Lieb said. \"If you live by the water or have a second home, or even just your property is over 5,000 square feet, getting insurance is going to cost you astronomical numbers and require lots of upgrades just to bind the policy.\n\"However, as a real estate litigator, I can tell you that not having homeowners' insurance is going to cost you a heck of a lot more in legal fees and damages if someone is injured on your property\u2014so think twice before forgoing this important product.\"\nAndrew Ragusa, a real estate broker with Remi Realty in New York City and Long Island, told Newsweek via email that there are currently no affordability increases in his region.\n\"I have friends in Florida who are trying to sell their house right now and they're having a really hard time because there's so much inventory down there and prices are dropping,\" Ragusa said.\nPart of that is attributed to construction styles, with Ragusa saying homes in Florida \"are cookie-cutter standardized\" and that building designs lack \"uniqueness.\"\n\"That means if you won't take a low offer on yours, someone else will take the low offer on theirs\u2014and the houses are pretty much the same, especially in those developments,\" he said.\nWhat People Are Saying\nKatie Shook, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in Phoenix, in a statement: \"Buyers are battling affordability and they see a lot of listings sitting on the market, so they're asking for major concessions. We've been in a buyer's market for the past eight months. If your home isn't in 10/10 condition and priced at or below market value, it's going to linger on the market.\n\"A lot of sellers are offering $10,000-$15,000 to cover the buyer's closing costs to seal the deal. Some home features, like a landscaped backyard or pool, aren't getting the return they used to. Buyers are no longer willing to pay a premium for those things.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nWith home prices leveling off or declining in several major metros and inventories projected to rise, industry analysts expect affordability to improve modestly in more markets by the end of 2025.\nRedfin's data suggests national home prices could fall up to 1 percent by year-end, giving some would-be buyers an opportunity to reenter the market. However, real estate markets remain highly regional.\nAbout the writer\nNick Mordowanec is a Newsweek investigative reporter based in Michigan.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nAmericans agree that something needs to be done to fix the housing crisis. The median sales price for homes in the United States has increased more than 30 percent just since the pandemic. Millions of people are now priced out of the market.\nA central but overlooked feature of the housing crisis is that it is really a land crisis. Fixing the land problem\u2014from land shortages to excessive land use regulations and high prices\u2014in turn requires local policy reform.\nThe price of land has risen even more rapidly than housing, and now comprises about 40 percent of the share of property value. In a growing number of U.S. cities and metropolitan areas, land prices constitute more than half of property value, and in areas like San Jose and Los Angeles they make up around three-quarters of property value.\nOther important economic and social factors have also contributed to the housing malaise, such as a construction backlog, high interest rates, and pandemic-era moves and remote work. These broad trends have fostered global housing disruptions. Many countries in the developed world\u2014such as Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom\u2014are experiencing a housing shortage and rapid rise in prices akin to the United States.\nBut differences in the severity of the housing crisis across developed economies illustrate the importance of the politics\u2014and the prices\u2014surrounding land. Take the United Kingdom, which faces spiraling prices and a deficit of 4.3 million homes that is worst in the most dynamic and desirable areas. The UK has discretionary case-by-case urban planning rather than rule-based planning, which means that both urban planners as well as city councils can reject building plans. That gives city councils a political role in choosing winning and losing developments, and it encourages residents to lobby to protect their particular interests. As a result, most houses are getting built in the areas where circumventing these dynamics is easiest, such as far urban peripheries. And land prices continue to rise.\nThe Netherlands is also home to an unaffordable housing market. Like in the UK, local zoning laws are holding back building. Lengthy zoning procedures and strict environmental laws, advocated by longtime urban residents who held property before it became unaffordable, throttle new construction. Land politics have also gone national. A set of governments reformed laws to enable investors to snap up houses at a large scale and to provide mortgage tax relief, which in turn encouraged multiple home ownership.\nJapan has taken a different path. Property prices in Tokyo were the most expensive in the world 30 years ago. No more. Affordability has not come because of population decline. Although the country's population as a whole has leveled off, greater Tokyo's population increased by 4 million people over the last 30 years. Instead, urban zoning is simple. There are 12 zone types, each defined by a nuisance level they allow that ranges from residential to industrial. If the building type doesn't exceed the nuisance level, then anything can be built. That circumvents a lot of planning and permissions for individual sites and makes it far easier to increase housing density where there is the greatest demand.\nThe United States is more akin to the UK and the Netherlands in its land politics and policies than to Japan. Most locales, especially cities, have byzantine land regulations and zoning restrictions that make homebuilding slow and expensive. Some of these are rooted in politicized racial and demographic changes that existing property owners have tried to forestall through restrictive land use regulations that the Supreme Court allowed beginning in the 1920s. Strong property rights in real estate support the owners of property but they also serve to keep other people out. The problem with this inherently exclusionary aspect of ownership for the broader housing market arises when it encounters major population shifts, sympathetic local or national government, or both.\nCutting regulatory barriers to land use will take some of the politics out of land use. To encourage these reforms, state governments and the federal government should provide funding and incentives to cities and townships to undertake structural zoning reforms. That could in turn free up more land for building while reducing prices and stabilizing the housing market.\nMichael Albertus is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and an internationally renowned expert on land issues. He is the author of the book, Land Power: Who Has It, Who Doesn't, and How That Determines the Fate of Societies.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nTwo new homeowners have revealed how the unexpected handwritten note they received from the property's previous residents on moving day left them in tears.\nWhen Laura Rudd and her fianc\u00e9 bought their first home in June 2020, family and friends were so excited to celebrate the special occasion with sentimental gifts to help them decorate their new place. But as it turned out, it was something that the previous owners left behind for them that immediately captured their attention.\nIn a now-viral TikTok post (@laurajrudd), Rudd, 28 revealed that a handwritten letter was left on the kitchen counter, next to a celebratory bottle of wine. The heartfelt letter explained that the house in Lincolnshire, England, had been the previous owners' home \"since the mid-50s,\" and in that time it provided them with \"so much happiness and love, and sadly a little grief.\"\nFinding the letter was a moment that Rudd will never forget, telling Newsweek that she \"cried when [she] read it.\" Although they have since bought a new property and moved again, they kept the letter and it's gone with them to their new place.\nRudd said: \"We thought the note was so thoughtful, and of course we kept it. It was propped up with a bottle of prosecco when we entered the house. It was obvious that the family loved the home, and we knew that when we bought the property.\"\nA post featuring a picture of the letter warmed hearts on social media after being shared by Rudd, being viewed over 1.3 million times and gaining more than 93,000 likes in a matter of days. Alongside the image, a caption read: \"We loved that home very much, it was filled with our love too.\"\nIn the two years that Rudd and her fianc\u00e9 lived there, they spent ample time renovating the property, and they discovered countless more surprises from the previous owners.\nRead more: Compare the Best Home Improvement Loans\n\"We found many little pockets of love when renovating, such as a note under the wallpaper saying, 'I did this 18/12/65' and there were names carved into cement where they'd installed a door as a later date,\" Rudd continued.\n\"We actually told the new owners everything we knew about the house too. I hope the previous family would have been happy with the changes we made.\"\nRudd tried to connect with members of the family who lived there prior on social media, but sadly her searches came to no avail. But at least she will always have the letter they wrote for them before moving.\nThe social media response has been so unexpected, but Rudd has loved seeing how many people were moved by the handwritten letter. Among the 1,000 comments on the TikTok post, one person wrote: \"This brought a tear to my eye. The end of an era is someone else's new beginning. How truly wonderful. Wishing you all the best in your new home.\"\nAnother person responded: \"This made me cry! How lovely!\"\nWhile another comment reads: \"I think this is beautiful and a very lovely lesson about life that time doesn't stop, and possessions come and go, but memories last forever.
