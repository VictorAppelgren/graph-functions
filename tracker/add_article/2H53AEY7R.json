      "summary": "Hurricane Erin, a rapidly intensifying storm that reached Category 5 strength earlier this week, has skirted the U.S. East Coast, producing dangerous rip currents, rough surf, and coastal flooding—especially on North Carolina’s Outer Banks—while prompting beach closures and evacuation orders from New York to Maryland. Despite moving north‑northeast and likely weakening to a tropical storm by Sunday, Erin’s vast reach continues to pose marine hazards, with rip current risks expected to linger through the weekend. The National Hurricane Center notes the storm’s size and wind field are larger than 90% of similar Atlantic systems, and it remains a significant threat to coastal communities and maritime activities. The rapid intensification of Erin underscores the growing frequency of extreme Atlantic hurricanes linked to warming oceans, and forecasters warn that the storm will likely expand further as it heads into the open Atlantic. Overall, Erin’s passage has caused widespread beach closures, disrupted transportation, and highlighted the ongoing danger of rip currents and storm surge along the eastern seaboard.",
