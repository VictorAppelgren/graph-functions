  "title": "Justin Verlander Knows It Is An Uphill Climb To Reach 300-Win Club",
  "description": "San Francisco Giants right-hander Justin Verlander's pursuit of 300 career wins has stalled as his record is 1-8 this season.",
  "content": "Jason Verlander knows his climb to 300 career wins is getting steeper with each outing.\n\nThe milestone may be out of reach for the San Francisco Giants right-hander. His record is 1-8 with less than two months to go in the season, leaving the 42-year-old with 263 lifetime wins.\n\nVerlander would like to play three more seasons until he turns 35. However, he needs 37 wins to get to 300.\n\nVerlander acknowledges that it is difficult to look at the stat sheet and see a 1-8 record through 19 starts, especially since he is likely to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Verlander has won three American League Cy Young Awards, was the AL MVP in 2011, and is a nine-time All-Star.\n\n\"Look, I mean I don't shy away (from his record) because it's like everyone knows where I'm at,\" Verlander said. \"Wins-wise, I'd like to get some, but at the same time, I think you just control what you can control. It's a (bad) run in a long career.\n\n\"There's nothing you can do about it. Just try to pitch better consistently and keep us in ballgames and give us a chance to win, give myself a chance to win, and do that more times than not, and see where things end up.\"\n\nVerlander hasn't pitched terribly, as his 4.29 ERA translates to a 90 ERA+, placing him 10 percent below the MLB average. However, he also hasn't been dominant, allowing 102 hits in 94 1/3 innings with 81 strikeouts and 35 walks.\n\nRegardless, Verlander should have more than one win. He has made 10 starts in which he has at least five innings and allowed two runs or fewer, but the Giants are 1-9 in those games.\n\nVerlander has looked like his old self in his last three starts, going 1-0 with a 0.60 ERA. Included in that stretch was Verlander's lone win on July 23 against the Braves in Atlanta.\n\n\"Here recently has probably been his best work, and to have better velocity at this time of the year is impressive because most pitchers tend to lose a little off their fastball later in the season,\" Giants manager Bob Melvin said. \"It's a credit to him that he kind of keeps tinkering and working on things. He's always trying to get better.\n\n\"We haven't given him much run support, and he's really a little bit unlucky as far as wins and losses go, but I think he's been very good lately.\"\n\nYet it is likely not good enough to get the Giants into the postseason.\n\nAlthough the Giants went 4-2 on a road trip that concluded on Wednesday, it followed a 0-6 homestand. Since moving to a season-high 12 games over .500 on June 13, they have gone 17-28, falling to 56-55. That leaves the Giants eight games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West and five games out of the last wild card berth.\n\nThere seemed to be a chance that Verlander might get moved before the MLB trade deadline on July 31. Instead, the Giants decided to keep Verlander after signing him to a one-year, $15-million contract in the offseason as a free agent.\n\nWhile the Giants' playoff hopes have dimmed and Verlander is seemingly in the twilight of his career, he continues to look for ways to improve.\n\n\"I've made a few adjustments, kind of scooted over (to the third base side) of the rubber,\" Verlander said. \"I've always been a little bit of a tinkerer with some timing staff. I do feel like things have kind of started to sink in.\n\n\"It's never easy when you're facing the best hitters in the world. It's extremely difficult. But at least my last couple of starts have been better. I'm moving in the right direction.\"",

      "text": "He doesn\u2019t have to do one more thing on a baseball field to be one of the very greatest to pitch at the game\u2019s highest level. Justin Verlander is a slam dunk Hall of Famer, with a 262-147, 3.30, career line, 3416 strikeouts and 82.0 fWAR. He\u2019s won a pair of World Series rings with the Astros, and was the 2017 ALCS MVP.\nThe San Francisco Giants went hard after a couple of the biggest prizes on the free agent market this offseason, coming up short on both Blake Snell and Corbin Burnes. The arms race in the competitive NL West has gotten pretty heated, and the club needed to do something to stay within hailing distance of the Dodgers (Snell\u2019s new home), Padres and Diamondbacks (Burnes\u2019).\nOn the surface, this marriage between team and player, at the cost of $15 million for one year, might not seem to be a cost-effective one. Is it a case of a club simply doing something with its available funds after falling short on its primary targets?\nThink about it for a second - $15 million doesn\u2019t go as far as it used to on the free agent market. A league average starter - someone you might expect to contribute about 2.0 fWAR over a full season, is worth about that much, if not a little more.\nSo the question becomes, is Justin Verlander likely to be a league average starter in 2025? A cursory glance at this 2024 stat line might cause one to quickly respond in the negative. 5-6, 5.48, a 138 ERA- and 118 FIP-, with his lowest K rate (18.7%) since 2014? Nothing to see here.\nA deeper dive into his 2024 numbers offers a bit more room for optimism, however. Verlander still does plenty of things well - and possibly does some of them better than he ever has.\nFirst, the negatives. You can\u2019t count on him for nearly the innings bulk he carried even a few years ago. 2021 Tommy John surgery and more minor 2024 shoulder and neck ailments have seen to that. The Astros got a mere 90 1/3 innings out of him last season. There\u2019s also the aforementioned K rate drop. It\u2019s never been all about fastball velocity for Verlander, but it is worth noting that his average 2024 four-seam velocity of 93.5 mph was his lowest since 2015. This is a guy who used to be able to dominate with his fastball, beyond his stable of imposing offspeed offerings.\nPositives? They\u2019re easier to find than you might think. Verlander was one of the unluckiest pitchers in the AL on batted balls last season. In fact, he was the unluckiest among pitchers with a better than league average \u201cTru\u201d ERA- (my batted ball-based proxy for ERA-/FIP-).\nHis Adjusted Line Drive Contact Score of 99 was far better than his actual, unadjusted 124 mark. And his Adjusted Ground Ball Contact Score of 106 was dramatically better than his actual, unadjusted 232 mark. Hitters batted an obscene .328 AVG-.343 SLG on the ground against Verlander last season - there\u2019s no reason for that other than dumb (bad) luck.\nYou might say, OK, but even though he was unlucky, he was below league average in both of those categories, and you\u2019d be right. But did you know that Verlander was the best starter in the AL (tied with the Mariners\u2019 Bryan Woo) at limiting fly ball authority, with a 70 Adjusted Fly Ball Contact Score? That\u2019s a big deal, especially when you\u2019re posting the 3rd highest fly ball rate (45.7%) among AL starters. Toss in a very high 6.6% pop up rate (over a full standard deviation above league average) and you have the very definition of a \u201cfly ball guy\u201d.\nPut it all together and Verlander was an above average contact manager in 2024 (93 Adjusted Contact Score), and his \u201cTru\u201d- of 96 was far better than either his ERA- or FIP-, making him a - yes - better than league average starter.\nDo I expect Verlander to be as exceptional at throttling fly ball contact in 2025? Probably not, but I expect him to get off of the mat in the areas in which he struggled, and provide similar pitching quality. And I\u2019d also place the odds at better than 50-50 that he\u2019ll exceed his 2024 innings quantity. That makes him worth his contract right there.\nAnd if he gets a little more oomph on his heater or refines any of his secondary pitches and pushes his K rate back up to the league average range, like where it was in 2023 (21.5%), than the Giants might really have something.\nHonestly, there\u2019s no such thing as a truly risky one-year deal, so the Giants just might have threaded the needle and attained a desirable risk-reward ratio even after whiffing on their preferred targets. The great ones tend to figure it out, and Justin Verlander is one of the greatest."
