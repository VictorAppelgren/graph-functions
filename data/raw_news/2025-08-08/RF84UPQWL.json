  "description": "Live TV streaming services get you access to local stations, sports matches and cable networks. Here's a guide to picking the best service for you.",
  "content": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nWe still think getting a live TV streaming service is a better deal than paying for cable \u2014 but the gulf between the two options is narrowing. Now that many of the major providers go for more than $80 per month, it\u2019s not the amazing deal it once was. Still, live TV streaming plans have no contract, offer relatively simpler pricing and need no special equipment beyond a smart TV or streaming device and an internet connection.\n\n\n\nAfter testing all the major players, we found YouTube TV to be the most well-rounded. But other services have their advantages, too, and there are plenty of free services as well. Here are the best live TV streaming services we tested, along with our advice on how to stream and what to look for.\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Three announcements from the past week will change the streaming landscape. and will each launch its own standalone streaming service on August 21. The former will go for $30 monthly and include all of ESPN\u2019s linear networks as well as ESPN+. A Select plan will go for $12 monthly and content from the streaming service ESPN+. Current subscribers to that service will automatically be rolled into the Select tier. \n\n\n\nFox One will go for $20 per month and feature live and on-demand content from Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports, Fox Weather and more. The separate services are arriving a few months after the between Fox, Warner Bros. and Disney (owners of ESPN) called Venu.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of Disney, it has also announced that it will combine the on-demand streaming service . The company confirmed to that Hulu+ Live TV will also be rolled into Disney+ at some point next year.\n\u2022 None What to look for in a live TV streaming service\n\nThere are plenty of ways to get free TV these days. To start, many standard streaming apps have added live components to their lineups. You\u2019re paying for the service, so it\u2019s not technically \u201cfree,\u201d but you can get a dose of live TV without spending more than necessary. Peacock includes some regional NBC stations, and notably access to the 2024 Summer Olympic Games. Paramount+ subscribers can watch on-air CBS programming. The standard Hulu app has a live ABC news channel and Max now includes a live CNN outlet with its service, along with cable-like linear channels.\n\nThe smart TV operating system (OS) you use likely provides free live content too: Amazon\u2019s Fire TV interface has a live tab and Roku\u2019s built-in Roku Channel includes hundreds of live channels at no extra cost. The same goes for Samsung TV Plus, which added a trove of K-dramas to its free live and on-demand lineup in 2024. The PBS app offers local live streams of its channels \u2014 even NASA has a free streaming service with live coverage.\n\nBut for a full suite of live TV networks, and don\u2019t want to sign up for any paid service, there are a number of free ad-supported TV services that have live TV. Even cable company DirecTV has joined the crowd with MyFree, and Fubo Free lets customers with a lapsed subscription keep watching some content. Here's the best of the live TV streaming services we tried:\n\nWhat to look for in a live TV streaming service\n\nStreaming live TV is a lot like using Netflix. You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or streaming device and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.\n\nWhen I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the price difference between live TV and a standard video streaming app. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks \u2014 particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices.\n\nOnly two of the services I tried don\u2019t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it\u2019s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations \u2014 and only in larger markets \u2014 but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.\n\nWhen you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you\u2019ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area\u2019s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an HD antenna, you\u2019ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.\n\nBut local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area\u2019s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a recently announced deal with one of France\u2019s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it\u2019s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.\n\nOne reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out upcoming games (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the \u201cTV & streaming\u201d button will tell you which network is covering it.\n\nThat just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don\u2019t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of streaming rights negotiations, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.\n\nI should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. Peacock carries live Premier League matches, Sunday Night Football games and aired the 2024 Olympic Games from Paris. Thursday Night Football as well as NBA and WNBA games are on Amazon Prime and Christmas Day Football aired on Netflix. Max (formerly HBO Max) now airs select, regular season games from the NHL, MLB, NCAA and NBA with a $10-per-month add-on. You can watch MLS games with an add-on through the Apple TV app, and Apple TV+ includes some MLB games. Roku users can watch the just-added free sports channel and those who subscribe to Paramount Plus can see many of the matches aired on CBS Sports, including live NFL games. This year, even the Super Bowl was live-streamed for free on Tubi. While all of these alternatives may not cover as much ground as live TV streamers, they could end up being cheaper avenues to the sports you want.\n\nAnd if sports is all you\u2019re after, there are sports-only plans that are a touch cheaper, too. The promised sports streaming service from ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. called Venu was cancelled early this year. But in May, ESPN confirmed it will launch its own streaming service that will include all ESPN channels, though a start date hasn\u2019t been confirmed. DirecTV recently announced a $70-per-month, sports-only streaming package called MySports and Comcast now has a sports and news bundle for the same price (as long as you're an Xfinity customer with auto-pay, otherwise it's more expensive).\n\nDozens of linear programming networks were once only available with cable TV, like Bravo, BET, Food Network, HGTV, CNN, Lifetime, SYFY and MTV. If you only subscribe to, say, Netflix or Apple TV+, you won\u2019t have access to those. But as with sports, standard streamers are starting to incorporate this content into their offerings. After the Warner Bros. merger, Max incorporated some content from HGTV, Discovery and TLC. Peacock has Bravo and Hallmark shows, and Paramount+ has material from Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central.\n\nOther channels like AMC+ have stand-alone apps. The Discovery+ app gives you 15 channels ad-free for $9 per month (or with ads for $5 monthly). And a service called Frndly TV starts at a mere $7 per month and streams A&E, Lifetime, Game Show Network, Outdoor Channel and about 35 others. Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them \u2014 and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.\n\nMost live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn\u2019t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET\u2019s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.\n\nPartnerships, like Hulu\u2019s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you\u2019re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.\n\nEvery option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You\u2019ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you\u2019ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.\n\nAside from being able to watch whenever it\u2019s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can\u2019t skip them on live TV or VOD.\n\nEach plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP\u2019s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.\n\nMost services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.\n\nPicture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.\n\nRight now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams \u2014 but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a $20-per-month add-on, after which you\u2019ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K. DirecTV Stream has three channels that show live 4K content \u2014 one with shows and original series, and two with occasional sporting events. You don\u2019t have to pay extra for these but you do need to have either DirecTV\u2019s Gemini receiver, or a device from Fire TV, Apple TV or Roku. You\u2019ll need those same streaming devices to watch the select 4K programming on Sling as well. FuboTV shows certain live events in 4K but access is limited to the Elite and Premier packages, not the base-level Pro plan.\n\nOf course, watching any 4K content also requires equipment that can handle it: a 4K smart TV or 4K streaming device paired with a cord and screen that can handle 4K resolution.\n\nComparing price-to-offering ratios is a task for a spreadsheet. I\u2026 made three. The base plans range from $28 to $85 per month. From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV. This is where streaming can quickly get expensive, pushing an $80 subscription to $200 monthly, depending on what you choose.\n\nHow to stream live TV for free\n\nI also downloaded and tried out a few apps that offer free ad-supported TV (FAST) including Freevee, Tubi, PlutoTV and Sling Freestream. These let you drop in and watch a more limited selection of live networks at zero cost. Most don\u2019t even require an email address, let alone a credit card. And if you have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV or Stick, a Samsung TV, a Chromecast device or a Google TV, you already have access to hundreds of live channels via the Roku Channel, the live tab in Fire TV, through the Samsung TV Plus app or through Google TV.\n\nWhen I begin testing for a guide, I research the most popular and well-reviewed players in the category and narrow down which are worth trying. For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the top cable networks were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.\n\nI then looked at how the programming was organized in each app\u2019s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of Home Town.\n\nI used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.\n\nStreaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. Live streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.\n\nWhat is the difference between streaming and live streaming?\n\nStandard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It\u2019s also referred to as \u201cvideo on demand.\u201d Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.\n\nWhat streaming service is best for live TV?\n\nFuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.\n\nWhat is the most cost effective TV streaming service?\n\nFree TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won\u2019t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you\u2019re not paying for stuff you don\u2019t need.\n\nIs it cheaper to have cable or streaming?\n\nA basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that\u2019s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service.\n\nWhat streaming service has all the TV channels?\n\nNo service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, according to Neilsen. Hulu\u2019s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can\u2019t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.\n\nWhat is the most popular live TV streaming platform?\n\nYouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's letter from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney\u2019s 2024 third quarter earnings put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling\u2019s customer count dipped from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to 1.6 million.\n\nHow safe are free streaming services and websites?\n\nYou may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That\u2019s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series \u2014 which can come bundled with malicious code.\n\nBut if you\u2019re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don\u2019t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.\n\nJanuary 31, 2025: Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi\u2019s free option. Updated Fubo\u2019s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream\u2019s sports-only package and Comcast\u2019s sports and news bundle.\n\nJanuary 16, 2025: Included higher prices for Sling\u2019s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV\u2019s new sports package.\n\nDecember 31, 2024: Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon\u2019s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV\u2019s free service.\n\nAugust 6, 2024: Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu.\n\nJune 12, 2024: Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.",

  "summary": "Engadget has tested the best live TV streaming services to find a better deal than cable, but the gap between cable services is narrowing as many providers go for over $80 per month. Live TV streaming plans offer no contract, simpler pricing, and require no special equipment beyond a smart TV or streaming device and internet connection. After testing all major players, we found YouTube TV the most comprehensive service. Disney has also announced it will combine its own on-demand streaming service with Hulu+ Live TV, which will also be rolled into Disney+ at some point next year. The article also provides advice on how to stream live TV without spending more than necessary. There are also several free ad-supported TV services that offer live TV.",

      "text": "Comcast\u2019s sports and news streaming bundle starts at $70 monthly\nBut the fine print says you could pay as much as $100 monthly before taxes.\nA week after DirecTV launched its first sports-only streaming package, Comcast unveiled a similar offering that adds news to the mix. The Xfinity Sports & News TV package combines over 50 broadcast, cable news and sports channels with Peacock, DVR storage and more.\nAlthough Xfinity Sports & News is being widely marketed and reported as costing $70 monthly, there\u2019s some extensive fine print attached. (With Comcast?? Can\u2019t be.)\nFirst, that price only applies to Xfinity Internet or Xfinity TV customers (new or existing). You\u2019ll pay at least $90 monthly if you want to stick with home internet from elsewhere. On top of that, your monthly price goes up by $10 without automatic billing through a bank account. Autopay with a credit or debit card adds an extra $8.\nSo, it can be as little as $70 or as much as $100 per month. Plus tax. This is only a good deal compared to YouTube TV (which recently raised prices again) or Hulu + Live TV if you\u2019re already an Xfinity Internet customer who\u2019s cool with automatic payments.\nEven then, whether it\u2019s a bargain will depend on whether it has all the content you want. Its national cable news lineup includes CNN, CNBC, MSNBC and Fox News. It has ESPN, FS1, ACC Network, Big Ten Network, GOLF Channel and SEC Network for live sports channels. Also on tap are local broadcast channels, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, Telemundo and Univision affiliates. Plus, you get Peacock (which includes live sports in addition to its on-demand fare) and other extras like 300 hours of cloud DVR storage.\nIf you want the best viewing experience, you\u2019ll need an Xfinity X1 TV box, only available for Xfinity cable customers. But since that would be somewhat redundant, you can still watch through the Xfinity Stream app on streaming boxes like Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV and mobile devices.\nYou can read more (and perhaps make yourself dizzy from fine print) at Xfinity\u2019s Sports & News landing page.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

Most often, they\u2019ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we\u2019ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you\u2019ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing.\nIf you\u2019re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You\u2019ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Maybe you find you like the service so much that you\u2019re fine paying full price for it \u2014 that\u2019s the ideal situation. But if you\u2019re not compelled to keep that app on rotation in your smart TV, most streaming services make it easy for you to cancel at any time. With that said, these are the best streaming deals you can snag right now.\nThis offer includes access to HBO Max with ads for no extra cost when you sign up for a DashPass Annual plan. You can then decide to upgrade to Max Standard, which removes ads, for a discounted rate of $11 monthly if you want. Aside from the obvious streaming benefits, this deal gives you $0 deliver fees and lower service fees on some restaurant DoorDash orders, five percent DoorDash credits on pickup orders, on-demand grocery delivery and other members-only exclusives.\nYouTube TV (three months) for $150 ($99 off): You can get three months of our favorite live TV streaming service for $50 per month. That should give you a decent chunk of time to see if the service is right for you while saving some cash. The discount and trial are only open to new subscribers to YouTube TV\u2019s base plan, which includes access to over 100 channels, unlimited DVR space and six household accounts with the ability to stream on three devices at once.\nFubo Pro for $65/month for the first month ($20 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA.\nSling Orange for $23/month for the first month (50 percent off): New customers can get Sling Orange or Sling Blue for half off the usual price for the first month, bringing the final prices to $23/month and $25.50/month, respectively. Orange is likely best for sports fans, with eight exclusive sports and family channels, while Blue includes 19 exclusive news and entertainment channels. You can get both Orange and Blue access also for half off for one month, or $33 total.\nSpotify Premium Individual (1 month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. Right now, users who have not signed up for Spotify's Premium service before are eligible to get one month for free. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version.\nPeacock first responders discount \u2014 one year for $48 (50 percent off): Medical professionals and first responders can save 50 percent each year of Peacock. The deal requires annual verification and is open to those who work for either private or public institutions. Peacock has some great stuff to watch, including Poker Face and Killing It and more.\nStudent discounts on streaming services\nHBO Max student discount \u2014 subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You\u2019ll just have to verify that you\u2019re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service.\nHulu student discount \u2014 subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu\u2019s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They\u2019ll keep the same sale price for as long as they\u2019re a student as well.\nSpotify student discount \u2014 Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify\u2019s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu\u2019s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you\u2019d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up.\nNBA League Pass student discount \u2014 one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.\nStreaming bundle discounts\nThere\u2019s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you\u2019ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service.\nSpeaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Here are some of the best streaming bundles you can get right now.\nHBO Max may not technically be under the Disney-Hulu mega-umbrella, but this bundle gives you ad-free viewing across most content in all three services. Download support for offline watching is included, too. Compared to the $52/month you\u2019d pay for these tiers separately, you\u2019ll save 42 percent with this combination.\nDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max bundle with ads for $17/month: Ad-supported HBO Max is included here, along with full, ad-supported access to Disney+ and Hulu. You\u2019ll save 43 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for all three services individually.\nDisney+ and Hulu Bundle Premium for $20/month: Disney and Hulu offer a few different bundles, which you can view in the drop-down lists under Choose Your Plan. This bundle removes the ads from both Disney+ and Hulu (with the exception of select live and linear content) and allows you to download content for offline viewing. You\u2019ll save 42 percent with this bundle, as opposed to paying for both ad-free tiers individually.\nParamount+ with Showtime for $13/month or $120/year: This includes everything in Paramount+\u2019s Essential plan, except the ads, and also provides access to Showtime content, live CBS streams and download features.\nSling TV + HBO Max starting at $53/month: Sling TV and HBO Max have partnered on a discount that gives new subscribers 50 percent off their first month of Sling TV, plus $5 off monthly when you subscribe to the Sling TV + HBO Max bundle. The standard price for the Sling Blue + HBO Max duo is roughly $58/month, so you'll get a monthly discount of $5 off that. In addition, for the first month only, you'll get half off the price of the bundle. The promotion also applies to the Sling Orange & Blue + HBO Max package, which has a standard price of $73/month.\nHulu + Live TV with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $96/month: This streaming bundle amalgamation is a bit confusing but it does offer a lot: you get live TV streaming via Hulu\u2019s service plus access to the following VOD services: Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Out of those three, only ESPN+ will have ads.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Basic for $17/month: You get full access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ content with this package, albeit with ads across the board. This bundle price is 46 percent off the total price of all three separate subscriptions.\nDisney+, Hulu, ESPN+ Bundle Premium for $27/month: Similarly to the Duo bundles, the Premium version of the Trio removes ads from most content in Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, and you can download content for offline viewing. This price represents a 43-percent savings when compared to paying for all three ad-free tiers separately.\nRead more streaming coverage\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice."

      "text": "Amazon is rebranding IMDb TV as 'Freevee'\nLook, it could have been called Zon.\nAmazon\u2019s IMDb TV is rebranding. Beginning April 27th, the ad-supported streaming service will be known as Freevee, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Amazon\u2019s Studios division told the outlet the new name is designed to better reflect how much it costs to access the platform.\nAs part of the rebranding, Amazon said it would also invest more into original programming, with a promise to offer 70 percent more exclusive content than it does currently. Among the shows Amazon plans to debut on the platform is High School, a coming of age series from indie duo Tegan and Sara. The company will announce additional details about Freevee\u2019s upcoming slate of originals at its NewFronts presentation on May 2nd.\nWe know from reporting from The Information that Amazon had been mulling a rebranding of IMDb TV since at least the start of last fall. At the time, company executives had reportedly considered names like \u201cZon,\u201d along with \u201cFree TV\u201d and \u201cFree Streaming TV,\u201d as potential options. The thought among executives was that the existing name was too difficult for people to pronounce and was thereby hurting its popularity.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "NBA TV rights go to ESPN, NBC and Amazon as TNT is rejected\nThe 11-year media rights deal includes the WNBA and runs through 2036.\nThe NBA and WNBA have inked deals for where games will be aired and streamed for the next eleven years. The NBA deals run from the 2025-2026 season through the 2035-2036 season. For the WNBA, the agreement covers the 2026 through 2036 seasons.\nPro basketball has been an ESPN mainstay for years and that will continue, with the Disney-owned network remaining the primary media rights owner for both leagues. ESPN will be the exclusive home for the NBA finals for all eleven years of the new deal, as well as five out of the eleven years of the WNBA finals. The games covered by ESPN's deal will be part of the sports network's direct-to-consumer platform and a package of NBA and WNBA games will also be made available to stream on Disney+ in select international markets.\nWhile the bulk of the games will go to ESPN, basketball is going to have more of a streaming presence thanks to two new partnerships. NBC and Peacock will have access to 100 NBA national games during each regular season. About 50 games will be exclusive to the Peacock streaming platform, including national Monday night games and doubleheaders. The rest of the games go to Amazon. Prime Video will be the home for 66 regular-season NBA games and 30 regular-season WNBA games each year of the deal.\nRegular basketball viewers may notice that TNT Sports is not part of this lineup. The NBA's deal with that network does not appear to be getting an extension after next year, with those games mostly going to Amazon. But the situation may yet go into overtime. TNT Sports claims that it matched Amazon's offer for the games and seems to be challenging whether the NBA can switch partners. NBA's statement counters that the offer from parent company Warner Bros. Discovery did not match Amazon's, leaving them free to shop elsewhere.\nThe long-awaited agreements for both basketball leagues aren't a complete slam dunk for fans. On the positive side, the next decade marks a notable shift toward streaming. After so long with the sport closely tied to broadcast shows, having access as part of your existing streaming plans is great. But on the negative side, multiple media partners mean that you'll have to double- and triple-check where to watch each game. Major League Baseball, for instance, has games scattered across ESPN, Fox, Apple TV+, TNT Sports, and MLB Network on any given night."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best streaming devices for 2025\nFrom sticks to dongles to set-top boxes, there are media streaming devices for every budget.\nMost TVs on the market today are smart TVs \u2014 but there are still a few compelling reasons to get a streaming device. These sticks and set-top boxes let you access a user interface that might be easier to suss out than the built-in one on your set. In the case of older or cheaper TVs, a streaming device could make your TV feel faster, too. You may also find streaming sticks convenient for travel, letting you access all your streaming services on a hotel or Vrbo TV set without typing in a ton of passwords. We tested out streaming players from Roku, Google, Apple, Amazon and more, gauging the usability and the performance of each one to help you find the best streaming device for your cord-cutting needs.\nTable of contents\nBest streaming devices for 2025\nOperating system: Google TV | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 5, Ethernet | Voice control: Yes (Google Assistant) | Resolution: 4K | Supported formats: HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos | Smart home compatibility: Google Home | Ambient Mode: Yes | Headphone compatible: Yes, wireless | TV power/volume control: Yes\nRead our full Google TV streamer review\nThe Google Chromecast product line was replaced with the Google TV Streamer in September of 2024. There\u2019s no HD model, only 4K this time around and the going price is $100, which is double the price of the most recent 4K Chromecast. Instead of a dongle that hides behind your TV, it\u2019s now a set-top wedge.\nInside, there\u2019s a faster processor, which kept up with my scattered testing methods \u2014 opening and closing apps then reloading them immediately \u2014 with no trouble. The Apple TV 4K is still the fastest of the streamers I\u2019ve tried, but I don\u2019t think the speed here will disappoint most people. The storage has jumped up to 32GB from a skimpy 8GB on the Chromecast and the memory is doubled at 4GB. It supports up to 4K/60fps video with HDR, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. Audio formats include Dolby Digital and Dolby Atmos along with spatial audio if you\u2019re wearing the Pixel Buds Pro.\nThe remote control is compact and streamlined; the D-pad handles navigation, play, pause and rewind. Of course there\u2019s also a back button (as you\u2019d find on any good Android device). And if you ever lose the pill-shaped remote, you can push a button on the back of the set-top wedge to make it ring.\nGoogle has made its Home app an integral part of the streamer. Not only will you use it to set up your device, but you can also use the streamer to view a slideout home panel on your TV screen (that looks a lot like the Favorites tab in the app). The panel lets you control your compatible smart home devices so you can set temperatures, turn off lights, view feeds and so on. You can even do so while you\u2019re watching something if you program the star button on the remote to pull up the Home panel.\nWhat really makes the Google TV 4K Streamer the best for all-in-one steaming is the interface. It\u2019s basically the same as what you'll find on any TV set or screen that comes with Google TV built in. I find Google\u2019s presentation to be the best at pulling together content from different streaming apps into one useful and intuitive menu. It\u2019ll track what you\u2019ve been watching across different platforms so you can easily dive back in, and the recommendations are pulled fairly equitably from across your subscribed services.\nOf course, no big tech company can release a product today without some AI contrivance and it comes here in the form of computer-generated plot and audience review summaries for titles. It\u2019ll also generate screensaver images based on your prompts. Those are fine and all, though probably not worth it. The real reason to go for the Google TV Streamer is the helpful interface combined with performance that\u2019s faster than most of the sticks on the market. And if you\u2019re someone who uses Google Home for your smart home control, you\u2019ll get even more out of this device.\n- Excellent interface combines all streaming content equally\n- Useful smart home control with a slide-out paneluseful\n- Attractive device with a great remote\n- Required HDMI cable issold separately\n- Double the price of its predecessor\nOperating system: Roku OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 5 | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: 4K, HDR | Smart home compatibility: Roku Smart Home, Alexa, HomeKit, Google Home | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, wireless via Roku app | TV power/volume control: Yes\nRead our full Roku Streaming Stick Plus review\nBelieve it or not, the streaming world has enough free content to keep even the most voracious watchers entertained \u2014 and the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is probably the best way to access it. Roku\u2019s interface is uncluttered, with a simple list at the left and an app grid on the right. Two of those list items, Live TV and Featured Free, are stuffed with free content, both on linear channels and video-on-demand (VOD) services. The Roku Channel app adds thousands more series, films, Roku Originals and live channels to watch without subscribing to a dang thing.\nRoku updated its streaming device selection this year and now there are five in total, with one Streambar, the set-top Roku Ultra and three Streaming Sticks. The $40 Streaming Stick Plus is a direct replacement for the Roku Streaming Stick 4K and it has the best mix of features for the price. The slim design hides behind your TV and doesn\u2019t require power from a wall outlet, just a USB port on your TV. It supports 4K and HDR as well as Apple Air Play 2 and works with Alexa, HomeKit, Google Home and Roku Home. The included voice remote can control your TVs power and volume as well.\nIt doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision and lacks the Wi-Fi extender that the Streaming Stick 4K has built in. If your TV can display that higher picture quality or if your Wi-Fi signal could use a boost in getting to your TV, you might want to upgrade to the 4K model.\nI find Roku's universal search function to be accurate when looking for specific titles; pushing the Voice button and saying \u201cPoker Face\u201d brings up results for the Peacock show, the Russell Crowe movie and a poker documentary from a free channel. Saying \u201cSuccession\u201d gets you the show from Max as well as listings for other series and films with \u201csuccess\u201d in the title. It was pretty good at finding suggestions for more general searches, like \u201cpolice procedural shows\u201d and \u201cIdris Elba,\u201d though it had issues with recommendations for kids movies (not enough Disney+ results, in my opinion).\nNavigation is speedy with minimal load times between apps. The remote has a nice layout with a large back button and the volume rocker on the side. The handy Instant Replay button jumps back 10 to 20 seconds and can even show subtitles for the replayed portion, if the app supports it. The only thing I didn\u2019t love was the What to Watch menu, which was overwhelmingly populated with free content and had a minimal amount of titles sprinkled in from my paid apps. But since free content is where Roku really shines, I can\u2019t be too miffed. \u2014 A.S.\n- Built-in access to tons of free content\n- Accurate universal search\n- Supports 4K, HDR, TV controls and voice input\n- Doesn't require a wall adapter for power\n- What to Watch menu ignores content from other streamers\nOperating system: Fire TV OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 1080p | Supported formats: HDR10+ | Smart home compatibility: Alexa | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, wireless | TV power/volume control: Yes\nTowards the end of 2024, Amazon replaced the Fire TV Stick Lite and the standard Fire TV Stick with the Fire TV Stick HD. It has the same internal hardware and supports the same 1080p at 60 fps as the Lite but the remote can now control the power and volume on your TV \u2014 something the Lite couldn't do.\nThe price went up by $5 as well, making the list price $35. Still, as it's often on sale for $25 and lower, it's one of the cheaper streaming sticks on the market. We tested the original Lite model for this guide, and our biggest complaint was the lack of control for our TV's power and volume \u2014 using two remotes was a tad annoying, so it's good to see that flaw remedied. If you don't have a 4K TV, or don't watch a ton of 4K content, this will save you a good chunk of change over the $50 Fire TV Stick 4K.\nThe HD's remote not only controls the TV, it also lets you use Alexa to search for shows and ask general questions like the weather forecast or the latest scores for your favorite sports team. Amazon\u2019s Fire TV interface supports all of the major streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, Max, YouTube and Live TV providers like Sling, YouTube TV and Fubo.\nDespite its low price, the Fire TV Stick HD is a decent streaming dongle. It comes with the updated Fire TV interface that has user profiles and and a navigation that's better at integrating different content that it was before. Finding apps and shows is easy enough, though the layout isn\u2019t as unified as Google TV\u2019s and is more complicated than Roku\u2019s. One thing to note is that Amazon's interface prioritizes Prime Video content, and you'll see a lot more ads here than on other streaming platforms.\n- Affordable\n- Supports all major streaming services\n- Updated remote can control your TV's power and volume\n- No 4K content support\n- UI heavily favors Amazon Prime Video content\nOperating system: Roku OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 5 | Voice control: No | Resolution: up to 1080p | Supported formats: HD | Smart home compatibility: Alexa, HomeKit, Google Home, Roku Home | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, via Roku app | TV power/volume control: Yes\nThe Roku Express was replaced by this Streaming Stick earlier this year. It has the same interface as all Roku devices, which we find easy to navigate and particularly good at letting you access free and live content. This model doesn\u2019t support 4K or HDR but, unlike the retired Express model, the remote supports voice input and can control your TV\u2019s power and volume. If you don\u2019t have a 4K TV and all you need is a capable HD streaming device at a low price, the $30 Streaming Stick fits the bill. \u2014A.S.\n- Affordable\n- Lots of free and live content\n- No 4K streaming support\n- No voice remote\nOperating system: Roku OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, HDR10+ | Smart home compatibility: Roku Home, HomeKit, Alexa, Google Home | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, Bluetooth | TV power/volume control: Yes\nRoku updated its most advanced streamer, the Roku Ultra, in 2024, giving it a faster processor, Wi-Fi 6 compatibility and a brand new remote. Like the previous generation, it supports 4K HDR10/10+ streaming, 100 Mbps Ethernet connection, Bluetooth streaming, AirPlay2 connectivity and voice commands with Alexa, Google Home and Roku Smart Home. The previous model had a microSD slot for external media, now there\u2019s a USB port for local playback.\nI used the Ultra for about a month and was impressed with the speed, image quality and the new remote \u2014 plus a couple of perks I hadn\u2019t expected. The 4K TV I used for testing was new to me and whoever had watched it before had set it to 1080p. During setup, the Ultra prompted me to head to the TVs settings to adjust the video quality. It was a nice touch and not something all players do.\nFlipping from app to app was nearly instantaneous. Changing my mind with the back button immediately returned to the home screen. I experienced no buffering issues or audio synching troubles and pairing up Bluetooth headphones was fast with glitch-free performance.\nI really liked the new remote. Pick it up and the backlight kicks in, making it easy to control in a darkened room. Since it's equipped with an always-on mic for hands-free voice control (you can turn it off right on the remote) you can say, \u201cHey Roku, where\u2019s the remote?\u201d and it\u2019ll start ringing. Even with the Roku and TV off, you can just say \u201cHey Roku, open Netflix\u201d to turn on your TV and start up the app. A backlight and always-on feature will obviously drain the battery quicker, but in a month of using the remote, I only had to recharge it once, which is easy to do via USB-C.\nThe voice control function didn\u2019t perform more complicated functions as easily, though. With the TV off, I asked it to continue playing a show I\u2019d been watching and it turned on my PS5. While on the Roku home screen, I asked it to continue playing Gravity Falls, and was told there was no content to continue playing, even though my kid had been watching the show the day before. I often had better luck just holding down the mic button and speaking a search request as I\u2019m used to doing with other players. The search function was accurate most of the time, presenting the correct movie or show and taking me to the app when I clicked on what I wanted.\nOf course, as we said about the other Roku device on our list, the OS here is best at finding and presenting free and live content, with a live TV channel guide, a Featured Free content tab, a What to Watch section packed with stuff from no-cost providers like Tubi, plus the brand\u2019s own Roku Channel. If you\u2019re a fan of the Roku experience and want to get the most out of a higher-end TV, the Ultra is the set-top box to get. \u2014 A.S.\n- Excellent remote\n- High-quality video and audio\n- Lots of access to free and live content\n- USB port for playing local media\n- HDMI cable is included\n- Voice control struggles with complex requests\n- Interface is better at free content than organizing your paid apps\nOperating system: Apple tvOS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, Apple Lossless | Smart home compatibility: HomeKit | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, via Bluetooth, Spatial Audio avail. with AirPods | TV power/volume control: Yes\nWhen my colleague Devindra Hardawar reviewed the latest gen of the Apple TV 4K upon its debut in 2022, he called it \u201cthe best streaming box by a long shot.\u201d In terms of picture quality, speed, longevity and Apple-engineered extras, that remains accurate. The set-top box supports 4K Dolby Vision and HDR10+, which makes compatible content look, to borrow Devindra\u2019s term, glorious.\nThe A15 Bionic chip inside enables near-instantaneous loading of and switching between apps. Zooming from the beginning of an episode to the end or anywhere in between is not only quick, but also quite easy to do once you get the hang of the touch-sensitive directional pad on the Siri remote. Apple improved the box hardware over the previous generation, too, with a smaller, fan-less design.\nYou don\u2019t have to be an Apple devotee to appreciate the streaming box, but having an iPhone makes setup easier, letting you hold your iOS handset near the device to transfer credentials. If you use the Fitness+ app with an Apple Watch, not only can you watch workouts on a big screen, you\u2019ll see live heart rate stats splashed in the corner as well. The app library is extensive, covering all of the most popular streaming services, plus countless Apple Arcade and other games. The remote\u2019s Siri button lets you easily search for stuff to watch with voice commands, and typically gets you to the right app immediately. I found it nearly as good as other devices in suggesting content for more general queries like \u201csci-fi space movies.\u201d\nIf you were waiting for the \u201cbut,\u201d here it is: the Apple TV 4K is expensive. The base model is $129, which comes with 32GB of storage. The 128GB model goes for $149 and adds an Ethernet port and acts as a Thread-enabled home hub, a requirement for certain smart home devices. Also, if you\u2019re looking for lots of free channels and live programming with an all-in-one home page to unify your disparate streaming subscriptions, this isn\u2019t quite it.\nThe Apple TV app incorporates recently watched series into the Up Next section and your most-used apps appear in the Channels and Apps row. But the homepage is mostly a showcase for Apple TV+ series and movies. And don\u2019t expect to see much in the way of Netflix content in the app either. Possibly due to a continuing grudge match between the two companies, Siri even has trouble finding Netflix shows at all \u2014 searching for Lupin only came back with results from the anime franchise and when I asked for All the Light We Cannot See, the AI turned off my smart lights. Finally, this premium streaming device doesn\u2019t come with the HDMI cable required to hook it up to your TV. That\u2019s a minor detail in the grand scheme of things, but it did cause me to fling grownup words in Cupertino's general direction. \u2014 A.S.\n- Extremely fast operation\n- Apple Fitness+ and Arcade on a big screen\n- Support for 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision content\n- Expensive\n- Apple TV app heavily favors Apple TV+ content\n- Sub-par Netflix searches\nOperating system: Android TV | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, microSD card slot | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: HDR10, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, DTS-X | Smart home compatibility: Google Home, Alexa | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, Bluetooth | TV power/volume control: Yes\nFor those who want an all-in-one device that lets you stream movies, run a PLEX media server and play games, consider NVIDIA\u2019s Shield TV Pro. It currently runs Android TV, which is a little outdated at this point, but there\u2019s a possibility that it could be upgraded to Google TV in the future.\nThanks to its capable Tegra X1+ processor, the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro can stream in native 4K and it can also upscale 720p and 1080p video to 4K with the company\u2019s AI neural network. It also supports Dolby Vision and HDR10, has 3GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and two USB-C ports. Additionally, there\u2019s a gigabit Ethernet port, an HDMI socket and a microSD card slot. Since it runs on Android, you can use it to play most games from the Google Play Store.\nThe main reason you\u2019d choose the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro over other machines is that it gives you access to NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service. As long as you have a relatively speedy internet connection, you can play top-tier PC games that are streamed online to your Shield TV Pro. \u2014N.L.\n- Supports 4K, HDR10 and Dolby Vision content\n- Provides access to NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service\n- Built-in Google Assistant support\n- Expensive\nOperating system: Roku OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: HDR10+, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision | Smart home compatibility: Home Assistant | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, Bluetooth and wired | TV power/volume control: Yes\nEven though both Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X can stream video, it\u2019s the Xbox that we think is the best gaming console for the job. It can play 4K Blu-Rays and supports all of the usual streaming video apps including Apple TV+ and Disney+. However, the PS5 can\u2019t stream Disney+ Dolby Atmos, which is disappointing if you ever want to watch The Mandalorian in all its cinematic glory.\nFortunately, that\u2019s not the case with the Xbox Series X. On top of that, the Xbox Series X (and S) also support Dolby Vision for streaming video, which is especially great for people with newer TVs. Of course, the Xbox is also a pretty great gaming machine, and it offers access to Game Pass, Microsoft\u2019s subscription service that has a large library of titles. \u2014N.L.\n- Provides access to all major streaming services\n- Plays 4K Blu-Rays\n- Expensive\nOperating system: FireTV OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+ | Smart home compatibility: Alexa | Ambient Mode: Yes | Headphone compatible: Yes, Bluetooth | TV power/volume control: Yes\nOur budget pick from Amazon doesn\u2019t support 4K image quality or Dolby Atmos. Amazon\u2019s higher-end Fire TV Stick 4K Max not only handles Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+, but it also supports Wi-Fi 6E. That means if you have a router that also carries the protocol, you could see better and faster connectivity.\nThe 4K Max has the fastest processor of any Fire TV Stick (the Amazon Fire TV Cube is faster, but isn't a stick), and we found it plenty zippy. The 4K Max even supports a fairly pleasant Ambient Experience, displaying art (and widgets) when the screen is idle, like on Samsung\u2019s The Frame. It also lets Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers play games via the app without an Xbox Series X or S console.\nI'll also point out that Engadget\u2019s Jeff Dunn has gotten a lot of use from the stick as a retro gaming emulator. That\u2019s a decent amount of utility from a $60 device (that\u2019s often on sale for around $45).\nThat said, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV interface is less elegant (and less democratic) than other UIs, highly prioritizing Prime Video content. It\u2019s also notably ad-stuffed \u2014 promoting not just Amazon\u2019s content, but products as well. \u2014 A.S.\n- Affordable 4K streaming\n- Additional gaming access\n- Ad-stuffed interface\n- Prioritizes Prime Video content\nWhat to look for in a TV streaming device\nOperating system and interface\nGoogle\u2019s TV Streamer, the Apple TV 4K, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV Sticks and Roku devices are the most popular players in the space. Three of those brands also come built into TVs, such as Fire, Google and Roku TVs, but the Apple TV 4K doesn't come pre-loaded on any set. Each one has a unique operating system and interface. This may be the biggest deciding factor for many people, as it determines how the home entertainment you want to watch is arranged and presented. We go into detail for each platform below, but all of them come with home screens that, to varying degrees, gather your apps in one place, present the movies and TV shows you\u2019re currently watching and give you suggestions of other media streaming options.\nNearly all streaming devices come with a remote that lets you search and do other operations using your voice, eliminating the need to hunt and peck at on-screen keyboards. They all offer \u201cuniversal search,\u201d in which searching for a title takes you to whichever app has it available. If you want to watch Wicked but don\u2019t know where it\u2019s playing, just push the voice button on the remote and say \"Wicked.\u201d (We found simply saying the title or the genre you want sometimes works better than saying \u201cShow me\u2026\u201d or \u201cSearch for\u2026\u201d) From the search results, hit the play button and the correct app will open and start playing \u2014 assuming you\u2019ve previously logged into that app and, in most cases, have an active subscription.\nConnectivity\nMost streaming sticks connect to the internet via Wi-Fi, with the majority of them supporting Wi-Fi 5 or 6 protocols. Set-top boxes can also have Ethernet ports, so you can hardwire your internet connection to the device, which is typically faster than wireless. Streaming media players connect to your TV through an HDMI port, and most sticks hide behind the screen, while set-top boxes sit on a surface nearby. Nearly all units also plug into an AC outlet for power. Some sticks used to work by pulling power from a USB port on the TV, but increasingly, these devices are designed to plug into the wall.\nVideo and audio features\nIf your home theater setup has a screen that can display 4K content with Dolby Vision and HDR10, you\u2019ll want a streaming device that supports those high-end formats. Of course, even the most top-shelf streamer can\u2019t make a 1080p TV stream 4K. The series or movie also has to be transmitted in 4K and, increasingly, companies restrict higher-quality streaming to more expensive subscription plans. In short, every element needs to support the video or audio feature, otherwise the highest quality you\u2019ll get will be the lowest of any component in the chain.\nRemotes\nMost remotes that come with streaming devices will allow you to control the power and volume of your TV. Some of the less expensive devices, however, don't have that feature, so you'll need to use your TV's remote control to turn it on, then use the streaming remote to navigate the streamer's interface. If your streamer's remote does offer power and volume controls, the setup process will usually calibrate your remote to your TV. If you want to use a soundbar, such as from Sonos or other brands, for audio you may also have to take the additional step of pairing your remote to the speaker.\nVoice control\nIn addition to helping you find stuff to watch, streaming devices from Apple, Google and Amazon can answer questions about the weather, sports scores and general facts using built-in voice assistants. They can also act as smart home controllers to turn off connected smart bulbs or plugs and show feeds from smart cameras. Just remember, as with all smart home devices, compatibility is key. Fire TV devices work with Alexa-enabled smart home equipment; the Google TV Streamer lets you control Google Home devices; and Apple TV 4Ks play nice with HomeKit and other Apple devices. Rokus grant power over Roku\u2019s smart home products, but also work with the other ecosystems.\nHow we tested and picked the best streaming devices\nLike every gadget we test, we start by researching what\u2019s worthy of reviewing. Then we get a hold of the devices ourselves and see how well they work. We don\u2019t have a central Engadget lab; we test things in our own living rooms, on our own TV sets. We also figure that\u2019s a better approximation of your own TV experience anyway.\nWe began testing streaming devices as far back as 2007 with the first Apple TV device. Since then, we\u2019ve tried out most of the major new releases to come along \u2014 from the Roku Stick back in 2014 to the 2024 Google TV Streamer 4K. A few years ago, we decided to compile the streaming devices we reviewed into this guide. Since then, we\u2019ve updated our top picks using verdicts from our reviews, as well the testing we perform just for this guide. As new devices come out, we try them and, if something is worthy, we add it to our top picks on this list."

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best music streaming services in 2025\nThe differences between Spotify, Apple Music and the rest of the major music streamers are subtle but significant.\nThere\u2019s no such thing as one \u201cbest\u201d music streaming service. Most of these apps are designed around the same principles and provide access to a huge music catalog. Pretty much none of them are paying artists properly, yet nearly all of them are steadily raising prices. If you\u2019ve used one to build up a library over the years, that one is most likely to be in tune with your musical tastes.\nThat said, if you\u2019ve grown tired of whatever service you use today, we\u2019ve spent months getting to know all of the major music streamers, feeding them similar data and taking note of how they adapt to our preferences over time. While the broad strokes are similar with each, there are a few key differences in the margins that might sway you from one app to another. Below, we\u2019ve highlighted the best music streaming services on the whole and broken down where they excel and fall short.\nFree tier: No | Individual plan: $11/month or $109/year | Family plan: $17/month (up to 6 members) | Student plan: $6/month | Streaming quality: Up to 24-bit/192 kHz ALAC\nIf we were forced to pick one music streaming service to recommend to most people, it\u2019d be Apple Music. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s especially convenient for people who use an iPhone or other Apple products. You can favorite songs right from an iPhone\u2019s lock screen, control your library with Siri, quickly share (or SharePlay) playlists through iMessage and subscribe as part of an Apple One subscription. The app is available on just about every Apple device, and the interface is consistent throughout, whether you\u2019re using an iPad, Apple TV or CarPlay-enabled vehicle.\nAs with most music streaming services, Apple Music\u2019s UI can be a lot to take in, but it largely strikes the right balance between algorithmic suggestions and recommendations from actual people. If you just want to jump into some tracks you\u2019ll probably like, there\u2019s a dedicated station tuned to your listening history, a \u201cDiscovery Station\u201d that only serves up songs you haven\u2019t streamed and other personalized mixes and album suggestions right at the top of the app. You can start a custom station from any track and access all of your favorited songs in one easily sortable and searchable playlist. We\u2019ve found Apple Music\u2019s algorithm to lean on established artists more than some alternatives, but it\u2019s better than most at not repeating songs on a regular basis.\nWhat gives Apple Music an edge is the way it emphasizes curation. There are diverse, regularly updated and editor-picked playlists all over the app. Many artist pages will spotlight the act\u2019s essential works and \u201cdeep cuts.\u201d Their albums are listed in order, and popular records are often accompanied by a thoughtful review. Most notably, there\u2019s a collection of live radio stations, with DJ-hosted shows that spotlight new records and artist interviews. These include dedicated channels for different genres, from pop and country to Latin and \u201cchill\u201d music.\nTo be clear, Apple Music is still heavy on automated suggestions, but it has a human touch that\u2019s easier to see than with many of its peers. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re totally giving into The Machine while using it \u2014 you still can if you want, but it\u2019s just as easy to let real people guide you to music you may (or may not) enjoy.\nBeyond that, Apple Music is one of the few services that still lets you import your own local files. That\u2019s great if you have a big iTunes library \u2014 or, you know, value actually owning things. It also offers lossless streaming for no extra cost, with its entire catalog available in CD quality (16-bit/44.1kHz) at minimum. Most people won\u2019t care about or even notice that, but if you have good wired headphones (and a DAC) or a decent speaker system, higher-res streams genuinely can wring out more fine details than the compressed files used by Spotify, YouTube Music and a few others.\nThere are still clear downsides. Only Spotify is compatible with more third-party devices and platforms, but Apple Music inevitably works best on Apple\u2019s own stuff. The web and Windows PC apps, for instance, aren\u2019t as polished or fully-featured as the iOS one. Apple has made a huge push into spatial audio, but that format often sounds unnatural with music that isn\u2019t specifically mixed for it. With some algorithmic stations, the queue will only display the next track instead of giving you a larger list to peruse. There\u2019s also no free tier. Podcasts are absent as well, though we consider that a good thing; it makes the app feel more focused and less likely to shove irrelevant content in your face.\n- Works great with Apple devices\n- Impressive blend of curated content and personalized recommendations\n- All music available in CD quality or higher\n- Local file support\n- Designed for Apple devices first\n- Spatial audio can sound unnatural\n- No free tier\nFree tier: No | Individual plan: $13/month or $130/year (Studio); $180/year (Sublime) | Duo plan: $18/month or $180/year (Studio); $270/year (Sublime) (2 members) | Family plan: $22/month or $216/year (Studio); $350/year (Sublime) (up to 6 members) | Student plan: $5/month | Streaming quality: Up to 24-bit/192 kHz FLAC\nQobuz is worth a look for audiophiles who want a more curated music service and don\u2019t want to funnel extra cash into tech giants like Apple or Google. Even more than Apple Music, it comes off like the streaming equivalent of a friendly music nerd. The top of the app greets you with a handpicked selection of recent albums, while a \u201cQobuzissime\u201d section further down spotlights up-and-coming acts. Tons of records, new and old, come with liner-notes-like reviews. A \u201cMagazine\u201d tab offers a stream of fun articles; as we write this, those include interviews with Kim Wilde and Franz Ferdinand, a look back at Jimmy Carter\u2019s connections to the music industry and a regular \u201cAlbum of the Week\u201d write-up. Qobuz emphasizes albums more than playlists overall; it wants you to engage with an artist\u2019s complete work, not just bits and pieces encouraged by algorithms. Yet the playlists it does have are varied and thoughtful, and the UI as a whole is much cleaner, more legible and less chaotic than most of its competitors.\nLike Apple Music, Qobuz includes lossless streaming for no extra cost, with FLAC files that reach up to 24-bit/192 kHz. It also lets you purchase albums outright in CD or Hi-Res quality. If you subscribe to its upper \u201cSublime\u201d tier, you can get those at a discount. It all speaks to a service with a record-store mindset: Its recommendations mostly come from real people, its streams are high quality, and it doesn\u2019t slavishly tailor itself to your listening history. Past reports suggest it\u2019s one of the better-paying services for artists, too, something its digital album shop should only help.\nStill, this sort of anti-Spotify approach has its shortcomings. When it does have to algorithmically recommend music \u2014 through a track radio, for instance, or its personalized \u201cWeekly Q\u201d playlist \u2014 its selections aren\u2019t bad, but they\u2019re usually less adventurous and far-reaching than what you\u2019d get from certain alternatives. If you want a service that does all the discovery work for you, this is not it; you have to open to exploring new music to get the most out of it. It\u2019s also not as receptive to sharing on social networks, and there\u2019s no Spotify Connect-style feature for streaming across different devices just yet. While it has a huge library with more than 100 million tracks, it tends to not spotlight Top 40 hits as strongly as other services, particularly when it comes to hip-hop and pop. (Though some may view that as a positive.) There are no podcasts or audiobooks either \u2014 again, maybe a good thing \u2014 plus it costs $2 more per month than most of our other picks.\n- Thoughtful curation and editorial content\n- Lossless streaming included in base tier\n- Cleanly designed app on mobile and desktop\n- Offers digital store for buying music\n- Costs more than rival services\n- Not ideal for keeping up with popular music\n- Recommendation algorithm isn't as far-reaching as peers\nFree tier: Yes | Individual plan: $11/month or $110/year; also available as part of YouTube Premium subscription for $14/month or $140/year | Family plan: $17/month (up to 6 members) | Student plan: $5.49/month | Streaming quality: Up to 256kbps AAC & OPUS\nIf you\u2019re really into YouTube, you\u2019ll like YouTube Music. It comes included with a YouTube Premium subscription, which removes ads from the video site, allows for offline downloads and enables background playback for $14 a month. Those are significant upgrades on their own \u2014 mostly because the experience of using YouTube with ads is so mind-numbingly terrible \u2014 plus there\u2019s a full Spotify competitor on top. If you already spend a ton of time on YouTube, this should make Google\u2019s music service the best value by default.\nEven without those perks, YouTube Music benefits from close ties to its sister site. YouTube is home to a mountain of creative works that just aren\u2019t available on standard music services, from obscure soundtracks and rare live performances to monstrous Neil Cicierega mashups and Radiohead remixes made from Super Mario 64 sounds. With YouTube Music, you can search through those, add them to playlists and listen to them alongside more traditional releases. If you sign up with the same account, music you\u2019ve liked on YouTube will show up right away and help inform YouTube Music\u2019s recommendations. You also get the same class-leading selection of music videos, which you can access with a single tap.\nAs with Apple Music, YouTube Music lets you upload your own music files. It\u2019s also one of the better options when it comes to surfacing new artists. It\u2019s far more focused on algorithmic suggestions than Apple Music, and it\u2019s not immune to repeating song recommendations if you use it long enough. But the app is loaded with personalized mixes and relevant album suggestions, and we\u2019ve discovered many lesser-known acts through its track radios and community-based playlists.\nThat said, the integration with YouTube is really the thing here. Without it, there isn\u2019t much reason to choose YouTube Music over its rivals. There\u2019s no lossless streaming, and the home tab is as much of a hodgepodge of disparate elements as any other service. (Though a nifty \u201cSpeed Dial\u201d in the mobile app makes it easy to hop into recent plays, and it\u2019s nice that you can pin specific albums and playlists to it for fast access.) The ability to pull in music you\u2019ve liked on YouTube is convenient but sometimes sloppy in execution, as those likes won\u2019t always integrate your library neatly. In general, there are few of the editorial touches you\u2019d find in Apple Music or some of our other picks below.\nYouTube Music also has podcasts, technically, but the selection mainly consists of YouTube videos that are marked as podcast content. Many shows still appear as promised, but this means some feeds consist of brief clips more than full episodes. You can add missing podcasts to your library via RSS, but that\u2019s an extra step apps like Spotify don\u2019t force you to take. We\u2019d also be remiss not to mention Google\u2019s long history of killing its own products, including this service\u2019s predecessor. Nevertheless, the company seems committed to gradually improving YouTube Music today.\n- Includes a wealth of rare and interesting music that isn't available on other services\n- Available with YouTube Premium subscription\n- Good music discovery tools\n- Local file support\n- Music videos\n- No lossless streaming\n- Podcast integration is messy\n- UI can feel overwhelming at times\nFree tier: Yes | Individual plan: $12/month | Duo plan: $17/month (2 members) | Family plan: $20/month (up to 6 members) | Student plan: $6/month | Streaming quality: Up to 320kbps Ogg Vorbis\nSpotify is the most popular music streaming service, and as such it\u2019s available on the widest array of devices and platforms. A Spotify Connect feature makes it a breeze to move your stream from one device to another without losing your place. It also has a decent free tier \u2014 not good, mind you, as you still have to deal with ads, limited track skips and no offline downloads \u2014 which provides access to most of the service\u2019s social features and gigantic music and podcast catalog at no cost.\nThose social features are another area where Spotify excels. You can follow friends, discover and collaborate on other people\u2019s playlists and easily share your own mixes. You likely know about Spotify Wrapped, which remains a certified Big Deal every year. With many artists, you can also view tour dates right from the app and find links to buy tickets and merch.\nIf you want podcasts and audiobooks alongside your music, meanwhile, Spotify has gone all-in on those. Most podcasts you enjoy are probably on here, a number of popular shows are exclusive to the service and paid members get 15 hours of audiobook streaming as part of their subscription.\nSpotify is built around playlists much more than full albums, and it leans harder on \u201cthe algorithm\u201d than rivals like Apple Music. The good news is that many of those playlists are genuinely great. \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d fully deserves its reputation for digging up tracks you haven\u2019t streamed but still align with your tastes. A regularly updated \u201cdaylist\u201d morphs with the kind of music you stream at different points in the day. What feels like a billion other mixes based on artists, decades, moods and more nebulous concepts (from \u201ccottagecore\u201d to \u201cescapism\u201d to \u201cEthiopian jazz\u201d) are mostly on point. There\u2019s still plenty of manually curated playlists as well: Things like \u201cRap Caviar,\u201d \u201cNew Music Friday\u201d and \u201cViva Latino\u201d may not be personalized to your tastes, but they\u2019re clearly put together by knowledgeable people who are in tune with current trends.\nIn truth, other services are no longer that far behind Spotify when it comes to surfacing relevant new music. Still, simply following the app down its many rabbit holes will usually lead you to something enjoyable, and its playlists typically do well to mix lesser-known acts in with the big names.\nSpotify\u2019s biggest issue is its interface: It\u2019s kind of a mess. The desktop app has a handy sidebar that provides fast access to your library, while the mobile app puts several playlists, podcasts and recent listens right at the top. After that, there are rows of podcast and audiobook suggestions sandwiched between a shotgun blast of playlists. At least some of those, however, may be programs you\u2019ve never shown an interest in. The way Spotify pushes you toward aesthetically similar content is good for finding three-minute songs, but it\u2019s much more obnoxious when applied to hours-long shows. Podcasts are not music; you can\u2019t group and recommend them by vibe the way you can with certain tracks. If we like the Engadget Podcast, for instance, that doesn\u2019t mean we want to spend another 80 minutes listening to other, possibly more aggravating people talk tech.\nKeep scrolling, and the mobile app descends into a string of large TikTok-style suggestion cards. These look slick, but scrolling through a feed of giant icons, one recommendation at a time, isn\u2019t an efficient way of finding something interesting. Spotify has also spent the last couple of years pushing an \u201cAI DJ\u201d tool that works like an algorithm-based personal radio station, but while it\u2019s technically impressive, it still tends to make jarring leaps between genres. In our most recent round of testing, it managed to jump from Fleetwood Mac to Playboi Carti within five tracks.\nAnd while we realize that everyone consumes music differently, it must be said that the app\u2019s playlists-over-all approach essentially devalues the album as a concept. Intentional or not, it can turn listening to music into an echo chamber, one where you don\u2019t have to engage with the way musicians make their art.\nIn more objective issues, Spotify lacks any sort of lossless streaming despite confirming a CD-quality \u201cHiFi\u201d tier four (!) years ago. Every few months, we get whispers of the service coming actually for real this time, but at this point we\u2019ll believe it when we see it. Though you can play local files through the Spotify app, you can\u2019t import them into your library across devices as neatly as you can with Apple\u2019s service. The Premium plan also costs a dollar more per month than Apple Music (for now).\nLast but not least, while no music streaming service properly values artists \u2014 buy merch and tickets, folks \u2014 Spotify has a particularly horrible reputation for low payouts. A recent Harper\u2019s report even said that the company has populated some playlists with copy-cat tracks credited to fake artists to further pinch pennies. (The company has disputed this.) Ultimately, our guide is for consumers, and Spotify still does enough well in certain areas to be a worthwhile product for some people. In many ways, however, it has become the poster child for the streaming industry\u2019s most worrying traits.\n- Widely available and easy to use across platforms\n- Podcasts and audiobooks\n- Lots of fun and inventive playlists\n- Free tier\n- UI often tries to do too much\n- Costs more than some rival services\n- No lossless streaming\nFree tier: No | Individual plan: $11/month | Family plan: $17/month (up to 6 members) | Student plan: $5.49/month | Streaming quality: Up to 24-bit/192 kHz FLAC\nTidal is something like a half-step between Qobuz and Spotify. Like the former, it offers lossless streaming and Hi-Res FLAC files for no extra cost, and it focuses on curation and editor-led discovery features more than most of its peers. Past reports have said it\u2019s better about compensating artists than competitors, and it takes care to provide extensive, interactive credits for most tracks.\nAt the same time, it isn\u2019t as aggressive about downplaying algorithmic suggestions, playlists and more mainstream hits. It also has features like Tidal Connect (which makes it easier to stream across devices), music videos, animated album art and live lyrics. It\u2019s $2 cheaper than Qobuz per month, and its UI is much less cluttered than Spotify\u2019s, so it\u2019s a fine compromise if you\u2019re passionate about music but don\u2019t want to give up features common in modern music apps.\nThat said, it can feel like a compromise. Some hand-curated features \u2014 articles from \u201cTidal Magazine,\u201d a \u201cTidal Rising\u201d tab designed to highlight up-and-coming acts, various staff-picked playlists and album suggestions \u2014 are less visible in the app than their equivalents on Qobuz. On mobile, the top of the home tab provides quick links to a few of your recent listens, then displays a separate \u201cRecently played\u201d tab just under it, which is redundant. While we\u2019ve found plenty of new music through Tidal\u2019s algorithmic suggestions, its automated song radios repeat the same artists more frequently than we\u2019d like. The service isn\u2019t as widely available on other devices as Spotify or Apple Music, either. Nevertheless, Tidal is easy to like, and it\u2019s gotten better over time.\n- Lossless streaming included in base tier\n- Thoughtful curation and editorial content for music fans\n- Personalized recommendations could be better\n- No annual plan\nOther notable music streaming services\nDeezer\nDeezer has an attractive app, CD-quality streaming, a competitive library, a (limited) free tier and the option to upload local MP3 files. It also gives quick access to several live radio stations from around the globe, which is great. There\u2019s little truly wrong with it, so if you dig its interface and find those features appealing, it should serve you well. But it costs a dollar more than Apple Music, YouTube Music and Tidal each month, and its playlists and discovery tools generally aren\u2019t as expansive. It technically lacks the highest-res streams offered by Apple, Qobuz and Tidal as well.\nAmazon Music Unlimited\nAmazon Music Unlimited offers lossless streaming and podcasts, with many shows available ad-free. Naturally, it works great with Amazon\u2019s fleet of Alexa devices. Its interface is somewhat clunkier than most of our main picks, though, with weaker discovery and curation features than Apple Music and an overly aggressive approach to promoting podcasts and audiobooks you may not care about. It also costs $1 more per month than Apple Music, YouTube Music and Tidal unless you have a Prime subscription.\nPandora Premium\nPandora is superb at surfacing music you\u2019ll probably like, so its free or Plus tiers will work great if all you need is a simple, personalized internet radio. If you want music on-demand, though, you need a Premium subscription, which costs $11 a month. That service is much less feature-rich than our top picks, however, and it has the most compressed streaming quality of any option we\u2019ve tested, topping out at 192kbps."

      "text": "Disney+ will unhinge its jaw and swallow Hulu in 2026\nDisney says there will still be separate plans for Disney+ and Hulu, though.\nIt\u2019s almost the end of the road for Hulu as a standalone app. Now that it fully owns Hulu, Disney will entirely integrate the streaming service into Disney+. It will roll out a new, unified app next year.\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the price of a Disney+ subscription is going to skyrocket in 2026. A Disney spokesperson told Variety the company will still offer standalone plans for Disney+ and Hulu.\nDisney CEO Bob Igor said on an earnings call that having Disney+ and Hulu on the same tech platform should help the company reduce costs and provide it with more ways to package ad sales. For users, Iger said the unified app will offer an \u201cimproved consumer experience.\u201d Iger and Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said merging the services \u201cwill create an impressive package of entertainment, pairing the highest-caliber brands and franchises, great general entertainment, family programming, news and industry-leading live sports content in a single app.\" Disney+ is also slated to get a more personalized homepage and other new features in the coming months.\nThere will be a notable change for Disney+ users outside of the US as well. Disney will rebrand the Star tile in the app to Hulu starting this fall.\nDisney has been nudging its streaming services more closely together for a while. Last year, it integrated Hulu content into Disney+ in the hopes of getting more people to pay for a bundle that includes the two services.\nOn top of all that, Disney says it will soon (for the most part) stop disclosing subscriber numbers for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, following the likes of Netflix in taking such a step. Between them, Disney+ and Hulu had 183 million subscribers at the end of June, up 2.6 million from the end of March. Meanwhile, the new ESPN streaming service is set to debut on August 21."

      "text": "YouTube is testing a hub of free, cable-style channels\nThe company is reportedly in talks with media companies to feature their shows and movies.\nYouTube is reportedly in talks with media companies to feature their TV shows and films in a hub of ad-supported channels. It's already testing the idea to weigh viewer interest. The platform could roll out the hub to more users later this year, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nIf YouTube moves forward with the plan, it would be entering a market known in the industry as Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television, or FAST. Players in that space include Roku, Fox's Tubi and Pluto TV, which is owned by Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS). Depending on what content it offers and how it sets up the mooted channels, YouTube could end up pulling more attention away from those services.\nYouTube confirmed to the Journal that it's running a test in which a small number of users can watch ad-supported channels. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for new ways to provide viewers a central destination to more easily find, watch and share the content that matters most to them,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\nThe service is said to have teamed up with the likes of Lionsgate, A+E Networks and FilmRise for the test. For media companies, such channels offer a way for them to earn revenue from content that might otherwise languish.\nYouTube already offers ad-supported movies, but this hub could give users a bigger platter of free films and shows to watch. Its channels could operate in a similar way to Pluto TV. That platform has channels dedicated to reruns of certain shows \u2014 such as CSI, Doctor Who, South Park and Frasier \u2014 along with ones for reality series, live news and even sports.\nThe mulled move into FAST aligns with YouTube's strategy of expanding into other video formats beyond the content that's traditionally associated with the platform. In November, it broke premium streaming channels out of YouTube TV and into its main app. Showtime, Starz, Paramount+ and AMC+ were among the first Primetime Channels. More recently, YouTube locked down exclusive rights to the NFL's Sunday Ticket package in a multi-billion-dollar deal said to run for seven years.\nYouTube already has the biggest share of TV viewing time among streaming services in the US, according to Nielsen. It beat Netflix for the third straight month in November with 8.8 percent of viewing time. Initiatives like the FAST channels and Sunday Ticket could help it lock up more mindshare and viewer attention.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

A MySports subscription is around $10 cheaper than what competitors like YouTube TV and Fubo offer, priced at $83 and $80 a month, respectively.\nYou can watch MySports content using the DirecTV app on iOS and Android. It\u2019s also available on smart TV platforms like Fire TV, Android TV and Apple TV.\nUpdate, February 5 2025 10:56AM ET: MySports is now available nationwide."

      "text": "ESPN's streaming service will cost up to $30 per month and be called... ESPN\nBundles with Disney+ and Hulu will be available too.\nDisney isn't quite ready to reveal exactly when you'll be able to start using ESPN's long-awaited standalone streaming service, but it has announced some key details. For one thing, the company isn't rocking the boat in terms of branding. The service will simply be called ESPN.\nThat was the best and most obvious option, especially considering that the unlimited plan includes all of ESPN's offerings, albeit via the internet instead of satellite or cable. \"As we thought about the name, we kept returning to the fact that, across every generation, ESPN is the most trusted, loved and recognized name in sports, and that we should keep it simple and double down on the power of ESPN,\" ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in a statement.\nThere are two plans that will be available through the revamped ESPN app: an unlimited subscription for $30 per month and a select plan for $12 per month. The former includes all of ESPN's linear networks. You'll be able to watch (deep breath) ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNEWS and ESPN Deportes live, as well as ESPN on ABC, ESPN+, ESPN3, SECN+ and ACCNX. ESPN's press release does not mention the inclusion of ESPN8 The Ocho, a free ad-supported streaming channel that features all kinds of strange and wonderful sports.\nAlong with studio shows and original programming like the 30 for 30 films, the unlimited plan offers access to 47,000 live events every year plus on-demand replays, ESPN says. That includes games from the big four North American sports leagues, along with the NWSL, PGA Tour, UFC, Big 12, the College Football Playoff, dozens of NCAA championships, major European soccer leagues, three of the tennis grand slam tournaments and much more. The select plan, meanwhile, is basically what ESPN+ is now.\nThere are other payment options available. An annual unlimited membership will run you $300. If you also use Disney+ and/or Hulu, though, a bundle will likely be the best way to go. Disney is trying to sweeten the deal for newcomers with a launch offer that includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN unlimited for $30 per month for 12 months. That effectively gets you Disney+ and Hulu for free for a year, but it'll be the ad-supported version of each. After that, the bundle will cost you $36 per month for a plan with ads on Disney+ and Hulu. To go ad-free on those services, you'll pay $45 per month for the bundle.\nAs for the select plan, that's $120 for an annual subscription. The bundle of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN select will be $17 per month with ads on Disney+ and Hulu, and $27 to go ad-free. Bundle subscribers will be able to access ESPN content from the Disney+ app.\nCurrent ESPN+ subscribers will be moved over to the ESPN service on the select plan (but expect a lot of attempts to upsell you on the unlimited offering). If you have a bundle with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, you'll soon find yourself with the ESPN select bundle.\nThe transition will happen when the ESPN streaming service debuts sometime in early fall. Disney will announce more details, including the date when the service goes live, later this summer as the cable-ization of streaming TV continues.\nThe standalone ESPN service had been in the works for years, but it's not the only sports streaming platform Disney had been putting together. The company teamed up with Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox with the intention to start a joint offering called Venu Sports, but that plan vaporized earlier this year amid legal challenges from competitors. Still, Fubo agreed to drop its case against Venu Sports after it reached a deal with Disney on a joint venture that combines FuboTV with Hulu + Live TV."

      "text": "ESPN vs. ESPN+: What's the difference between the two sports streaming services?\nConfused about sports streaming options? We review the changing ESPN landscape.\nAs every SportsCenter fan knows, ESPN is pretty much a must-have for sports fans. But the question these days might be, \"Which one?\" And we don't just mean The Ocho \u2014 there are already at least seven ESPN channels on many cable systems, and we're about to get more streaming options, too. ESPN announced in mid-May that it will be launching a new direct-to-consumer streaming service for sports fans this fall, which is great news for audiences who want to be able to watch their favorite sports in one place.\nESPN's chairman, Jimmy Pitaro, explained that the streamlined service is meant to help \"fans cut through the clutter,\" but it begs one big question: Doesn't ESPN already have a streaming service with ESPN+? And how will the new platform, which will simply be called ESPN, differ from ESPN+? For some subscribers, there will be no difference at all; for others, it will be a pricier but more comprehensive viewing experience. It all depends on which tier of the service you subscribe to. Here's what you need to know about ESPN's new streaming service.\nWhat is included in ESPN's new streaming service?\nESPN recently announced that it will be launching a new streaming service, also called ESPN. This service will be divided into two tiers: the ESPN Unlimited package and the ESPN Select package.\nESPN Unlimited, as the name suggests, will include access to all of ESPN's linear networks: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNews and ESPN Deportes, plus access to programming on ABC, ESPN+, ESPN3, SECN+ and ACCNX. It's effectively \"cable ESPN, but via streaming.\" That means fans will get coverage of more than 47,000 live events each year, on-demand replays, original programming and more.\nESPN Select is essentially the new name for ESPN+. The service will still provide exclusive access to many events, and will simulcast certain sports that air on other channels and offer PPV access to UFC fights, but will not feature the robust programming of Unlimited.\nESPN+ has thousands of exclusive live events, original studio shows and acclaimed series that aren't on the ESPN networks. ESPN+ allows subscribers to purchase UFC PPV events and access an extensive archive of on-demand content (including the entire 30 For 30 library, select ESPN Films, game replays and more). Whether you purchase a standalone plan, add-on or Disney Bundle plan, the service provides access to thousands of sports events for $11.99/month or $119.99/year.\nExisting ESPN+ subscribers will notice their plans change to ESPN Select when the new service launches in September.\nCan I get ESPN for free?\nIf you subscribe to ESPN via most cable, satellite or streaming packages, you can already authenticate in the ESPN app. This ability will carry over to the new ESPN offering, so you'll continue to have access to the full range of streaming ESPN channels, as well as any of the new app features. In other words, whether you subscribe to ESPN via cable or the new ESPN Unlimited streaming product, you'll have access to the same programming and options online.\nAt the moment, there is no information about whether the new ESPN plan will offer a free trial period.\nWhat does the new ESPN streaming service cost?\nThanks to bundling options within the wider family of Disney streaming apps, you'll be able to get ESPN at several price levels:\nESPN Unlimited as a standalone plan for $29.99/month or $299.99 for the year, no cable subscription required. Remember, that includes access to every ESPN broadcast network as well as all content that's currently streamed on the ESPN+ service.\nESPN Unlimited can be bundled with Disney+ and Hulu starting at $35.99/month (with ads on Disney+/Hulu) or $44.99/month (no ads on Disney+/Hulu). Subscribers can get a special limited-time deal when the platform launches and pay $29.99/month for the first 12 months for a Disney+, Hulu, ESPN Unlimited bundle (with ads on Disney+/Hulu).\nESPN Select (basically just a new name for ESPN+) will still cost $11.99/month or $119.99/annually. A Disney+, Hulu, ESPN Select bundle will cost $16.99/month (with ads on Disney+/Hulu) or $26.99/month (no ads on Disney+/Hulu).\nWhen is the new ESPN streaming service available?\nThe launch date for the new ESPN service is September 2025. Keep that timing in mind if you plan to sign up and take advantage of the special pricing available at the platform's launch.\nHow do I enroll in the new ESPN streaming service?\nIf you're a subscriber to ESPN+ (either with a standalone subscription or as part of a Disney+/Hulu bundle), you don't have to lift a finger \u2014 you will automatically be enrolled in the new Select plan at no additional cost. Standalone ESPN+ subscribers get the ESPN Select plan, and Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ bundle subscribers get the ESPN Select bundle. If you want to upgrade, you can do so when the platform launches.\nIf you want to subscribe to the Unlimited plan, you can do so when the plan launches by signing in on either ESPN.com, the ESPN App on mobile and connected TV devices.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "Plex is adding reviews for TV shows and movies\nThis puts the app in competition with Letterboxed and TV Time, among others.\nStreaming company Plex just announced that it\u2019s introducing a new reviews feature for TV shows and movies, as reported by TechCrunch. This is great for people who want to quickly find something good to watch, as the reviews are culled from other Plex users, professional critics and friends. This move places Plex in direct competition with apps like Letterboxd.\nThere\u2019s also going to be a social media component to this toolset. Reviews can be shared with your friends and even friends of friends. The company says that, eventually, there will be an update that will allow users to share their ratings and reviews with anyone using Plex. The feature is in beta release right now and you can sign up with a verified email address on the web interface or the mobile app.\nOf course, reviews must abide by Plex\u2019s community guidelines, so keep it family-friendly. Once activated, you can access a new \u201cRatings and Reviews\u201d option in settings that allows for criteria adjustments. These settings can be adjusted to only display reviews from Plex users, critics, or a combination of both.\nThis update follows the app\u2019s Discover Together feature, which allows people to create profiles on the app and follow friends for personalized recommendations. Plex has been absolutely hoovering up investment capital lately. It scored $40 million earlier this year and $50 million back in 2021.\nFor the uninitiated, Plex is an extremely popular free, ad-supported television (FAST) streaming app. It easily made our list of the best live TV streaming services. However, it also acts as a portal to other streaming platforms, making for a centralized entertainment hub."

      "text": "Disney cuts DirecTV customers' access to ABC, ESPN and more\nThe two companies failed to reach a new licensing agreement before the expiration date.\nESPN's broadcast of the US Open was cut short for DirecTV users on Sunday after Disney issued a blackout midway through on all of its networks. It occurred after a 2019 deal expired without a new agreement for a licensing deal between the two companies.\nUnsurprisingly, DirecTV and Disney disagree on which company is to blame. \"The Walt Disney Co. is once again refusing any accountability to consumers, distribution partners, and now the American judicial system,\" Rob Thun, chief content officer at DIRECTV, said in a statement. \"They want to continue to chase maximum profits and dominant control at the expense of consumers \u2014 making it harder for them to select the shows and sports they want at a reasonable price.\"\nDirecTV's release also claimed that Disney mandated at the last minute that it \"must agree to waive all claims that Disney's behavior is anti-competitive\" to proceed with a deal. The provider further called out Disney for being unpopular with many of DirecTV's customers. It also took issue with Disney putting its \"best programming,\" like The Bear and Only Murders In The Building, directly on streaming services while filling ABC with \"cheap-to-produce primetime gameshows, unscripted spinoffs, old former ABC hits, or simulcast content.\"\nIn contrast, Disney claimed that DirecTV \"chose\" to deny their subscribers access to content. \"While we're open to offering DirecTV flexibility and terms which we've extended to other distributors, we will not enter into an agreement that undervalues our portfolio of television channels and programs,\" stated Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, co-chairmen of Disney Entertainment, and Jimmy Pitaro, chairman of ESPN. \"We invest significantly to deliver the No. 1 brands in entertainment, news and sports because that's what our viewers expect and deserve. We urge DirecTV to do what's in the best interest of their customers and finalize a deal that would immediately restore our programming.\"\nA similar disagreement occurred at the same time last year. In that instance, Disney pulled its networks from Spectrum for 12 days until making a new deal with Charter, Spectrum's parent company. The agreement brought back channels like ABC and ESPN, and Spectrum TV Select and Select Plus subscribers also got access to the Disney+ basic tier and ESPN+ (only Select Plus users). In its release, DirecTV called out this pattern, claiming that \"Disney is again taking an anti-consumer approach.\""

      "text": "Disney is increasing prices (again) for standalone streaming plans\nThe hikes apply to ad-free and ad-supported individual plans for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+.\nIn what seems to be an annual tradition, Disney announced that the costs for standalone plans of its video streaming services will get more expensive, starting on October 17.\nThe ad-supported Disney+ Basic plan will increase from $8 a month to $10, while the ad-free Disney+ Premium plan jumps from $14 a month or $140 annually to $16 a month or $160 annually. For Hulu, the plan with ads is changing from $8 a month or $80 a year to $10 a month or $100 a year and the ad-free plan will go from $18 a month to $20 a month. ESPN+ is getting pricing updates as well, with monthly costs going from $11 monthly or $110 annually to $12 monthly or $120 annually.\nRecall that Disney+ was a mere $7 a month, without ads, when it launched less than five years ago.\nOnly one combo plan seems to be getting a change. The Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes ad-supported access to both Disney+ and Hulu, is increasing from $10 a month to $11 a month. The Hulu + Live TV plans are also hiking costs: $83 a month for ad-supported, and $96 a month for ad-free.\nThe increased subscription costs were included in a feature announcement that had been rumored earlier this year. Disney+ will start offering viewers continuous playlists starting September 4. There will be two playlists to start: a channel for ABC News Live, and one with videos for preschoolers. Four more playlists will debut later in the fall: Seasonal Content, Epic Stories (featuring franchises like Marvel and Star Wars), Throwbacks (\"nostalgic pop culture content\") and Real Life (biopics and documentaries)."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best streaming services in 2025\nOut of the dozens available now, these are our favorites.\nWith so many options available today, choosing the best streaming services can feel overwhelming. Whether you\u2019re into blockbuster movies, reality TV, documentaries or just want access to news channels, there\u2019s a platform tailored to your tastes and budget. From premium subscriptions like Disney Plus, Netflix and Max to free streaming options like Tubi or Pluto TV, there\u2019s something for everyone.\nIf you\u2019re looking to cut the cord completely, you might also want to explore live TV options that offer cable-like channels without the hassle. We\u2019ve also put together a separate guide to the best live TV streaming services if you\u2019re after a full channel lineup that includes sports, local stations and breaking news. In this buying guide, though, we\u2019re focusing on the top on-demand streaming services worth subscribing to right now \u2014 whether you\u2019re binging shows solo or setting up family-friendly entertainment for the weekend.\nBest streaming services for 2025\nFree trial: No | Monthly price: Starts at $7/month (with ads) | Annual cost: Starts at $84/year (with ads) | Live TV: Limited | Local channels: No\nCompared to other on-demand streaming services, no one offers more high-quality content at a single price than Netflix. Pick any category you can think of and Netflix probably has something that will fit the bill, including original programming. Plus, new content is released every week and as a worldwide service, Netflix is consistently adding movies and TV shows from around the globe that can change the viewing experience in ways you may not have considered (Are you sure you\u2019re not into K-Dramas, Finnish detective thrillers or British home improvement shows?).\nNetflix is available in almost every country on the planet, and its app or website runs on most of the devices that connect to the internet. Those apps are also some of the most easy-to-use of any service. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always simple to choose something to watch, but when it comes to swapping profiles or simply picking up where you left off, it doesn\u2019t get better than this. If you\u2019re heading off the grid \u2014 or onto a plane \u2014 then you can easily download most (but not all) of its content to watch on your iOS or Android device.\nIf you somehow don\u2019t have Netflix already (or someone to share a login with) then getting a taste of it is a little more complicated than it used to be. Netflix dropped its free trial period in the US a while ago so it\u2019s important to have all your information in order before going in to create an account.\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that maybe if you\u2019ve let your account lapse, the service that exists now is very different from what you would\u2019ve seen two years ago, or five, or ten. Remaining the dominant player in subscription streaming has required adjustments to stay on top with a changing mix of content and plans to choose from.\nIn the US, there are three levels of Netflix you can subscribe to. All of them include unlimited access to the same content, work on the same devices and you can cancel or pause them at any time. The Standard with Ads tier costs $7 per month and it's the only option that includes advertisements. The difference between Standard ($15.50 per month) and Premium ($23 per month) comes down to picture quality and the amount of simultaneous streams allowed. \u2014 Richard Lawler, Senior News Editor\nFree trial: Yes (with free Prime trial) | Monthly price: Starts at $9/month (with ads) | Annual cost: Starts at $108/year (with ads) | Live TV: Limited | Local channels: No\nIf you think of Amazon\u2019s Prime Video package as a Netflix-lite, or even if you\u2019ve only used it once or twice, then you may be underestimating the options available to streamers. The ad-free (other than trailers) subscription service is available as part of Amazon Prime, which you can purchase for either $15 per month, or $139 annually. While the subscription started out as a way to get free shipping on more purchases, Amazon has tacked on benefits that extend across books, music, games and even groceries. If you\u2019d prefer to get Prime Video only, it\u2019s available as a standalone for $9 per month.\nWe\u2019ll focus on the video service, which includes a selection of original and catalog content that is a lot like what Netflix and the others offer. In recent years Amazon Prime has increased its original output with award-winning series like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, as well as highly-regarded genre content like The Boys and The Expanse.\nWhen it comes to where you can watch Amazon Prime Video, the list of options rivals Netflix. Streaming boxes and smart TVs, whether they\u2019re part of Amazon\u2019s Fire TV platform or not, are almost a given. Game consoles? Check. The only major gap in compatibility was Google\u2019s Chromecast, and it closed that hole in the summer of 2019.\nAmazon also has a significant amount of content that\u2019s available to watch in 4K and HDR and unlike Netflix it won\u2019t charge you extra for the privilege. The same goes for simultaneous streams \u2014 Amazon\u2019s rules say you can have up to two running concurrently. When it comes to downloads, Amazon allows offline viewing on its Fire devices, Android and iOS.\nThe only downside is that Amazon\u2019s apps aren\u2019t quite on par with Netflix in terms of usability. While all the features are there, simple things like reading an episode summary, enabling closed-captions or jumping out of one show and into another are frequently more frustrating on Amazon than on other platforms. The company also frequently insists on bringing its Fire TV-style interface to other platforms instead of using their native controls. That can make it harder to use, although on platforms where it hews to the built-in controls, like Roku, can be easier to use.\nOne other thing to think about is that Amazon\u2019s video apps link to its on-demand store, and include access to Channels. For cord-cutters who just want a consistent experience across different devices, that means you can easily buy or rent content that isn\u2019t part of the subscription. Amazon Channels lets you manage subscriptions to Britbox, Showtime, Paramount+ and others. \u2014 R.L.\nFree trial: Yes | Monthly price: Starts at $10/month (with ads) | Annual cost: Starts at $100/year (with ads) | Live TV: Limited | Local channels: No\nIn 2020, HBO decided to take the fight to its streaming competitors with HBO Max. It supplanted the existing HBO channels, as well as streaming via HBO Go or HBO Now by refocusing on original content and rebuilding the service for the modern era. Even before the recent merger and rebranding as simply Max, it had the advantage of linking to one of the deepest (and best) content libraries available, drawing from the premium cable channel\u2019s archives, the Warner Bros. vault, Studio Ghibli, Looney Tunes, Sesame Street and Turner Classic Movies.\nIf you pay for HBO from one of the major TV providers, then congratulations \u2014 you probably already have access to the full Max experience. Just activate your account and start streaming. Otherwise, you can subscribe directly over the internet. Max has a free 7-day trial, and costs $16 per month (or $150 a year) for the cheapest no-ads tier. You can pony up $20 per month, or $200 per year, for a no-ads tier that includes 4K streaming and four simultaneous streams. To get in on the ground floor, the ad-supported tier costs $10 per month.\nSince launch, Max has come to more TV platforms and it's now available on Roku, Apple TV, Android TV, Samsung and others. You can also stream it via a browser, Sony and Microsoft\u2019s game consoles or with mobile apps on Android and iOS. It also includes support for AirPlay and Google\u2019s Cast feature, which help it work with more smart TVs than just the ones listed here.\nMax content includes premium stuff that Warner yanked back from Netflix and others, like full series runs of Friends and The Fresh Prince, or DC Universe-related TV series and movies. The Max library speaks for itself, with Game of Thrones, The Wire, Band of Brothers, and Flight of the Conchords or Entourage, and newer shows like The Last of Us and The White Lotus.\nWe should mention, however, that Max canceled several shows ahead of its Discovery+ merger as a cost-cutting move. It is deprioritizing kid and family content, leading to the removal of Sesame Street spin-offs and a handful of Cartoon Network titles. Movies like Batgirl and Scoob!: Holiday Haunt have also been axed. Despite these changes, Max still has one of the best content libraries of any TV streaming service and is worthy of consideration. \u2014 R.L. and Nicole Lee, Commerce Writer\nFree trial: Yes | Monthly price: Starts at $10/month (with ads) | Annual cost: Starts at $100/year (with ads) | Live TV: Yes, at an additional cost | Local channels: Yes, at an additional cost\nHulu started out as a bit of a curiosity \u2014 a joint venture by NBC, News Corp and a private equity firm to compete with Netflix by offering new episodes of TV shows. Then, after Disney joined up in 2009, bringing along its content from ABC and the Disney Channel, Hulu became a streaming network worth paying attention to. Today, Hulu's focus is still on recent TV episodes, but it also has a strong library of original series and films (like The Handmaid's Tale and Only Murders in the Building), as well as an archive of older TV and movies that often puts Netflix to shame.\nNow that Disney owns a majority controlling stake in Hulu, following its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the service is less of a collaboration between media giants. (Comcast still offers NBCUniversal content, but it can choose to have Disney buy out its shares.) Instead, it's yet another feather in Disney's increasingly important digital empire, alongside Disney+ and ESPN+. That may not be a great thing for the competitiveness of streaming services in general, but for subscribers it means they can look forward to even more perks, like access to all of the FX shows that hit Hulu earlier in 2024.\nHulu subscriptions start at $10 a month (or $100 a year) with ads. You can also bump up to the ad-free plan for $18 a month (worth it for true TV addicts). The company's Live TV offering is considerably more expensive, starting at $77 a month with ads and $90 a month ad-free, but you do get Disney+ and ESPN+ services bundled in. Hulu allows two of your devices to stream at the same time, and you can also download some content for offline viewing. Hulu Live TV subscribers can also pay $10 a month for unlimited streaming at home (and for up to three remote mobile devices).\nGiven that it's one of the longest-running streaming services out there, you can find Hulu apps everywhere, from TVs to set-top boxes. The company has been slow to adopt newer home theater technology, though \u2014 we're still waiting for surround sound on Apple TV and many other devices, and there's no HDR at all. \u2014 Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor\nFree trial: No | Monthly price: Starts at $10/month (with ads) | Annual cost: Starts at $120/year (with ads) | Live TV: No | Local channels: No\nDisney+ came out swinging, leveraging all of the company's popular brands, like Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel. It's your one-stop-shop for everything Disney, making it catnip for kids, parents, animation fans and anyone looking for some classic films from the likes of 20th Century Pictures. And unlike Hulu, which Disney also owns, there aren't any R-rated movies or shows that curious kiddos can come across. It\u2019s just The Mandalorian (and things like it) from here on out.\nGiven the company's new focus on streaming, Disney+ has quickly become a must-have for families. And at $10 a month, it's a lot cheaper than wrangling the kids for a night out at the movies (or even buying one of the Disney's over-priced Blu-rays). You can also get it bundled with ESPN+ and Hulu for $17 a month. Some Verizon FiOS and mobile customers can also get Disney+, Hulu and ESPN for free.\nDisney+ supports four simultaneous streams at once, and also lets you download films and shows for offline viewing. (That's particularly helpful when you're stuck in the car with no cell service and a crying toddler. Trust me.) You can access Disney+ on every major streaming device and most TV brands. While the service launched without support for Amazon Fire TV devices, it's now available there as well. \u2014 D.H.\nFree trial: Yes | Monthly price: $10/month | Annual cost: $120/year | Live TV: No | Local channels: No\nApple spared no expense with its streaming platform, launching with high profile series like The Morning Show. While they weren\u2019t all hits initially (See you later, get it?), Apple TV+ has since amassed a slew of must-watch programming like Ted Lasso, Severance, and For All Mankind. Clearly, the iPhone maker is taking a different approach than Netflix or Disney, with a focus on quality and big celebrity names, rather than bombarding us with a ton of content. But that strategy seems to have paid off.\nFor $10 a month, there\u2019s a ton of great shows and movies to dive into, including a number of National Geographic shows. But if you\u2019re a dedicated Apple user, it may be worth moving up to an Apple One plan, which also bundles Apple Arcade, Apple Music, and 50GB of iCloud storage for $20 a month. Step up to $26 monthly, and you can bring in your whole family with up to 200GB of iCloud storage. And for $38 a month, Apple throws in News+ and Fitness+. \u2013 D.H.\nFree trial: Yes | Monthly price: $73/month | Live TV: Yes | Local channels: Yes\nYouTube TV is a great option for cord cutters who still want to watch live TV without having to sign up for a contract. It carries over 85 different channels, so it\u2019s highly likely that you won\u2019t miss your cable TV or satellite subscription at all if you switch over. YouTube TV even carries your regional PBS channels, which is a rarity on most live TV streaming services.\nWhere YouTube TV really shines is in the live sports department. Not only does it offer sports-carrying channels like CBS, FOX, ESPN, NBC, TBS and TNT, it also offers specific sports coverage networks like the MLB Network, NBA TV and the NFL Network. You can even opt for a Sports Plus package for an additional $11 a month if you want specific sports channels like NFL RedZone, FOX College Sports, GOLTV, FOX Soccer Plus, MAVTV Motorsports Network, TVG and Stadium. Unfortunately, however, YouTube TV recently lost the rights to carry Bally Sports regional networks, which means that you won\u2019t get region-specific channels such as Bally Sports Detroit or Bally Sports Southwest.\nOne particularly strong selling point for sports fans is that instead of always remembering to record a particular game, you can just choose to \u201cfollow\u201d a specific team and the DVR will automatically record all of its games. Plus, if you happen to have jumped into the match late, there\u2019s a \u201ccatch up with key plays\u201d feature that lets you watch all the highlights up until that point so that you\u2019re up to speed.\nYouTube TV is on the expensive side at $73 a month, which might not be much more than your basic cable package. If you want to add 4K viewing (which is currently only available through certain sporting events) plus unlimited streaming, you\u2019d have to cough up an additional $20 a month. But a standard subscription includes channels such as BBC, BET, Comedy Central, the Food Network, MTV, Nickelodeon, USA, and more.\nIt currently offers one of the best cloud DVRs available. YouTube TV\u2019s DVR has unlimited storage plus you have up to nine months to watch your recorded content before they expire. There are also no DVR up-charges here; you can rewind or fast forward through the recorded content as you please by default. We should note, however, that the on-demand content on YouTube TV does have ads which you can\u2019t fast-forward through.\nThere\u2019s also a plethora of premium channels that you can add for as low as $3 per month, such as Showtime, Max, Starz, Cinemax and EPIX. You can also subscribe to an Entertainment Plus bundle that includes Max, Showtime and Starz for $30 a month. Other niche add-ons include CuriosityStream, AMC Premiere, Shudder, Sundance Now, Urban Movie Channel, and Acorn TV. \u2014 N.L.\nFree trial: Yes | Monthly price: $83/month | Live TV: Yes | Local channels: Yes\nAside from on-demand and original content, Hulu also offers a Live TV add-on that lets you stream over 80 channels without a cable or satellite subscription. It\u2019ll cost $83 a month, but that includes access to both Disney+ and ESPN+ (or you can pay $82 monthly for live TV only). For an extra fee, you\u2019ll also be able to watch on-demand shows without any ads, which can\u2019t be said with YouTube TV. Hulu\u2019s Live TV option also has unlimited DVR storage for up to nine months. That includes on-demand playback and fast-forwarding capabilities.\nHulu allows two simultaneous streams per account, but you can pay $15 more if you want unlimited screens (and up to three remote mobile devices). If you want, you can also add premium add-ons to your Hulu plan, such as Max, Cinemax, Showtime, or Starz.\nHulu\u2019s Live TV service is a great option for sports fans, as it has access to a channel lineup that includes CBS, FOX, ESPN, NBC, TBS, TNT and more, all of which should deliver content for fans of most major sports like football, basketball and baseball. However, Hulu plus Live TV does not carry the NBA TV, MLB Network or regional sports networks, so you could miss out on additional sports coverage. \u2014 N.L.\nFree trial: No | Monthly price: $11/month | Annual cost: $110/year | Live TV: Limited | Local channels: No\nWithout a doubt, ESPN\u2019s standalone service is the best deal in sports streaming. No one can compete with the network when it comes to the sheer volume of content. The platform hosts thousands of live college sporting events, plus MLB, MLS, NHL, NBA G League games and more. There\u2019s plenty of pro tennis as well, and ESPN+ is an insane value for soccer fans.\nOn top of select MLS matches, ESPN+ is the US home of the Bundesliga (Germany) and the EFL cup (Carabao Cup). It\u2019s also the spot for the UEFA Nations League international competition in Europe.\nESPN offers a slate of original shows and the full catalog of its 30 For 30 series on the service. And lastly, ESPN+ is the home of UFC. Fight Nights, Dana White\u2019s Contender Series and other shows stream weekly or monthly, plus the app is how you access PPV events.\nThat\u2019s a truckload of sports included in the $11 a month standard plan. If you splurge for the Disney bundle with Disney+ and Hulu (ad-supported), you can get all three for $15 per month. \u2014 Billy Steele, Senior News Editor\nFree trial: Yes | Monthly price: Starts at $8/month (with ads) | Annual cost: Starts at $60/month (with ads) | Live TV: Limited | Local channels: Yes, at an additional cost\nFormerly CBS All Access, Paramount+ may get the most attention for originals like Star Trek: Discovery, Star Trek: Picard and The Twilight Zone, but it\u2019s becoming a sports destination as well. The app began streaming NWSL soccer matches last summer when the league returned to the pitch. CBS also announced that All Access would be the live streaming home of the US women\u2019s league. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t watch every match there, but it\u2019s a start.\nSoon after, CBS added UEFA Champions League and Europa League soccer to its sports slate. The Champions League is the biggest competition in club soccer, pitting teams from various countries around the continent against each other to see who\u2019s the best. Europa League does the same, but with less glory. Paramount+ is now the home of Series A soccer (Italy) and will broadcast CONCACAF World Cup qualifiers, which the US Men\u2019s National Team will participate in.\nAt $8 a month with limited commercials, or $13 a month for the ad-free tier (with Showtime bundled in), Paramount+ isn\u2019t a must have sports destination just yet. You can stream NFL games and more that air on your local CBS station inside the app, but the network is still filling out a well-rounded slate. For now, it\u2019s more of a necessity for soccer fans than anything else. \u2014 B.S.\nFree trial: No | Monthly price: Starts at $8/month (with ads) | Annual cost: Starts at $80/year (with ads) | Live TV: Limited | Local channels: No\nNBC made it clear before Peacock\u2019s debut that Premier League soccer would be available on the standalone service. What we didn\u2019t expect was that the network would put so many games there, basically forcing anyone who\u2019s more than a casual fan to subscribe. This is partially due to PL scheduling. In the US, that means you need the $6/month service and access to NBC Sports network (through cable TV or live TV streaming) to follow comprehensively.\nNBCUniversal had a similar structure in the past where one game per time slot was broadcast on NBC Sports and NBC Sports Gold was used as the overflow. Gold was also the home to cycling, Olympic sports and more. Now the Premier League is being used to push the new service Peacock, and with the current scheduling format, even more games are relegated to streaming only. Thankfully, Peacock does offer match replays, so there\u2019s some added value there if you can\u2019t be parked in front of your TV all day on Saturday and Sunday.\nPeacock also shows coverage of US Open tennis, NFL Wild Card games and will host \u201cselect events\u201d from upcoming Olympics in Tokyo and Beijing. There\u2019s also a smattering of sports talk shows available for free with paid users getting on-demand replays of Triple Crown horse racing and more. \u2014 B.S.\nFree trial: Yes | Monthly price: $11/month | Annual cost: $100/year | Live TV: No | Local channels: No\nWhile it's easy to find modern blockbuster films on Netflix and other streaming services these days, classic cinema is often tougher to find. FilmStruck tried to solve that problem, but it couldn't find a large enough audience to survive. Now there's the Criterion Channel, which delivers a rotating array of its cinephile-approved library for $11 a month or $100 a year. (Where else can you stream something like the incredible ramen noodle Western Tampopo?)\nIt's a service that's built for movie lovers: It's chock full of commentary tracks, conversations with writers and directors, and some of the company's renowned special features. The Criterion Channel also does a far better job at curating viewing options than other services. Its double features, for instance, pair together thematically similar films, like the classic noir entries Phantom Lady and Variety. What\u2019s more, its editors make it easy to find all of the available films from a single director, for all of you auteur theory connoisseurs.\nSure, it costs a bit more than Hulu and Disney+, but The Criterion Channel gives you access to a library that's far more rewarding than the latest streaming TV show. You can watch on up to three devices at once, and there's also offline viewing available for iOS and Android devices. It also supports major streaming devices from Apple, Amazon and Roku, but as far as TV's go, it's only on Samsung's Tizen-powered sets. Unfortunately, The Criterion Channel is only available in the US and Canada, due to licensing restrictions. \u2014 D.H.\nFree trial: Yes | Monthly price: $7/month | Annual cost: $72/year | Live TV: No | Local channels: No\nSometimes, a good horror movie is the only way to deal with the constant anxiety of a potential climate apocalypse and the seeming downfall of modern society. If that describes your personality, it's worth taking a look at Shudder, AMC Network's streaming service dedicated to everything spooky. You'll find plenty of horror classics, like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but Shudder has also gotten into the original content game with unique films like Host, which takes place entirely over a Zoom call.\nIf you're a bit squeamish, Shudder probably won't sell you much on horror. But for fans of the genre, it's a smorgasbord of content to dive into. You can try it out free for seven days, and afterwards it's $7 per month (or $72 annually). Shudder only supports viewing one stream at a time, and there's no support for offline viewing yet. You can find Shudder on major streaming device platforms, but since it's so niche, don't expect to find it on smart TVs anytime soon. \u2014 D.H."

      "text": "Netflix will stream its first NFL games on Christmas Day\nThe three year-deal includes a doubleheader this holiday season.\nAfter dipping its toes into live sports with golf and tennis exhibitions, Netflix is taking a major step forward on that front. The company has locked in a deal with the NFL to air a Christmas Day doubleheader, marking the first time that it will broadcast games from the league. Netflix will stream at least one holiday game in 2025 and 2026 as well. These games won't be blacked out in competing teams' home markets.\nReports last week suggested Netflix was in play for Christmas Day NFL games, and that was seemingly why the league postponed the reveal of its 2024 schedule until today (when Netflix is trying to win over advertisers at its upfront presentation). To that end, it's not yet clear which NFL teams will be the first to square off live on Netflix around the world, though we'll find out when the league releases the schedule at 8PM ET.\nOf course, Netflix isn't the first streaming service to broadcast NFL games. Prime Video has been showing them for years, while YouTube is the home of NFL Sunday Ticket.\nIt's not Netflix's first foray into the NFL as a whole, either. Last year, it debuted Quarterback, a hit unscripted series that followed Patrick Mahomes, Kirk Cousins, and Marcus Mariota during the 2022 season. A self-explanatory follow-up show called Receiver will arrive this summer.\nBefore we get to Christmas Day and Netflix's first NFL games, the company will stream a boxing card featuring Mike Tyson vs. Logan Paul, which is somehow now an official professional fight. The holiday NFL games will also act as something of a warmup for Netflix as the company will start streaming live WWE programming every week in January."

      "text": "The Fallout TV series is V.A.T.S. (a very awesome TV show)\nThis might be the second best video game to TV adaption behind The Last of Us.\nFallout\u2019s transition to TV starts with a bang (or three depending on how you\u2019re counting). But even after the show emerges from the vault, the hits keep coming. That\u2019s because unlike a lot of other video game adaptations that receive a thin veneer designed to appeal to fans of the source material, the essence of Fallout runs so deep throughout this series it could weather an atomic blast. Its characters are magnetic and its visuals are downright impressive. But most importantly, just like HBO\u2019s The Last of Us, Fallout is more than just a video game adaptation. It\u2019s a really good show in its own right \u2013 an apocalyptically good one at that.\nThe first thing that stands out about the show is just how good it looks. Every set and costume is packed with detail. The clean blues and yellow of vaultsuits are the perfect counterpoint to the dilapidated buildings and shaggy clothes of surface dwellers, which look so grimy you can almost feel the rads coming out of your screen. Meanwhile, Fallout\u2019s Power Armor might be some of the best-looking live-action mech-suits this side of Pacific Rim. Locations are also incredibly diverse and fleshed out while still paying homage to the franchise that inspired them. The settlement of Filly looks almost exactly how I imagine Megaton might appear in real life, you know, aside from having a massive bomb in the middle of town. The show\u2019s audio is also a treat, right down to the crunchy sounds of analog electronics and all the rockin\u2019 oldies that wafting in the background (including an obligatory playing of the Inkspots\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t want to set the world on fire\u201d).\nI really liked how all the show\u2019s easter eggs and references to the video game never felt forced. Iconic gadgets like the Pipboy help build the world while simultaneously pushing the plot forward. Even its cinematography makes callbacks to the game with slow-mo that evokes the V.A.T.S. mechanic during firefights. And all the little critters Fallout fans love and hate like rad roaches, irradiated bears and a very good canine companion make appearances that feel right at home.\nOf course, all this would simply be window dressing without characters that bring the world to life. And once again the show doesn\u2019t disappoint. As a vault dweller, Lucy MacLean (played Ella Purnelle) is the perfect foil to ease us into the world of Fallout. As she explores and adapts to the surface, we get to meet an incredible cast of characters who highlight the struggles and revel in the weirdness of a post-doomsday world. I also need to call out the casting of Walton Goggins as the Ghoul, which feels like an especially enlightened choice. This man was made for this role, and even considering some of his previous appearances in Justified and The Hateful Eight, this might be his most engaging performance yet.\nThe most impressive thing about the Fallout show is how it balances several different stories with grace and intrigue. So often when you have branching plotlines, one arc drags while the others shine. But in Fallout, they are woven together so well that even if one scene goes long, the show on the whole never bores. Now I will admit that those new to the franchise may need to be a bit more patient, as Maximus\u2019 arc and the story surrounding the Brotherhood of Steel takes some time to get rolling.\nPerhaps the biggest issue with Fallout is its brutality. This is not a series for the faint of heart. Warning: There is some animal cruelty and there\u2019s so much gore that a regular bullet wound seems tame in comparison. It\u2019s also important to mention that the jump from pixels to live action adds even more impact to this. But coming from a franchise that\u2019s reveled in crass and crudeness since the beginning, it would feel weird any other way.\nAs a fan of the franchise, there\u2019s always a little trepidation when a game tests the waters of a new medium. But Fallout has absolutely nailed it. And looking back, it probably shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise, because unlike Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat whose stories always felt like afterthoughts, it was the world and the characters of Fallout that kept people coming back to the wasteland. While the game may have provided the blueprint to make the show a success, this adaptation can stand on its own.\nThe Fallout series is available to stream today starting at 9PM ET on Amazon Prime Video.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "ESPN vs. ESPN+: What's the difference between the two sports streaming services?\nConfused about sports streaming options? We review the changing ESPN landscape.\nAs every SportsCenter fan knows, ESPN is pretty much a must-have for sports fans. But the question these days might be, \"Which one?\" And we don't just mean The Ocho \u2014 there are already at least seven ESPN channels on many cable systems, and we're about to get more streaming options, too. ESPN announced in mid-May that it will be launching a new direct-to-consumer streaming service for sports fans this fall, which is great news for audiences who want to be able to watch their favorite sports in one place.\nESPN's chairman, Jimmy Pitaro, explained that the streamlined service is meant to help \"fans cut through the clutter,\" but it begs one big question: Doesn't ESPN already have a streaming service with ESPN+? And how will the new platform, which will simply be called ESPN, differ from ESPN+? For some subscribers, there will be no difference at all; for others, it will be a pricier but more comprehensive viewing experience. It all depends on which tier of the service you subscribe to. Here's what you need to know about ESPN's new streaming service.\nWhat is included in ESPN's new streaming service?\nESPN recently announced that it will be launching a new streaming service, also called ESPN. This service will be divided into two tiers: the ESPN Unlimited package and the ESPN Select package.\nESPN Unlimited, as the name suggests, will include access to all of ESPN's linear networks: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, ACCN, ESPNews and ESPN Deportes, plus access to programming on ABC, ESPN+, ESPN3, SECN+ and ACCNX. It's effectively \"cable ESPN, but via streaming.\" That means fans will get coverage of more than 47,000 live events each year, on-demand replays, original programming and more.\nESPN Select is essentially the new name for ESPN+. The service will still provide exclusive access to many events, and will simulcast certain sports that air on other channels and offer PPV access to UFC fights, but will not feature the robust programming of Unlimited.\nESPN+ has thousands of exclusive live events, original studio shows and acclaimed series that aren't on the ESPN networks. ESPN+ allows subscribers to purchase UFC PPV events and access an extensive archive of on-demand content (including the entire 30 For 30 library, select ESPN Films, game replays and more). Whether you purchase a standalone plan, add-on or Disney Bundle plan, the service provides access to thousands of sports events for $11.99/month or $119.99/year.\nExisting ESPN+ subscribers will notice their plans change to ESPN Select when the new service launches in September.\nCan I get ESPN for free?\nIf you subscribe to ESPN via most cable, satellite or streaming packages, you can already authenticate in the ESPN app. This ability will carry over to the new ESPN offering, so you'll continue to have access to the full range of streaming ESPN channels, as well as any of the new app features. In other words, whether you subscribe to ESPN via cable or the new ESPN Unlimited streaming product, you'll have access to the same programming and options online.\nAt the moment, there is no information about whether the new ESPN plan will offer a free trial period.\nWhat does the new ESPN streaming service cost?\nThanks to bundling options within the wider family of Disney streaming apps, you'll be able to get ESPN at several price levels:\nESPN Unlimited as a standalone plan for $29.99/month or $299.99 for the year, no cable subscription required. Remember, that includes access to every ESPN broadcast network as well as all content that's currently streamed on the ESPN+ service.\nESPN Unlimited can be bundled with Disney+ and Hulu starting at $35.99/month (with ads on Disney+/Hulu) or $44.99/month (no ads on Disney+/Hulu). Subscribers can get a special limited-time deal when the platform launches and pay $29.99/month for the first 12 months for a Disney+, Hulu, ESPN Unlimited bundle (with ads on Disney+/Hulu).\nESPN Select (basically just a new name for ESPN+) will still cost $11.99/month or $119.99/annually. A Disney+, Hulu, ESPN Select bundle will cost $16.99/month (with ads on Disney+/Hulu) or $26.99/month (no ads on Disney+/Hulu).\nWhen is the new ESPN streaming service available?\nThe launch date for the new ESPN service is September 2025. Keep that timing in mind if you plan to sign up and take advantage of the special pricing available at the platform's launch.\nHow do I enroll in the new ESPN streaming service?\nIf you're a subscriber to ESPN+ (either with a standalone subscription or as part of a Disney+/Hulu bundle), you don't have to lift a finger \u2014 you will automatically be enrolled in the new Select plan at no additional cost. Standalone ESPN+ subscribers get the ESPN Select plan, and Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ bundle subscribers get the ESPN Select bundle. If you want to upgrade, you can do so when the platform launches.\nIf you want to subscribe to the Unlimited plan, you can do so when the plan launches by signing in on either ESPN.com, the ESPN App on mobile and connected TV devices.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "Sure, 'Max' sounds dumb, but HBO Max needed a reboot\nWB needed a big change, it doesn't matter what it's called.\nThere are many things I think of when I hear the name \"Max.\" There's Max Headroom, the '80s AI icon that's been on my mind a lot lately. Mad Max! Max Payne! Every friend I've ever had named Max (whose names I've always been jealous of). Even Homer Simpson's alternate persona, Max Power. But there's no universe where I associate \"Max\" with HBO, even though we've been living with \"HBO Max\" for years. \"HBO\" was always the dominant part of that name, whereas \"Max\" felt like a vestigial remnant from its sister network Cinemax.\nSo I'm sure that many viewers will be surprised to learn that HBO Max will be rebranded as \"Max\" on May 23rd. Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav, who spearheaded the $43 billion merger between WB and his previous company Discovery, announced the new service during a media event this morning. It's been a year since Zaslav finalized that merger and announced his intentions to combine each network's content. And, given the increasingly volatile world of streaming media, he likely had to move quickly. But the rebranding seems like a missed opportunity to align the new service with something people already know and love.\nNow, to be clear, Zaslav's desire to build something new makes sense. HBO Max's May 2020 launch was notoriously rocky, so much so that it led to a round of executive firings. HBO Max was a blatant attempt to catch up with Disney+, which hit 10 million subscribers just a day after its debut. But it couldn't compete with Disney's seemingly limitless library of content. A month after HBO Max arrived, AT&T (TimeWarner's owner at the time) said the service only had 4.1 million active users. The company tried to make it seem more popular by saying it had 23.6 million \"wholesale\" subscribers, but those were mostly existing HBO customers who had never touched the HBO Max app.\nAs a relatively new Warner Bros. leader, Zaslav likely wanted to make a mark with a service of his very own. (Media executives just can't help themselves, remember Jeffrey Katzenberg's Quibi?) So long HBO Max, hello something that combines HBO's prestigious content with Discovery's vast library of unscripted reality shows. During today's media event, Warner Bros. executives stressed that the company wanted to highlight HBO's world-renowned branding \u2014 \"HBO is not TV, HBO is HBO!\" someone proclaimed boldly. But they also hinted that the company didn't want to stuff too much into \"HBO\" as a concept.\nI also bet that Zaslav and crew talked to plenty of advisors and focus groups who made it clear that HBO would never be considered as family-friendly as Disney. A cautious parent may not want to subscribe to an HBO service, even if it was the only way to watch a new Discovery series for kids. As one WB executive pointed out, the company used to see double-digit shares of kids programming across their many networks, but that's \"virtually disappeared\" in the streaming era.\nWith the Max refresh, Warner Bros. is trying to fix many of HBO Max's underlying problems. The company says it's aiming to increase engagement (having a ton of new content helps!), enhance retention, strengthen performance and optimize monetization. A carousel of personalized recommendations should help to surface content users may ignore, and WB says Max will also be able to alert people if their subscription payments fail. These are basic features for any modern subscription service, so it's shocking to learn that HBO Max couldn't manage them on its own.\nOf course, WB is also trying to \"optimize monetization\" by raising the subscription cost for 4K viewers. If you want to see Game of Thrones or the upcoming Flash movie in 4K, you'll need to spend $4 more for Max's \"Ultimate tier.\" That's similar to Netflix's 4K strategy, so it's not entirely surprising, but it's still annoying.\nLet me be truly cynical: It doesn't really matter what Max is called. We're awash in terribly-named streaming services, like Peacock and Paramount+. It would have been nice to see WB highlight one of its most prominent properties, but lopping off the first half of HBO Max probably makes more sense than trying to hype up another ridiculous media name (Hulu somehow made it work, but Quibi will forever sound dumb).\nNo matter what it's called, we'll still rush to Max to catch the latest episode of Succession or The Last of Us. In this era of streaming networks dumping mountains of content on us, it's somewhat refreshing to have premium shows airing weekly. That gives us time to truly absorb major events (like the most recent Succession shocker), and space to anticipate what comes next. Ultimately, that's HBO's superpower, and Zaslav knows it. When combined with the onslaught of cheap and addictive content from Discovery, he might be able to turn Max into a true Disney+ competitor.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "Amazon's Freevee is adding free MGM and Warner Bros. Discovery channels\nThe service now offers hundreds of ad-supported, cable-style channels.\nAmazon's Freevee is continuing to expand its lineup of cable-style streaming channels. The platform currently has more than 280 free, ad-supported TV (FAST) channels and it's adding more from MGM and Warner Bros. Discovery.\nTwelve MGM channels are coming to the service over the next few months, including one called MGM Presents and others dedicated to action and sci-fi shows and movies. There will be channels focused on individual shows, including The Pink Panther, Stargate, Green Acres and The Outer Limits. There are already dedicated channels for the likes of Paternity Court, In the Heat of the Night, The Addams Family and Teen Wolf.\nAmazon bought MGM last year, and spinning up FAST channels to monetize the studio's wealth of films and TV shows makes a lot of sense. Perhaps there'll be a James Bond one at some point too.\nMeanwhile, Freevee is adding 11 FAST channels from Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) this month. They'll include reality and documentary shows such as Cake Boss, Extreme Couponing, Ghost Brothers, Paranormal Lockdown, Say Yes to the Dress and Long Lost Family.\nWBD has made a push into FAST channels in recent months in an attempt to generate more revenue. It pulled shows such as Westworld and The Nevers from its own Max streaming service to offer those titles (and others) for free on FAST channels on the likes of Roku and Tubi.\nYou'll be able to access all of these channels through the Freevee app, Fire TV and Prime Video (you don't need an Amazon Prime subscription to watch them). Earlier this year, Amazon said it would make more than 100 Prime Video shows and movies available for free through Freevee's channels."

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nFubo raises prices on all English-language plans\nThe hikes come a few weeks after the announcement of a planned merger with Disney\u2019s Hulu + Live TV.\nIn the latest riveting episode of Everything Costs More, Fubo raised the prices of all of its English-language plans by $5 for new customers. The hike includes Fubo\u2019s Essential plan, which only launched in early December.\nIn a statement to The Streamable (which first reported the news), Fubo blamed the fee hikes on increased programming costs. \u201cThe regular prices of the English-language plans have increased $5 due to rising costs from our programming partners,\u201d a spokesperson wrote. \u201cWe only make adjustments when necessary, and we\u2019re committed to keeping Fubo competitive while ensuring our subscribers have access to the channels, features and live events they enjoy.\u201d\nThe changes now put Fubo\u2019s cheapest plan (the aforementioned Essential bundle) at $85 monthly, slightly more than YouTube TV\u2019s $83. The latter raised its fees by $10 per month in early December \u2014 up from the $35 monthly price it debuted with in 2017.\nIn addition to Fubo\u2019s $85 Essential plan, the streamer offers a Pro plan that technically costs the same. But its angle is that, unlike Essentials, it includes regional sports networks, which add mandatory fees of up to $16 per month to the base price. Essentials gives you the option of skipping the RSNs and their fees if you aren\u2019t worried about losing many of your local teams\u2019 games. (Yes, live-streaming TV is often now as much of a confusing mess as traditional cable.)\nFubo Elite, which now costs $95 monthly (plus RSN fees), includes 78 extra channels \u2014 like The Cooking Channel, NBA TV and MLB TV. Fubo also offers a $33 Spanish-language Latino plan with networks such as ESPN Deportes, Cine Latino and Nat Geo Mundo. It was the only subscription tier spared from the price hikes.\nAlthough Fubo is arguably the best live TV service for sports, it has some significant missing pieces compared to rivals like YouTube TV. Notable omissions are channels from Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN, TNT, TBS, HGTV, Discovery, Food Network and more), A&E and AMC.\nTo ease the blow (very briefly), Fubo is offering savings to new subscribers on their first month of service. New signups get $25 off their first month of the Essential plan and $20 off Elite or Pro. Meanwhile, you can save $8 on the Latino plan. Just remember that the full prices will kick in after that single discounted month.\nEarlier this month, Fubo and Disney agreed to merge the streaming service with Hulu + Live TV. If the deal gets shareholder and regulatory approval, it will create a new entity (under the Fubo brand) to manage both services. At least the initial promise is that the two services will continue to operate independently. Disney will own 70 percent of the new company, while Fubo will have 30 percent. The two products currently boast a combined six million subscribers."

      "text": "Apple TV's MLS Season Pass subscriptions have doubled since Messi's arrival in the US\nThe Inter Miami player is quickly helping to grow the profile of soccer in North America.\nLionel Messi has hit the ground running in Major League Soccer, and he's boosting Apple's bottom line in the process. Tickets for Inter Miami games have soared in price since Messi, the greatest soccer player of his generation and arguably the best of all time, joined the team several weeks ago. On top of that, subscriptions to Apple TV's MLS Season Pass have more than doubled since the former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain star started plying his trade in the US in July.\nThat's according to Jorge Mas, one of Inter Miami's owners. Mas added that \"Spanish language viewership on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV has surpassed over 50 percent for Messi matches and continues to rise,\" underscoring the player's popularity in the Spanish-speaking community. Apple CEO Tim Cook retweeted Mas' comments, indicating that Mas' claims are genuine (Apple's PR team has been drawing attention to the tweet as well).\nThe company hasn't disclosed how many subscribers the service has, though reports in July suggested the number was nearing 1 million before Messi's arrival. In any case, Apple is evidently pleased by Messi's impact on MLS Season Pass.\n\"For MLS, we could not be happier with how the partnership is going,\" Cook said on an Apple earnings call last week. \"It's clearly in the early days, but we are beating our expectation in terms of subscribers, and the fact that Messi went to Inter Miami helped us out there a bit. And so we're very excited about it.\"\nApple, which dropped the price of the subscription from $99 to $49 for the second half of the season, is said to be paying $250 million a year for the MLS broadcast rights. Messi is reportedly taking a cut of revenue from new MLS Season Pass subscribers as part of his Inter Miami contract.\nMessi has hit the ground running in Miami. He has scored seven goals and contributed three assists in four games, all of which Miami won. Before he joined the team, Miami was on an 11-game winless streak.\nAlthough he's 36, an age when most soccer players are winding down their careers, Messi is still going strong. He led Argentina to the biggest prize in the game, the World Cup, last December and helped PSG win back-to-back French league championships before moving to the US. As a result, Messi is the overwhelming favorite to win the Ballon d'Or, arguably the most prestigious individual award in soccer, for a record-extending eighth time.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "Letter from the YouTube CEO: 4 Big bets for 2024\nFeb 06, 2024 \u2013 [[read-time]] minute read\nFeb 06, 2024 \u2013 [[read-time]] minute read\nSince the very first upload, YouTube has opened up a new way to tell stories. Suddenly anyone with a story could find an audience. And they did just that. People filmed in their kitchens, their bedrooms, and even their backyards. Along the way, they built communities that stretched across the globe.\nYouTube took this creativity one step further by making a big bet: we decided to share revenue with creators. Since then, the growth of the creator economy has been incredible. More people created content on YouTube last year than ever before. And we\u2019ve hit a new milestone. Today more than 3 million channels are in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), which gives creators ways to earn money on YouTube. YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, and we paid over $70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last three years.\nNow generative AI is driving another evolution that raises critical questions about how we express creativity. As we move forward, we\u2019ll continue to embrace partnership. We\u2019ll develop entirely new ways of empowering creative expression, managing rights, and driving revenue for our partners.\nWe\u2019re at a key moment in history and I\u2019m excited about what lies ahead. Today I\u2019m sharing how we\u2019re thinking about these changes, my vision for 2024, and four big bets we\u2019re making across YouTube.\nI\u2019ve spent my career at the intersection of tech and creativity, and I recognize both the potential and the questions we face with generative AI. The good news is that YouTube has spent years tackling complex content challenges from monetization to rights management to protecting our community.\nWe\u2019re approaching advances in AI with the same mission that launched YouTube years ago. We want to help everyone create. AI should empower human creativity, not replace it. And everyone should have access to AI tools that will push the boundaries of creative expression.\nWe recently announced new AI experiments that demonstrate this drive to innovate. Dream Screen is scaling creativity by giving anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube Shorts. It lets you create anything you can imagine by just typing in an idea, like a popcorn volcano or a disco forest. And through our Music AI Incubator, we\u2019re hearing feedback from artists about the ways AI can supercharge their creative process. Last year, we shared Dream Track, one of the first experiments as we explore the possibilities of AI in music in collaboration with partners across the industry. See how it\u2019s going so far.\nWe\u2019re leveling the playing field and developing AI tools that empower everyone. Our commitment to democratizing access to AI builds on the ways we\u2019re enabling everyone to share fun videos right from their phones with Shorts. The next generation of storytellers has the power to create in the palm of their hands. Shorts is an easy way for anyone to get started, and AI innovation will make it possible for even more people to create. I love seeing how people use Shorts to participate in cultural moments. Shorts is averaging over 70 billion daily views, and the number of channels uploading Shorts has grown 50% year over year.\nThis year, we\u2019ll continue to ensure AI is in service of creativity through our work with creative industries, in the rollout of AI-powered features, and as we unlock opportunities while building out appropriate protections.\nShorts is averaging over 70 billion daily views, and the number of channels uploading Shorts has grown 50% year over year.\nOver the years, creators have built a name for themselves. They\u2019re entertaining people around the world, making us laugh, and bringing us together. They\u2019re also doing something even bigger. They\u2019re redefining the future of the entertainment industry with top-notch storytelling that can\u2019t be dismissed as simply \u201cuser-generated content.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just the entertainment industry that\u2019s taking note. World leaders are also tapping into the wide reach of creators. Last fall at the APEC Economic Leaders\u2019 Week in San Francisco, government officials like the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Secretary of Commerce sat down with creators, including Toby Hendy, Liah Yoo, and Humphrey Yang, to connect with their audiences. I had the opportunity to watch some of these conversations in person \u2013 it\u2019s great to see leaders understand the value of creators.\nCreators are truly entrepreneurs, and we\u2019re helping them diversify the ways they make money on YouTube. We\u2019re investing in ways creators earn money while helping viewers shop for products. And viewers are directly supporting their favorite creators through fan funding features like channel memberships. The number of creators using memberships increased more than 50% last year, and creators are seeing the impact of fan funding. Like Narae is Consulting, who leaned into memberships to draw more viewers to her career development content. And Emily D. Baker, whose membership earnings grew more than 50% last year. The majority of Emily\u2019s YouTube revenue now comes from memberships.\nWe\u2019re also working behind the scenes to support creators through programs like the Creator Collective, which brings creators together to share experiences, build community, and collaborate. We launched a pilot of this program last year in eight countries and we\u2019ve heard helpful feedback from creators.\nThis year, we\u2019ll help policymakers and partners across the industry see the economic and entertainment value that creators bring to the table. Being a creator is a full time job with an international audience, but most governments don\u2019t account for creators in their labor data. We believe creators should be recognized for their work and creators at the top of their game should be acknowledged in key industry forums.\nWhen I started at YouTube, people thought about content from major studios and content from creators as entirely different, but today that stark divide is gone. Viewers want everything in one place, from a live sports game to the BBC to Khan Academy and NikkieTutorials. And they\u2019re watching YouTube the way we used to sit down together for traditional TV shows \u2013 on the biggest screen in the home with friends and family. Their numbers are impressive. Viewers globally now watch more than 1 billion hours on average of YouTube content on their TVs every day. According to Nielsen's report on streaming in the U.S., YouTube was the leader in streaming watchtime for the past 11 months.\nCreators are thinking about how to optimize their content for the living room, and it\u2019s easy to see why \u2013 it\u2019s where their audience is watching! In the last three years, the number of top creators that received the majority of their watchtime on the big screen increased more than 400%.1 Like creators Ms Rachel and SypherPK, whose living room watchtime doubled in the second half of last year. And it might not be what you\u2019d expect, but people like watching Shorts on their TVs!\nWe\u2019re bringing everything viewers love about YouTube to the living room experience. And that includes sports. We just wrapped our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket, and it really shows the future of YouTube. We\u2019re bringing all of the content people want to see, like commentary from creators such as Deestroying and the Kelce brothers\u2019 New Heights podcast.\nWe\u2019re also seeing growing consumer interest in our subscription services. We\u2019re excited to announce that we have more than 8 million subscribers to YouTube TV. And we passed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers, including trials. Music subscriptions help us deliver on our goal to be the best place for artists to connect with fans, from insider access to Coachella to Shorts challenges with NewJeans, Dua Lipa, Tate McRae, and more.\nThis year, we\u2019ll continue to deliver a best in class experience for subscriptions and YouTube in the living room.\nAs we work across all of these priorities, our number one commitment is to responsibly protect the YouTube community. Our business as a streaming service relies not just on engagement, but on giving viewers and advertisers confidence that they can count on us to deliver high quality content. Protecting the creator economy is foundational to everything we do, and it\u2019s good for business.\nProtecting the creator economy is foundational to everything we do, and it\u2019s good for business.\nIt\u2019s important that we create a healthy online experience for kids. As I watch my own kids use technology at home, I\u2019m reminded how many families come to YouTube every day to help their kids with everything from homework to tutorials for new hairstyles. Our youth products reach more than 100 million active viewers every month, and we\u2019re supporting the growth of kids and teens thoughtfully and in coordination with parenting and mental health experts.\nAnother way we uphold our responsibility is connecting people with high quality information. This is more important than ever as elections take place across the globe - more than 50 countries will hold elections this year. We\u2019re ensuring that when people look for election news on YouTube, authoritative sources are prominent in their searches and recommendations. We spent years investing in a playbook to responsibly manage content on YouTube including longstanding, rigorously enforced policies against hate speech, incitement to violence, election interference, and more. We quickly evolve and adapt when new challenges emerge, and we\u2019ll do so again as generative AI makes more sophisticated deepfakes possible and raises new questions. Not only do all of our existing policies apply to synthetically generated content, we\u2019ll also add new layers of transparency and protections. For example, in the coming months, we\u2019ll introduce labels that inform viewers when the realistic content they\u2019re seeing is synthetic.\nWe\u2019re focused on our responsibility efforts in every aspect of our work, and we\u2019ll continue to make investments in the teams and technologies that protect the YouTube community.\nThese are four big bets we\u2019re making in 2024, but our work doesn\u2019t end there. We\u2019re creating the best possible experiences on YouTube, whether you\u2019re learning something new, checking out a podcast, or watching your favorite gaming creator\u2019s livestream. Most of the innovations we work on every day don\u2019t make headlines, but they deliver on our mission to help people connect through stories.\nOf course, none of this would be possible without our creators, viewers, advertisers, and partners. Thanks to this amazing community for everything you do to help people around the world come together on YouTube every day. I look forward to seeing what you\u2019ll all do next.\n1. For creators with more than 100k hours of watchtime a month."

      "text": "A live CNN streaming channel is coming to Max in September\nHere\u2019s hoping it fares better than CNN+.\nCNN+ lasted barely over a month before Warner Bros. Discovery pulled the plug last year amid reports of abysmally lower viewer numbers. But the company still thinks there\u2019s room for live news from CNN on a streaming service.\nIt\u2019s bringing CNN Max to all Max tiers in the US at no extra cost on September 27th. The new round-the-clock service will \u201cbe part of an open beta for news that will enable experimentation with product features, content offerings and original storytelling, all with the input and feedback from the Max community,\" WBD said in a press release.\nCNN Max will feature original programming, as well as live programs from CNN US and CNN International. New shows include CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta, Rahel Solomon, Amara Walker and Fredricka Whitfield and CNN Newsroom with Jim Sciutto. The streaming channel will feature several CNN tentpoles as well, like Amanpour, Anderson Cooper 360, The Lead with Jake Tapper and The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\nMeanwhile, WBD will rename Max\u2019s CNN Originals hub to CNN Max. Non-news CNN programming like Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown and Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy will be available through this hub, along with the new 24/7 channel and more than 900 episodes of new and classic programming.\nCNN Max is perhaps a less-risky bet for WBD than CNN+. CNN sank hundreds of millions of dollars into that endeavor. CNN+ was more personality-centric, while it seems CNN Max will be aligned with CNN proper\u2019s approach to news. Having a blend of CNN and original programming should help keep costs down too."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nThe best streaming devices for 2025\nFrom sticks to dongles to set-top boxes, there are media streaming devices for every budget.\nMost TVs on the market today are smart TVs \u2014 but there are still a few compelling reasons to get a streaming device. These sticks and set-top boxes let you access a user interface that might be easier to suss out than the built-in one on your set. In the case of older or cheaper TVs, a streaming device could make your TV feel faster, too. You may also find streaming sticks convenient for travel, letting you access all your streaming services on a hotel or Vrbo TV set without typing in a ton of passwords. We tested out streaming players from Roku, Google, Apple, Amazon and more, gauging the usability and the performance of each one to help you find the best streaming device for your cord-cutting needs.\nTable of contents\nBest streaming devices for 2025\nOperating system: Google TV | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 5, Ethernet | Voice control: Yes (Google Assistant) | Resolution: 4K | Supported formats: HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos | Smart home compatibility: Google Home | Ambient Mode: Yes | Headphone compatible: Yes, wireless | TV power/volume control: Yes\nRead our full Google TV streamer review\nThe Google Chromecast product line was replaced with the Google TV Streamer in September of 2024. There\u2019s no HD model, only 4K this time around and the going price is $100, which is double the price of the most recent 4K Chromecast. Instead of a dongle that hides behind your TV, it\u2019s now a set-top wedge.\nInside, there\u2019s a faster processor, which kept up with my scattered testing methods \u2014 opening and closing apps then reloading them immediately \u2014 with no trouble. The Apple TV 4K is still the fastest of the streamers I\u2019ve tried, but I don\u2019t think the speed here will disappoint most people. The storage has jumped up to 32GB from a skimpy 8GB on the Chromecast and the memory is doubled at 4GB. It supports up to 4K/60fps video with HDR, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. Audio formats include Dolby Digital and Dolby Atmos along with spatial audio if you\u2019re wearing the Pixel Buds Pro.\nThe remote control is compact and streamlined; the D-pad handles navigation, play, pause and rewind. Of course there\u2019s also a back button (as you\u2019d find on any good Android device). And if you ever lose the pill-shaped remote, you can push a button on the back of the set-top wedge to make it ring.\nGoogle has made its Home app an integral part of the streamer. Not only will you use it to set up your device, but you can also use the streamer to view a slideout home panel on your TV screen (that looks a lot like the Favorites tab in the app). The panel lets you control your compatible smart home devices so you can set temperatures, turn off lights, view feeds and so on. You can even do so while you\u2019re watching something if you program the star button on the remote to pull up the Home panel.\nWhat really makes the Google TV 4K Streamer the best for all-in-one steaming is the interface. It\u2019s basically the same as what you'll find on any TV set or screen that comes with Google TV built in. I find Google\u2019s presentation to be the best at pulling together content from different streaming apps into one useful and intuitive menu. It\u2019ll track what you\u2019ve been watching across different platforms so you can easily dive back in, and the recommendations are pulled fairly equitably from across your subscribed services.\nOf course, no big tech company can release a product today without some AI contrivance and it comes here in the form of computer-generated plot and audience review summaries for titles. It\u2019ll also generate screensaver images based on your prompts. Those are fine and all, though probably not worth it. The real reason to go for the Google TV Streamer is the helpful interface combined with performance that\u2019s faster than most of the sticks on the market. And if you\u2019re someone who uses Google Home for your smart home control, you\u2019ll get even more out of this device.\n- Excellent interface combines all streaming content equally\n- Useful smart home control with a slide-out paneluseful\n- Attractive device with a great remote\n- Required HDMI cable issold separately\n- Double the price of its predecessor\nOperating system: Roku OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 5 | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: 4K, HDR | Smart home compatibility: Roku Smart Home, Alexa, HomeKit, Google Home | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, wireless via Roku app | TV power/volume control: Yes\nRead our full Roku Streaming Stick Plus review\nBelieve it or not, the streaming world has enough free content to keep even the most voracious watchers entertained \u2014 and the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is probably the best way to access it. Roku\u2019s interface is uncluttered, with a simple list at the left and an app grid on the right. Two of those list items, Live TV and Featured Free, are stuffed with free content, both on linear channels and video-on-demand (VOD) services. The Roku Channel app adds thousands more series, films, Roku Originals and live channels to watch without subscribing to a dang thing.\nRoku updated its streaming device selection this year and now there are five in total, with one Streambar, the set-top Roku Ultra and three Streaming Sticks. The $40 Streaming Stick Plus is a direct replacement for the Roku Streaming Stick 4K and it has the best mix of features for the price. The slim design hides behind your TV and doesn\u2019t require power from a wall outlet, just a USB port on your TV. It supports 4K and HDR as well as Apple Air Play 2 and works with Alexa, HomeKit, Google Home and Roku Home. The included voice remote can control your TVs power and volume as well.\nIt doesn\u2019t support Dolby Vision and lacks the Wi-Fi extender that the Streaming Stick 4K has built in. If your TV can display that higher picture quality or if your Wi-Fi signal could use a boost in getting to your TV, you might want to upgrade to the 4K model.\nI find Roku's universal search function to be accurate when looking for specific titles; pushing the Voice button and saying \u201cPoker Face\u201d brings up results for the Peacock show, the Russell Crowe movie and a poker documentary from a free channel. Saying \u201cSuccession\u201d gets you the show from Max as well as listings for other series and films with \u201csuccess\u201d in the title. It was pretty good at finding suggestions for more general searches, like \u201cpolice procedural shows\u201d and \u201cIdris Elba,\u201d though it had issues with recommendations for kids movies (not enough Disney+ results, in my opinion).\nNavigation is speedy with minimal load times between apps. The remote has a nice layout with a large back button and the volume rocker on the side. The handy Instant Replay button jumps back 10 to 20 seconds and can even show subtitles for the replayed portion, if the app supports it. The only thing I didn\u2019t love was the What to Watch menu, which was overwhelmingly populated with free content and had a minimal amount of titles sprinkled in from my paid apps. But since free content is where Roku really shines, I can\u2019t be too miffed. \u2014 A.S.\n- Built-in access to tons of free content\n- Accurate universal search\n- Supports 4K, HDR, TV controls and voice input\n- Doesn't require a wall adapter for power\n- What to Watch menu ignores content from other streamers\nOperating system: Fire TV OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 1080p | Supported formats: HDR10+ | Smart home compatibility: Alexa | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, wireless | TV power/volume control: Yes\nTowards the end of 2024, Amazon replaced the Fire TV Stick Lite and the standard Fire TV Stick with the Fire TV Stick HD. It has the same internal hardware and supports the same 1080p at 60 fps as the Lite but the remote can now control the power and volume on your TV \u2014 something the Lite couldn't do.\nThe price went up by $5 as well, making the list price $35. Still, as it's often on sale for $25 and lower, it's one of the cheaper streaming sticks on the market. We tested the original Lite model for this guide, and our biggest complaint was the lack of control for our TV's power and volume \u2014 using two remotes was a tad annoying, so it's good to see that flaw remedied. If you don't have a 4K TV, or don't watch a ton of 4K content, this will save you a good chunk of change over the $50 Fire TV Stick 4K.\nThe HD's remote not only controls the TV, it also lets you use Alexa to search for shows and ask general questions like the weather forecast or the latest scores for your favorite sports team. Amazon\u2019s Fire TV interface supports all of the major streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, Max, YouTube and Live TV providers like Sling, YouTube TV and Fubo.\nDespite its low price, the Fire TV Stick HD is a decent streaming dongle. It comes with the updated Fire TV interface that has user profiles and and a navigation that's better at integrating different content that it was before. Finding apps and shows is easy enough, though the layout isn\u2019t as unified as Google TV\u2019s and is more complicated than Roku\u2019s. One thing to note is that Amazon's interface prioritizes Prime Video content, and you'll see a lot more ads here than on other streaming platforms.\n- Affordable\n- Supports all major streaming services\n- Updated remote can control your TV's power and volume\n- No 4K content support\n- UI heavily favors Amazon Prime Video content\nOperating system: Roku OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 5 | Voice control: No | Resolution: up to 1080p | Supported formats: HD | Smart home compatibility: Alexa, HomeKit, Google Home, Roku Home | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, via Roku app | TV power/volume control: Yes\nThe Roku Express was replaced by this Streaming Stick earlier this year. It has the same interface as all Roku devices, which we find easy to navigate and particularly good at letting you access free and live content. This model doesn\u2019t support 4K or HDR but, unlike the retired Express model, the remote supports voice input and can control your TV\u2019s power and volume. If you don\u2019t have a 4K TV and all you need is a capable HD streaming device at a low price, the $30 Streaming Stick fits the bill. \u2014A.S.\n- Affordable\n- Lots of free and live content\n- No 4K streaming support\n- No voice remote\nOperating system: Roku OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, HDR10+ | Smart home compatibility: Roku Home, HomeKit, Alexa, Google Home | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, Bluetooth | TV power/volume control: Yes\nRoku updated its most advanced streamer, the Roku Ultra, in 2024, giving it a faster processor, Wi-Fi 6 compatibility and a brand new remote. Like the previous generation, it supports 4K HDR10/10+ streaming, 100 Mbps Ethernet connection, Bluetooth streaming, AirPlay2 connectivity and voice commands with Alexa, Google Home and Roku Smart Home. The previous model had a microSD slot for external media, now there\u2019s a USB port for local playback.\nI used the Ultra for about a month and was impressed with the speed, image quality and the new remote \u2014 plus a couple of perks I hadn\u2019t expected. The 4K TV I used for testing was new to me and whoever had watched it before had set it to 1080p. During setup, the Ultra prompted me to head to the TVs settings to adjust the video quality. It was a nice touch and not something all players do.\nFlipping from app to app was nearly instantaneous. Changing my mind with the back button immediately returned to the home screen. I experienced no buffering issues or audio synching troubles and pairing up Bluetooth headphones was fast with glitch-free performance.\nI really liked the new remote. Pick it up and the backlight kicks in, making it easy to control in a darkened room. Since it's equipped with an always-on mic for hands-free voice control (you can turn it off right on the remote) you can say, \u201cHey Roku, where\u2019s the remote?\u201d and it\u2019ll start ringing. Even with the Roku and TV off, you can just say \u201cHey Roku, open Netflix\u201d to turn on your TV and start up the app. A backlight and always-on feature will obviously drain the battery quicker, but in a month of using the remote, I only had to recharge it once, which is easy to do via USB-C.\nThe voice control function didn\u2019t perform more complicated functions as easily, though. With the TV off, I asked it to continue playing a show I\u2019d been watching and it turned on my PS5. While on the Roku home screen, I asked it to continue playing Gravity Falls, and was told there was no content to continue playing, even though my kid had been watching the show the day before. I often had better luck just holding down the mic button and speaking a search request as I\u2019m used to doing with other players. The search function was accurate most of the time, presenting the correct movie or show and taking me to the app when I clicked on what I wanted.\nOf course, as we said about the other Roku device on our list, the OS here is best at finding and presenting free and live content, with a live TV channel guide, a Featured Free content tab, a What to Watch section packed with stuff from no-cost providers like Tubi, plus the brand\u2019s own Roku Channel. If you\u2019re a fan of the Roku experience and want to get the most out of a higher-end TV, the Ultra is the set-top box to get. \u2014 A.S.\n- Excellent remote\n- High-quality video and audio\n- Lots of access to free and live content\n- USB port for playing local media\n- HDMI cable is included\n- Voice control struggles with complex requests\n- Interface is better at free content than organizing your paid apps\nOperating system: Apple tvOS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, Apple Lossless | Smart home compatibility: HomeKit | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, via Bluetooth, Spatial Audio avail. with AirPods | TV power/volume control: Yes\nWhen my colleague Devindra Hardawar reviewed the latest gen of the Apple TV 4K upon its debut in 2022, he called it \u201cthe best streaming box by a long shot.\u201d In terms of picture quality, speed, longevity and Apple-engineered extras, that remains accurate. The set-top box supports 4K Dolby Vision and HDR10+, which makes compatible content look, to borrow Devindra\u2019s term, glorious.\nThe A15 Bionic chip inside enables near-instantaneous loading of and switching between apps. Zooming from the beginning of an episode to the end or anywhere in between is not only quick, but also quite easy to do once you get the hang of the touch-sensitive directional pad on the Siri remote. Apple improved the box hardware over the previous generation, too, with a smaller, fan-less design.\nYou don\u2019t have to be an Apple devotee to appreciate the streaming box, but having an iPhone makes setup easier, letting you hold your iOS handset near the device to transfer credentials. If you use the Fitness+ app with an Apple Watch, not only can you watch workouts on a big screen, you\u2019ll see live heart rate stats splashed in the corner as well. The app library is extensive, covering all of the most popular streaming services, plus countless Apple Arcade and other games. The remote\u2019s Siri button lets you easily search for stuff to watch with voice commands, and typically gets you to the right app immediately. I found it nearly as good as other devices in suggesting content for more general queries like \u201csci-fi space movies.\u201d\nIf you were waiting for the \u201cbut,\u201d here it is: the Apple TV 4K is expensive. The base model is $129, which comes with 32GB of storage. The 128GB model goes for $149 and adds an Ethernet port and acts as a Thread-enabled home hub, a requirement for certain smart home devices. Also, if you\u2019re looking for lots of free channels and live programming with an all-in-one home page to unify your disparate streaming subscriptions, this isn\u2019t quite it.\nThe Apple TV app incorporates recently watched series into the Up Next section and your most-used apps appear in the Channels and Apps row. But the homepage is mostly a showcase for Apple TV+ series and movies. And don\u2019t expect to see much in the way of Netflix content in the app either. Possibly due to a continuing grudge match between the two companies, Siri even has trouble finding Netflix shows at all \u2014 searching for Lupin only came back with results from the anime franchise and when I asked for All the Light We Cannot See, the AI turned off my smart lights. Finally, this premium streaming device doesn\u2019t come with the HDMI cable required to hook it up to your TV. That\u2019s a minor detail in the grand scheme of things, but it did cause me to fling grownup words in Cupertino's general direction. \u2014 A.S.\n- Extremely fast operation\n- Apple Fitness+ and Arcade on a big screen\n- Support for 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision content\n- Expensive\n- Apple TV app heavily favors Apple TV+ content\n- Sub-par Netflix searches\nOperating system: Android TV | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, microSD card slot | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: HDR10, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, DTS-X | Smart home compatibility: Google Home, Alexa | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, Bluetooth | TV power/volume control: Yes\nFor those who want an all-in-one device that lets you stream movies, run a PLEX media server and play games, consider NVIDIA\u2019s Shield TV Pro. It currently runs Android TV, which is a little outdated at this point, but there\u2019s a possibility that it could be upgraded to Google TV in the future.\nThanks to its capable Tegra X1+ processor, the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro can stream in native 4K and it can also upscale 720p and 1080p video to 4K with the company\u2019s AI neural network. It also supports Dolby Vision and HDR10, has 3GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and two USB-C ports. Additionally, there\u2019s a gigabit Ethernet port, an HDMI socket and a microSD card slot. Since it runs on Android, you can use it to play most games from the Google Play Store.\nThe main reason you\u2019d choose the NVIDIA Shield TV Pro over other machines is that it gives you access to NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service. As long as you have a relatively speedy internet connection, you can play top-tier PC games that are streamed online to your Shield TV Pro. \u2014N.L.\n- Supports 4K, HDR10 and Dolby Vision content\n- Provides access to NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service\n- Built-in Google Assistant support\n- Expensive\nOperating system: Roku OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: HDR10+, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision | Smart home compatibility: Home Assistant | Ambient Mode: No | Headphone compatible: Yes, Bluetooth and wired | TV power/volume control: Yes\nEven though both Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X can stream video, it\u2019s the Xbox that we think is the best gaming console for the job. It can play 4K Blu-Rays and supports all of the usual streaming video apps including Apple TV+ and Disney+. However, the PS5 can\u2019t stream Disney+ Dolby Atmos, which is disappointing if you ever want to watch The Mandalorian in all its cinematic glory.\nFortunately, that\u2019s not the case with the Xbox Series X. On top of that, the Xbox Series X (and S) also support Dolby Vision for streaming video, which is especially great for people with newer TVs. Of course, the Xbox is also a pretty great gaming machine, and it offers access to Game Pass, Microsoft\u2019s subscription service that has a large library of titles. \u2014N.L.\n- Provides access to all major streaming services\n- Plays 4K Blu-Rays\n- Expensive\nOperating system: FireTV OS | Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth | Voice control: Yes | Resolution: up to 4K | Supported formats: Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+ | Smart home compatibility: Alexa | Ambient Mode: Yes | Headphone compatible: Yes, Bluetooth | TV power/volume control: Yes\nOur budget pick from Amazon doesn\u2019t support 4K image quality or Dolby Atmos. Amazon\u2019s higher-end Fire TV Stick 4K Max not only handles Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+, but it also supports Wi-Fi 6E. That means if you have a router that also carries the protocol, you could see better and faster connectivity.\nThe 4K Max has the fastest processor of any Fire TV Stick (the Amazon Fire TV Cube is faster, but isn't a stick), and we found it plenty zippy. The 4K Max even supports a fairly pleasant Ambient Experience, displaying art (and widgets) when the screen is idle, like on Samsung\u2019s The Frame. It also lets Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers play games via the app without an Xbox Series X or S console.\nI'll also point out that Engadget\u2019s Jeff Dunn has gotten a lot of use from the stick as a retro gaming emulator. That\u2019s a decent amount of utility from a $60 device (that\u2019s often on sale for around $45).\nThat said, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV interface is less elegant (and less democratic) than other UIs, highly prioritizing Prime Video content. It\u2019s also notably ad-stuffed \u2014 promoting not just Amazon\u2019s content, but products as well. \u2014 A.S.\n- Affordable 4K streaming\n- Additional gaming access\n- Ad-stuffed interface\n- Prioritizes Prime Video content\nWhat to look for in a TV streaming device\nOperating system and interface\nGoogle\u2019s TV Streamer, the Apple TV 4K, Amazon\u2019s Fire TV Sticks and Roku devices are the most popular players in the space. Three of those brands also come built into TVs, such as Fire, Google and Roku TVs, but the Apple TV 4K doesn't come pre-loaded on any set. Each one has a unique operating system and interface. This may be the biggest deciding factor for many people, as it determines how the home entertainment you want to watch is arranged and presented. We go into detail for each platform below, but all of them come with home screens that, to varying degrees, gather your apps in one place, present the movies and TV shows you\u2019re currently watching and give you suggestions of other media streaming options.\nNearly all streaming devices come with a remote that lets you search and do other operations using your voice, eliminating the need to hunt and peck at on-screen keyboards. They all offer \u201cuniversal search,\u201d in which searching for a title takes you to whichever app has it available. If you want to watch Wicked but don\u2019t know where it\u2019s playing, just push the voice button on the remote and say \"Wicked.\u201d (We found simply saying the title or the genre you want sometimes works better than saying \u201cShow me\u2026\u201d or \u201cSearch for\u2026\u201d) From the search results, hit the play button and the correct app will open and start playing \u2014 assuming you\u2019ve previously logged into that app and, in most cases, have an active subscription.\nConnectivity\nMost streaming sticks connect to the internet via Wi-Fi, with the majority of them supporting Wi-Fi 5 or 6 protocols. Set-top boxes can also have Ethernet ports, so you can hardwire your internet connection to the device, which is typically faster than wireless. Streaming media players connect to your TV through an HDMI port, and most sticks hide behind the screen, while set-top boxes sit on a surface nearby. Nearly all units also plug into an AC outlet for power. Some sticks used to work by pulling power from a USB port on the TV, but increasingly, these devices are designed to plug into the wall.\nVideo and audio features\nIf your home theater setup has a screen that can display 4K content with Dolby Vision and HDR10, you\u2019ll want a streaming device that supports those high-end formats. Of course, even the most top-shelf streamer can\u2019t make a 1080p TV stream 4K. The series or movie also has to be transmitted in 4K and, increasingly, companies restrict higher-quality streaming to more expensive subscription plans. In short, every element needs to support the video or audio feature, otherwise the highest quality you\u2019ll get will be the lowest of any component in the chain.\nRemotes\nMost remotes that come with streaming devices will allow you to control the power and volume of your TV. Some of the less expensive devices, however, don't have that feature, so you'll need to use your TV's remote control to turn it on, then use the streaming remote to navigate the streamer's interface. If your streamer's remote does offer power and volume controls, the setup process will usually calibrate your remote to your TV. If you want to use a soundbar, such as from Sonos or other brands, for audio you may also have to take the additional step of pairing your remote to the speaker.\nVoice control\nIn addition to helping you find stuff to watch, streaming devices from Apple, Google and Amazon can answer questions about the weather, sports scores and general facts using built-in voice assistants. They can also act as smart home controllers to turn off connected smart bulbs or plugs and show feeds from smart cameras. Just remember, as with all smart home devices, compatibility is key. Fire TV devices work with Alexa-enabled smart home equipment; the Google TV Streamer lets you control Google Home devices; and Apple TV 4Ks play nice with HomeKit and other Apple devices. Rokus grant power over Roku\u2019s smart home products, but also work with the other ecosystems.\nHow we tested and picked the best streaming devices\nLike every gadget we test, we start by researching what\u2019s worthy of reviewing. Then we get a hold of the devices ourselves and see how well they work. We don\u2019t have a central Engadget lab; we test things in our own living rooms, on our own TV sets. We also figure that\u2019s a better approximation of your own TV experience anyway.\nWe began testing streaming devices as far back as 2007 with the first Apple TV device. Since then, we\u2019ve tried out most of the major new releases to come along \u2014 from the Roku Stick back in 2014 to the 2024 Google TV Streamer 4K. A few years ago, we decided to compile the streaming devices we reviewed into this guide. Since then, we\u2019ve updated our top picks using verdicts from our reviews, as well the testing we perform just for this guide. As new devices come out, we try them and, if something is worthy, we add it to our top picks on this list."

      "text": "ESPN\u2019s new streaming service arrives August 21\nESPN will also soon become the exclusive streaming platform for WWE events in the US.\nESPN\u2019s long-awaited new standalone streaming service will launch on August 21, alongside an overhauled ESPN app that gives users a \"more personalized, dynamic viewing experience.\" Simply (and potentially confusingly) called ESPN, the new platform arrives just ahead of the new NFL season and the US Open tennis competition, as well as a number of other returning sports that ESPN broadcasts.\nESPN\u2019s streaming service will be offered with a choice of two plans. The $30 per month ($300 annually) \"unlimited\" offering includes access to all of ESPN\u2019s linear networks, as well as ESPN on ABC, ESPN+, ESPN3, SECN+ and ACCNX. With this plan, you\u2019ll have access to all of ESPN\u2019s live events, on-demand content and original documentaries, and if you bundle it with Disney+ and Hulu you\u2019ll pay nothing extra for the first 12 months. This is a launch offer, so no guarantees it\u2019ll apply for long.\nThe alternative is ESPN\u2019s \"select\" plan, which costs $12 per month ($120 per year) and includes access to all content on ESPN+, the company\u2019s other streaming subscription service that will continue to operate beyond the arrival of the new platform. ESPN says existing ESPN+ subscribers will automatically be put onto an ESPN select plan.\nESPN also announced today that it has agreed a deal to exclusively broadcast all WWE Premium Live Events in the US, from 2026. All WWE PLEs will stream on ESPN\u2019s new platform, with major events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and the Royal Rumble available to watch in their entirety. You\u2019ll be able to stream 2026\u2019s NFL Draft, as well as a new daily show dedicated to the draft.\nAlongside the new streaming service, ESPN has also redesigned its app to offer a more personalized experience. New features include an updated multiview screen, integrated game stats, betting information and built-in fantasy sports management."

      "text": "What\u2019s Happening With TIDAL?\nTIDAL will soon be ending its integration with Plex. TIDAL functionality will be turned off for Plex users on October 28, 2024.\nBeginning on September 26, 2024, TIDAL subscriptions billed through Plex will no longer be renewed. For those of you with a subscription billed through Plex, that means that the subscription will expire and you\u2019ll lose access to the TIDAL service one month after your last renewal.\nYou may be asking, \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d\nKeep an eye out for an email from TIDAL, which will include instructions on how to continue subscribing to their music and features using the TIDAL app.\nIf you\u2019ve had a TIDAL subscription billed through Plex and don\u2019t already have a separate (monthly, yearly, or lifetime) Plex Pass subscription, then you will need to start a new Plex Pass subscription to retain access to Plex Pass features and benefits, such as Downloads for personal music, Sonic Sage, Guest DJ, and more (including non-music features). You can find information about Plex Pass subscription features and benefits, as well as start a subscription, from our Plex Pass page\nCommon Questions\nWhen will my existing TIDAL subscription expire?\nThere is not a single, specific date. If you have a TIDAL subscription billed through Plex, we\u2019ll stop processing renewals beginning on September 26, 2024. The subscription will expire 1 month after your last renewal, which means it will expire between September 26 and October 28, depending on when the last renewal prior to that occurred.\nDetails about your subscription are available in your account Subscriptions page, when signed in to your account.\nCan I still stream TIDAL content through Plex?\nSo long as your TIDAL subscription is active and the TIDAL account is linked to Plex, you can continue accessing TIDAL functionality in Plex until October 28, 2024. On that date, TIDAL functionality in Plex will be turned off, after which you will no longer be able to use TIDAL functionality in Plex.\nCan I still use TIDAL?\nWe\u2019re no longer accepting new TIDAL subscriptions billed through Plex. If you wish to start a new TIDAL streaming subscription (for use through TIDAL\u2019s own apps), you\u2019ll need to do it through TIDAL themselves. For instance, you can do so through the TIDAL website.\nAre my TIDAL playlists and My TIDAL information gone?\nThat data is associated with your TIDAL account itself, not Plex. If you have an active TIDAL subscription on your TIDAL account, then you can continue to access those through TIDAL\u2019s own apps.\nWhat about TIDAL artists/albums/tracks that I added to appear in my personal Plex Media Server music library?\nTIDAL content that you have used Add to [library]\non so that they appear as entries in a personal music library will not be removed automatically. Those artists, albums, or tracks will still appear in your library. Once we turn off TIDAL functionality on October 28, 2024, you will no longer be able to actually play any of those entries, of course.\nIf you wish to remove those entries, you can filter your personal music library by \u201cSource\u201d in our web app and then choose to Remove\nthe content.\nHow do I remove TIDAL content from a playlist?\nSimilar to the above question, you can use the Remove\naction from the context menu for an item in a playlist."

      "text": "Letterboxd sells a majority stake after explosive pandemic-fueled growth\nReportedly valued at over $50 million, the site has around 10 million active users.\nThe film-focused social media site LetterBoxd has new ownership. Cofounder Matthew Buchanan announced on Friday that Tiny, a venture capital firm, has bought a 60 percent stake in the platform. The New York Times reported that the deal values Letterboxd at over $50 million. Buchanan and fellow founder Karl von Randow will retain minority shareholder positions and continue to lead the company as they insist \u201cvery little else will change.\u201d\nFounded in 2011, Letterboxd was a rare independently owned social network. It grew significantly during pandemic lockdowns as homebound users sought new movies to stream (and communities to chat with). Lacking the clutter of Amazon-owned IMDb, the website and app provided a haven for film buffs who wanted to write and read reviews, rate movies, create watch lists and socialize with fellow enthusiasts.\nLetterboxd\u2019s cofounders frame the move as less about selling out to big money and more a growth opportunity. \u201cTeaming up with Tiny represents a big leap forward for us,\u201d Buchanan and von Randow wrote in a statement. \u201cWe see this as a huge win for our community, enabling us to cement Letterboxd\u2019s future with additional resources without sacrificing the DNA of what makes it special.\u201d\nThe site doesn\u2019t currently support television series, but the founders say they\u2019re working on a way to offer that. They insist they want to incorporate TV shows \u201conly once we know we can do it right.\u201d Letterboxd partnered with Netflix earlier this year, bringing the streaming service\u2019s recommendations to the social platform.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been huge fans and users of Letterboxd for a long time and could not be more excited to join forces with Matthew, Karl, and the rest of the team for the long-term,\u201d said Andrew Wilkinson, Co-founder of Tiny. \u201cIf you\u2019re running out of things to watch, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t used Letterboxd yet \u2014 and we believe that the potential for superior discovery is a large opportunity.\u201d"

      "text": "YouTube TV's multiview streams now include non-sports options\nBut viewers still have to choose from preselected streams.\nYouTube TV has expanded its multiview feature's scope so that even non-sports fans can enjoy it. When the service launched multiview, it could show up to four sports streams on the screen at once. But now users will be able to choose from streams with news, business news and weather content, in addition to sports streams. Viewers will still have to pick from preselected videos and can't choose whatever stream they want to watch in multiview, but at least they now have more choices and don't have to stick to having all four screens tuned into sporting events.\nThe service first rolled out multiview in March with a focus on sports, just in time for NCAA's March Madness. Multiview is supported on all smart TVs and media players that can run YouTube TV, because the processing is done on the service's servers. While viewers can keep an eye on all four streams at once, they can jump to a full-screen view for each one and switch the audio and the captioning to whatever event they want to focus on at the moment.\nIn addition to expanding multiview's repertoire, YouTube TV is also adding Spanish-language sports channels to the preselected stream options for members with a Spanish or Spanish Plus plan. Some members might not have access to the expanded multiview options yet, but they will soon enough \u2014 YouTube TV says it gradually roll out these updates to all users over the summer."

      "text": "Peacock's 2024 Paris Olympics coverage includes enhanced multiview options\nYou'll be able to stick with an event you're into instead of staying with the broadcast's whip-around coverage.\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics are just 128 days away. They'll be here before you know it, so what better time to learn about all the groovy features that the Games' streaming home, Peacock, has lined up?\nThe platform will host more than 5,000 hours of live coverage across the two weeks, including each of the 329 medal events. That's far more than anyone could possibly watch during the Games, so to help you keep track of several events at once, Peacock is offering several multiview options. On TVs, tablets and desktop browsers (but not phones, sadly), you'll be able to watch four matches at the same time in sports such as track and field, soccer and wrestling in a traditional multiview format.\nA mode called Peacock Discovery Multiview aims to direct you to the most important events. Here, you'll see on-screen descriptions telling you what's at stake (such as whether there's an elimination risk or if it's a medal event) or if you're watching a first-time Olympian. In both multiview modes, you can move the screens around, choose the audio track you want to listen to and click through to watch an event in full screen. Peacock will offer you up to four multiview options at any given time.\nAnother key new feature is called Peacock Live Actions. The idea here is to help you follow the events you're most interested in. So, if you're really enjoying a live gymnastics session but the whip-around coverage on the Gold Show broadcast is about to switch over to weightlifting or something, you can hit a button to keep watching the action on the parallel bars. Peacock says the feature will also allow those watching the NBC primetime simulcast to add events to their My Stuff list to watch later.\nElsewhere, you'll be able to browse through the coverage by sport and check out an interactive schedule. The Catch Up with Key Plays tool will be available for basketball and golf on top of soccer. And along with up-to-date medal standings, you'll be able to search for your favorite athletes. This will bring you to live events and replays including your favorite competitor, regardless of whether they're competing individually or as part of a team.\nWhile the Olympics don't start for another few months, you can subscribe to Peacock now. If you do so and opt for an annual plan, you'll get 12 months of access for the price of 10.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "The broadcast bounce is real. As 2024 ends, CBS led the pack in total viewers for the year thanks, of course, to Super Bowl LVIII. No surprise, live sports continues to work its magic for the traditional networks, as NBC was also up year vs. year and even took the adults 18-49 crown for 2024 \u2014 bolstered by the tremendously successful Paris Olympics. ABC, meanwhile, was virtually flat (OK, down 1%) from 2023, which these days is a big win \u2014 and presumably the Alphabet web was helped by airing more NFL Monday Night Football games this fall.\nAmong the Big 4, only Fox was down by double digits \u2014 and that can be explained by the fact that it ran the Super Bowl in 2023, so of course it\u2019s going to be down. In cable, unless you were a news network in a major presidential election year, well, it was another year of dramatic declines.\nPopular on Variety\nTomorrow, Variety will share the ranker of this year\u2019s most-watched primetime telecasts. But here, we recount which networks were up and (mostly) down in 2024.\nWINNERS\nCBS, NBC, ABC: Even though the NFL and other sports coverage gets most of the credit for keeping broadcast afloat, that\u2019s not the only story. This has been a solid fall for the linear nets in entertainment fare as well, which boasts breakout fall hits like CBS\u2019 \u201cMatlock,\u201d ABC\u2019s \u201cHigh Potential\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cHappy\u2019s Place.\u201d Broadcast still matters in 2024, whereas cable\u2026 well, we\u2019ll get to that in a second.\nTELEMUNDO: On the Spanish language side, we have quite a smackdown brewing. Perennial leader Univision is still on top, but Telemundo is coming after the crown. NBCU-owned Telemundo was up a whopping 12% this year \u2014 tying CBS for the biggest jump in broadcast. (And if you take out special events, Telemundo actually claims the primetime victory in primetime for the first time in history.)\nJUSTICE CENTRAL, AMERICAN CRIMES AND OTHER DIGI-NETS: Perhaps the most interesting trivia of the year comes from the growth of obscure digital networks that mostly exist on over-the-air HD subchannels but also have some satellite, cable and even FAST carriage. You\u2019ve likely never heard of these networks \u2014 and granted, they\u2019re starting from a small base, so their percentage gain can be enormous.\nBut here\u2019s something to share at your next cocktail parties: Ask your friends what the two fastest-growing TV networks were in 2024. They\u2019ll never get it right. The answer is Justice Central (up 508%) and American Crimes (up 460%).\nWhat the hell are those channels? Justice Central is owned by Byron Allen\u2019s company, airing mostly court reality shows he produces. But this year, the network also added old episodes of the original \u201cMatlock\u201d and \u201cPerry Mason\u201d to the mix \u2014 hence the rise. Meanwhile, American Crimes is owned by NBC and took the place of its lifestyle NBC LX channel, airing true crime shows from the NBCU library like \u201cDateline\u201d and \u201cLockup.\u201d NBCU did absolutely no press on this quiet rebrand \u2014 we bet most staffers at the company don\u2019t even know this channel exists, and who knows where in might land in the upcoming SpinCo spinoff \u2014 but it seems to be working for the viewers who find it.\nOther digi-nets with strong years include Charge! (up 33%), Dabl (up 38%), Telexitos (up 39%) and TBD TV (up 80%). The secrets to their success vary: Dabl, owned by Paramount but managed by Weigel broadcasting, switched to a comedy format in 2024, airing mostly shows from the early days of UPN (\u201cGirlfriends,\u201d \u201cMoesha,\u201d \u201cEverybody Hates Chris\u201d). Telexitos, owned by NBCU (another one they might want to hold on to?) airs old Spanish TV repeats. Charge!, owned by Sinclair, runs crime dramas like \u201cCSI: Miami.\u201d And TBD, also owned by Sinclair, shifted away from viral videos in 2024 to a mix of comedy repeats like \u201cSNL\u201d and \u201cKey and Peele,\u201d hence the ratings bump.\nRELATED: The 25 Most-Watched Entertainment Specials of 2024\nMOST \u201cNEWS\u201d NETWORKS: This presidential year, the big story was the expanding dominance of Fox News, which was up a tremendous 30% in viewers to make it the fifth most-watched network in 2024, behind entertainment sibling Fox. MSNBC also remained a top 10 network, at No. 7 but up a more modest 4%. Despite its difficulties, CNN could still find solace at rising 20% and landing at No. 15. Also up 31% was Newsmax, although still at No. 38. The one network that bafflingly didn\u2019t get an election bump? Newsnation, which dropped 1% in 2024.\nBIG TEN NETWORK: While many of the league-based networks saw declines in 2024, including the NFL Network (down 26%) and NBA TV (down 2%), the Big Ten Network saw a bounce as it became the Bigger Ten. The addition of former Pac 12 teams like USC and UCLA must have had an impact, as Big Ten was up 25%.\nLOSERS\nSPIN-OFF CHANNELS: Perhaps the only thing tougher than being a major cable network these days is being the offshoot of a major cable network. Those channels, created in the heyday of cable carriage deal mania, are now often the first to be zombified. And indeed, most of these long ago gave up any promise of original fare and now are completely on autopilot with repeats: FXX (down 29%), Nat Geo Wild (down 29%), Cooking Channel (down 31%), American Heroes (down 27%), MTV 2 (down 31%) among them. Perhaps the saddest slump is VH1, an early MTV spinoff that held its own for decades but was down 38% in 2024.\nKIDS AND TEEN NETWORKS: This is starting to sound like a broken record, as Gen Z and Gen Alpha just aren\u2019t watching linear TV. They\u2019re getting their Disney and Nickelodeon fix on streaming, optimistically. But as YouTube and TikTok also grab their attention, it was another rough year for everyone in this space.\nSTARTUPS: Pretty brave to attempt to launch a new network or attempt a big rebrand in the year 2024. So far there isn\u2019t much to show for folks like Dr. Phil\u2019s Merit Street or Scripps News \u2014 which was rebranded from Newsy last year. Scripps News won its first News Emmy in September\u2026 and then shut down two months later. The channel ceased operations on Nov. 16.\nBelow are the primetime rankers for broadcast, cable and premium cable networks in 2024, among total viewers (as well as the top 50 list in adults 18-49).

      "text": "Peacock's NFL wild card game broke streaming records\nThe game reached 27.6 million viewers.\nThere are few things as American as watching football on a Sunday. If anyone needs further proof, NFL and Peacock have it: The January 14 Peacock Exclusive AFC Wild Card has set a new record for the United States' most streamed live event in history. According to a joint release from NBC-owned Peacock and Comcast, the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Miami Dolphins game \u2014 the first playoff ever exclusively live-streamed \u2014 reached 27.6 million viewers.\nPeacock also claims that the livestream is to thank for the most internet usage in a single day across the US, taking up 30 percent of internet traffic. However, the current data is courtesy of Nielsen's custom fast national live and same-day data, with official numbers coming out on Friday, January 19.\nWhile the livestream was a good alternative to shivering in person during the fourth coldest NFL game in history, not everyone was happy about it. New York congressman Pat Ryan was among those who expressed their outrage over having to pay for another streaming service in order to watch a game that typically airs on cable. \"How much more profit do [NFL commissioner Roger] Goodell and NBC need to make at the expense of hard working Americans?\" Ryan wrote in a letter. \"Congress granted the NFL an antitrust exemption in its broadcast deals with the expectation that you wouldn't use it to screw over fans. That was clearly a mistake.\"\nThe game was available to Miami and Kansas City viewers on local NBC affiliates. Anyone else interested in watching had to sign up for a Peacock subscription, starting at $6 per month. Peacock's plan to stream the wild card game was first announced last May, with NBC reportedly paying $110 million for the rights to it."

      "text": "RIP to the entirely hypothetical streaming service Venu Sports\nDisney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox have cancelled their plans for the platform.\nThe long-awaited streaming service Venu Sports is no longer happening, according to The Hollywood Reporter and others. The sports-focused streaming service was to be a joint offering by Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox. There was no concrete reason given, other than corporate-speak.\n\u201cIn an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels,\u201d the companies wrote in a statement.\nWe assume this move will also involve some serious layoffs, as Venu has been percolating for a while. To that end, the companies said they are \u201cproud of the work that has been done on Venu to date and grateful to the Venu staff, whom we will support through this transition period.\u201d There are no details as to what this support will entail.\nThe real reason for the shutdown is likely due to ongoing legal woes. Just as one threat disappeared this week, with Fubo dropping an antitrust lawsuit and joining forces with Disney, another popped up in its place. Days after Disney announced a deal to merge Hulu + Live TV with Fubo, a pair of satellite TV companies argued against lifting a pre-existing injunction that delayed the launch of Venu.\nDirecTV and EchoStar suggested that Fubo and Disney\u2019s newfound friendship doesn\u2019t resolve alleged antitrust issues surrounding Venu Sports. DirecTV wrote to a judge, saying that the joint venture \u201crestores an anticompetitive runway\u201d for the companies \u201cto control the future of the live pay TV market.\u201d EchoStar wrote a similar letter.\nAn unnamed source familiar with Venu Sports told The Hollywood Reporter that the move to cancel the streaming service was made in the past few days and that the aforementioned legal snafu played a role."

      "text": "Say ciao to the stand-alone Hulu streaming app: Disney said it is \u201cfully integrating\u201d the Hulu service, which it now owns 100%, into its flagship Disney+ streamer.\nA new \u201cunified\u201d Disney+ and Hulu streaming app will be available in 2026, the company said. According to a Disney rep, customers will still be able to buy a stand-alone Hulu subscription (as well as a stand-alone Disney+ plan).\n\u201cToday we are announcing a major step forward in strengthening our streaming offering by fully integrating Hulu into Disney+,\u201d CEO Bob Iger and CFO Hugh Johnston said in prepared commentary on the media giant\u2019s quarterly earnings. \u201cThis will create an impressive package of entertainment, pairing the highest-caliber brands and franchises, great general entertainment, family programming, news and industry-leading live sports content in a single app.\u201d\nThe single Disney+ app with Hulu will deliver an \u201cimproved consumer experience,\u201d which will lower churn, Iger said on the earnings call. Both services will be \u201con one tech platform,\u201d which will result in cost synergies, according to Iger. In addition, Disney \u2014 which already sells ads for Disney+ and Hulu together \u2014 sees new opportunities for bundling ad sales by fully combining them, he said.\nPopular on Variety\nIn their prepared remarks, the Disney execs said, \u201cBy creating a truly differentiated streaming offering, we will be providing subscribers tremendous choice, convenience, quality, and enhanced personalization. This will enhance our ability to continue to grow profitability and margins in our entertainment streaming business through expected higher engagement, lower churn, and advertising revenue potential, as well as operational efficiencies that over time may result in savings that we can reinvest back into the business.\u201d\nIn addition, Hulu will become a global general entertainment brand: Starting in the fall of 2025, it will replace the Star tile on Disney+ internationally.\n\u201cWork is already underway to continue enhancing our technology, and over the coming months, we will be implementing numerous improvements within the Disney+ app, including exciting new features and a more personalized homepage,\u201d Iger and Johnston said.\nMeanwhile, Hulu\u2019s live TV business will be combined Fubo, under a proposed joint venture majority-owned by Disney. The Hulu + Live TV and Fubo brands will remain separately sold and marketed. A Disney rep confirmed that Hulu + Live TV will eventually be integrated into Disney+ sometime in 2026.\nThe move to fully sew Hulu together with Disney+ comes after Disney \u2014 following two years of negotiating \u2014 closed its deal with Comcast to buy out NBCUniversal\u2018s one-third stake in Hulu in June 2025. Disney paid Comcast in total about $9 billion, including $8.61 billion in November 2023 and $438.7 million this past June. Comcast had been seeking more than $13 billion for the 33% Hulu stake; the final price tag was determined through arbitration by a third-party banker.\nDisney has already taken steps to integrate Hulu and Disney+. In the spring of 2024, the Disney+ app launched \u201cfull\u201d integration of Hulu content, which the company has used as a way to convert stand-alone Disney+ customers into bundled Disney+/Hulu subs.\nAlso Wednesday, Disney announced that it will no longer report streaming subscriber numbers for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, following the lead of Netflix and others.\nIn addition, the company set Aug. 21 as the launch date for its ESPN stand-alone streaming product, priced at $29.99/month.\nRELATED: Disney\u2019s Move to Merge Hulu Into Disney+ Could Save Company Billions of Dollars"

      "text": "Disney\u2019s latest quarter was mixed but solid with a big upswing in studio profit led by Deadpool & Wolverine and Inside Out 2, the top two movies of 2024 to date. At a complex time for media and a company with many moving parts, streaming was in the black and domestic theme parks saw operating income rise.\nAll in, Disney\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter ended in September saw revenue rise 6% from the year before to about $22.57 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts, and operating income grew 23% to $3.65 billion. It missed some metrics too but the company\u2019s forward-looking guidance, more detailed than provided in the past, includes mostly positives, one analyst said.\nThe stock is up over 6% premarket trade after the numbers.\nWatch on Deadline\nEntertainment, which houses content, streaming and linear television, saw operating income surge to $1.1 billion from $236 million on revenue up 14% at $10.8 billion. Pixar\u2019s Inside Out 2 and Marvel\u2019s Deadpool & Wolverine broke numerous box office records and helped drive $316 million in operating income.\n\u201cOur solid performance in the fiscal fourth quarter reflected the success of our strategic efforts to improve quality, innovation, efficiency, and value creation,\u201d said CEO Bob Iger. \u201cIn Q4 we saw one of the best quarters in the history of our film studio, improved profitability in our streaming businesses, a record-breaking 60 Emmy Awards for the company, the continued power of live sports, and the unveiling of an impressive collection of new projects coming to our Experiences segment.\u201d\nDTC saw Disney ending the quarter with 174 million Disney+ core and Hulu subscriptions, and more than 120 million Disney+ core paid subscribers, an increase of 4.4 million over the prior quarter. Streaming swung to a $253 million profit from a $420-million loss the year earlier, and from $19 million in red ink for the previous quarter ended in June.\nHulu ended September with 47.4 million subs, up slightly. Hulu + Live TV stood at 4.6 million subs, up from 4.4 million in June. Disney is buying out Hulu from partner Comcast and has already paid out an agreed upon $8.6 billion floor amount. They are still hashing out how much more is due.\nStreaming revenue rose 15% to $5.78 billion. Ad sales rose 14%. Disney cited gains from subscription price hikes and lower marketing costs.\nCombining Disney+ and Hulu with ESPN+ from the Sports segment, total DTC revenue rose 13% and there was a profit for the second consecutive quarter \u2014 of $321 million, after a positive $47 million in June driven by ESPN+. The trio lost $387 million in the 2023 third quarter.\nDisney also said today it plans to add an ESPN tile to Disney+ on December 4, giving subscribers to to the \u201ctrio\u201d streaming bundle access to ESPN+ content.\nDisney early this year agreed to merge its Star India streaming operation with Reliance in an $8.5 billion deal \u2014 and announced this morning that the transaction has been completed.\nThe pressing question with streaming \u2014 for Disney and other traditional media \u2014 is how soon, and if, it can be profitable enough to offset declines in linear television.\nSports revenue was flat at $3.9 billion. Operating income slipped 5% to $929 million. Domestic ESPN advertising revenue in Q4 grew 7% from the prior-year quarter.\nDisney will debut a stand-alone ESPN+ streaming service in 2025, something Iger will likely be asked about on a call with analysts set for 8:30 am ET, along with its challenged Venu sports streaming joint venture with Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery that Fubo has sued to block and whose fate is in the hands of a New York court.\nAlso of interest, the outlook on streaming, the timing of a theme park rebound, Disney\u2019s new NBA contract, its film slate and, of course, succession. The board led by James Gorman is looking for Disney\u2019s new CEO, eyeing both internal and external candidates. Iger\u2019s contract expires at the end of 2026.\nExperiences revenue nosed up 1% to $8.2 billion with operating income of $1.6 billion, down 6% from the year before.\nDomestic parks\u2019 operating income rose in Q4 on comparable attendance to the prior-year quarter, Disney said, driven by higher guest spending, partially offset by higher expenses and costs related to new offerings by Disney Cruise Line. International Parks & Experiences operating income declined. The company didn\u2019t name locations but had said last quarter that it expected the Paris Olympics would impact Disneyland Paris.\nU.S. parks in particular have had a hiccup this year as frenzied post-Covid attendance began to moderate. Wall Street was quite alarmed but has settled into wariness at the dynamic that\u2019s rattled one of Disney\u2019s most reliable growth drivers.\nAlso, what happens when NBCUniversal\u2019s new, massive Epic Universe theme park opens in May next year in Orlando across town from Walt Disney World? Iger has said it\u2019s fine. Disney itself is in the midst of a multi-year, $10 billion investment cycle in its parks. Universal has also noted dips in attendance at its parks this year.\nLinear networks, part of the Entertainment division, saw revenue dip 6% to $2.46 billion with operating income of $498 million, falling 38%. Domestic networks were squeezed by higher marketing costs from more season premieres this year due to Hollywood strikes in 2023. Affiliate and advertising revenue fell on fewer subscribers.\nDisney also cited \u201cthe impact of the non-renewal of carriage of certain networks by an affiliate.\u201d It did not specify, but a renewal with Charter in September of 2023 trimmed out a handful of networks including Baby TV, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FXM, FXX, Nat Geo Wild and Nat Geo Mundo.\nDisney took $1.5 billion in restructuring and impairment charges, including $69 million for severance. It\u2019s been rough. Media companies have been aggressively tossing out staffers to streamline as the entertainment industry shifts and contracts.\n\u201cThis was a pivotal and successful year for The Walt Disney Company, and thanks to the significant progress we\u2019ve made, we have emerged from a period of considerable challenges and disruption well positioned for growth and optimistic about our future,\u201d Iger said.\n\u201cAs a result of our strategies and our focus on managing our businesses for both the near- and long-term, we are differentiating ourselves from traditional competitors, leveraging the deepest and broadest set of entertainment assets in the industry to drive attractive returns and further advance our goals.\u201d\nThe hot mic incident was staged. Iger wanted to draw attention to their strong ad tier numbers.\nSo much for Disney going broke. That woke nonsense never had anything to do with anything. The whole dilemma was: Netflix killed linear TV. Companies like Disney that depended on linear were thwacked upside the head and trying to adjust.\nNow Disney has adjusted and things are looking up because the survivors in the streaming wars will be fewer than before and each will have a bigger slice of the pie.\nSeems like Warners might make it too. Paramount\u2026? Comcast needs to get out of content while it\u2019s still worth something or switch to an arms dealer strategy.\nFunny, that the anti-Disney/anti Igers are avoiding commenting on these articles that have a positive outlook but are commenting on the ones that are spin more negatively like the \u201chot-mic\u201d article lol\nEpic will reduce park attendance for Disney. The lawsuits and settlements aren\u2019t in this report so they get another quarter to kick the can down the road while trying to appear healthy. Sports decline should be concerning given the Billions they have committed and no one is saying if the movies and shows are profitable; by all accounts they haven\u2019t been. Meanwhile how are those Star Wars toys selling?"
