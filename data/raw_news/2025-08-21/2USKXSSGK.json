  "content": "A New York appeals court struck down a $464 million fraud fine against President Donald Trump and his company, handing him a victory over the state\u2019s attorney general.\n\nIn a decision issued Thursday, the Manhattan appellate court still found that Trump broke the law by inflating the valuation of assets like Mar-a-Lago and his Trump Tower penthouse, but it said the massive penalty was unconstitutionally \u201cexcessive.\u201d\n\nThe long-awaited ruling by an intermediate state appeals court wipes out one of Trump\u2019s biggest financial liabilities. It also puts fresh pressure on New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has become the focus of a federal probe into whether her lawsuit violated Trump\u2019s legal rights.\n\nThe politically charged decision resulted in the five-judge panel issuing three separate opinions. The majority ultimately concluded that Trump violated the law by inflating his assets, but nevertheless threw out the massive fine.\n\nMost of Trump\u2019s legal woes melted away after his election victory. The Justice Department dropped two federal criminal cases against Trump, citing a longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president. While Trump was convicted in his hush money case in Manhattan, a judge sentenced him to no jail time at a hearing 10 days before his inauguration \u2014 following a US Supreme Court ruling that gave the president broad immunity.\n\nJames filed the case against Trump and his sprawling real estate company in September 2022, more than two years before his successful bid to retake the White House. She won the case after an 11-week trial. The development raises questions about whether James, a Democrat and staunch critic of Trump, will seek to reinstate the penalty by appealing the decision to the state\u2019s highest court in Albany.\n\nTrump argued that his method of valuing his real estate was typical of the industry and that disclaimers on his financial statements advised banks they should do their own valuations anyway. One of his biggest defense arguments was that no banks lost money on his loans, and the state didn\u2019t dispute that.\n\nOn Aug. 8, people familiar with the federal probe into James\u2019 civil lawsuit against Trump said Justice Department officials had convened a grand jury and sent subpoenas to James\u2019s office. The subpoena also seeks information on James\u2019s case against the National Rifle Association, said one of the people. The probe is being run out of Albany, New York.\n\nAbbe Lowell, a lawyer for James, said at the time that the investigation is a \u201cblatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\u201d\n\nTrump has long criticized James as well as Justice Arthur Engoron, who oversaw the non-jury trial, calling both of them biased against him because he\u2019s a Republican.\n\nTrump has also appealed his conviction in the hush money case, seeking to erase his criminal record. He has also appealed two civil jury verdicts against him in lawsuits brought by E. Jean Carroll, who sued him for sex abuse and defamation and won nearly $90 million in total damages. Trump has maintained innocence throughout.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

      "text": "By Robert Burnson, Bloomberg\nElon Musk must face allegations that he defrauded voters when he promised them a chance to win $1 million for signing a petition in the days before the 2024 presidential election.\nA federal judge said Wednesday a woman from Arizona can proceed with her claims that she never would have signed Musk\u2019s America PAC petition and handed over personal identifying information if she knew she had no chance of winning. She said she believed, based on statements by Musk, that the winners would be picked at random. In fact, they were carefully selected to be spokespeople for Musk\u2019s pro-Donald Trump political action committee.\nUS District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, didn\u2019t rule on the merits of Jacqueline McAferty\u2019s proposed class-action case, but found that she plausibly alleged she didn\u2019t get \u201cwhat she bargained for \u2014 a random chance to win $1 million.\u201d\nThe district attorney in Philadelphia sued Musk and the PAC about a week before the November election to shut down the sweepstakes as an \u201cunlawful lottery,\u201d but a judge denied the DA\u2019s request to halt the contest. Musk\u2019s representatives revealed at the time that the PAC picked registered voters from swing states to be public spokespeople for the committee, often based on their personal stories, and required them to sign employment contracts.\nIn addition to seeking damages for fraud, McAferty can also pursue a breach of contract claim, Pitman said. The judge dismissed her claim under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\nLawyers for Musk didn\u2019t immediately respond outside regular business hours to requests for comment.\nMusk spent hundreds of millions of dollars to elect Trump and Republicans in 2024, and when Trump defeated Kamala Harris in the election, he turned to Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, to lead an effort to slash the size and scope of government.\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P."

      "text": "By Danielle Moran, Bloomberg\nThe University of California has shelved a $1.5 billion municipal-bond sale that had been slated for this week, according to a person familiar with the matter, a decision that comes amid a fight between the system and the Trump administration over federal funding.\nThe deal was expected to price the week of Aug. 17, according to a post on California\u2019s debt-sale website captured by an internet archive. That notice is no longer on the state\u2019s investor relations webpage.\nSpokespeople for the University of California and Bank of America Corp., the joint senior manager, declined to comment. A representative for Jefferies, the book-running joint senior manager, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe Bond Buyer reported the move on Wednesday.\nThe transaction from one of the most prestigious US public higher-education systems was set to include two tranches of general revenue bonds, one for $825 million and another for $675 million, according to an Aug. 12 report from Fitch Ratings. The company assigned the bonds an AA grade, the third-highest available. Proceeds were expected to fund various projects at its 10 campuses and six academic health centers, Fitch said.\nThe Trump administration has demanded more than $1 billion from the University of California at Los Angeles in exchange for releasing $584 million in federal research funding that the US froze amid concern about antisemitism and bias on campus.\nBorrowers in the municipal-bond market are required to provide investors with information on risks that could impact the credit of the issuer. If California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, were to challenge the Trump administration\u2019s actions in court, it would have made such disclosure challenging, according to the person familiar, who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the deal publicly.\nNewsom has been vocal in his opposition to the school settling with the administration. He said UCLA shouldn\u2019t \u201cbend on their knees\u201d to the White House as he alleged other universities that settled had.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not Brown, we\u2019re not Columbia,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI will fight like hell to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\u2013With assistance from Elizabeth Rembert, Maxwell Adler and Amanda Albright.\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P."

      "text": "By Ryan Weeks, Bloomberg\nArthur Hayes got rich, indicted and banned \u2014 all before turning 40. He built BitMEX into one of the world\u2019s largest crypto trading platforms, watched it buckle under regulatory and legal fire, and later saw his conviction wiped clean by a pardon from President Donald Trump.\nNow, Hayes is back investing \u2014 not only in tokens, but in himself. He recently took a large stake in a stem cell business with clinics in Mexico and Bangkok where he\u2019s been a regular patient for over a year, flying in for infusions aimed at extending his healthspan.\n\u201cI want to live as long as possible, as healthy as possible,\u201d Hayes said in a video interview. \u201cThis is the future \u2014 you\u2019re seeing more and more countries are relaxing their regulations around the use of stem cells.\u201d\nHayes wouldn\u2019t name the company because it\u2019s in the middle of a rebrand, but said he joined the board this summer.\nIn March, Trump pardoned Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, the three co-founders of BitMEX, once the largest platform for trading crypto derivatives. The trio were charged in 2020 with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and pleaded guilty in 2022. They each agreed to forfeit $10 million and were sentenced to probation.\nThe pardon changed little about Hayes\u2019s professional status, he said. Even before it, the 40-year-old was living in Singapore and spending three months of each year skiing in Hokkaido, Japan. His essays \u2014 an array of digressions on meme culture, monetary theory and markets \u2014 remain widely read in crypto circles. One March 2023 post, titled \u201cDust on Crust,\u201d inspired the creation of Ethena\u2019s synthetic dollar, now the third-largest stablecoin with a market value of $11.6 billion.\nToday, Hayes is riding crypto\u2019s revival with money to spend, longevity in mind, and a taste for disruption. Reinvigorated by an aggressively pro-crypto White House and flush with bull market gains, crypto pioneers like Hayes, who once stormed the financial system with code, are now turning their energy to domains they consider slow-moving, over-regulated, or ripe for disruption.\nWhether it\u2019s stem cells, speculative tokens, AI-fueled education, or publicly traded firms accumulating token holdings, the through line is the same: men with capital and conviction, who made fortunes in a largely unregulated industry, are testing how many boundaries they can redraw.\nLongevity has become the final frontier for industry executives. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has donated millions to life-extension research. Former Coinbase Global Inc. CTO Balaji Srinivasan has backed both biotech and startup societies. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong co-founded NewLimit, a genetic engineering startup that in May raised $130 million in a Series B round led by Kleiner Perkins.\nIn crypto markets, too, ambitions are expanding. So-called digital asset treasury companies, or DATs \u2014 listed firms that accumulate crypto on their balance sheets \u2014 have surged in popularity, offering token exposure in a format that\u2019s more familiar to institutional investors. Such entities now hold about $110 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to CoinGecko, alongside a growing trove of smaller, less liquid tokens.\nTreasury Boom\nThe frenzy has even drawn warnings from Hayes\u2019s family office, Maelstrom, which has backed three DATs. Its general partner Akshat Vaidya said the push may be getting out of hand, potentially putting the broader crypto rally at risk. Hayes \u2014 who is an advisor to Solana-hoarder Upexi Inc. \u2014 says the real test is still ahead.\n\u201cThe DATs that differentiate themselves,\u201d he said, \u201care going to be the ones that are able to get the volume market cap metrics that allow passive index money managers in the United States to allocate to them.\u201d\n\u201cIf they fail at that, then I definitely could see a lot of these treasury companies trading at a discount. And it\u2019s obviously very difficult to unwind these trades if they trade at a discount.\u201d\nTrump Inc. has embraced the treasury model, too. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the loss-making company behind Truth Social, raised more than $2 billion earlier this year to buy Bitcoin. More recently, a little-known Las Vegas-based firm named Alt5 Sigma Corp. announced plans to raise about $1.5 billion to buy crypto, with a focus on Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial\u2019s WLFI token.\nTrump\u2019s sons have also helped to launch a crypto mining venture, while the president and First Lady Melania Trump have debuted their own memecoins, speculative cryptocurrencies that can skyrocket on social media hype and crash just as fast. Trump\u2019s coin is down roughly 80% from a peak reached shortly after it launched.\nThe family\u2019s ever-expanding digital footprint has triggered accusations of conflicts of interest. Yet to Hayes, it\u2019s simply fresh validation of the crypto-led era.\n\u201cIf you have the president of the empire creating his own memecoin and it\u2019s freely tradable, I think that gives license to other politicians to use memecoins as a way to do campaign finance,\u201d he said. \u201cI love that Trump launched his own memecoin. I really don\u2019t care what the price did.\u201d\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P."

Gradison is the acting assistant secretary of the department\u2019s Administration for Children and Families, which handles the grant funding at issue.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration will not allow taxpayer dollars to be used to indoctrinate children. Accountability is coming for every state that uses federal funds to teach children delusional gender ideology,\u201d Gradison said.\nThe California Department of Public Health didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe announcement comes as the Trump administration continues cracking down on gender affirming care services and education in the US.\nTransgender Rights Under Trump: Policy Battles and Legal Flights\nThe US Department of Justice is also ramping up efforts, with recently unsealed court findings showing the administration subpoenaed the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia for 15 categories of information on gender-related care, including names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of patients that received treatment.\nThe Federal Trade Commission is similarly looking into whether gender-affirming care for minors could count as deceptive trade practices.\nThe HHS said in its Thursday announcement that California was teaching \u201ccurricula that could encourage kids to contemplate mutilating their genitals\u201d and instructed educators to tell students that men are at times born with female anatomy.\n\u201cDespite clear direction, California responded to ACF stating they will not be making the required modifications, leading ACF to take decisive action to terminate their PREP grant,\u201d the HHS spokesperson said.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has pushed back on an HHS report earlier this year that claimed the department found little benefit for medical intervention for minors with gender dysphoria. The AAP\u2019s president, Susan Kressly, said in a May statement that the HHS report \u201cmisrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.\u201d\nThe HHS told California Department of Public Health officials in a letter that they can appeal the findings within thirty days.\n\u2013With assistance from Felipe Marques.\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P."

And the basis of his accusation is that I own a home in Maryland, and I own my home in California,\u201d Schiff said in July.\n\u201cBig surprise,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cMembers of Congress, almost all of them, own more than one home or rent more than one home because we\u2019re required to be on both coasts. So he is using my ownership of two homes to make a false claim of mortgage fraud.\u201d\nSchiff\u2019s office on Wednesday, Aug. 20, maintained that the senator accurately told lenders that a house he and his wife purchased in Maryland in 2003 would be used as a \u201cprincipal residence.\u201d\nHis office also maintained that Schiff disclosed to lenders that he owned another home in California, which he also considered a principal residence because he lives there when he\u2019s not in Washington. The senator claimed a homestead tax exemption only for his property in California, Schiff\u2019s office said.\nPreet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney who is representing Schiff, previously called the allegations \u201ctransparently false, stale, and long debunked.\u201d\nBharara also took issue with the fact that the Justice Department tapped Ed Martin to lead the probe into Schiff. Trump had previously nominated Martin to become a U.S. attorney, but Schiff held up Martin\u2019s nomination. In the end, Martin failed to secure enough support in the U.S. Senate to be confirmed and landed in another position within the Justice Department.\n\u201cThe bias here is glaring,\u201d Bharara said in a statement.\nA spokesperson for the Justice Department could not be immediately reached for comment."
