  "content": "Recent reports have suggested Apple is actively considering bringing cellular connectivity to the Mac lineup as early as next year, but arch rival Microsoft isn't waiting around to find out \u2013 the company is launching its first 5G-enabled Surface laptop this month.\n\n\n\nThe Surface Laptop 5G is part of Microsoft's Copilot+ PC lineup aimed at business customers, featuring a 13.8-inch display and Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) processors. Microsoft says it has six \"strategically placed antennas\" that allow it to automatically adjust signal paths and power based on usage. The device includes both Nano SIM and eSIM options, and can also function as a hotspot for other devices.\n\nStarting at $1,700, Microsoft says it will begin shipping its first 5G-enabled Surface laptop on August 26 with support for over 100 carriers worldwide \u2013 though its small print notes that 5G will be available \"later in 2025.\"\n\nThe Surface Laptop's 5G capabilities come as Apple has begun deploying its custom-built C1 modem chip in some devices. The company introduced a sub-6GHz version of its 5G modem in the iPhone 16e earlier this year and is expected to include it in the upcoming iPhone 17 \"Air,\" which will be unveiled next month.\n\nAccording to a December report by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is \"investigating\" the possibility of adding a second-generation C2 modem to a future Mac as early as 2026. According to Gurman, Apple's next-generation C2 modem will support faster mmWave technology and is expected to arrive in 2026, debuting in Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models \u2013 with inclusion in a Mac potentially shortly after.\n\nApple has played with the idea of a cellular MacBook for years now. Back in 2007, the company developed MacBook Pro prototypes with integrated 3G connectivity, including a SIM card slot and an extendable cellular antenna along the right side of the lid. Despite these early experiments, Apple never released a MacBook with built-in cellular capabilities. Here's hoping 2026 will be the year it happens.",

      "text": "Apple 'Investigating' Macs With Cellular Connectivity\nApple is considering bringing cellular connectivity to the Mac lineup for the first time, reports Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The Cupertino company is said to be \"investigating\" the possibility of adding a modem chip to a future Mac, but a cellular Mac isn't likely to launch until 2026 or later.\nEarly in 2025, Apple plans to introduce the custom-built 5G chip that it's had in the works for years now. The modem chip will be added to the iPhone SE, low-cost iPad, and iPhone 17 \"Air,\" giving Apple an opportunity to test the technology before rolling it out to flagship devices.\nFrom there, Apple's custom 5G modem chip will expand to other iPhones and iPads over a three-year period, and it may also come to the Mac. A Mac with a 5G chip would be able to connect to a cellular network just like a 5G-enabled iPhone or iPad, and Wi-Fi or a cellular hotspot would not be required.\nThe first Apple modem chip will be limited to sub-6GHz 5G speeds, but the second-generation version will support faster mmWave technology. Apple is aiming to outcompete Qualcomm with a third-generation model, offering better performance and AI features. Apple ultimately wants to phase out Qualcomm modem chips, replacing them with the modem chips that Apple has designed.\nLast year, Gurman said that Macs with Apple-designed modem chips would be introduced in 2028 at the earliest, with Apple planning to integrate 5G connectivity into its Apple silicon chips.\nMacs with 5G connectivity have been rumored for several years, and way back in 2008, Apple considered adding a modem chip to the MacBook Air. Then-CEO Steve Jobs said that Apple decided not to because the modem chip would take up too much room in the case and would lock customers to a specific carrier, but chip technology has come a long way since then.\nPopular Stories\niOS 26 introduces an Adaptive Power Mode on the iPhone, alongside the existing Low Power Mode.\nApple says that Adaptive Power Mode can make \"small performance adjustments\" when necessary to extend an iPhone's battery life, including slightly lowering the display brightness or allowing some activities to \"take a little longer.\"\nThe full description of Adaptive Power Mode, from the iOS 26...\nThe calendar has turned to August, and that means the iPhone 17 series is just one month away.
