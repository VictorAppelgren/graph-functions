  "content": "The child\u2019s parents were intoxicated from a \u201ccentral nervous system stimulant,\u201d according to officials with the San Bernardino County sheriff\u2019s Colorado River station.\n\nTwo parents have been arrested after police found their toddler wandering alone on the overpass of a railroad in Needles.\n\nAround 6 a.m. Sunday morning, the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department responded to a report of the 2-year-old at L Street and Broadway Street. They found the child alone, wearing no shoes and roaming along the track, according to a release from the Sheriff\u2019s Department Colorado River station.\n\nAuthorities said that the child\u2019s parents, identified as Bradley Underwood, 48, and Sara Estrada, 30, then arrived at the scene. The railroad runs alongside the family\u2019s neighborhood, the department said.\n\nThe couple were intoxicated from a \u201ccentral nervous system stimulant,\u201d authorities said. Evidence was gathered at the couple\u2019s home nearby, and they were both arrested on suspicion of child abuse and taken to the sheriff\u2019s Colorado River station jail. Underwood also faces a potential charge of violating post-release community supervision and was held with no bail. They both await court hearings, with Estrada\u2019s bail set at $50,000, authorities said.\n\nThe toddler was taken to the station, where Child and Family Services later assumed custody of her, the release said.\n\nThe department advised those with more information on the case to call Deputy B. Moore at (760) 326-9200 or to submit an anonymous tip at WeTip.",

      "text": "L.A. County children abducted by parents remain missing two weeks later\n- Share via\nAuthorities are still searching for a brother and sister who were abducted by their parents earlier this month during a supervised visit in South Los Angeles.\nThe children \u2014 2-year-old Willow and 4-year-old Wyman \u2014 had been in foster care since last year, when their newborn sibling tested positive for drugs, ABC7 reported. According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, the children\u2019s parents \u2014 Tiffany Bryant, 39, and David James, 53 \u2014 fled with Willow and Wyman from a Department of Child Support Services facility.\nThe parents were driving a brown 2008 Buick Enclave SUV with a blue paper license plate in front and a missing license plate at the rear of the vehicle, according to authorities.\nThe four were last seen around 3:10 p.m. in the 8300 block of Vermont Avenue.\nNina Glass with the nonprofit Search and Rescue San Antonio TX Inc. is providing assistance to the foster family who was caring for Wyman and Willow when they were abducted. James and Bryant left the third child, now 15 months old, at the Department of Child Support Services during their supervised visit, Glass said.\nThat child has been with his caregivers for approximately one year, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nThe Department of Children and Family Services said in a statement it \u201cshares the community\u2019s deep concern for the well-being of the missing children\u201d but would not provide any specific details about the case due to state confidentiality laws.\nThe children were taken by their biological mother for nine hours in May \u2014 years after they were adopted \u2014 according to a claim that could result in a lawsuit against the LAUSD.\nWillow is described as 2 feet tall and 28 pounds, with brown eyes and blonde hair. She was last seen wearing a blue shirt, pink and white shorts and pink and white Nike shoes. Her brother Wyman is 2 feet tall and 35 pounds with blonde hair and blue eyes. He was last seen wearing a blue shirt and gray shorts.\nAuthorities said there is concern for the kids\u2019 well-being, but they did not provide any additional information.\nThere have been no reported sightings of the family since they were last seen, said Glass, who shares daily bulletins about missing people on her nonprofit\u2019s social media accounts. An Amber Alert was issued Aug. 19 warning people in Southern California to be on the lookout for the parents and kids.\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting out daily reminders about the case,\u201d Glass said. \u201cFor anyone out in the world who might come across them, we want to make sure they know what they look like.\u201d\nAnyone with information can call the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Missing Persons Unit at (323) 890-5500. Anonymous tips can be made with Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (8477)."
