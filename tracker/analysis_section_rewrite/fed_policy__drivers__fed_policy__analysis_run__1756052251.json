      "feedback": "Overall assessment: the draft builds a solid Regime A/B/C framework and ties macro, policy, and single-stock dynamics (Ford, oil) to a long‑horizon, productivity‑driven view, but it lacks a crisp causal chain, relies on non‑source or incomplete elements, and omits a tight, sourced watch‑list that would make the cross‑topic synthesis actionable. Actionable edits: drop ACMR and Navarro references and reframe all claims strictly to the five source IDs (NL5YYTLF2, 22PL3Q360, 65UUBU0OR, J99EM2TPZ, RHFWI02JT); articulate a clear stepwise causal chain from AI/TFP productivity to disciplined capex to durable earnings and then to valuation multiples, explicitly stating how regime shifts alter inflation dynamics and discount rates (or rely on the source’s language if it provides thresholds); convert the “A→B/C” transitions into either well‑defined thresholds (if NL5YYTLF2 provides them) or explicit qualitative conditions and timelines; fix numerical gaps by anchoring every figure to a cited value (e.g., Ford Q2 EV loss ≈ $1.3B; adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%; ROIC ≈ 10.1%; 2014–2024 revenue CAGR ≈ 2.5% from 22PL3Q360; IEA 2025 supply growth ≈ 2.5 mbpd from J99EM2TPZ; 15% tariff envelope with carve‑outs from RHFWI02JT) and remove trailing incomplete lines (e.g., “gross margin ≈ 4” and “revenue midpoint ≈ $900m”) unless you can source exact figures; constrain near‑term catalysts to sourced items (tariff pause, policy signals, oil supply/demand inflection per J99EM2TPZ) and exclude unsourced conjectures (Navarro, speculative 50% tariffs); craft a concise cross‑topic synthesis that explicitly links macro/policy/flows/valuation through the regime framework; produce a 5‑point watch‑list of decisive signals with clear measurements and timing (e.g., automation exposure threshold and its quarterly trajectory; Ford EV-margin readouts; tariff trajectory/renewal timing; oil‑supply/demand inflection indicators; labor slack metrics) and a falsification test (e.g., if automation diffusion stalls or policy space tightens beyond a defined rule, shift the view toward Regime B/C); tighten prose for readability, ensure every claim is sourced to one of the IDs, and keep the length within the intended SECTION FOCUS constraints.",
