  "content": "Investing.com - H.C. Wainwright has reiterated its Buy rating and $116.00 price target on Inc. (NASDAQ: ) following an analyst day at the company\u2019s Houston calibration lab last week. Currently trading at $86.03, the stock has significant upside potential, with 4 analysts recently revising their earnings estimates upward according to InvestingPro data.\n\nThe research firm highlighted the positive impact of increasing automation within Transcat\u2019s service segment, noting that it has already helped move service segment margins to the mid-30.0% range from the low-30.0% range over the past few years. This improvement aligns with the company\u2019s current gross profit margin of 32.14% and healthy revenue growth of 8.49% over the last twelve months.\n\nDuring the facility tour, H.C. Wainwright observed that automation efficiency gains were evident as technicians were able to work on multiple assignments simultaneously, with approximately seven full-time programmers dedicated to expanding these capabilities. InvestingPro analysis reveals the company maintains strong operational efficiency with a current ratio of 2.92, indicating robust liquidity to support its automation initiatives.\n\nThe firm projects service segment gross margin to reach 35.8% in FY27, up from 33.4% in FY25, with potential to move to 40.0% over time, while also noting that equipment rental facilities should continue to see elevated demand levels, driving margin improvement across distribution.\n\nH.C. Wainwright expects the combination of increasing revenue (both organic and inorganic), expanding gross margins across both segments, and cost discipline to result in stronger operating leverage going forward.\n\nIn other recent news, Transcat Inc. reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations. The company achieved an adjusted earnings per share of $0.59, significantly higher than the forecasted $0.40. Additionally, Transcat\u2019s revenue for the quarter reached $76.4 million, exceeding the anticipated $72.28 million. In a separate development, Oppenheimer reiterated its Perform rating on Transcat after meeting with the company\u2019s leadership at its Houston calibration laboratory. During the meeting, Transcat\u2019s management reaffirmed their long-term revenue target of $500 million annually. They emphasized growth through recurring service revenue, strategic acquisitions, and efficiency improvements via automation. These recent developments highlight the company\u2019s financial performance and strategic direction.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
