  "content": "Investing.com -- Roth upgraded Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $19 from $16, saying the company\u2019s business is showing signs of improvement after a difficult stretch.\n\nWhile second-quarter revenue came in slightly below expectations, Lyft reported record levels of rides and operating margins. \n\n\n\nThe company also added more new riders and said more trips were booked through its partner network, which includes United Airlines and Chase.\n\nRoth said Lyft is in a better position heading into the second half of the year, helped by its acquisition of Freenow, a European ride-hailing service that adds nine new markets. \n\n\n\nThe firm expects that deal to support stronger growth in bookings and improve Lyft\u2019s market position outside the U.S.\n\nLyft is also spending less to attract drivers and riders, helping profits improve. Its adjusted operating margin reached a record in the second quarter, and free cash flow turned positive. Lyft is also buying back stock and expects to cut further costs through 2027.\n\nStill, the firm noted several risks, including the potential for pricing pressure from rival Uber (NYSE:UBER) and uncertainty over how much Freenow will contribute in the near term. \n\n\n\nThere are also questions around Lyft\u2019s progress in autonomous driving, an area where Uber has a lead.\n\nEven so, Roth said recent results point to a more stable business, and at current prices, the stock looks undervalued.\n\nRoth upgrades Lyft, says business is stabilizing after Freenow deal\n\nAfter soaring 149%, this stock is back in our AI\u2019s favor - & already +25% in July",
