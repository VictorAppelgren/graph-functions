  "content": "For decades, homeownership has stood as the bedrock of the American dream \u2014 a symbol of prosperity, stability, and upward mobility. But for millions of U.S. households in 2025, that dream is rapidly transforming into a source of financial fragility.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nData from the latest PYMNTS Intelligence in the July 2025 New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report, \u201cThe Adjustable-Rate Reckoning: How Homeownership Is Pushing Millions Paycheck to Paycheck,\u201d reveals that a confluence of rising home prices, sticky inflation and the delayed impact of interest rate hikes has turned a growing share of homeowners into paycheck-to-paycheck survivors.\n\nAt the heart of this reckoning is a significant shift in borrowing behavior. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), once a niche product with a checkered past, are gaining renewed relevance in a high-rate environment. But as these loans reset, homeowners are grappling with a new financial reality: one where housing, once a source of equity, becomes a destabilizing liability.\n\nAccording to the PYMNTS Intelligence report, more than 24 million Americans living paycheck to paycheck attribute their precarious financial state to the costs of homeownership \u2014 particularly mortgage burdens.\n\nWhy the American Dream Is Getting More Expensive\n\nSince March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates from near zero to a 23-year high, seeking to tame inflation. While much of the immediate impact was felt in business and capital markets, mortgage borrowers \u2014 especially those with ARMs \u2014 are now experiencing the lagged effects.\n\nAccording to PYMNTS Intelligence data, homeowners with ARMs are disproportionately burdened. Nearly 80% of those living paycheck to paycheck have increased credit card usage in recent months to manage rising mortgage payments. These borrowers are also more likely than their fixed-rate counterparts to defer large purchases or cut back on discretionary spending.\n\nThis behavior isn\u2019t isolated. It signals a broader tightening of consumer liquidity across the middle and upper-middle class, even among households that traditionally maintained financial buffers. The PYMNTS Intelligence report underscores that high income is no longer a reliable proxy for financial stability. In fact, over one-third of ARM borrowers making more than $100,000 annually now report living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nAfter all, to afford a median-priced home in 2025, a household requires an annual income of $116,986 \u2014 up 50% from five years ago. The median home price is now exceeding $416,900, up 100% since the financial crisis.\n\nThis disconnect between home prices and wage growth \u2014 average household income grew just 1.3% between 2020 and 2023 \u2014 means that an increasing number of buyers are stretching themselves thin to enter the market. The decision to own is no longer a straightforward investment play.\n\nRead the report: The Adjustable-Rate Reckoning: How Homeownership Is Pushing Millions Paycheck to Paycheck\n\nThe most revealing aspect of the study is not the existence of financial hardship, but its demographic breadth. Living paycheck to paycheck is no longer a symptom of low income. It now encompasses millions of middle- and upper-income Americans.\n\nNotably, among paycheck-to-paycheck consumers with mortgages, 31% say it\u2019s entirely due to homeownership costs, while 36% cite a mix of factors. This bifurcation is critical for banks, retailers and policymakers: a one-size-fits-all solution won\u2019t suffice.\n\nIn this environment, tools like BNPL are not just convenience products\u2014they are financial infrastructure. Among homeowners with mortgages, 1 in 5 reported using BNPL services in the past six months, more than renters or outright owners. For choice-driven consumers, BNPL is a way to manage cash flow without paying interest. For necessity-driven users, it may be a last resort.\n\nThe rise of consumer-grade financial engineering poses both opportunities and risks for providers. FinTech lenders and embedded finance platforms are uniquely positioned to serve this demand. However, underwriting quality and default exposure remain concerns as credit usage climbs.\n\nTraditional banks, meanwhile, are rethinking product strategies. The line between secured and unsecured debt is blurring. Mortgage holders using credit cards or BNPL to cover household costs are indirectly leveraging their homes for cash flow \u2014 without the formal structure of a HELOC or refinance.",

      "text": "Homeownership has been a cornerstone of the American Dream ever since the New Deal introduced the 30-year mortgage following the Great Depression. What\u2019s new is how that widely held aspiration increasingly comes with strings. Property prices vary wildly by region and zip code, of course, but the toughest housing market in more than a generation means the average home went for $416,900 in the first quarter of this year. This price tag is more than double the amount in early 2009 following the subprime mortgage crisis.\nNeedless to say, the rise in most people\u2019s household incomes hasn\u2019t kept up with real estate\u2019s vertiginous run-up. The steep price tag means that a larger share of a typical homeowner\u2019s income now goes to the mortgage for their house, apartment or condo. Bankrate estimates that the average U.S. homebuyer now needs an annual household income of $116,986 to afford the typical property. This is nearly 50% more than just five years ago. Meanwhile, average household income rose just 1.3% from 2020 to 2023, according to the most recent data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s St. Louis branch. Inflation has also cut into pocketbooks. The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows you need $191 today to buy what $100 bought in January 2025.\nHowever, despite the worsening pocketbook economics, homebuyers are willing to sacrifice their financial safety nets to achieve the American dream. More than two-thirds of U.S. consumers now live paycheck to paycheck, with their monthly income going out the door for basic bills and other expenses as soon as it comes in. Among those, 14% cite the financial strain of buying a home as a key reason for their financial condition. That means more than 24 million consumers live with crimped pocketbooks at least partly as a result of a tradeoff they deliberately made in order to own a home. As owning a new home often comes with a more restrictive financial lifestyle, many consumers choose pay-later credit methods that help make that possible. Nowhere is that more evident than with homeowners paying adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs).\nThe share of consumers living paycheck to paycheck overall has decreased very slightly from its peak in April and May. But over the last two years, the youngest and highest-income segments have experienced the greatest strain with this financial tightrope. That signals that homebuyers and homeowners across the spectrum are choosing to put a larger share of their income toward owning a home.\nOnly about one-third of consumers living paycheck to paycheck do so solely out of financial necessity.\nPYMNTS Intelligence research finds that among consumers living paycheck to paycheck, 31% do so by choice. That is, these consumers\u2019 financial lifestyles are a result of their voluntary spending decisions. This group is the most likely to cite buying a residence as a key reason. Another 34% of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers attribute their financial lifestyle to necessity\u2014to not making enough money to save or pay for anything beyond monthly bills for necessities and whatever discretionary items they choose. The remaining 35% of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers live that way due to a combination of circumstance and choice.\nThese are just some of the findings explored in \u201cThe Adjustable-Rate Reckoning: How Homeownership Is Pushing Millions Paycheck to Paycheck,\u201d the latest installment of\u201c New Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence exclusive series. This edition examines the financial tradeoffs consumers make and the expense management strategies they use to afford homeownership. It draws on insights from a survey of 2,135 consumers conducted from June 2, 2025, to June 23, 2025\n24.4 Million Consumers Cite Homeownership as a Reason for Living Paycheck to Paycheck\nHomeownership is a key reason for consumers choosing to live paycheck to paycheck. Nearly one in five such consumers cite buying a home that stretched their budget as a key reason they cannot live solely on their savings. These consumers aren\u2019t buying a bigger or fancier house than they can safely afford. Instead, they\u2019re holding mortgages that cut into their income. This share is greater than the 14% of all paycheck-to-paycheck individuals who said the same. It is far higher than the 7.8% of consumers who live this way by necessity, who cited this reason. The upshot is that homeownership is a major factor behind sending consumers into a paycheck-to-paycheck financial lifestyle. It ranks only behind taking time off work, buying a car and starting a business or freelancing as a primary source of income.\nSimilarly, consumers living paycheck to paycheck by choice are more likely than others in this lifestyle to be considering buying a home. Among these, 13% are actively looking to buy. This percentage is nearly three times the share of those living paycheck to paycheck by necessity. Meanwhile, by-necessity consumers are more likely to be considering purchasing a home down the line.\nHomeowners Are More Likely than Other Paycheck-to-Paycheck Individuals to Use BNPL to Manage Expenses\nWith mortgages often accounting for a significant portion of these consumers\u2019 incomes, they are turning to alternative budgeting tools to manage expenses. Many, for instance, are using BNPL to afford large purchases.\nOne in four consumers living paycheck to paycheck by choice report that they used BNPL for larger purchases in the past six months to manage rising living costs. This figure is more than twice the share of those living paycheck to paycheck by necessity. It seems that the widespread perception that shoppers use BNPL, which typically splits purchase payments into three or four monthly installments, out of desperation may be misleading. Many consumers whose budgets are stretched are using the credit method as a deliberate budgeting strategy.\nEven homeowners are leveraging BNPL as a tool to manage rising living costs. One in five homeowners who pay a mortgage report having used BNPL in the past six months. This figure exceeds the share of renters who reported the same. Mortgage payers are the most likely of all paycheck-to-paycheck consumers to use the pay later method, intentionally utilizing BNPL as a flexible budgeting solution.\nBNPL users are utilizing the credit tool in conjunction with other financial strategies to mitigate rising living costs. For instance, 41% of BNPL users have also reduced their nonessential spending in the past six months. Additionally, one in three have delayed or canceled a major purchase such as appliances, furniture or a car. It is evident that consumers are using BNPL as part of a broader, disciplined financial approach. They are combining flexible payment options with spending cuts to optimize their budgets.\nAdjustable-Rate Mortgages Strain Paycheck-to-Paycheck Homeowners\u2019 Budgets\nAdjustable-rate mortgages can leave consumers in a tricky position financially. As such, borrowers with such mortgages are taking more actions to manage rising living costs than their counterparts with fixed-rate mortgages.\nFor instance, 42% of adjustable-rate mortgage holders living paycheck to paycheck report they have cut back on nonessential spending in the last six months. Just 37% of fixed-rate mortgage holders living paycheck to paycheck say the same. Similarly, 39% of those with adjustable rates have delayed or canceled a major purchase. In comparison, just 31% of those with fixed rates did so.\nThese disparities suggest that, as rates rise, these types of mortgages are cornering homeowners into more intensive financial coping strategies as they juggle cost pressures.\nAdjustable-rate mortgage holders also rely more heavily on credit to make ends meet. They are more likely to use credit cards to cover basic expenses than those with fixed rates. Additionally, nearly eight in 10 paycheck-to-paycheck consumers with adjustable-rate mortgages have increased their use of credit in the last six months. Just over half of those with fixed rates have done the same. Only 2.9% of paycheck-to-paycheck adjustable-rate mortgage holders have decreased their use of credit in that timeframe, compared to 15% of fixed-rate mortgage holders. It appears that, as mortgage payments increase, homeowners are becoming more reliant on deferring payments for purchases.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the consumer trends driving innovation in consumer finance, digital payments and financial inclusion.
