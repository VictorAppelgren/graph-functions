  "description": "President Trump has long railed about crime in blue cities. Now he\u2019s effectively put himself in charge of policing one of them.",
  "content": "Closely flanked by the defense secretary and the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official, President Trump sought to project an image of raw power on Monday as he announced his plans to send National Guard troops to the nation\u2019s capital and engineer a federal takeover of its police department.\n\nHe also sounded a little like he wanted a job other than his own: Mayor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to replace the medians that are falling down all over the road, we\u2019re going to replace the potholes,\u201d Trump said, just after urging the nation\u2019s tourists not to be put off from their trips to see the White House or the Air and Space Museum by the apocalyptic stories of murders and carjackings that he was telling at that very moment, despite the fact that the city\u2019s violent crime rate has fallen.\n\n\u201cKeep coming!\u201d Trump said, briefly assuming another mantle, that of local tourism director. \u201cBy the time you get your trip set, it\u2019s going to be safe again.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump has deployed the National Guard to cities before, including in Los Angeles earlier this year and in Washington in 2020, this is the first time that he has actually moved to take control of a local police force, and to make a city\u2019s crime his problem.",
