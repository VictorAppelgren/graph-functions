      "summary": "Ukraine’s intelligence has identified more than 260 foreign‑made tools used by Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, including equipment from the US, Germany, and China. Most of these items were purchased before 2022, but their presence raises concerns that sanctions could cut off spare parts and software, potentially hampering Russia’s tank production. Kyiv urges foreign manufacturers to monitor exports and consider GPS tracking and on‑site inspections to prevent further support of Russia’s military industry.",
