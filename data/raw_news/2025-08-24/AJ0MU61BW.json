  "content": "MIDDLESEX COUNTY, NJ - As autumn approaches, the Middlesex County Office of Parks and Recreation is calling on community members to roll up their sleeves and help preserve the county's natural treasures through a series of volunteer conservation projects.\n\nThe department has organized three special volunteer events running from September through November, each focusing on different aspects of environmental stewardship across the county's park system. The fall volunteer season kicks off on Saturday, Sept. 27, with National Public Lands Day at Ireland Brook Conservation Area in East Brunswick. From 9 a.m. to noon, volunteers will tackle trail maintenance and participate in ongoing restoration projects that help preserve this 581-acre natural space along Riva Avenue.\n\nThe conservation efforts continue on Saturday, October 18, with a Beach Sweep at Raritan Bay Waterfront Park in South Amboy. This shoreline cleanup, running from 9 a.m. to noon, is part of a statewide initiative organized in partnership with Clean Ocean Action. Located at 201 John T O'Leary Boulevard, Raritan Bay Waterfront Park provides crucial habitat for marine life and serves as a recreational destination for county residents. The beach sweep addresses the ongoing challenge of coastal pollution while raising awareness about marine conservation.\n\nThe volunteer season concludes on Saturday, Nov. 15, with Fall Trails Day at Davidson's Mill Pond Park in North Brunswick. This 9 a.m. to noon event focuses on trail maintenance and habitat improvement projects throughout the park's diverse ecosystems. Davidson's Mill Pond Park, located on Riva Avenue, encompasses wetlands, woodlands, and open spaces that provide habitat for various wildlife species. The Fall Trails Day activities help ensure these trails remain accessible and safe for the thousands of visitors who use them for hiking, birdwatching, and nature study.\n\nRegistration is required for all three events. Interested volunteers can contact Julia DeRosso at 732-745-8147 or email juliaderosso@co.middlesex.nj.us to sign up for any or all of the conservation projects. The parks department encourages volunteers of all ages and skill levels to participate, with activities suitable for families, groups, and individuals. Volunteers should dress appropriately for outdoor work and bring water bottles and sun protection.",
