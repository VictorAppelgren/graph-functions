  "content": "The provision in the law signed by President Trump in July eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them. It\u2019s temporary and runs from 2025 until 2028. It applies to people who make less than $160,000 in 2025.\n\nA bit more unexpected? Podcasters and social media influencers will also be excluded from forking over a portion of their tips, according to the list released Tuesday by the Treasury Department.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Golf caddies, blackjack dealers and house painters are among the jobs covered under the Trump administration\u2019s preliminary list of occupations no required to pay income tax on their tips under Republicans\u2019 new tax cuts and spending bill.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab estimates that there were roughly 4 million workers in tipped occupations in 2023, which amounts to roughly 2.5% of all jobs.\n\nThe administration was required to publish a list of qualifying occupations within 90 days of the bill\u2019s signing. The full list of occupations is located on the Treasury Department website.\n\nThey are broken down into eight categories, including beverage and food service; entertainment and events; hospitality and guest services; home services; personal services; personal appearance and wellness; recreation and instruction; and transportation and delivery.\n\nAmong other jobs exempted from tax on tips are sommeliers, cocktail waiters, pastry chefs, cake bakers, bingo workers, club dancers, DJs, clowns, streamers, online video creators, ushers, maids, gardeners, electricians, house cleaners, tow truck drivers, wedding planners, personal care aides, tutors, au pairs, massage therapists, yoga instructors, cobblers, skydiving pilots, ski instructors, parking garage attendants, delivery drivers and movers.\n\nA report from the Budget Lab shows that the effects of the law would be small, given that tipped workers tend to be lower income. More than 37% of tipped workers, or over one third, earned income low enough that they faced no federal income tax in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe larger and far more uncertain effect would stem from behavioral changes incentivized by the bill, such as substitution into tipped employment and tipped income, which would increase the bill\u2019s overall cost,\u201d states the report, which was written by Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Budget Lab.\n\nCongressional budget analysts project the \u201cNo Tax on Tips\u201d provision would increase the deficit by $40 billion through 2028. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in June that the tips deduction will cost $32 billion over 10 years.\n\nOnly tips reported to the employer and noted on a worker\u2019s W-2, their end-of-year tax summary, will qualify. Payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare, would still be collected along with state and local taxes.\n\nPolling shows Americans have panned the big bill. Half US adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most \u2014 about 6 in 10 \u2014 think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people.",

  "summary": "The Trump administration has released a preliminary list of occupations exempt from federal income taxes on tips under its 'no tax on tips' plan, which eliminates federal taxes for people working in jobs traditionally receiving them. The list also includes podcasters and social media influencers. The temporary provision, which runs from 2025 until 2028, applies to people who make less than $160,000 in 2025. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that there were roughly 4 million workers in tipped occupations in 2023, representing roughly 2.5% of all jobs. The Treasury Department has not specified which jobs will be exempt from tax. However, a report from the Budget Lab suggests that the effects of the law would be small given that tipped workers tend to be lower income. The provision could increase the deficit by $40 billion through 2028.",
