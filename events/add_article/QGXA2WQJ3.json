      "summary": "Shopify’s stock surged 22% after its Q2 2025 earnings, driven by strong growth in gross merchandise volume (up 27% YoY) and revenue (up 29% YoY). The company’s no‑code, AI‑enhanced ecosystem has helped it regain profitability after abandoning its costly fulfillment network, but its valuation remains high with a P/E of ~70 and a P/S of 18. While the stock is still only about 20% below its all‑time high, investors should approach it cautiously, balancing the upside from continued growth against the risk of a near‑term pullback. The Motley Fool’s analyst team does not currently rank Shopify among its top 10 picks, suggesting a more selective stance for investors.\n",
