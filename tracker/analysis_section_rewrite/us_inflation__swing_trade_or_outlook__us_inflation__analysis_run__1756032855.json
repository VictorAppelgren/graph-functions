      "feedback": "The draft is rich but currently fails the Section Focus constraints and could be elevated to world‑class with four crisp movers, a grounded trade plan, and tighter, evidence‑anchored logic. Actionable edits: (1) Replace the present multi‑topic text with exactly four Movers lines in the required Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability% format, two Up and two Down, each tied to a single, first‑principles driver (AI/cloud moat, macro productivity, and policy/oil dynamics) and with probabilities rooted in material evidence (cite IDs next to the facts you rely on). For example, Up 3–6m could cite Range productivity and cloud moat momentum (e.g., UPV3X2MQ6; 0G3A676BP; QFDWCTAYB), Up 6–12m could cite Azure/MSFT cloud trajectory and Shopify margin rebound (0G3A676BP; TN66GHPAT; QFDWCTAYB), Down 3–6m could cite AI‑growth deceleration and inflation risk (A7VLN74BK; FOM34PUWA), and Down 6–12m could cite policy/rate risk and oil‑supply shocks (TN66GHPAT; J99EM2TPZ). (2) For Probability%, calibrate to explicit material facts rather than default guesses; if you must, anchor to a transparent rubric (e.g., base‑case 50–60% Up, 20–30% Down, with 0–10% tail risks) and annotate the exact sources (IDs) you used to derive each number. (3) Decide whether the asset you’re modeling is tradable; if yes, present a Swing Trade Plan with the full 10‑field format (Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability% | Confidence), using a concrete instrument (e.g., SHOP or MSFT) and explicit price levels or ranges, otherwise provide a single Outlook line: Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability% | Confidence. (4) Tighten the rationale to a clean chain: base case grounded in cloud/AI moat expansion → durable FCF and ROIC → valuation support, with explicit alt/bear case tied to identifiable catalysts (tariff extension, oil supply, inflation path). (5) Eliminate non‑core alt channels (Pacaso, Mogul, Gameflip) from the Movers unless you explicitly link them as liquidity/alt‑asset risk signals in a separate watchlist; keep the core line items tightly focused on AI/cloud, labor productivity, and macro policy. (6) Ensure every factual claim that feeds the lines has an in‑text citation to the provided IDs; if conflicts arise between sources (e.g., Just Capital vs HBR themes), summarize the base‑case as the strongest consensus and note the alternative view succinctly within the same line or as a brief side comment. (7) Aim for concise, single‑sentence lines per mover with one crisp watch item each, and a one‑line Outlook if tradable, or a single concise 1–line Outlook if not tradable. (8) Finally, enforce the formatting discipline: four Movers only, each line strictly as required, no extra trailing prose, and keep the entire output to the stated length and cadence so the swing view is immediately actionable.",
