Why Trust Us?\n\nAfter several months of delays and extensions, President Donald Trump\u2019s extensive tariff plan was implemented Thursday just after midnight, marking the start of a more aggressive phase in his global trade overhaul.\n\nMost imports to the U.S. will now be subject to a 10% baseline tariff. NBC News says that as a result, the average effective tariff rate will exceed 17%, the highest level since the Great Depression in 1935. This increase is largely due to steeper tariffs on goods from some of America\u2019s largest trading partners, according to the Yale Budget Lab.\n\n\n\nWhen the Trump administration imposed tariffs starting in 2018, the goal was to target China. But the effect of those tariffs has rippled through American consumers' everyday purchases. Many goods, from electronics to cars, rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing, meaning higher prices at checkout were inevitable. Businesses either absorbed the cost or passed it down to consumers.\n\nThe impact on prices will vary depending on the type of goods and the specific industries involved. For instance, products with significant amounts of imported materials (like tech gadgets) could see a more noticeable price jump. Additionally, items from major trading partners like China, Mexico, and the European Union may become more expensive.\n\nOver time, if the tariffs stay in place or escalate, economists expect broader inflation on all products that involve imported materials from the impacted countries, CBS News says.\n\nIf you plan to shop for a new laptop, home appliances, or even a car in the near future, you will likely notice price increases. The electronics sector will be one of the hardest hit by the trade war. CNN says computers were among the top U.S. imports last year, with major suppliers including China, Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and India. While most Chinese goods face a 30% tariff, computers are taxed at 20%, though rates may rise if a new trade deal isn't reached by August 12.\n\nIn light of these tariffs, some companies are looking for ways to invest in the United States' manufacturing. Apple has announced plans to invest over $500 billion over the next four years. These plans include hiring 20,000 people and building a new server factory in Texas. Other companies like Chobani, Johnson & Johnson, Honda, and Hyundai have similar plans.\n\nWhat Is Currently Available For a Low Price?\n\nAccording to CNN, the products most likely to skyrocket in price are computers, clothing, watches, shoes, furniture, and toys. Now is the time to stock up on anything you may need from the aforementioned list, as prices are expected to rise by mid-fall if trade deals are not made.\n\nSome of our favorite tested products from these categories are still available at their original prices (or sale prices, even). TVs from LG, headphones from Bose, watches from G-Shock, and even an extremely popular laptop from Apple are currently seeing great sale prices before the expected tariff hikes hit.

      "text": "President Donald Trump has said that tariffs won\u2019t lead to higher prices. But the United States economy seems to disagree: Inflation, which has remained fairly tame, is slowly creeping up because of tariffs.\nTrump\u2019s latest round of higher taxes on imports, which went into effect Thursday, will immediately make imported goods from impacted countries more expensive in the United States.\nAnd while businesses have tried to shoulder part of the cost, they now may be forced to pass along some of those expenses to consumers. That means higher prices for Americans.\nHere\u2019s what could get more expensive:\nComputers and other electronics\nComputers are among the top goods the United States imported last year, according to US Commerce Department data. The top countries that exported computers and other electronic products to the United States last year were China, Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia.\nGoods from China already face a minimum tariff of 30% \u2013 except for computers, which face tariffs of only 20%.\nHowever, rates could soon shoot even higher if a trade deal is not reached with China by August 12. Goods from Mexico can be shipped to the US duty-free if they comply with a trade deal Trump signed during his first term.\nMeanwhile, taxes on goods from Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia nearly doubled on Thursday, from the 10% they were being charged in April to the 19% or 20% they\u2019re being charged now.\nWhile not among the top five sources of foreign-produced computers, India is still a major supplier of computers and other electronics to the US. Goods from there are facing 25% minimum tariffs.\nAnd although fully assembled computers are exempt from \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, many components used to make computers face tariffs, which may be why prices were up 1.4% in June compared to the prior month, according to Consumer Price Index data.\nAdditionally, economists at the Yale Budget Lab estimate that the tariffs Trump put in place, if left unchanged indefinitely, could cause computer and other electronic prices to rise by 17% in the short run and 7.7% in the long run. The authors consider the short run to be two to three years from now, while the long run is considered three to ten years. And their estimates take into account all tariff exemptions in place as of August 7.\nClothing\nAs with electronics, America buys much of its apparel from other countries. Top destinations include China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia.\nThe tariffs Trump placed on these countries are impactful for the cost of clothing, especially since that\u2019s one of the top goods the US imports overall.\nYale Budget Lab estimates prices could rise by 36.6% in the short run and 18% in the long run.\nWatches\nWristwatches are one of the top exports to the United States from Switzerland, which is facing a 39% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff. Last year the country sent over $4 billion worth of watches to the United States.\nPrices of leather products, which often include watches, are estimated to rise by 39% in the short run and 18% in the long run.\nShoes\nChina, Vietnam and Indonesia are top destinations where shoes are made and tariffs start at a minimum of 19% for the three countries.\nLike watches, many kinds of shoes use leather and could face similar price increases as a result.\nAlcohol\nImported wine and spirits encompass 35% of revenue of all US sales in the alcohol market, according to the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America (WSWA).\nTariffs on goods from the European Union, a main supplier of alcoholic beverages, including wine, whiskey and vodka, rose Thursday from 10% to 15%.\nFurniture\nVietnam is the top source of imported furniture, followed by China.\nToys\nChina and Vietnam are the top two countries that ship toys to the United States. Toy brands have already been warning of higher prices due to the tariffs in place on Chinese goods. The higher tariffs on Vietnamese goods are also likely to be a pressure point.\nWhen could tariff-related price increases happen?\nIn addition to the fact that businesses haven\u2019t been fully passing on tariff costs to consumers thus far, in anticipation of higher import taxes, many spent months stockpiling goods.\nThat\u2019s in part why Goldman Sachs economists estimate it takes eight months for the effect of the costs of imported consumer goods \u201cto be fully realized in consumer prices.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Elise Hammond contributed reporting."

      "text": "With new tariffs in effect, economists see profit dips and price hikes up ahead\nPresident Trump's sweeping tariffs, which went into effect on Thursday, are likely to have a negative effect on companies' bottom lines and cause consumer prices to rise, trade experts say.\nWith the new duties on imports from dozens of U.S. trade partners now in place, Mr. Trump's foreign trade policy is expected to lead to even more dramatic cost increases for American companies and consumers, according to economists.\n\"Even if they might not raise prices immediately, it's unlikely that most businesses are just going to be willing to eat the extra costs forever,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, an online lending marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch.\nThe impact of tariffs on consumer prices was initially muted, explained Shulz, as firms can be reluctant to be the first among their competitors to institute price hikes. While some companies waited to see where tariff rates settled before adjusting retail prices, others took steps to absorb added costs to avoid turning off customers. But companies can't employ such measures forever, according to experts.\n\"You don't want to be the first to raise prices, even if you have a perfectly legitimate reason for doing so,\" Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So, I suspect once we see businesses start raising their prices more, that might embolden others to do so as well.\"\nThat could mean a tsunami of price hike announcements from corporations, some of which have already warned of tariff impacts, or instituted \"tariff surcharges\" to cover their added costs.\nTo date, Mr. Trump's tariffs on the U.S.'s trade partners have generated billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. government collected about $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, according to the Treasury Department. That reflects a 242% jump in revenue collected from duties since July 2024.\nIn addition to paying down the national debt, which currently stands at more than $36 trillion, those billions in new tariff revenue may be used to issue rebate checks for Americans, Mr. Trump suggested last month.\nProfit dips\nTariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.\n\"There is very little evidence that foreign exporters to the U.S. are reducing their prices,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're not seeing broad-based evidence of price cuts by countries, and that's an indication that foreign exporters realize that it's U.S. importers, U.S. businesses and eventually consumers that are bearing the brunt of this tariff-induced inflation acceleration.\"\nCompanies from personal electronics companies to automakers have already experienced the damaging effects of Mr. Trump's foreign trade policies on profits.\nOn Thursday Toyota, the world's largest auto maker, reported a 37% drop in profit in the April-June quarter and said it cut its full-year earnings forecast largely because of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Other auto makers have also said they expect to see profit drops as a result of the new levies.\nGM has projected a tariff hit of up to $5 billion for 2025, and Ford has said tariffs will cost the company $3 billion in revenue for the year.\nLiquor companies are in the tariff crosshairs, too. Guinness maker Diageo said it expects tariffs to cost it $200 million a year.\nWalmart in May warned that higher tariffs would force it to increase prices on a wide range of items at its stores, from bananas to children's car seats.\nPrice hikes\nSome companies have said outright that in order to bear the added costs from the new tariffs they'll have to pass along some of the pain to consumers in the form of price hikes.\nFor example, popular consumer electronics marker Sonos, which makes speakers, said on its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday that it would raise prices on its audio devices as a result of higher reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Malaysia, where Sonos devices for the U.S. market are made.\nOverall, as a result of the levies, Americans are expected to pay an average of 18.3% more for imported products, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.\nEY-Parthenon's Daco told CBS MoneyWatch that the higher costs being paid by companies because of tariffs is already starting to trickle down to product prices.\nCurrently, the average tariff rate stands at around 18% \u2014 the highest it's been in decades, according to Daco. As a result, \"the increase in the tariffs will only exacerbate inflationary pressure that [is] starting to emerge,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\"You're going to see more durable goods, and nondurable goods products with higher price tags,\" he said. \"That will feed into higher consumer price inflation and lead to a more pronounced erosion of consumer spending as more households struggle in the face of these higher prices.\"\nMr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing. He has also tried to assure the public that foreign producers will pay for the import taxes and has told retailers and automakers to absorb the additional expenses.\n\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS News.\n\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been four months since Liberation Day and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent CEA analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining.\""

      "text": "The 5 Best Field Watches, Tested and Reviewed\nThese stylish timepieces are built to withstand major impacts and plunges in deep water.\nGear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?\nWhen it comes to wristwatches, few styles balance beauty with durability as well as the field watch. Originally designed for the military, hallmarks of the basic field watch include a face with easy-to-read typography, a sturdy strap, and\u2014most importantly\u2014mechanics that won't break or lose time under heavy stress.\nAlthough today's models are as fashionable as they are functional, core features that make them battlefield-ready remain. If you're searching for a simple, sturdy watch that works great for camping trips and pairs well with your dinner outfits, check out all the field watches our team tested and reviewed below.\nThe Best Field Watches\n- Best Overall: Huckberry X Timex Titanium Automatic Field Watch\n- Best Value: Casio G-Shock GD-010-1A1 Digital Black Resin Strap Watch\n- Best Strap: Luminox Atacama Field Watch\n- Most Durable: Marathon 34mm Desert Tan GPQ-D Field Watch\n- Best Stainless Steel Option: Citizen Promaster Land U822 Watch\nWhat to Consider\nDigital vs. Analog\nIt's long been the norm that field watches are analog. They were invented before and popularized during World War I because soldiers needed clear, simple watch faces that could be read at a glance.\nField watches have not changed much since their inception, and as a result, most are still analog. However, there are a growing number of digital models that, like their analog counterparts, feature bold and easy-to-read displays.\nDurability\nConsidering their battlefield origins, field watches are designed to endure drops and scratches, as well as the elements, including rain and snow. All the field watches on this list are built with a certain amount of shock resistance, and they use scratch-resistant watch face materials like crystal or mineral glass. Keep in mind that most field watches are durable but aren't true military watches. Of the models we cover below, only the Marathon DPQ-D is manufactured in accordance with military standards.\nWater Resistance\nAll watches on our list have a water resistance of at least around 30 meters\u2014another necessary feature that dates back to their origin, when soldiers needed to dive into and trudge through anything from a puddle to a pond. The majority of field watches these days offer water resistance between 100 and 200 meters.\nWater resistance is measured through ATM, or atmospheres. Essentially, every ten meters of water depth is equivalent to the pressure of our atmosphere, so every additional ten meters in depth equates to another atmosphere's worth of pressure impacting our bodies (and our watches). If a watch is water resistant up to 200 meters, it means it has a water resistance of 20 ATMs.\nStrap Material\nHistorically, field watches featured nylon straps for durability and a secure fit. The woven material doesn't easily fray or snap, and it resists water, heat, and moisture. Today, field watches have straps made of metal, silicone, and rubber. Thanks to the introduction of performance materials, these bands offer similar resistance to the elements and give wearers more style options.\nBattery Type\nThe majority of field watches take a traditional button-cell battery. But there are also automatic models that harness the natural motion of your wrist to turn the internal winding mechanism, as well as solar-powered models. The latter two are typically preferable if you're adventuring in areas without a nearby power source for days or weeks on end.=\nWatch Face Features\nSome field watches come with additional information including the date or battery levels. Similarly, many field watches have glow-in-the-dark indicators and arms, so you can comfortably read the time in the dark. Digital field watches often have a backlight that fulfills a similar purpose.\nMost field watch faces are made with incredibly durable glass or crystal. Many on our list are made of scratch-resistant sapphire crystal which can stand up to a lot of wear and tear without shattering or scratching. Others are made of mineral glass which also is quite sturdy.\nHow We Selected and Tested\nEach field watch on this list was tried on and worn for several days. With fewer moving parts and extras to evaluate in comparison to, say, outdoor watches, each of the field watches were looked at with a few primary qualities in mind: design, comfort, and readability.\nBeyond the basic day-to-day utility of the watches, I took into account other key factors like battery type, durability, and size. With each of our selections, I tried to walk the line between style and function without losing sight of one or the other. I also keep price in mind: All of the watches we write about cost less than $1,000, and most are under $500.\nTom Price is a Reviews Editor for Popular Mechanics and Runner's World while also contributing to Best Products and Bicycling.

      "text": "Apple announces $500 billion investment in US amid tariff threats that could affect the iPhone\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Apple announced Monday that it plans to invest more than $500 billion in the United States over the next four years, including plans to hire 20,000 people and build a new server factory in Texas.\nThe move comes just days after President Donald Trump said Apple CEO Tim Cook promised him that the tech giant\u2019s manufacturing would shift from Mexico to the U.S. Trump noted the company was doing so to avoid paying tariffs. That pledge, coupled with Monday\u2019s investment commitment, came as Trump continues to threaten to impose tariffs that could drive up the cost of iPhones made in China.\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d Cook said in a company blog post.\nApple outlined several concrete moves in its announcement, the most significant of which is the construction of a new factory in Houston \u2014 slated to open in 2026 \u2014 that will produce servers to power Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features. The company claims this factory will create \u201cthousands of jobs.\u201d\nThe announcement is similar to one Apple made in early 2018 \u2014 during the first Trump administration \u2014 that promised to create 20,000 new jobs as part of a $350 billion spend in the U.S. Trump was also mulling a tariff then that could have affected iPhones at the time, but he didn\u2019t end up targeting those devices during his first administration."

      "text": "These companies say they're investing more in U.S. manufacturing as tariffs go into effect\nSince the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.\nThe announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.\nIn March, for example, the White House celebrated pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson's plan to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing, calling it a \"massive victory in President Donald J. Trump's unrelenting pursuit of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.\nFor most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.\nMany trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.\nEconomists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.\nTo date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.\n\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"\n- Trump administration may form task force to handle China tariff impact\n- Small business owners say economic uncertainty is worse than tariffs. Here's why.\n- Trump tariff plans bring concern about prices, financial impact\nHere's a partial list of companies large and small that have recently announced plans to expand their manufacturing capabilities in the U.S.\nAbbott Laboratories\nIllinois-based medical device company Abbott Laboratories said in a statement Wednesday that a $500 million investment in manufacturing, research and development capabilities at plants in Illinois and Texas will \"go live\" by the end of the year. To support the expansion, Abbott plans to hire up to 300 workers across both states.\nAbbott manufactures medical devices at facilities worldwide, and such products are subject to country-specific levies that Mr. Trump has paused for 90 days.\nApple\nApple in February said that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.\nThe company says it will expand its current facilities, increasing the number of workers employed at plants in Arizona, California, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas and Washington.\nApple also has plans to build a 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston. Scheduled to open in 2026, the plant will build servers that power Apple Intelligence, the company's AI \u2014 another area the tech giant is pouring money into.\nThe sum marks Apple's largest-ever financial commitment, the company said.\n\"We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we're proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country's future,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. \"From doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we're thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we'll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\"\nChobani\nChobani, known for its Greek-style yogurt, is expanding manufacturing in New York State. The yogurt company on Tuesday announced plans to spend at least $1.2 billion opening a million-square-foot factory in Rome, New York.\nCompany executives believe the plant will be the largest dairy factory in the U.S., with the capacity to produce up to one billion pounds of dairy products annually. Chobani said the domestic expansion, which will create 1,000 new jobs, is necessary to meet demand.\nThe investment comes after Chobani announced a $500 million expansion in Twin Falls, Idaho in March.\nCra-Z-Art\nRandolph, New Jersey-based toy company Cra-Z-Art in March said it is growing its U.S. production capacity by 50%, \"to combat the cost of tariffs for imported goods from China and other countries.\"\n\"Based on the current economic climate, we are taking decisive action to expand and invest in American manufacturing. We are fortunate to have the infrastructure and capabilities in place to rapidly increase toy and school supply production as well as manufacturing space right here in the USA,\" Cra-Z-Art chairman Lawrence Rosen said. \"This will greatly benefit our retail partners by allowing us to get products to market quicker and more cost effectively, ultimately passing along the savings to our valued consumer. It also benefits the local economy where our factories are located.\"\nJohnson & Johnson\nJohnson & Johnson is planning to invest more than $55 billion in new U.S. manufacturing facilities over four years. The investment represents a 25% increase compared with the previous four years, the health care company said in March.\n\"Today's announcements accelerate our nearly 140-year legacy as an American innovation engine tackling the world's toughest healthcare challenges,\" Johnson & Johnson Chairman and CEO Joaquin Duato, said in a statement. \"Our increased U.S. investment begins with the ground-breaking of a high-tech facility in North Carolina that will not only add U.S.-based jobs but manufacture cutting-edge medicines to treat patients in America and around the world.\"\nThe brand new Wilson, North Carolina, facility will focus on manufacturing next-generation medication for people with cancer, and immune-mediated and neurological diseases, the company said.\nThe pharmaceutical company will also expand capacity at existing domestic plants in a move it says \"will create high-paying, high-technology jobs.\"\nHonda Motor\nHonda Motor this week said it is moving production of its Civic Hybrid Hatchback from Japan to the U.S., in the face of a barrage of tariffs by the Trump administration, including a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S.\nHonda currently produces the Civic Hatchback Hybrid from two plants, one in Indiana and another in Japan. \"But beginning later this year it will be produced only in Indiana,\" American Honda Motor Co. spokesperson Chris Abbruzzese told CBS MoneyWatch.\nHyundai Motor Company\nHyundai in March announced a $21 billion commitment to investing in domestic manufacturing from 2025 to 2028.\nAs part of that commitment, the company has pledged to put $9 billion toward expanding domestic automobile production to 1.2 million vehicles a year, it said.\n\"Hyundai Motor Group is deepening its partnership with the United States, reinforcing our shared vision for American industrial leadership. The Group's investment and efforts will further expand our operations in the U.S. and grow our American workforce,\" Hyundai said in a March statement.\nIBM\nIBM on April 28 pledged to invest $150 billion in U.S. manufacturing over five years. At least $30 million will go toward research and development to further U.S.-based computer manufacturing, the computing giant said.\n\"We have been focused on American jobs and manufacturing since our founding 114 years ago, and with this investment and manufacturing commitment we are ensuring that IBM remains the epicenter of the world's most advanced computing and AI capabilities,\" IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a statement.\nMerck\nDrugmaker Merck is investing $1 billion to build a U.S. plant in Delaware. The move comes amid plans by President Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals, which would include taxes on imported ingredients used drug manufacturing.\nThe company said it plans to build a new 470,000-square-foot facility in Wilmington, Delaware, where it will make Keytruda, the company's immunotherapy treatment for different cancers. The plant will be Merck's first U.S. facility dedicated to making Keytruda for U.S. patients, the company said.\n\"This is part of a significant investment to not only bring the world's best-selling medicine closer to the American patients who rely on it, but to also establish a home for our biologics portfolio of products serving U.S. patients,\" Merck said in a statement.\nNvidia\nLast week, American chip maker Nvidia announced that for this first time in the company's history, it will be manufacturing chips and AI supercomputers in the U.S.\nNvidia said in a statement that it has commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space to build its Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas. The company said it expects to produce up to half a trillion dollars' worth of AI infrastructure in the U.S.\n\"The engines of the world's AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,\" Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in the same statement. \"Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.\"\nRoche\nSwiss pharmaceutical company Roche in April said it's committing $50 billion to growing its U.S. operations.\nThe funds will go toward building new research and development sites, and expanding existing manufacturing facilities in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and California, the company said on April 21.\nRoche will also announce a new 900,000-square-foot manufacturing center dedicated to its weight loss medicine portfolio. Its location has not yet been disclosed.\n\"Roche is a Swiss company with a strong heritage in more than 130 countries globally. Today's announced investments underscore our long-standing commitment to research, development and manufacturing in the U.S.,\" Roche Group CEO said in a statement.\nTSMC\nTaiwanese semiconductor maker TSMC in March announced a $165 billion total investment in U.S. manufacturing capabilities. The investment augments an existing $65 billion investment in semiconductor manufacturing operations in Phoenix by $100 billion. The expansion includes plans for three new plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major research and development center, the company said."

      "text": "After months of delays and extensions, President Donald Trump\u2019s comprehensive and sweeping tariffs slate took effect Thursday just after midnight ET, shifting his global trade reset into high gear.\nMost imports into the United States will now face a baseline 10% duty, with the overall average effective tariff rate rising to more than 17% \u2014 the highest since 1935, during the Great Depression \u2014 thanks to higher duties on some of the biggest U.S. trading partners, according to the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab think tank.\nA wide variety of products will be hit. Tariffs will be collected on everything from European Union appliances and Japanese cars to food, furniture and toys from China and TVs from South Korea. Selected oil and gas imports, along with some smartphones and a suite of goods covered by a pre-existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, are not affected.\nTogether, the duties are the most significant move yet by a president set on tilting the global economy even more in favor of the United States.\nTrump was online to celebrate the moment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s midnight! Billions of dollars in tariffs are now flowing into the United States of America!\u201d he said in an all-caps post on Truth Social.\nSo far, the duties have mainly been jostling the U.S. economy instead. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports collected by the federal government, generally tend to raise costs, although there is some debate among economists about whether businesses or consumers ultimately bear the weight of those increased prices.\nYale\u2019s Budget Lab calculates that the inflationary effect of tariffs will cost a typical household an average of as much as $2,400 this year. It forecasts one of the biggest impacts in clothing, with consumers facing 40% higher prices for shoes and 38% higher costs for apparel in the short run as retailers that rely on importing clothes from South and Southeast Asia shift supply chains or grapple with higher costs.\nGlobal markets largely shrugged off the new tariffs, with European and Asian shares mostly higher on Thursday, CNBC reported. U.S. stock futures were also up slightly.\nBut Thursday is not the end of Trump\u2019s trade offensive.\nTrump told CNBC on Tuesday he still plans to impose import taxes on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Currently, only about a quarter of manufacturing facilities supplying the United States with key drug ingredients are actually based here, equating to a $116 billion deficit with the rest of the world. As for semiconductors, the United States imports $40 billion worth, though the figure can also include chips produced in the United States, shipped abroad and repackaged inside finished goods.\nTrump has also shown continued willingness to ratchet up duty levels at a moment\u2019s notice. On Wednesday, he hiked the tariff rate for India to 50% over the nation\u2019s purchases of Russian oil, which he said was allowing Russia to continue to finance its war in Ukraine. Brazil, too, now faces 50% duties as a result of Trump\u2019s displeasure with its treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who has been detained on coup charges.\nTrump also told CNBC he could raise the European Union\u2019s tariff level to 35% from 15% if it reneges on an investment commitment. Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the largest U.S. trading partner.\nThe Trump administration continues to insist tariffs are working, pointing to billions raised in new monthly revenues for the U.S. government. The White House also notes that nations have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, though no details about how that money will be spent have been released. Stock indexes have also set all-time highs.\n\u201cThe markets have seen what we\u2019re doing and celebrated,\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said Sunday on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\nMarket analysts say those gains have been largely driven by tech and bets on artificial intelligence, offsetting growing signs of weakness elsewhere, like a slowing labor market and softer consumer spending.\nOverall, the U.S. economy as a whole now appears to be on much shakier ground than at the start of the year. Price growth has continued to pick up, while employment growth in manufacturing \u2014 the sector Trump and his allies have said would benefit most from the tariffs \u2014 has flatlined.\nSome of that may also be attributable to elevated interest rates. But even non-manufacturing sectors are feeling the pinch.\nComments cited in the Institute for Supply Chain Management\u2019s survey of service-providing businesses for July, released this week, were filled with concerns about tariffs.\n\u201cAnticipation of the final tariff impacts is resulting in delayed planning for next fiscal year purchases,\u201d an accommodation and food-services firm said.\nA health services firm said: \u201cTariffs are causing additional costs as we continue to purchase equipment and supplies. Though we need to continue with these purchases, the cost is significant enough that we are postponing other projects to accommodate these cost changes.\u201d\nThe U.S. unemployment rate has held steady at 4.2%, still considered low \u2014 but most economists say that is partly a function of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, which has shrunk the overall labor force. The unemployment rate among native-born Americans reached a pandemic-era high last month of 4.7%.\nBusiness leaders are shaken up, too. Gartner Research said this week that its measure of CEO confidence has fallen at one of the fastest paces ever to recessionary levels, with 78% of top executives indicating they\u2019re implementing cost-cutting measures to safeguard performance. On Tuesday, equipment manufacturers Caterpillar and Eaton both reported significant profit hits from tariffs that constrained financial results amid resilient demand.\n\u201cWith the prospect of higher tariffs, many companies implemented strong cost saving measures,\u201d Gartner said. \u201cEven companies not directly impacted by tariffs began implementing these measures.\u201d\nThere remains an outside chance that the courts will strike the tariffs down. A group of small businesses has sued the Trump administration challenging its authority to impose tariffs under emergency powers. A trade court agreed in late May, but Trump\u2019s lawyers obtained an injunction to keep the tariffs he had already imposed in effect. All of Trump\u2019s tariffs on individual trading partners have been deployed using the law, which faces additional challenges from other suits.\nTariffs he has imposed on specific goods, like steel and copper, have been issued under a separate authority.\nIn April, a bipartisan group of senators passed a bill to assert Congress\u2019 authority as the only body allowed to impose tariffs, but the measure stalled in the House.\nA growing chorus of analysts is raising the prospect of stagflationary conditions, in which price growth increases while the job market weakens.\n\u201cEconomic activity and job growth are sputtering under the weight of higher tariffs, increasing inflation and rising economic policy and trade uncertainty,\u201d analysts with BMO said in a recent note to clients.\nAs higher tariff rates continue to creep up, stagflation and even a recession become likelier, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told NBC News last week.\n\u201cI think the economic fallout from the tariffs is now obvious: higher inflation and a struggling economy,\u201d he said."

      "text": "The 9 Best Bluetooth Speakers for the Powerful Sound Your Music Deserves\nBlast tunes from your backpack, bookshelf, and even the pool with models from JBL, Sony, Bose, and more.\nGear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?\nWith the ability to deliver sound that's infinitely more powerful and of higher quality than the speakers inside your phone, a standalone Bluetooth speaker is a must-have. These essential gadgets let you enjoy your favorite music or a podcast in any indoor or outdoor setting.\nBluetooth speakers are as widely available as wireless headphones and earbuds, and the sheer number of choices (hundreds, even thousands) is overwhelming. They range from affordable and compact models costing under $30 to pricey and feature-rich options with powerful, rich sound. Most portable models are also water resistant to varying degrees and have straps or carabiners for attaching to your backpack or bike.\nI spent weeks testing portable Bluetooth speakers from brands like Beats, Sony, and Soundcore, to name a few leading ones, to save you time and effort parsing through listings and decoding hardware specs. I also included a couple of excellent home Bluetooth speakers by Bose and Marshall, whose designs and specs are tailor-made for indoor use. These are the best Bluetooth speakers I recommend.\nThe Best Bluetooth Speakers\n- Best Overall: JBL Charge 6\n- Best Bass: Sony ULT Field 3\n- Best Budget: Soundcore Motion 300\n- Best Compact: Beats Pill\n- Best Smart Speaker: Sonos Roam 2\nWhat to Consider\nThe key specifications and features to consider when making your decision should focus on sound, design and durability, connectivity, and battery life. Additional extras, such as app-enabled controls and bundled accessories, are also worth considering.\nSound\nThe first thing to know about the acoustic capabilities of portable Bluetooth speakers is that the vast majority of them don't output stereo sound with left and right channels. Such a setup requires the speaker to have at least two equally sized audio drivers, and the best way to experience its benefits is to place the product in front of you.\nPortable Bluetooth speakers are designed to cover a wider, often outdoor area with powerful sound, so their audio driver layout differs from that of traditional stereo. It usually includes a larger woofer for producing low- and mid-range tones, a tweeter for delivering treble, and passive radiators to enhance the bass.\nYou can get a stereo experience by linking two Bluetooth speakers and placing them like traditional bookshelf units. Better yet, many of today's top Bluetooth speakers can connect with multiple additional units, creating a party atmosphere anytime, anywhere.\nDesign and Durability\nWeight should be one of the first design features to consider when selecting a portable speaker. A top-tier offering with good sound and long battery life should weigh below three pounds, ensuring it's easy to put in a bag or a backpack before heading outside.\nLarger Bluetooth speakers with boombox-style handles and superior sound are also available. Due to their size and heavier weight (six pounds and up), I wouldn't take one with me when I'm heading out, unless the trip to the final destination involves driving. These are great for delivering entertainment to larger groups in the backyard, around the swimming pool, or during a block party.\nWater- and dust-resistance, with an official rating, has long become standard for this product category, ensuring you can take it to the beach, in the garden, or on a camping trip without worrying about damaging it. Look for speakers with an IP67 or IP68 rating \u2014 the highest in the product category \u2014 if you plan to use them primarily outdoors.\nMany speakers with the above durability ratings can also float in water and even survive accidental drops. Choosing a speaker that's only rated for water resistance is acceptable if you're shopping on a tight budget. Home speakers like the Bose SoundLink Homeand the Marshall Stanmore III compensate for their lack of extra durability with a more luxurious design and finish.\nBattery Life\nA portable Bluetooth speaker should be able to entertain during a day's worth of outdoor activities between charges. Look for a battery life rating that's in double-digit territory, even if you're shopping for a mini speaker like the UE Miniroll.\nTop-shelf offerings from Beats, JBL, and Sony can all deliver more than 20 hours of wireless playback. That's the number to have as a reference if you want the best. The same goes for the speaker's ability to charge quickly and provide hours of music in just a few minutes.\nAdditional Features\nA companion app for customizing the sound and features of your portable Bluetooth speaker is mandatory. Products like the ultra-compact UE Miniroll and the luxe Bose SoundLink Home lack this functionality, but their unique design and features make up for the omission.\nHaving an integrated or removable carrying strap or handle is another feature to look out for in a portable speaker designed for outdoor use. Mini speakers have an advantage over their larger siblings in this department, as their built-in elastic straps or carabiners make them easier to attach to just about anything.\nHow I Tested\nI've been testing audio gear, including headphones, soundbars, surround sound systems, and portable Bluetooth speakers, for over a decade. For this guide, I focused on portable speakers from leading manufacturers at accessible price points. I wanted to ensure that the majority of products I suggest are reasonably sized and equally easy to take outside or move around your home or workspace. Up-to-date Bluetooth connectivity was also a key factor in my selection.\nMy testing process included playing an eclectic selection of tracks from Apple Music to judge the ability of each speaker to reproduce audible bass, treble, and mid-range tones. Where available, I tinkered with the app controls or the integrated buttons to customize the sound of the speakers. I also made calls on products with built-in microphones to experience their speakerphone capabilities.\nRegarding battery life testing, I monitored the ability of every outdoor-ready Bluetooth speaker to last me for 10-12 hours between charges \u2014 enough to last through a day at the beach, a weekend backyard gathering, and a pool party, to name a few scenarios.\nOf course, I also scrutinized the size and ergonomics of every speaker I tested, including the carrying and attachment options it has. I also looked for unique features, be it design- or performance-related, that set each product apart from its competitors.\nWith all of the above tips in mind, choose the Bluetooth speaker that suits you best from the picks I've tested and vouch for below.\nStefan is an award-winning consumer technology editor with over a decade of experience in reviewing gadgets, particularly smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, desktop and laptop computers across multiple form factors and platforms, as well as accessories for them.

      "text": "Most hobbies smack you right in the face with a dilemma from the outset: where to start without becoming quickly overwhelmed. And for hikers, there\u2019s no more appropriate place to start your journey than in an outdoor retail store, surrounded by dozens of shoeboxes and display footwear.\nWelcome to shopping for hiking shoes\u2014one of the most important steps (no pun intended) you\u2019ll take before hitting the trail. There\u2019s something about feet that forces most people I know to overlook the importance of shoes. Think of it this way: Every interaction your body has with the trail is going to go through your shoes. They\u2019re your connection to the terrain, your vehicles that enable you to travel, and, if you choose poorly, they can prevent you from traveling onward.\nI\u2019ve hiked in all four seasons across deserts, jungles, and forests, as well as atop glacier-strewn mountains. I\u2019ve tackled numerous casual day hikes and my fair share of 100-mile treks. Through it all, I\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s no one perfect hiking shoe that\u2019ll handle all terrains and conditions. In my earlier days, I\u2019ve also chosen wrongly and suffered for it. I don\u2019t want you to suffer through the worst of my mistakes.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve put together this guide on how to find the best fit for your hiking shoes (and how to fine-tune your preferences over time), along with a the most important hiking shoe terms and concepts.\nPerhaps you\u2019ll like speed laces, or you won\u2019t. Perhaps you\u2019ll ditch tall boots for lightweight hiking shoes. My goal is to make sure that, whichever pair of hiking shoes you choose, you\u2019re well-informed enough to find something that\u2019s suitable for your needs and fits you comfortably. After all, just because you\u2019re choosing to endure some discomfort, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a sucker for outright pain.\nHow to Find the Perfect Hiking Shoe Fit\nBefore I launch into hiking shoe lingo, it's time to buy, here's what you need to ensure your new kicks won't kick your butt the first time you take them on the trail.\nTry your shoes on in person.\nIf you\u2019re shopping online, get a few sizes of each model you\u2019re considering. Walk around in them a bit indoors, since retailers won\u2019t take returns that have been worn outside. Make sure you test them out at the end of the day rather than at the start. Your feet swell throughout the day, so you want to know your new shoes will fit you all day long and not just in the morning when your feet are smaller.\nSize up.\nYour hiking shoes should be a half size or full size larger than what you\u2019d normally wear around town. That leaves room for your feet to swell, and swell they will on long hikes. At the end of a day of hiking, I sometimes feel like I\u2019ve grown clown feet by how much they\u2019ve swollen.\nTest for toe bang.\nFind somewhere you can walk down a slope while testing out your shoes. Specialty outdoor retailers, such as REI, sometimes have a spot for this. At home, it may be harder to find a spot. This step lets you know whether your toes slam into the inside of the fronts of your shoes (source of the dreaded \u201ctoe bang\u201d). If they do, then repeat step two (that is, size up) or choose a different model of shoe.\nDo the twist.\nWhile wearing the shoes, twist your feet on a hard surface to test the grippiness of their outsoles. Turn them over, and inspect the soles\u2019 lug patterns. Are the lugs deep? If you plan on hiking through mud, you\u2019ll want deeper lugs than if you plan to traipse through the desert.\nConsider the conditions.\nWill you be walking over particularly rough rocky, root-strewn terrain? Then you\u2019ll value toe caps, heel brakes, full-length plates, shanks, a polyurethane midsole, and tougher varieties of leather, such as full-grain and nubuck. If your hiking on gentler terrain, perhaps you\u2019d rather have a lighter weight shoe that forgoes some or all of these features in order to prevent fatigue in your knees and legs.\nIf you plan to carry a heavy load through rough terrain, or if you have weak, injury-prone ankles, consider a full-cut boot for greater ankle stability. Otherwise, most people are best served with low- or mid-cut shoes, even if their backpacking trips are over several days.\nHikes in snowy terrain should always be done with boots that feature a water-resistant membrane, such as Gore-Tex or eVent. Everywhere else, you\u2019re better served by shoes without them.\nBreak them in.\nOnce you\u2019ve settled on a pair, take them home and begin breaking them in. Always break in new hiking shoes before your first hiking trip with them. Wear them around in the house or for short trips around town. New shoes are more likely to give you blisters. If you break them in for short periods of time close to home, you can avoid days of uncomfortable shoes and burning blisters on the trail.\nWhat to Know About Hiking Shoes\nBreak-in\nAll hiking shoes need to be broken in. Don\u2019t bring brand new shoes on a hike. You\u2019ll regret it when your feet blister up. (I\u2019m speaking from experience.) It\u2019s merely uncomfortable for the first few hours. Then, it\u2019s painful, it begins to slow you down, and finally, you\u2019re hobbling around, praying for an end to the hike instead of enjoying the scenery.\nTo break in new shoes, wear them around the house, out in the yard, or on short trips around town. Don\u2019t worry about wearing them out doing this; It\u2019s not like they\u2019re made out of tissue paper. Once you can wear them for a couple of hours without any abrasive pain on your toes or feet, you\u2019ll know they\u2019re ready for trail use.\nCollar\nThis refers to the band of material around the opening of the top of the shoe. It\u2019s normally padded. The collar\u2019s effectiveness comes down to the way it feels when the shoes are on your feet, so it\u2019s one more reason to try on shoes in person before committing to a hike.\nCut\nThe height of the boot. The three varieties you\u2019ll see are low-cut, mid-cut, and high-cut. Generally, a low-cut shoe ends below your ankle, just like you\u2019d see with a tennis shoe. This cut gives you greater mobility at the expense of less stability, meaning that an inexperienced hiker on rough terrain has a greater propensity to twist an ankle. On the other hand, they\u2019re lightweight, and I find them the most comfortable.\nHigh-cut hiking shoes, like the Salomon Quest 4, are universally referred to as boots. They stabilize the ankle by preventing it from moving much, which means it\u2019s harder to twist your ankle, but you\u2019re also more limited in how far you can move your feet.\nA beginner hiker may find that the extra weight and constraining material of a high-cut boot feels unusual, given that most people wear low-cut shoes on a daily basis. These shoes also weigh noticeably more, and an extra pound on your feet will fatigue you much more than an extra pound in your backpack. I use high-cut boots more often in winter because their height helps keep snow and slush from spilling over the tops of the boots and soaking the insides.\nSplitting the difference, there\u2019s the mid-cut boot. You can recognize most, but not all, mid-height boots by the way their collars slope downward at the rear, like this mid-cut Keen Targhee 4.\nWhen I backpack over rough trails, I prefer the agility of a low-cut hiking shoe over the rigidity of a higher-cut boot. Granted, I travel ultralight with minimal gear and most of it specialty lightweight, but for me, the agility of a low-cut shoe on rocky trails has been worth the elevated risk.\nEyelets\nThis is the area where you thread the laces. Basic eyelets are round rings of metal embedded into the parts of the shoe on either side of the tongue. Higher-cut shoes have more of them, which means more time spent lacing up and unlacing. There are a few speciality types:\n- D-rings - You guessed it: These are shaped like the letter D. They are more common on heavier-duty boots, and they make adjusting lace tension easier than regular eyelets do. I care more about these on the high-cut boots I use during winter than I do on the low-cut hiking shoes I use during the other three seasons because the laces slide through D-rings more smoothly than eyelets, which have a tendency to grab onto laces due to their higher friction. D-rings make lacing up and unlacing boots a little quicker and easier, and with high-cut boots\u2019 longer laces and greater number of eyelets, that\u2019s a blessing.\n- Speed hooks - These are found on some high-cut boots but only in place of the top few eyelets. As the name suggests, they\u2019re quicker to lace up and unlace. I\u2019m completely ambivalent about speed hooks. They\u2019d neither entice me to buy a pair of boots nor ward me away from them. When I lace up at the beginning of a morning and break camp, my shoes aren\u2019t leaving my feet until I roll into my tent at night to sleep, so speed in lacing up or unlacing doesn\u2019t play much of a concern for me.\nFull-grain leather\nThis leather that hasn\u2019t been split consists of a smooth outer face and a rough, suede-like inner face. Full-grain leather is thick, durable, and fairly water resistant. The downside is that shoes made from it take longer to break in.\nHeel brake\nThis is the rubber section of the boot that wraps from the sole to partway up the outside of the shoe\u2019s heel. It helps prevent skidding during descents. Most hiking shoes have at least a bit of a heel brake. You can see the well-defined heel brake prominently on the Keen Headout.\nInsole\nYour foot rests atop this cushion inside of your boot. Insoles are almost always removable, so you can replace a shoe\u2019s stock insoles with an aftermarket pair designed for outdoor pursuits, such as Superfeet Trailblazer. I swear by those. They\u2019re far more comfortable over rocky terrain, and they don\u2019t bunch up inside my shoes after river crossings and puddles like so many shoe\u2019s stock insoles.\nInsulation\nWinter boots may have a layer of synthetic, puffy insulation built into them for added warmth. Aside from mountaineering boots, in environments where temperatures are expected to be well below freezing, I prefer to get my foot insulation from non-insulated boots paired with warm socks, such as Darn Tough or Wrightsock, because I can tailor how warm I want the boots to be by choosing thicker or lightweight socks, rather than possibly be stuck wearing a boot that\u2019s too warm in some environments.\nLug pattern\nOn a tire, you\u2019d call this the tread. Each protruding chunk of rubber is called a lug, and it can be of any size. Most manufacturers take the opportunity to make the pattern of lugs something eye-catching, as it\u2019s a marketing boon for footprints left in the earth to signify that a particular brand of shoe was there. The design of the pattern I care less about than how aggressive its lugs are. Larger lugs with more space between them are good for thick mud and dirt, as they don\u2019t get packed up with grit and rarely become slick.\nMidsole\nSandwiched between the insole and the outsole (more on that shortly), there\u2019s a layer of impact-absorbing material called the midsole that adds comfort to a shoe. Often, you\u2019ll see \u201cEVA\u201d thrown around in marketing speak. It stands for ethylene-vinyl acetate, a common material for midsoles. EVA midsoles tend to be cushier and more flexible than polyurethane midsoles, so you may prefer the lighter EVA on shorter day hikes. For longer trips over rougher terrain, polyurethane\u2019s firmer, tougher nature lends itself well to longer trips when you\u2019re carrying more weight in gear and food on your back.\nNubuck leather\nNubuck leather starts out as full-grain leather before a leather worker buffs the surface until it becomes rough and nappy like suede. Its appeal isn\u2019t just for aesthetics. The buffing process makes the material more pliable, so shoes made from nubuck leather are more flexible out of the box. (That said, you still can\u2019t skimp on the break-in process.)\nOutsole\nThe outsole consists of the rubber material that connects the rest of your shoe\u2014and by extension, you\u2014to the ground beneath you. In other words, this is the sole of a shoe as you\u2019ve come to know it outside of hiking-speak.\nBeyond reading customer reviews or choosing a known, reputable brand name of outsoles (such as Vibram), it\u2019s tough to gauge the durability of an outsole. What you can judge when you\u2019re trying on shoes, though, is how grippy they are. Fallen leaves, wet rocks, and mud test the traction of your footwear. I\u2019ve been on trails that were so slippery, I could\u2019ve skated down the whole mountain. Run your hands over a few pairs\u2019 soles, put them on, and give them a few twists against the ground, and you\u2019ll begin to see which ones have better traction than others.\nShank\nThis is a rigid piece of material sandwiched between the insole and midsole to provide more rigidity to a shoe. Most hiking shoes have a plastic or fiberglass shank.\nShankless shoes are lighter and more flexible, and they tend to provide more feel of the ground underneath\u2014possibly too much feel. I\u2019ve hiked over moderately rocky terrain in shankless shoes, and it\u2019s been borderline painful. Trail runners and hikers on mild terrain will appreciate shankless more than somebody tramping over difficult trails.\nSpeed laces\nYour feet swell throughout the day, especially after you\u2019ve been hiking rough terrain for hours. During a long day hiking, you\u2019ll probably need to adjust your laces a few times, and during these moments, speed laces are clutch.\nJust hold the plastic adjustment piece that rests on the shoe\u2019s tongue, pull the loop of lace over it, and it cinches the whole shoe\u2014no row-by-row cinching required. Tug the plastic adjustment piece upward without holding the lace and it loosens the whole shoe. Quick and easy.\nI\u2019ve been hearing for years that speed laces are more fragile than standard laces, and they are indeed thinner, but I\u2019ve never broken one or seen one break firsthand (and I\u2019ve hiked some pretty rough trails).\nSplit-grain leather\nTo create a more lightweight, breathable shoe, the leather is split to peel away the rough part of the hide. The downside is that, being thinner, it\u2019s not as durable as full-grain leather.\nSynthetic leather\nLeather taken from the hides of plastic cows. Ok, I\u2019m (mostly) kidding.\nSynthetic leather shoes are for the animal lovers out there. These plastic alternatives have gotten very convincing. I had a pair of Merrell Moab 2 Ventilators for a while before I found out their leather was synthetic. And as a bonus, the break-in period for synthetic leather is usually a bit quicker than for animal leather.\nAuthentic leather, especially full-grain and nubuck leather, have the edge on longevity compared to synthetic leather, but don\u2019t let that give you the impression that synthetic leather means a light-duty material. Good hiking shoes made of synthetic leather still last for quite a while. I\u2019ve had pairs last me for years, and I\u2019m not kind to my hiking shoes.\nToe bang\nWatch out for this serious, shoe-induced injury. It occurs when you have an ill-fitting shoe\u2014typically one that\u2019s too small. When you walk downhill, the front of your toes slam into the front of the shoe. Repeatedly. And that\u2019s a lot of weight for your delicate, little piglets to have smashing into them thousands of times a day. Soon, your toes start to ache. Eventually, you begin to damage their nerve endings. It\u2019s why you have to nail the right size when shopping for hiking shoes.\nSizing a hiking shoe is tricky. Because your feet swell during a day on the trail more so than during a normal day at home, you\u2019re going to want to size up \u00bd or one full size from your normal shoes. Your foot shouldn\u2019t be swimming in them, but it\u2019s normal for them to feel a little big compared to your day-to-day kicks.\nAvoiding toe bang is why it\u2019s crucial to try on several varieties of hiking shoes in person and to make sure you try them out while walking down a slope of some kind. I\u2019ve experienced the pitfall that is toe bang personally. Luckily for me, it was a weekend hike and not a longer trip. I was more irritated at myself for wasting money on shoes that were too small. I was sort of able to repurpose them as work shoes in the yard, but I had to go out and buy new, properly sized shoes for hiking.\nToe cap\nThis part of the rubber outsole continues up and around the top of the toes to shield them from being scraped on rock edges, banging against roots, and otherwise getting roughed up. Most hiking shoes have a bit of protection here but don\u2019t exactly qualify as toe caps because they don\u2019t extend over the tops of the ends of the toes. You may think, \u201cWho\u2019d ever bang the tops of their toes? I\u2019ll just be more careful.\u201d It happens, though. Toe caps are nice to have, but for me it isn\u2019t a dealbreaker if a shoe I otherwise like doesn\u2019t have them.\nTongue\nYou know that flappy bit of padded material between your shoe\u2019s laces and the top part of your foot? It\u2019s called the tongue\u2014just like the flappy bit of material that hangs out of your mouth when you know it\u2019s time to rehydrate. More heavily cushioned tongues keep tight laces from feeling like they\u2019re digging into the tops of your feet, but it\u2019s rare that I\u2019ve run into what you\u2019d think of as a \u201cbad\u201d tongue.\nTraction cleat\nThese are like the snow chains you\u2019d put on your car\u2019s tires. Only needed when you encounter moderately icy terrain, these chains, like the Yaktrax Diamond Grips, slip over your hiking shoes and run beneath your shoes\u2019 outsoles. Mildly aggressive spikes on the chains provide grip on ice. They can be easily removed when you\u2019re past the ice, and they fit a wide variety of hiking shoes and boots.\nCrampons are more serious devices used for mountain climbing only, although they\u2019re similar in concept.\nVentilation\nBelieve it or not, a day of hiking miles, even in cooler climates, makes your feet sweat. So designers build mesh panels into shoes that improve airflow to and from the inside of the shoe. This helps keep your feet cooler and has the side benefit of draining and drying the inside of your shoes more quickly after crossing a river.\nNot all hiking shoes have mesh panels. Those designed for colder weather or use in snowy, slushy environments often do without them in order to retain warmth and make it harder for water to leak into them. If you plan to use your shoes predominantly in hotter environments, look for shoes with larger mesh panels.\nDespite being a fairly burly and durable hiking shoe, the Merrell Moab 3 demonstrates effective ventilation very well. Its large mesh panels mean that even in temperatures over 90 degrees in the humid South, my feet were not nearly as swampy as they should\u2019ve been.\nWaterproof membrane\nThis is a bit of a misnomer because with enough water, these membranes don\u2019t hold up, but the term refers to a water-resistant, breathable layer of material\u2014usually polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)\u2014between the outer layer of the shoe and the inner lining. It keeps shoes from soaking through, but it also makes your feet feel warmer and causes them to sweat.\nUnless there\u2019s going to be snow on the ground, I wear shoes with non-waterproof membranes. My feet sweat less, so I get fewer blisters, and they dry out from puddles and rivers a lot more quickly. Even romping over sodden Vermont trails in 40-degree autumn, I wear non-waterproof shoes. The motion of walking generates enough heat to warm my feet and evaporate the water fairly quickly. Gore-Tex (GTX) and eVent are common brand names of \u201cwaterproof\u201d membranes.\nMatt Jancer has been in the industry for 15 years and lives in his favorite urban death maze, New York City. He\u2019s traded words for money on behalf of more than 15 magazines. Some of his longest-running bylines were spent covering cars, motorcycles, outdoors gear, health and fitness for Car and Driver, Outside, Esquire, Smithsonian, Playboy and Wired. When he\u2019s not writing about motorcycles and our place in the wilderness for a living, he\u2019s writing for enjoyment, riding his motorcycle, and mountain climbing out West. He believes everyone needs at least one hobby they have none of their ego invested into, and so guitar noises and cooking smells have been known to emanate from his apartment. Oh yeah, and he thinks pigeons are way underrated."

      "text": "Trump\u2019s tariffs have launched global trade wars. Here\u2019s a timeline of how we got here\nTrump\u2019s tariffs have launched global trade wars. Here\u2019s a timeline of how we got here\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Volley after volley of new tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have plunged the country into trade wars abroad, creating uncertainty for businesses and households.\nTrump is no stranger to tariffs. He launched a trade war during his first term as well, taking particular aim at China by putting taxes on most of its goods. At the time, Beijing responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. products. And Trump also used the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact.\nWhen President Joe Biden took office, he preserved most of the tariffs Trump had enacted against China, in addition to imposing some new restrictions. But his administration claimed to take a more targeted approach.\nFast-forward to today, and economists stress there are greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide under Trump\u2019s more sweeping tariffs this time around \u2014 and that higher prices leave consumers footing the bill. There\u2019s also been a sense of whiplash from Trump\u2019s back-and-forth tariff threats and responding retaliation seen over the last few months.\nHere\u2019s a timeline of how we got here:\nJanuary 20\nTrump is sworn into office. In his inaugural address, he again promises to \u201ctariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\u201d And he reiterates plans to create an agency called the External Revenue Service, which has yet to be established.\nOn his first day in office, Trump also says he expects to put 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1, while declining to immediately flesh out plans for taxing Chinese imports.\nJanuary 26\nTrump threatens 25% tariffs on all Colombia imports and other retaliatory measures after President Gustavo Petro\u2019s rejects two U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants to the country, accusing Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation.\nIn response, Petro also announces a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. But Colombia later reversed its decision and accepted the flights carrying migrants. The two countries soon signaled a halt in the trade dispute.\nFebruary 1\nTrump signs an executive order to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 4. Trump invoked this power by declaring a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking.\nThe action prompts swift outrage from all three countries, with promises of retaliatory measures.\nFebruary 3\nTrump agrees to a 30-day pause on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, as both trading partners take steps to appease Trump\u2019s concerns about border security and drug trafficking.\nFebruary 4\nTrump\u2019s new 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports to the U.S. still go into effect. China retaliates the same day by announcing a flurry of countermeasures, including new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google.\nChina\u2019s 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10% levy on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S., take effect Feb. 10.\nFebruary 10\nTrump announces plans to hike steel and aluminum tariffs starting March 12. He removes the exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, and also raises his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%.\nFebruary 13\nTrump announces a plan for \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 promising to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that countries worldwide charge on imports \u201cfor purposes of fairness.\u201d Economists warn that the reciprocal tariffs, set to overturn decades of trade policy, could create chaos for global businesses.\nFebruary 25\nTrump signs an executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether a tariff on imported copper is needed to protect national security. He cites the material\u2019s use in U.S. defense, infrastructure and emerging technologies.\nMarch 1\nTrump signs an additional executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether tariffs on lumber and timber are also needed to protect national security, arguing that the construction industry and military depend on a strong supply of wooden products in the U.S.\nMarch 4\nTrump\u2019s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect, though he limits the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. He also doubles the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20%.\nAll three countries promise retaliatory measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. And Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her country would respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods without specifying the targeted products immediately, signaling hopes to de-escalate.\nChina, meanwhile, imposes tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of key U.S. farm exports, set to take effect March 10. It also expands the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.\nMarch 5\nTrump grants a one-month exemption on his new tariffs impacting goods from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The pause arrives after the president spoke with leaders of the \u201cBig 3\u201d automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.\nMarch 6\nIn a wider extension, Trump postpones 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month.\nTrump credited Sheinbaum with making progress on border security and drug smuggling as a reason for again pausing tariffs. His actions also thaw relations with Canada somewhat, although outrage and uncertainty remains. Still, after its initial retaliatory tariffs of $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) on U.S. goods, the government says it\u2019s suspended a second wave of retaliatory tariffs worth $125 billion Canadian (US$87 billion).\nMarch 10\nChina\u2019s retaliatory 15% tariffs on key American farm products \u2014 including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef \u2014 take effect. Goods already in transit are set to be exempt through April 12, per China\u2019s Commerce Ministry previous announcement.\nMarch 12\nTrump\u2019s new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports go into effect. Both metals are now taxed at 25% across the board \u2014 with Trump\u2019s order to remove steel exemptions and raise aluminum\u2019s levy from his previously-imposed 2018 import taxes.\nThe European Union takes retaliatory trade action promising new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The measures will cover goods from the U.S. worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during Trump\u2019s first term. The 27-member bloc later says it will delay this retaliatory action until mid-April.\nCanada, meanwhile, announces plans to impose more retaliatory tariffs worth Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) on U.S. imports, set to go into effect March 13.\nMarch 13\nTrump threatens a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with its previously-announced plans for a 50% tariff on American whiskey.\nMarch 24\nTrump says he will place a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela, in addition to imposing new tariffs on the South American country itself, starting April 2.\nThe tariffs would most likely add to the taxes facing China, which in 2023 bought 68% of the oil exported by Venezuela, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a number of countries also receive oil from Venezuela \u2014 including the U.S. itself.\nMarch 26\nTrump says he is placing 25% tariffs on auto imports. These auto imports will start being collected April 3 \u2014 beginning with taxes on fully-imported cars. The tariffs are set to then expand to applicable auto parts in the following weeks, through May 3.\nApril 2\nTrump announces his long-promised \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports across the board starting April 5, as well as higher rates for dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the U.S. to take effect April 9.\nAmong those steeper levies, Trump says the U.S. will now charge a 34% tax on imports from China, a 20% tax on imports from the European Union, 25% on South Korea, 24% on Japan and 32% on Taiwan. The new tariffs come on top of previously-imposed levies, including the 20% tax Trump announced on all Chinese imports earlier this year.\nMeanwhile, for Canada and Mexico, the White House says USMCA-compliant imports can continue to enter the U.S. duty-free. Once the two countries have satisfied Trump\u2019s demands on immigration and drug trafficking, the White House adds, the tariff on the rest of their imports may drop from 25% to 12%.\nApril 3\nTrump\u2019s previously-announced auto tariffs begin. Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will match the 25% levies with a tariff on vehicles imported from the U.S.\nApril 4\nChina announces plans to impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10, matching Trump\u2019s new \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff on Chinese goods, as part of a flurry of retaliatory measures.\nThe Commerce Ministry in Beijing says it will also impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products like computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. And the government adds 27 firms to lists of companies subject to trade sanctions or export controls.\nApril 5\nTrump\u2019s 10% minimum tariff on nearly all countries and territories takes effect.\nApril 9\nTrump\u2019s higher \u201creciprocal\u201d rates go into effect, hiking taxes on imports from dozens of countries just after midnight. But hours later, his administration says it will suspend most of these higher rates for 90 days, while maintaining the recently-imposed 10% levy on nearly all global imports.\nChina is the exception. After following through on a threat to raise levies against China to a total of 104%, Trump says he will now raise those import taxes to 125% \u201ceffective immediately\u201d \u2014 escalating tit-for-tat duties that have piled up between the two countries. The White House later clarifies that total tariffs against China are actually now 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs are accounted for.\nChina upped its retaliation prior to this announcement \u2014 vowing to tax American goods at 84% starting April 10. Also earlier, EU member states vote to approve their own retaliatory levies on 20.9 billion euros ($23 billion) of U.S. goods in response to Trump\u2019s previously-imposed steel and aluminum tariffs. The EU\u2019s executive commission doesn\u2019t immediately specify which imports it will tax, but notes its counter tariffs will come in stages \u2014 with some set to arrive on April 15, and others May 15 and Dec. 1.\nSeparately, Canada\u2019s counter tariffs on auto imports take effect. The country implements a 25% levy on auto imports from the U.S. that do not comply with the 2020 USMCA pact.\nApril 10\nThe EU puts its steel and aluminum tariff retaliation on hold for 90 days, to match Trump\u2019s pause on steeper \u201creciprocal\u201d levies. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the commission wants to give negotiations with the U.S. a chance \u2014 but warns countermeasures will kick in if talks \u201care not satisfactory.\u201d\nApril 11\nChina says it will raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, in response to Trump\u2019s heightened levies. The new rate is set to begin April 12.\nLater, the Trump administration unveils that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, will be exempt from so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. But in the days following, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signals that this is only a temporary reprieve, saying that sector-specific levies on semiconductors will arrive in \u201cprobably a month or two.\u201d And other, non-\"reciprocal\u201d tariffs that tax some electronics, notably from China, remain.\nApril 12\nChina\u2019s new rate slapping 125% tariffs on U.S. goods takes effect.\nApril 14\nTrump says he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains.\nThe Trump administration also launches investigations into imports of computer chips, chipmaking equipment and pharmaceuticals \u2014 signaling next steps toward imposing tariffs on these sectors. The U.S. Commerce Department posts notices about these probes, seeking public comment within the next three weeks.\nSeparately, the Commerce Department says it\u2019s withdrawing from a 2019 agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation into fresh tomato imports from Mexico. That termination, set to take effect July 14, means most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff.\nApril 29\nTrump signs executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts \u2014 aimed at easing import taxes for vehicles that are made with foreign parts, but assembled in the U.S.\nFor one year, the administration says it will provide a rebate of 3.75% relative to the sales prices of a domestically-assembled car \u2014 a figure reached by putting the previously-imposed 25% import tax on parts that make up 15% of that price. And for the second year, the rebate would equal 2.5% of the sales price, applying to a smaller share of the vehicle\u2019s parts.\nMay 3\nThe latest round of Trump\u2019s auto tariffs takes effect. The previously-announced 25% levies now apply to a range of imported auto parts.\nMay 4\nTrump threatens a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, while claiming that the movie industry in the U.S. is dying. It isn\u2019t immediately clear how such a tariff on international productions could be implemented, but Trump says he\u2019s authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to \u201cimmediately begin the process.\u201d\nMay 8\nThe U.S. and Britain announce a trade deal, potentially lowering the financial burden from tariffs while creating greater access abroad for American goods.\nBritain says the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10%, with a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff. It also eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum. Under the agreement, the U.K. is also to buy more American beef and ethanol, and streamline its customs process for goods from the U.S. But Trump\u2019s baseline 10% tariffs against British goods are to stay in place.\nSeparately, the EU publishes a list of U.S. imports that it would target with retaliatory duties if no solution is found to end Trump\u2019s tariff war. The European Commission also says it would begin legal action at the World Trade Organization over the \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d that Trump imposed on countries around the world a month ago.\nMay 12\nThe U.S. and China agree to roll back most of the tariffs each nation had imposed on the other and declared a 90-day truce in their trade war.\nThe Trump administration says it will reduce the 145% duties it had imposed on imports from China to 30%, while China says it would cut its 125% tariffs on U.S. goods to 10%.\nMay 23\nTrump threatens a 25% tariff on Apple products unless its iPhones are made in the U.S. \u2014 making the tech giant the latest company caught in the crosshairs of the White House\u2019s tariff promises. In response to Trump\u2019s import taxes on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook had previously said that most iPhones solid in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam.\nThe president also moves to escalate his trade war with the EU \u2014 threatening to slap a 50% tax on all imports from the 27-nation bloc starting June 1. In a post on his social media site Truth Social, Trump claims that trade discussions with the EU are \u201cgoing nowhere.\u201d\nMay 25\nTrump says he\u2019s delaying the 50% tariff on the EU until July 9 to give the two sides more time to negotiate. The agreement came after a call with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission.\nMay 28\nThe New York-based U.S. Court of International Trade rules that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to slap import taxes on almost every country in the world. The order blocks tariffs Trump slapped on almost all U.S. trading partners on April\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d as well as levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada. The White House swiftly moves to appeal, but the three-judge panel\u2019s decision casts a sharp blow on Trump\u2019s economic agenda.\nMay 29\nA federal appeals court temporarily halts the order from the U.S. Court of International Trade \u2014 allowing Trump to continue collecting tariffs under an emergency powers law for now.\nMay 30\nTrump tells steelworkers in Pennsylvania that he will double the U.S. tariff on steel imports to 50%. And in a later post on his Truth Social platform, he adds that aluminum tariffs would also be doubled to 50% \u2014 marking a significant jump from the universal 25% he imposed on imports of both metals just months ago. Trump says that both tariff hikes will go into effect June 4.\nJune 2\nDays after Trump announced these steel and aluminum tariff hikes, the EU says it\u2019s preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d if a trade deal with the U.S. crumbles. The European Commission says that the 27-nation bloc is finalizing an expanded list of countermeasures that would automatically take effect on July 14 or earlier. That\u2019s the date when its current 90-day pause, aimed at easing negotiations, ends.\nMeanwhile, China accuses the U.S. of violating its trade truce by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and planning to revoke Chinese student visas. The Commerce Ministry says its held up its end of the May deal and threatens unspecified retaliation."

      "text": "- The 2025 Apple MacBook Air is now 20% off on Amazon, a discount that\u2019s lower than the one offered during Prime Day.\n- This is the latest MacBook Air model, offering you $200 in back-to-school savings on a top-of-the-line model.\nDon\u2019t look now, but the 2025 MacBook Air\u2014which features a powerful M4 chip and is comparable in speed and function to Apple\u2019s high-octane mainline Pro series\u2014is now on sale for $200 off on Amazon, and it\u2019s officially at the lowest price it\u2019s been since its inception. Apple\u2019s latest iteration of its sleek, cost-effective line of MacBook Air laptops was just released back in March and was discounted a hefty $150 during Prime Day, but Amazon has apparently upped the ante just ahead of the new school year.\nIt\u2019s not often Apple significantly discounts a new piece of hardware less than six months after its initial release, so 20 percent savings feels substantial. Our shock is bolstered by the fact that it was $50 more expensive during this year\u2019s mega Prime Day event, where it was one of Amazon\u2019s top sellers over the full four-day stretch.\nThe latest MacBook Air compares favorably to its traditionally heavier-quipped, spec-heavy MacBook Pro counterpart, which is typically a few hundred dollars more for the older entry-level options. The new M4 chip brings unprecedented power and speed to the slimmer, more basic line of MacBook Airs, which are geared more towards students and those seeking a more simplistic, everyday laptop. The 2025 MacBook Air, though, seems to bridge the gap between the powerhouse Pro and the minimalist Air series.\nSenior Tech Editor Stefan Vazharov has been testing MacBooks since 2018, and he confirmed that the latest version of the Air lived up to its billing as a powerful, yet cost-effective alternative to the MacBook Pro.\n\u201cBy offering meaningful hardware updates, uncompromising power, and industry-leading charging freedom at a lower price, the M4-packing MacBook Air is, incredibly, an even more appealing buy than past releases,\u201d Vazharov explained. \u201cIf you are on the market for an everyday laptop with a budget that hovers around $1,000, this is the one to get. I\u2019d take it over any PC and Chromebook rival in this price range.\u201d\nVazharov initially recommended the entry-level 13.6-inch at $1,000, noting its exceptional value for a newly released MacBook. The 2025 device is a full $100 less than the less powerful M3-equipped MacBook Air from 2024. He also noted that Apple hasn\u2019t released a new MacBook Air under $1,000 since the last Intel-based model, which was introduced almost five years ago. Considering we're just four months removed from its launch, and you can now nab one for under $800, we'd certainly file this under the umbrella of a \u201ccan\u2019t-miss deal.\u201d And with school right around the corner, the timing couldn\u2019t be any better.\nShop the 2025 MacBook Air Sale on Amazon\nTim Kohut is the Deals and Trends Editor for Popular Mechanics, Men\u2019s Health, Best Products, and Runner's World.

  "argos_summary": "President Trump's new tariff plan, implemented recently, imposes a baseline 10% tariff on most imports to the U.S., raising the average effective tariff rate to over 17%, the highest since the Great Depression. This move is expected to lead to significant price increases on a variety of consumer goods, particularly electronics, clothing, and furniture, as companies may pass on the costs to consumers. Economists predict that if these tariffs remain, inflation will rise, impacting household budgets significantly.",
