  "content": "\u2022 On August 18, 2025, TD Cowen upgraded EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) to \u2018Buy\u2019 from \u2018Hold\u2019 after the company delivered three consecutive quarters of organic revenue acceleration and completed its post-Ukraine delivery restructuring.\n\u2022 This upgrade highlights EPAM\u2019s ability to outpace many large IT peers in revenue growth while emphasizing the firm\u2019s renewed focus on sales execution, client expansion, and margin improvement.\n\u2022 We'll explore how TD Cowen's recognition of EPAM's successful delivery restructuring shapes the company's investment outlook and market positioning.\n\nFind companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.\n\nTo be an EPAM shareholder today, you have to believe in the company's renewed ability to drive organic revenue growth as it pivots further into AI-driven services, while successfully mitigating execution and margin risks. TD Cowen's upgrade underscores improved sales momentum and the conclusion of post-Ukraine restructuring, but the most important short-term catalyst, margin recovery, remains exposed to wage inflation and competition for talent. The upgrade doesn't materially change the main structural risk: shifting demand from traditional IT services to automated, AI-powered solutions.\n\nOne recent announcement central to this news is EPAM's Q2 2025 earnings, where revenue rose year-on-year but net income and EPS declined. This mixed performance reflects the company's ongoing investments in workforce upskilling and the cost challenges inherent to its shift toward higher-value digital transformation projects, tying directly to investors' focus on profitability improvement amid industry-wide AI adoption.\n\nBy contrast, wage pressure and talent competition in Eastern Europe and India remain a potential headwind that investors should...\n\nRead the full narrative on EPAM Systems (it's free!)\n\nEPAM Systems' outlook anticipates $6.5 billion in revenue and $582.4 million in earnings by 2028. This implies an 8.8% annual revenue growth rate and a $181.2 million earnings increase from current earnings of $401.2 million.\n\nUncover how EPAM Systems' forecasts yield a $212.69 fair value, a 23% upside to its current price.\n\nSix Simply Wall St Community members estimated EPAM's fair value between US$160 and US$267 per share. While revenue and AI expansion offer a path forward, the split in investor outlooks may reflect ongoing risks tied to sector disruption and cost management, inviting you to compare these viewpoints for yourself.",

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- Expanding AI expertise and proprietary platforms are enabling EPAM to secure larger, high-value client engagements and move further up the value chain.\n- Diversification across industries and geographies, coupled with operational efficiencies, is boosting resilience, supporting sustainable growth, and improving margins.\n- Rising automation, talent costs, and geopolitical risks threaten margins and revenue, while intense competition and slow adaptation to industry shifts could undermine EPAM's market position.\nCatalysts\nAbout EPAM Systems- Provides digital platform engineering and software development services worldwide.\n- The accelerating enterprise adoption of AI is driving a surge in demand for advanced data engineering, cloud migration, and platform modernization projects-areas where EPAM holds deep technical expertise-leading to increased revenue from larger and more complex client engagements.\n- EPAM's strategic investments in AI-native services, proprietary platforms (such as DIAL and AI/RUN), and upskilling of over 80% of its workforce have positioned it as a transformation partner for clients moving beyond pilot AI programs to large-scale deployments, supporting sustainable revenue growth and the potential for improved net margins as EPAM moves up the value chain.\n- The company's diversification into multiple industry verticals and continued expansion of its global delivery footprint (including substantial growth in LatAm, India, and Western/Central Asia) are reducing geopolitical risk and broadening its client base, making top-line growth more resilient against region-specific disruptions.\n- Increasing client reliance on EPAM for execution of mission-critical, ROI-driven programs-in part due to a shortage of high-skilled IT talent and growing need for vendor consolidation-supports higher revenue per client and enhanced gross and operating margins as EPAM takes on more premium, end-to-end transformation projects.\n- Operational efficiencies through AI-enabled delivery models, higher sales cycle efficiency from new CRM analytics, and improved resource utilization are expected to drive margin expansion, supporting higher earnings growth alongside revenue momentum.\nEPAM Systems Future Earnings and Revenue Growth\nAssumptions\nHow have these above catalysts been quantified?- Analysts are assuming EPAM Systems's revenue will grow by 8.8% annually over the next 3 years.\n- Analysts assume that profit margins will increase from 7.9% today to 8.9% in 3 years time.\n- Analysts expect earnings to reach $582.4 million (and earnings per share of $10.07) by about August 2028, up from $401.2 million today.\n- In order for the above numbers to justify the analysts price target, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 24.4x on those 2028 earnings, up from 23.6x today. This future PE is lower than the current PE for the US IT industry at 30.7x.\n- Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to decline by 1.81% per year for the next 3 years.\n- To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 8.76%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.\nEPAM Systems Future Earnings Per Share Growth\nRisks\nWhat could happen that would invalidate this narrative?- The proliferation of generative AI and automation presents a structural risk, as widespread adoption of AI-powered and low/no-code tools could reduce the demand for traditional custom IT services, leading to potential revenue pressure and long-term margin compression for EPAM if clients opt for automated or off-the-shelf solutions instead.\n- EPAM's operating margins have already been pressured by higher variable compensation, integration of recent acquisitions with lower profitability, and ongoing bench optimization; persistent wage inflation and competition for IT talent-particularly in key Eastern European and Indian delivery centers-could further erode net margins over time.\n- Despite progress in geographic diversification, EPAM retains a significant delivery footprint in Central and Eastern Europe, which leaves it vulnerable to geopolitical instability, wage pressure, and regulatory risks; such events could disrupt project delivery and inflate operational costs, impacting both revenue reliability and profitability.\n- As major cloud providers and hyperscalers (AWS, Microsoft, Google) expand their own consulting and professional services, and as enterprises consolidate vendors, EPAM faces increased competition from larger, better-capitalized rivals who may crowd out mid-sized engineering firms, putting pressure on EPAM's ability to win large, multi-year deals and sustain revenue growth.\n- Though EPAM is investing heavily in upskilling, AI, and platform-based offerings, the transition from legacy custom software development to higher-value, recurring digital transformation and AI consulting services is ongoing; if this portfolio evolution lags broader industry trends, EPAM risks stagnating revenue and market share losses as clients increasingly favor platforms and SaaS models over bespoke development.\nValuation\nHow have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?- The analysts have a consensus price target of $212.688 for EPAM Systems based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $246.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $171.0.\n- In order for you to agree with the analyst's consensus, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $6.5 billion, earnings will come to $582.4 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 24.4x, assuming you use a discount rate of 8.8%.\n- Given the current share price of $170.28, the analyst price target of $212.69 is 19.9% higher.\n- We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.\nHow well do narratives help inform your perspective?\nDisclaimer\nAnalystConsensusTarget is a tool utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) that ingests data on consensus price targets, forecasted revenue and earnings figures, as well as the transcripts of earnings calls to produce qualitative analysis.

EPAM is projected to reach $6.5\u202fbillion in revenue and $582\u202fmillion in earnings by 2028, with a consensus fair value of $212.69\u2014about 20% above its current price\u2014though margin recovery remains vulnerable to wage inflation and talent competition.
