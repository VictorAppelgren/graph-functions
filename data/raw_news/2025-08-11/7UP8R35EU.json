  "description": "Anthony Scaramucci challenges Wall Street's optimism about Trump's departure and warns that the full economic impact of his tariffs, including rising inflation, is yet to be felt.",
  "content": "Anthony Scaramucci, former White House Communications Director, has challenged Wall Street\u2019s assumption that President Donald Trump will leave office in three and a half years and warned that the full impact of his tariffs is yet to come.\n\nIn a video posted over the weekend, Scaramucci expressed concern that Wall Street is complacent, believing Trump's time in office is limited.\n\nHe highlighted the President's $200 million White House ballroom renovation project, questioning the belief that Trump will leave in 3.5 years.\n\n\"Do you know anybody who builds a $200 million ballroom onto their house and moves out in three and a half years?\" Scaramucci said. \"The guy\u2019s making expansive renovations to the White House. Doesn\u2019t smell like a guy that wants to leave anytime soon.\"\n\nScaramucci continued, suggesting that Trump's presidency is far from over, pointing to the expanding renovations and a growing \"personality cult\" around him.\n\nHe cautioned Wall Street that a \"cleanup\" of Trump's policies will be needed but is unlikely to happen quickly. The challenge, he warned, will be economic, particularly due to the ongoing trade war and the implementation of tariffs.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.\n\nSee Also: Apple's Smart Move May Save iPhone Sales\u2013And The Stock Could Soar\n\nIn a May interview with NBC News, Trump said he does not plan to seek a third term, confirming that his presidency would conclude after the 2028 election. Trump cited constitutional limits on presidential terms and said he intends to \"pass the torch\" to another Republican.\n\nWhile noting past speculation \u2014 including the sale of red \"Trump 2028\" hats \u2014 Trump dismissed the idea of another run, saying his focus is on \"four great years\" before handing over the reins \"to somebody, ideally a great Republican.\"\n\nHe named Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as strong contenders but refrained from making any endorsements, calling it \"far too early\" to decide.\n\nTurning to the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs, Scaramucci stressed that Wall Street is ignoring the true economic consequences of the administration\u2019s protectionist policies.\n\nWhile some have said that the tariffs haven't yet led to a recession, Scaramucci argued that the real effects are still to come. He pointed out that many economists are beginning to notice a slowdown in capital allocation decisions, with tariffs starting to hurt U.S. businesses.\n\n\u201cSo the MAGA narrative is \u2018ho ho still got a strong economy despite our tariffs,\u2019 but the real narrative should be, \u2018No, the tariffs haven\u2019t fully kicked in yet,'\u201d he stated in the video.\n\nThe effects of the tariffs are already starting to show in inflation, with core inflation set to rise in the coming months. Economists forecast the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to increase by 0.2% month-over-month in July, largely driven by higher import duties.\n\nU.S. businesses have been absorbing most of the costs, but this burden is expected to shift to consumers. Goldman Sachs economist Elsie Peng predicts that by October, U.S. consumers will shoulder 67% of the tariff costs, up from 22% currently.\n\u2022 AMD CEO Lisa Su Says China Strategy Rebounding As MI308 AI Chips Await US License: \u2018Better Position Than We Were Ninety Days Ago\u2019\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

      "text": "- Goldman sees consumer share of tariff costs jumping from 22% in June to 67% by October.\n- Oxford Economics projects US tariff rates topping 18%, highest since the 1930s.\n- This simple system has nailed 1,000+ post-earnings winners. Get in before Q3 trades take off \u2192\nSo far, President Donald Trump's trade tariffs have barely touched consumer prices, giving the White House a reason to claim victory over early fears of an inflation spike.\n- VOO ETF is trading near its annual peak. Check the latest price here.\nHowever, some economists argue that the real impact will only be a few months away, and this is going to have a highly impactful effect.\nIn a note shared Monday, Goldman Sachs economist Elsie Peng indicated that through June, U.S. consumers had shouldered just 22% of the tariff costs, with U.S. businesses absorbing 64% and foreign exporters covering 14%.\nThat balance, however, is likely to shift sharply.\nBy October, she expects that split to look very different: consumers picking up 67% of the tab, exporters 25%, and U.S. businesses just 8%.\nBrace For Tariffs Impact: Consumers Will Pay More\nSo far, the 9 percentage point increase in the effective tariff rate this year has lowered import prices by about 1.3%. By the time the expected 14-point increase for 2025 is in place, import prices could be down 3.7%.\nBut cheaper import prices don't necessarily mean more affordable goods for consumers. In fact, products that rely heavily on imports \u2014 like household appliances and information-processing equipment \u2014 are already up 7.5% more than their usual price trend this year.\nGoldman estimates that after four months of new tariffs, about two-thirds of the extra costs end up in consumer prices, not far from the pace during the last trade war in 2018\u20132019.\nThat means businesses, which so far have shouldered most of the pain, are about to see their share shrink to single digits, even as some domestic producers use the protection from tariffs to raise their own prices.\nGoldman calculates that tariffs have already added 0.20 percentage points to core inflation, with another 0.16 points expected in July and a further 0.5 points between August and December.\nThat would push core inflation to around 3.2% by the end of the year, assuming the underlying trend without tariffs is 2.4%.\n\"We continue to expect 70% of the direct costs of tariffs would fall on consumers and the total would rise to about 100% when combined with other spillover effects,\" Peng said.\nHow Will Trump\u2019s Tariffs Reshape Your Shopping Bill?\nOxford Economics sees similar risks. Economist Adam Slater sees the average U.S. tariff rate rising above 18% \u2014 the highest since the 1930s.\nThus far, importers have paid less in customs duties than the rates would suggest, meaning the full impact on prices and growth hasn't been felt yet.\nPrices for goods like furniture, toys and appliances are already climbing several percent a year.\nSome products, such as cars and clothing, have been spared for now thanks to leftover inventory and weak demand, which is forcing manufacturers to absorb some costs.\nStill, inflation pressures are building. A key gauge of core inflation \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index excluding food and energy \u2014 was rising at a 3% annualized pace in June, up from 2.4% in January.\n\"We still expect U.S. headline inflation to rise to around 3.5% by year-end,\" Slated stated.\nHow much of the tariff burden is passed on to store prices will depend on several factors: whether retailers can find cheaper suppliers, how aggressively U.S. firms raise prices under tariff protection, and how much wholesalers and distributors can absorb.\nHistory offers a warning \u2014 a Fed study found that during the 2018\u20132019 tariff wave, most of the costs were quickly passed on to consumers.\nThis time, the hit has been delayed, but the experts\u2019 message is clear: the relief won't last much longer.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

She expressed support for the global use of U.S. technology, stating that the company is committed to contributing to that effort.\nThe U.S. government has tightened export controls on AI hardware over concerns about China's military modernization. The MI308, one of AMD's advanced data center chips, falls under those restrictions.\nMI308 Inventory Largely In Process, Not Finished Goods\nWhile awaiting licenses, AMD has been holding inventory related to the MI308, but Su noted that most of it is still in the production phase.\n\u201cIn terms of the supply chain, most of our inventory was not in finished goods. So it was work in process and it'll take us a couple of quarters to run through that,\u201d she stated.\nThe timeline for revenue contribution from the MI308 depends on when export approvals are granted.\nAMD Eyes Rebound In China Strategy As AI Demand Grows\nSu's comments suggest AMD is positioning itself to re-enter the Chinese AI market as soon as regulations allow. \u201cChina is an important market for us. Given the timing of licenses, we have a number of licenses that are under review now.\u201d\nAMD posted second-quarter revenue of $7.69 billion, surpassing the $7.41 billion forecast by analysts. However, its adjusted earnings came in at 48 cents per share, slightly below the expected 49 cents.\nAMD projects third-quarter revenue to be around $8.7 billion, give or take $300 million. In comparison, analysts are estimating revenue of roughly $8.15 billion.\nPrice Action: AMD shares have risen approximately 44.50% year-to-date. However, as of the latest check on Wednesday, the stock was down 4.37% in pre-market trading, trading at $166.70, according to Benzinga Pro.\nBenzinga's Edge Stock Rankings show that AMD continues to demonstrate strong upward momentum across short, medium and long-term timeframes.

See how to find it live on Wednesday \u2192\nJuly's inflation report, due Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is likely to confirm that Donald Trump's trade tariffs are beginning to ripple across more categories in the consumer basket. That shift could create another obstacle for the Federal Reserve as it weighs the timing of interest rate cuts.\n- IWM ETF is testing a key resistance. Check the latest price here.\nJuly Inflation Preview: Tariffs Showdown Begins\nWall Street economists expect the Consumer Price Index to rise for a third straight month.\nThe consensus view is for annual CPI to print at 2.9%, above June\u2019s 2.8% and matching the highest level since February.\nOn a monthly basis, prices are projected to rise by 0.2%, which is slightly below the 0.3% increase observed in June. Much of the increase is expected to come from retailers passing along higher import duties, especially in household furnishings and recreational goods.\nExcluding food and energy, core inflation is expected to accelerate. Economists forecast a 0.3% monthly gain in core CPI, the largest in six months, up from 0.2% in June. The annual core rate is projected to tick up from 2.9% to 3%.\nCore inflation, which excludes food and energy, is projected to edge up to 3% from 2.9% in June, with the monthly core CPI expected to increase 0.3%, its sharpest rise in six months, after 0.2% previously.\nEconomists See Broader Price Pressures In July\n\"It seems likely that inflation will advance further over June's rate of 2.7% as the consequences of Trump's \u2018Liberation Day' tariffs become inescapable,\" Richard Potts, economist at Bondford, said in an emailed comment.\nHe added that a growing number of companies have \"exhausted the cheaper stockpiles of imported goods that they had built up in advance of April's tariff hikes\" and will now \"have little option but to pass on the new cost of these tariffs to consumers.\"\nStephen Juneau, economist at Bank of America, expects core goods prices to rise 0.3% month-on-month in July, faster than in June.\n\"Tariffs should continue to put upward pressure on prices,\" he said, highlighting a 1.2% surge in apparel prices as a leading driver, even as both new and used vehicle prices are projected to decline again.\nJessica Rindels at Goldman Sachs sees four key trends shaping the July data.\nShe forecasts a 0.75% rebound in used car prices due to higher auction prices, a 0.2% decline in new car prices resulting from stronger dealer incentives, a 0.1% decrease in car insurance premiums, and a 2% increase in airfares.\nRindel also expects monthly core CPI to remain between 0.3% and 0.4% in the coming months due to tariff effects, even as underlying inflation trends lower. Goldman expects the year-end core CPI to be 3.3%.\nRead now:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Preservation experts say President Donald Trump's push to add a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot state ballroom to the White House by 2029 risks sacrificing history for haste. The White House will begin the East Wing addition in September, a project that would be the mansion's largest structural change since the Truman Balcony.\nWhat Happened: White House chief of staff Susie Wiles insisted the project will honor the building's past. \"The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organizations to [preserve] the special history of the White House while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future Administrations and generations of Americans to come,\" Wiles said.\nYet historians warn the administration faces few guardrails. \"In most cases, you're not going to have a lot of binding obligations to historic buildings,\" said Michael Spencer, a preservation professor at the University of Mary Washington, told The New York Times, noting the White House is exempt from the National Historic Preservation Act.\nRichard Longstreth, professor emeritus at George Washington University, called the plan's scale alarming. \"It could do some harm to the property overall \u2026 There aren't any checks and balances here, unfortunately,\" he remarked.\nFormer National Park Service director Jonathan Jarvis questioned both design and timing. \"You couldn't put something on the side of the building that doesn't match it historically in terms of its architecture, colouration and style,\" he said, labeling the schedule \"optimistic.\" He added, \"You don't see one of those projects go that fast \u2026 It'll be a rush to get it done. It's the White House \u2014 it has to survive a terrorist attack.\"\nWhy It Matters: The Committee for the Preservation of the White House, whose advice is nonbinding, has not publicly weighed in. Trump has yet to appoint new members after earlier terms expired, increasing concerns that oversight will be minimal.\nFunding also remains opaque. The administration says Trump and \"patriot donors\" will pay, but has provided no list of contributors, prompting ethics advocates to demand transparency.\nConstruction management firm Clark and architect James McCrery promise to keep the addition \"classical\" and complete it \"long before\" January 2029. Preservationists counter that rushing a project of this magnitude courts structural, security and reputational risks that could linger far beyond Trump's term.\nPhoto Courtesy: Joey Sussman on Shutterstock.com\nRead Next:\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Get in before Q3 trades take off \u2192\nApple Inc.\u2018s AAPL smart decision to add another $100 billion to its U.S. manufacturing commitment is being hailed on Wall Street as a tactical move to dodge steep tariffs under President Donald Trump\u2018s trade regime\u2014and possibly reignite its stock, which is still down 12% year-to-date.\n- AAPL stock is moving fast.

This includes:\n- Expansion of Corning's Kentucky plant to produce U.S.-made cover glass for every iPhone and Apple Watch\n- Building out an end-to-end silicon supply chain, with 19 billion chips expected to be produced in the U.S. in 2025\n- Continuing construction of a server factory in Houston, supporting Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute\n- Growing data center capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada, and Oregon\n- Progress on a second campus in Austin, Texas\nCapex is also accelerating: Apple has spent $9.5 billion year-to-date, up from $6.5 billion in the same period last year.

      "text": "- Trump's tariff policies hit poorer nations harder, with some facing tariffs as high as 40%.\n- Controversial trade strategy could widen economic gaps and strain global relations.\n- The next 100%+ earnings move could hit this month. See how to find it live on Wednesday \u2192\nThe tariff policies of Donald Trump\u2018s administration have been found to disproportionately affect less affluent nations, a stark contrast to the special trading privileges these countries have enjoyed for years from wealthy nations like the U.S.\nWhat Happened: The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs have been more severe on poorer nations compared to their wealthier counterparts.\nWhile affluent nations such as South Korea, Japan, and European Union member states faced tariffs ranging from 10% to 15%, developing countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, South Africa, and Iraq were slapped with tariffs of 20% or more.\nFurther, Myanmar and Laos, among the poorest nations in Asia, were subjected to tariffs as high as 40%, threatening to cripple their exports to the U.S.\nIn a recent development, President Trump announced plans to hike tariffs on India to 50%, amidst disputes over India\u2019s continued imports of Russian oil.\n\"It's left developing countries with very high tariffs. It's a significant change especially for treatment of least developed countries,\" Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, an Asia-based think tank recently told the Wall Street Journal.\nAlso Read: Trump\u2019s Disapproval Rating Soars Amid Economic Woes, Epstein Drama\nHowever, countries with significant geopolitical or economic ties to the U.S., such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, were spared from these harsh tariffs. These nations, all major oil and gas producers, faced no tariffs higher than the standard 10%.\n\u201cIt is hard to tell if there is any logic to deciphering why some countries have been hit so hard while others were spared,\u201d David Henig, a trade expert at the European Center for International Political Economy, a think tank based in Brussels, told CNBC.\nWhy It Matters: This shift in tariff policy marks a significant departure from the traditional treatment of the world\u2019s least developed countries.\nThe demand from the Trump administration for trading partners to invest in the U.S. has put developing countries at a disadvantage, as few have the financial capacity to match the investment pledges made by Japan, South Korea, and the EU.\nThis could potentially exacerbate the economic divide between developed and developing nations, further straining international trade relations.\nRead Next\nSix Months In, Trump Struggles To Sell His Economic Vision To Skeptical Americans\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

  "argos_summary": "Anthony Scaramucci, former White House Communications Director, has expressed skepticism about Wall Street's belief that President Trump will leave office in three and a half years, citing the President's significant renovations to the White House as a sign of his long-term intentions. He warned that the economic impact of Trump's tariffs is yet to fully manifest, with expectations that consumers will soon bear a larger share of these costs, potentially leading to increased inflation. Meanwhile, Trump has confirmed he does not plan to seek a third term, focusing instead on passing the torch to a successor after the 2028 election.",
