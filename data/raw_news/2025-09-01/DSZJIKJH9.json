  "description": "New Orleans and the Gulf Coast have rebuilt. But the questions Katrina raised in 2005 on climate, government and race persist.",
  "content": "\u2022 Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast and New Orleans on Aug. 29, 2005.\n\u2022 The storm and flooding left thousands dead and billions in damage.\n\u2022 Now, 20 years later, America remembers the storm. But what about its lessons?\n\nTwenty years later, Edward Buckles Jr. remembers Katrina \u2212 remembers at age 13 having his neighborhood swept away by the hurricane's raging waters, a defining moment of his life that would dislodge his family for a time from its New Orleans roots.\n\nTwenty years later, America remembers Katrina, too \u2212 remembers one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern U.S. history, raising questions that persist today about the crises of climate, the role of government and the nation's divides by race and class.\n\nIn a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll, 85% of Americans said they were familiar with Hurricane Katrina despite the passage of two tumultuous decades packed with competing news events, from an economic meltdown to wars abroad to a global pandemic.\n\n\"The images are just burned into people's minds and hearts and souls about what those days and weeks looked like with the city underwater,\" said Mary Landrieu, then a Democratic senator from Louisiana, the daughter of one New Orleans mayor and the sister of another. \"The thousands of people that were stranded at the Superdome \u2212 I mean, that was a catastrophe and a real failure of the local, state and federal government.\"\n\nAs the hurricane approached, she and her extended family fled their summer camp on Lake Pontchartrain. Hours later, \"it was destroyed,\" she said in an interview. \"There wasn't a stick or a stone left.\"\n\nThe most intense memories are understandably in the South, where scars from the storm's battering can still sometimes be seen.\n\nBut the imprint of Katrina also remains remarkably wide across the country, recalled by nearly 9 of 10 in the Northeast and more than 8 in 10 in the Midwest and the West.\n\nEven among those now 18 to 34 years old \u2212 no more than teenagers when the storm struck, and some not even yet born \u2212 three-quarters say they know at least a little and sometimes a lot about the tropical cyclone that in August 2005 left devastation in its wake across Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.\n\nNearly everyone surveyed said the storm had a negative impact on New Orleans; 3 of 4 described the harm it did as significant.\n\nHurricane Katrina is believed to have killed 1,392 people \u2212 the deadliest hurricane since the Okeechobee hurricane in 1928 \u2212 and to have caused an estimated $200 billion in damage, when adjusted for inflation, one of the costliest storms to ever hit the United States.\n\nWhen disasters strike, who should help?\n\nOne reason Americans may remember Katrina is that its story isn't really over, that the issues it ignited haven't been settled.\n\n\"Katrina was a canary in the coal mine,\" said Maurice Carlos Ruffin, now an award-winning novelist and professor at Louisiana State University but then a young professional who lost his house, job and car in the storm. It spotlighted what many saw as government incompetence or disregard for those who were poor and people of color.\n\nAmong the issues that still resonate today:\n\nWhat should be done before the next storm?\n\nEight in 10 said Katrina showed the nation's disaster preparedness needs to be improved. Nearly as many, 73%, said it demonstrated a need to invest more in infrastructure in vulnerable coastal areas.\n\nKatrina was not only a natural disaster but also a man-made one. The death toll was exacerbated because the levees in New Orleans were breached, a failure blamed afterward on engineering flaws and cost-saving measures by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers when they were built.\n\nWho should help after disaster strikes?\n\nA large majority of Americans endorsed major roles for the federal government (71%), state governments (83%) and local governments (79%), but less so for the private sector (38%). About 66% called the services from of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \"very necessary\" and 57% supported increasing its budget.\n\nBut FEMA is now under fire by the Trump administration, its future uncertain. President Donald Trump has said he wants to phase out FEMA after the current hurricane season ends in November, cutting its funding and transferring most of its responsibilities to the states.\n\nDespite the significant support for FEMA, Trump's proposal strikes a chord with the public in some ways. Americans were skeptical about the ability of any level of government to handle major natural disasters, but their confidence was higher in state and local government (48% and 49%, respectively) than in the federal government (30%).\n\nEven lower was their confidence that Washington has learned the lessons of Katrina. Just 22% predicted the federal response would be better if a storm like Katrina hit again.\n\nShould people just live someplace less perilous?\n\nThere was no consensus on just how much help the government should give to people who live in areas known to be especially susceptible to landslides, earthquakes, hurricanes and flooding: 40% said residents should live at their own risk; 35% said the government should help them recover if disaster strikes.\n\nNo surprise that views of the role of government reflect the nation's partisan divide. Democrats by 2-1 supported government help; Republicans by 2-1 said residents in at-risk areas should be on their own.\n\nMost Americans said extreme weather has gotten more frequent and more intense over the past 10 years in the places they live. A third said they worry, occasionally or frequently, about becoming a victim of a disaster like a hurricane, tornado or earthquake.\n\nBy 3-1, those surveyed said humans could slow or reverse climate change but aren't willing to change their behavior to do that. Nearly 1 in 5 thought progress was being made; 1 in 5 said it's already too late.\n\nThe online poll of 1,023 adults, taken June 13-15 using Ipsos KnowledgePanel, has an error margin of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\n\nFor some, the legacy of Katrina is personal, not policy.\n\n\"There's an argument where New Orleans has bounced back fully, if you're looking at it from the perspective of tourism or if you're looking at it from the perspective of business, right?\" said Buckles, a filmmaker who produced \"Katrina Babies,\" an HBO documentary about the storm's impact on the children who lived through it. \"But I think that it's those things that you really can't see \u2212 the mental health trauma \u2212 that is still surfacing.\"\n\nMany of those he profiled said the lesson they learned was that neither the federal government nor the local police nor anyone else could be counted on to rescue them when catastrophe struck. Some describe their lives as divided into Before-Katrina and After-Katrina.\n\n\"It's constantly in our daily conversation,\" Buckles said. \"It's like we can barely talk about anything without mentioning Katrina.\"\n\nIn the nationwide poll, a 58% majority said Katrina showed that race and economic status can help determine who gets hurt by a natural disaster, and by how much.\n\nAmong White and Hispanic respondents, that was the view by 3-1. Among Black respondents, that opinion was held by nearly 6-1, 61%-11%.\n\nIn modern times, a handful of images have become iconic, defining a moment in history and recognizable in a flash: For the Vietnam War, a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack. For the Civil Rights Movement, Alabama troopers lifting truncheons to beat marchers crossing Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge. For 9/11, three New York City firefighters raising an American flag amid the wreckage of the World Trade Center.\n\nSome of the images from Katrina have been indelible, too \u2212 of desperate people trapped for days on their roofs or in their attics to get above the floodwaters and of thousands taking chaotic refuge in the Superdome. Of President George W. Bush, flying overhead on Air Force One, peering out a window at the devastation a mile below.\n\nCritics saw it not as a sign of his concern but as a demonstration of his distance, and Katrina became a kind of political shorthand. Pundits would debate when and whether the presidents who followed were having \"their Katrina moment\" \u2013 that is, a misstep that risked their reputation and their support.\n\n'The hand of God had wiped away the coast'\n\nTwenty years later, Haley Barbour, then the Republican governor of Mississippi, remembers Katrina and its devastation. \"It looked like the hand of God had wiped away the coast,\" he said in an interview. The storm and floods killed 238 residents of his state and leaving billions of dollars in damages \u2212 though he also remembers the outpouring of help from across the country as the state rebuilt.\n\nTwenty years later, Ruffin remembers Katrina, too, and wonders how it reshaped him, and the country. \"I am still an optimist, but I wonder if I would've been more of an optimist had that not happened,\" he said. \"There have been many moments in American history that I think have changed our attitude toward ourselves.\"\n\nFor him and others, Katrina still stands as one of those moments.",

      "text": "20 years after Hurricane Katrina, Americans want improvements to U.S. disaster preparedness\nNew USA Today/Ipsos poll shows most Americans see FEMA\u2019s role as very necessary; a plurality expect the federal response to a disaster like Katrina would be worse today\nWashington DC, August 28, 2025 - Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina exposed critical weaknesses in America's disaster response system, a new USA Today/Ipsos poll reveals overall low public confidence in federal emergency management amidst recent decline in funding for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), among other federal agencies. At the same time, a strong majority of Americans believe services that FEMA provides are very necessary, and most support increasing its budget to support future natural disasters.\nKey findings:\n- More than eight in ten Americans (84%) agree it's very important to have well-coordinated and well-funded emergency response systems.\n- A strong majority believe the federal government (71%), state governments (83%), and local governments (79%) all should play a major role in disaster preparedness. Democrats (87%) are more likely than Republicans (65%) to agree that the federal government should play a major role.\n- Only 30% overall express confidence in the federal government's ability to handle a major natural disaster, with confidence higher among Republicans (52%) and lower among Democrats (14%). Overall confidence is higher in state and local government (48% and 49%, respectively).\n- Nearly two in five (37%) believe the federal response to a hurricane like Katrina would be worse today than it was two decades ago, while only 22% think it would be better. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to believe the response today would be worse (64% and 11%, respectively).\n- While 57% of Americans overall believe FEMA's budget should be increased due to more frequent severe weather events, partisan views diverge dramatically: 82% of Democrats support increasing FEMA's budget compared to just 38% of Republicans.\nThese findings come as Americans report experiencing more extreme weather. A majority (57%) say unusual weather patterns have become more frequent in their areas over the past decade, with extreme heat (55%), poor air quality (49%), and severe storms (39%) topping the list. Looking forward, 58% expect extreme weather events to increase. This USA Today/Ipsos research also reveals stark partisan divides about both current weather conditions and future risks due to climate change.\nAbout the Study\nThis USA Today/Ipsos poll was conducted from June 13th through June 15th, 2025, using the probability-based KnowledgePanel\u00ae. This poll is based on a nationally representative probability sample of 1,023 adults age 18 or older. The sample includes 281 Republicans, 307 Democrats, and 321 independents.\nThe survey was conducted using KnowledgePanel, the largest and most well-established online probability-based panel that is representative of the adult U.S. population. Our recruitment process employs a scientifically developed addressed-based sampling methodology using the latest Delivery Sequence File of the USPS \u2013 a database with full coverage of all delivery points in the U.S. Households invited to join the panel are randomly selected from all available households in the U.S. Persons in the sampled households are invited to join and participate in the panel. Those selected who do not already have internet access are provided a tablet and internet connection at no cost to the panel member. Those who join the panel and who are selected to participate in a survey are sent a unique password-protected log-in used to complete surveys online. As a result of our recruitment and sampling methodologies, samples from KnowledgePanel cover all households regardless of their phone or internet status and findings can be reported with a margin of sampling error and projected to the general population.\nThe data for the total sample were weighted to adjust for gender by age, race/ethnicity, education, Census region, metropolitan status, and household income. Party ID benchmarks are from the 2024 National Public Opinion Reference Survey (NPORS). The demographic benchmarks came from the 2024 March Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS).\n- Gender (Male, Female) by Age (18\u201329, 30\u201344, 45-59 and 60+)\n- Race/Hispanic Ethnicity (White Non-Hispanic, Black Non-Hispanic, Other, Non-Hispanic, Hispanic, 2+ Races, Non-Hispanic)\n- Education (Less than High School, High School, Some College, Bachelor or higher)\n- Census Region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West)\n- Metropolitan status (Metro, non-Metro)\n- Household Income (Under $25,000, $25,000-$49,999, $50,000-$74,999, $75,000-$99,999, $100,000-$149,999, $150,000+)\n- Party ID (Republican, Leans Republican, Independent/Other, Democrat, Leans Democrat)\nThe margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for results based on the entire sample of adults. The margin of sampling error takes into account the design effect, which was 1.11 For Republicans, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 6.1 percentage points, and the design effect is 1.08. For Democrats, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 5.9 percentage points, and the design effect is 1.10. For independents, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 5.8 percentage points, and the design effect is 1.13.\nThe margin of sampling error is higher and varies for results based on sub-samples. In our reporting of the findings, percentage points are rounded off to the nearest whole number. As a result, percentages in a given table column may total slightly higher or lower than 100%. In questions that permit multiple responses, columns may total substantially more than 100%, depending on the number of different responses offered by each respondent.\nSome data from the survey is trended against past national surveys conducted in July 2023, April 2023, April 2022, April 2021, April 2018, April 2017, August 2006, February 2006, September 2005, and August 2004. Data collected in July 2023, April 2022, April 2021, April 2018, and April 2017 was collected via Ipsos\u2019 non-probability online panel (iSay), while data from 2006 and prior was collected via telephone survey.\nFor more information on this news release, please contact:\nMallory Newall\nVice President, US\nPublic Affairs\n+1 202 374-2613\n[email protected]\nAbout Ipsos\nIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally, operating in 90 markets and employing nearly 20,000 people.\nOur passionately curious research professionals, analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions, opinions and motivations of citizens, consumers, patients, customers or employees.

      "text": "Gruesome photos from tragedies test newsrooms\nHuman carnage is inevitable in wars and plane crashes. But just how eager are we to observe it up close?\nThe age-old dilemma for photojournalists and editors resurfaced this week with all its layered issues in reactions to gruesome photos from the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 wreckage in Ukraine and a bombing at a Gaza city beach.\nNot-for-the-squeamish photos from the scene by major news agencies, including The Associated Press, Reuters and the Agence France-Presse, were widely circulated to their customers and readily available online. The tough decision was which ones to display.\nEvery news organization \"has a standard. But it's more of a cultural norm rather than straight journalistic protocol,\" says Nina Berman, a photography professor at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. \"You don't want pictures to be a horror movie. You want it to be storytelling. It should provide some evidentiary purpose.\"\nEditorial decisions made in newsrooms to document an important event, vs. gratuitous displays aimed at generating online clicks, can seem like a fine line. The two tragedies this week \u2014 and how some news organizations chose to cover them \u2014 are a reminder of this delicate dance.\nThe New York Times ran a photo by staffer Tyler Hicks of a Palestinian man carrying the dead body of a boy while another dead boy lay on the beach on the front page Thursday, but chose not to run images of mangled bodies and human limbs from the wreckage in Ukraine.\nOther news organizations ran similar photos from Gaza but similarly refrained from showcasing gruesome photos from the plane crash site. Several news organizations, including The Huffington Post and Business Insider, ran photos showing corpses strewn in the flight wreckage.\n\"The question is, does showing a dead body serve a purpose in the journalistic mission?\" says Sean Elliot, chair of the ethics committee of the National Press Photographers Association. \"An airplane comes out the sky at 30,000 feet in the air, and there's going to be a lot of dead bodies. You may not need a confirmation. In a military attack in Gaza, it's not certain that there would be a dead body. (The photo) is a reporting of fact.\"\nIn a statement, Whitney Snyder, executive news editor of The Huffington Post, said the photos were posted with a warning statement about the graphic nature and after considering respect for the victims and \"the public's right to understand what has happened.\"\n\"Our job is to deliver the news. And in the case of an international tragedy, we have a responsibility not to shy away from the real human toll,\" Snyder said. \"We respect (readers') decision whether or not to look.\"\nPhotographers in war zones and crash sites are hardly a shy lot, and some of their finest and bravest works have won Pulitzer Prizes and swayed public policy.\nWhile American readers \u2014 particularly of small newspapers \u2014 can be sensitive to graphic photos, news organizations must carry on their responsibility to avoid \"sugar-coating,\" Berman says. \"Is that (photo) really important in adding value to the story? With each story, you have to ask, 'Does this story really advance in a deeper way by the photo?' \"\n\"The Falling Man\" photo from the 9/11 attacks (by AP photographer Richard Drew of a man falling from the North Tower of the World Trade Center), however horrific, \"spoke to the people up in the towers and the loneliness of death,\" she says.\nEddie Adams won a Pulitzer for the AP with a photo showing a South Vietnamese police chief executing a handcuffed Vietcong prisoner. His photo \u2014 along with another Pulitzer-winning picture by AP photographer Nick Ut that depicted a naked girl fleeing from a napalm attack \u2014 helped fan public opinion against the Vietnam War.\nEditorial decisions are also moved by geography, says Ken Light, a photographer who teaches photojournalism at the University of California, Berkeley. One of the unspoken modes of U.S. news photo desks is that graphic photos of destruction abroad are more tolerated than domestic tragedies, Light says. \"If it was an event in the U.S., editors tend to be more sensitive to that. We can look at (photos from abroad) and say 'It's not our world.' It's disconnected. They're the other.\"\nSocial media throws a complex variable to the mix. It's so much easier to share photos on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr, often without a proper editorial context or attribution.

      "text": "Floods, hurricanes, heat: New poll shows Americans fear rise of extreme weather\n- A 58% majority of Americans say extreme weather is getting worse, a USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds.\n- 30% say they have personally experienced extreme weather, such as heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms.\n- Most surveyed are optimistic that humans could reverse climate change but pessimistic that they'll do it.\nMost Americans fear extreme weather is getting worse, a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds, a concern underscored by the rising death toll from flash floods in central Texas.\nAs rescue workers frantically searched for survivors in Texas Hill Country, a third of those surveyed nationwide last month said they sometimes or often worry that they themselves will be a victim of a disaster like a hurricane, tornado or flood.\nThe poll, taken June 13-15, showed both alarm about worsening weather and skepticism that the world would effectively respond to curb it.\nA 58% majority predicted that extreme weather events will become more frequent in the near future, though views differed along partisan lines. An overwhelming 84% of Democrats felt that way, compared with just 38% of Republicans.\nBut even among Republicans, a plurality expressed fears of worsening extreme weather. Just 24% said incidents of extreme weather weren't increasing; another 36% didn't have an opinion or weren't sure.\nThe online poll of 1,023 adults, taken using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel, has a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points for the full sample. The error margin for the Republican subsample is 6.1% and for Democrats 5.9%.\n\"The majority of Americans agree that events like the tragedy in Texas are becoming more frequent, making the effects of climate change harder to deny,\" said Mallory Newall, vice president at Ipsos. \"The question now is not if severe weather is more common but what, if anything, can be done to slow the effects \u2212 or if people in areas prone to disaster can stay in their homes long-term.\"\nFeeling extreme weather where they live\nMany Americans said they had felt the effect of dangerous weather in their own lives:\n- 30% had personally experienced extreme weather events in the previous month; most frequently mentioned were heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms.\n- 57% said unusual weather had become more frequent compared with 10 years ago, especially extreme heat and poor air quality.\n- 51% said unusual weather had become more intense compared with 10 years ago; 54% said extreme heat had gotten more intense.\nClimate scientists agree that the threat of extreme weather is increasing.\n\"As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting extreme weather across the planet,\" a NASA report concludes. \"Record-breaking heat waves on land and in the ocean, drenching rains, severe floods, years-long droughts, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense.\"\nIn recent days, much of Europe has been hit by a sweltering heat wave, reaching record temperatures for June in several countries and prompting a temporary rules change at Wimbledon.\nClimate progress underway? Or already too late?\nMost Americans were both optimistic that humans could reverse climate change and pessimistic that they'll do it.\nA 56% majority of those polled agreed with a statement that \"humans can slow/reverse climate change but aren't willing to change their behavior.\" That included 83% of Democrats but just 33% of Republicans, who tend to be more skeptical of climate change.\nOne in 5 said it was too late to stop climate change at this point. An almost equal number, 18%, said humans already were making progress against climate change.\nAnd 17% said the impact could be very personal indeed \u2212 predicting that climate change will make it more difficult to stay where they currently live."

      "text": "Trump administration continues to suggest FEMA could go away\nPresident Donald Trump's administration continues to suggest the Federal Emergency Management Agency could be coming to an end, with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem reiterating to lawmakers that the president would like to abolish FEMA.\nTrump discussed eliminating FEMA in the wake of recent natural disasters in California and North Carolina.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to recommend that FEMA go away,\" Trump said while touring flood damage in North Carolina in January, before continuing on to Los Angeles, which was devested by wildfires, where he said \"I say you don't need FEMA, you need a good state government.\"\nNoem told lawmakers during a May 6 hearing that the president believes the federal disaster relief agency has \"failed.\"\nThe top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, questioned Trump\u2019s plan for the embattled agency after his budget proposed to cut $644 million in FEMA grants.\n\u201cFederal disaster relief should be readily available across the United States, regardless of where you live,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cNatural disasters happen everywhere.\u201d\nDeLauro argued that states couldn\u2019t handle disasters on their own. But Noem said Trump proposed to provide states with federal grants rather than the bureaucracy.\n\u201cHe believes that FEMA and its response in many, many circumstances has failed the American people, and that FEMA as it exists today should be eliminated,\u201d Noem said.\nDeLauro asked for evidence of FEMA\u2019s failure. Noem said the agency still has claims open from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and from fire claims a decade ago.\n\u201cWhat the president has said is he\u2019s sick and tired of federal agencies that pick and choose who wins and who loses,\u201d Noem said.\nRep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., said his state has been hit with many hurricanes and \u201cfrustration levels are off the chart\u201d because FEMA payments lag for years while cities and states pay interest on disaster costs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that FEMA shows up and everything\u2019s OK,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the contrary, actually.\u201d\nTrump signed an executive order Jan. 24 creating a review council to look at FEMA and suggest potential changes, including \"whether FEMA can serve its functions as a support agency, providing supplemental Federal assistance\" to states instead of directly controlling disaster relief.\nThe agency has been under strain amid the wave of federal layoffs and buyouts pushed by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. At least 2,000 out of 6,100 full-time FEMA employees have left or plan to leave, a former employee told USA TODAY.\nTrump criticized FEMA's response to Hurricane Helene, a devastating storm that killed 248 people and inflicted $78.7 billion in damage from Florida to North Carolina, where catastrophic flooding led to 105 deaths. The agency also has been grappling with the aftermath of the Los Angeles wildfire, which caused an estimated $250 billion to $275 billion in damage.\nFEMA is running low on disaster relief funding as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches."

      "text": "A quick look at Superdome history ahead of the 2025 Super Bowl\nIt's as if the Caesars Superdome were built for the Super Bowl. This Sunday, the NFL's premier event returns to the iconic home of the New Orleans Saints for a record eighth time.\nThe Superdome's central location in the city and the organizers' experience in hosting massive events makes it easy for the city to draw the league to New Orleans. It's had multiple renovations in its 50-year history, most notably after the wide-scale devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nMore recently, the stadium underwent extensive upgrades to its wireless and cellular capabilities, fan amenities and elevators.\nWhere is the 2025 Super Bowl being played?\nThe stadium opened in 1975 as the Louisiana Superdome at a cost of $134 million ($786 million in today's dollars) and is now the fifth-oldest stadium in the NFL. With the 2026 opening of a new $2.1 billion stadium for the Buffalo Bills to replace its existing Highmark Stadium, the Caesars Superdome will move into fourth on the list of oldest stadiums.\nThe Superdome's multiple renovations have led the seating capacity to be somewhat fluid, but it's generally about 75,000 for football games and can go even higher for concerts.\nIn 2021, the 10-year agreement with Mercedes-Benz for corporate naming rights came to an end, and Caesars Entertainment signed an exclusive new 20-year agreement to include its name on the stadium. The company operates Caesars New Orleans Hotel & Casino less than a mile east of the stadium.\nHow many times has the Superdome hosted a Super Bowl?\nSuper Bowl 59 will mark the eighth time the Superdome has hosted NFL's crowning event, the most of any stadium in the history of the game. It's also the 11th time the city has hosted the Super Bowl. The first three Super Bowls were played at Tulane Stadium, which ties New Orleans with Miami for the most of any city.\nNineteen cities have hosted a Super Bowl. Here's how New Orleans stacks up among cities that have hosted at least two Super Bowl games:\nMiami's Super Bowls have been split between the Orange Bowl and Hard Rock Stadium, which has hosted six games.\nIn addition to the eight Super Bowl games, Caesars Superdome has played host to five NCAA championships in men's basketball and has hosted college football's Sugar Bowl every year since its opening.\nWhat happened in the Superdome during Katrina?\nIn 2005, the arena become a symbol for the plight of tens of thousands of New Orleans flood refugees displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The stadium itself sustained heavy flooding and extensive damage to its domed roof.\nThe stadium housed an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people during the storm and underwent a multi-phase renovation after the storm that cost $250 million, drawing money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the state of Louisiana and the NFL.\nThe stadium reopened the following season for the New Orleans Saints' first home game, a 23-3 win over the Atlanta Falcons.\nThe Superdome has hosted only one Super Bowl since Katrina: Super Bowl 47 in 2013. The game \u2212 a 34-31 Ravens win over the 49ers \u2212 was mostly notable both for a partial power failure that stopped the game for 33 minutes in the third quarter and the first Super Bowl matchup between sibling head coaches, the Ravens' John Harbaugh and the 49ers' Jim Harbaugh.\nBefore the 2024 season, a $560 million renovation modernized the facility in preparation for Super Bowl 59. The work included upgrades to the wireless and cellular connectivity, improved food and beverage areas and updated elevators.\nSecurity in wake of New Year's Day attack in New Orleans\nAfter the deadly New Year's Day truck attack in the city's iconic Bourbon Street, the NFL has adjusted its security plans surrounding Super Bowl 59.\nCathy Lanier, the NFL's chief security officer, said in a news conference last week that the league had requested and received additional law enforcement support after the ramming attack.\n\"It's natural to ask if we've changed things since the attack on Jan. 1, and of course the short answer is yes,\" Lanier told reporters on a conference call. \"But I want to remind people, to be clear, that our planning and security is continually reviewed. We review, enhance and modify our security plans based on the latest information that we have. We're constantly monitoring what's going on in the environment and the security world to make those adjustments.\"\nOn Tuesday, multiple reports indicated President Donald Trump will attend Sunday's game, likely adding a new layer of complexity to the security plan.\nContributing: Nick Brinkerhoff and Tom Schad\nSOURCES: NFL, USA TODAY reporting"

      "text": "All your questions about the 2025 hurricane season answered\nThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season will bring months of danger for millions of Americans. Here's a primer on what to know.\nEarly forecasts say the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season will bring months of danger for millions of Americans, and the time to prepare starts well before the storms form.\nOfficials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the most dangerous storms can quickly explode in intensity, so understanding forecasts, hurricane dangers and preparedness should be top-of-mind for residents well before storms start forming.\nThere's plenty to learn. (For example, did you know that hurricane hazards extend well beyond the famous \"cone of uncertainty\"?)\nHere's a primer on what to know as hurricane danger ramps up in 2025.\nWhen does the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season start?\nIn the Atlantic Basin, which includes storms that form in the Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of America (formerly known as Gulf of Mexico), hurricane season lasts from June 1 until Nov. 30. In fact, 97% of all tropical cyclones in the Atlantic form during the season.\nThe peak of the Atlantic season is typically from mid-August until mid-October.\nIn the eastern Pacific Basin, hurricane season starts on May 15 and lasts until Nov. 30.\nHurricane season forecasts: How many storms are expected?\nFederal forecasters on May 22 predicted a 60% chance of an above average season. (A typical year averages about 14 tropical storms, seven of which spin into hurricanes, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.)\nSpecifically, NOAA is forecasting a range of 13 to 19 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher). Of those, 6 to 10 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3 to 5 major hurricanes (Category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).\nExperts from Colorado State University said in their initial forecast released in early April that an active Atlantic hurricane season is likely. They predicted as many as 17 storms.\nOf those 17 storms, researchers said that nine will become hurricanes.\nA forecast from AccuWeather, which also came out in April, called for 13-18 named storms, of which 7-10 will be hurricanes.\nLast year, 18 storms formed, including devastating Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\nWhat state has the most hurricanes?\nFlorida, by a wide margin. Since accurate hurricane records began in 1851, more than 120 hurricanes have made landfall in the state of Florida. Texas is second, with 66 hits.\nAnd according to NOAA, 40% of all U.S. hurricanes have hit Florida.\nHow can you prepare for hurricane season?\n- Check with your local government to see if you live in an evacuation zone.\n- Have a plan for where you would go if you need to evacuate and share that plan with friends or loved ones. Plan to travel only as far as you need to.\n- Write a family emergency plan with your family and/or close friends to decide how you would contact each other in an emergency, where you will go and what you will do. Keep copies on your phone, in your emergency supplies and share with family.\n- Put together a basic emergency kit, with water and shelf stable foods for up to a week, flash lights, back up batteries, a first aid kit and moist towelettes.\n- Review your insurance policies to ensure if you have adequate coverage, including flood coverage.\n- Store insurance policies, photos of your home and its contents and other important papers in a safe place, in electronic files and/or share copies with family members.\n- For more suggestions, visit NOAA's hurricane preparations page.\nWhat are the costliest hurricanes in U.S. history?\nAccording to NOAA, for all United States hurricanes, Hurricane Katrina (2005, $201.3 billion) is the costliest storm on record.\nHurricane Harvey (2017, $160.0 billion) ranks second, Hurricane Ian (2022, $119.6 billion) ranks third, Hurricane Maria (2017, $115.2 billion) ranks fourth, and Hurricane Sandy (2012, $88.5 billion) ranks fifth.\nWhat is rapid intensification?\nA rapid strengthening of a hurricane, when wind speeds increase by at least 35 mph in 24 hours.\nIt occurs when a tropical storm or hurricane encounters an extremely conducive environment for strengthening, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. That environment consists of very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of midlevel moisture.\nWhat is storm surge?\nStorm surge, the massive amount of water that builds up and comes ashore during a hurricane, is often the deadliest and most destructive threat from these storms.\nIt is characterized by water being pushed toward the shore by the force of the winds moving around the storm, NOAA said.\nStorm surge has accounted for about half of all the deaths in hurricanes since 1970, according to the National Hurricane Center. It caused most of the 1,800 deaths in Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nWhat are the hurricane names for 2025?\n- Andrea\n- Barry\n- Chantal\n- Dexter\n- Erin\n- Fernand\n- Gabrielle\n- Humberto\n- Imelda\n- Jerry\n- Karen\n- Lorenzo\n- Melissa\n- Nestor\n- Olga\n- Pablo\n- Rebekah\n- Sebastian\n- Tanya\n- Van\n- Wendy"

  "argos_summary": "Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Americans still vividly remember the disaster and its lessons, with a USA Today/Ipsos poll showing 84% believe well\u2011coordinated emergency response is essential. The survey finds 71% support a major federal role, yet only 30% trust the federal government to handle a major disaster, while 57% back increasing FEMA\u2019s budget. Confidence is higher at state (48%) and local (49%) levels, and partisan divides are stark: Democrats favor federal action more than Republicans. The poll also highlights growing concern over extreme weather, with 58% expecting more frequent events in the near future. These findings underscore the need for stronger disaster preparedness and clearer federal\u2011state coordination.",
