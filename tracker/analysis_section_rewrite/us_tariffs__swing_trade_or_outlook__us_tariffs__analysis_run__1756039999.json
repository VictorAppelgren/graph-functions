      "feedback": "Actionable edit notes to elevate to world-class quality: (1) fix the analytic backbone by formalizing a first-principles regime map (tariff baseline 15% with exemptions; escalation if exemptions stall; a deregulation-forward growth path; a mixed-regime drift) and tie it to invariant real-rate differentials and terms-of-trade to anchor pricing and risk premia (cite RHFWI02JT; 9W8ZUIBDY). (2) reconstitute Movers & Scenarios into exactly 4 lines, 2 Up and 2 Down, each in the strict 5-field format: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %; base probabilities should be explicit, e.g., Up 60% (base-case), Alt-1 25%, Alt-2 15%, with in-text citations only for facts/numbers drawn from the source IDs (e.g., RHFWI02JT, 2SJORBV6H, QRX2HD4X0, WLXM1819K, AJTHKYXQ3, S15934PBQ, 194059448.html, DGG6HXUFZ, VCZKKPORO, 184224630.html). (3) Decide clearly whether the asset is tradable; if not, provide a single Outlook line (Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence) and drop any Swing Trade lines; if tradable, add a Swing Trade line(s) with Entry/Stop/Target/ R/R/Invalidation/Trigger and 0–100 confidence. (4) quantify every assertion with concrete numbers from sources (e.g., 15% MFN tariff; 80% pass-through; $350m annual tariff cost; $4 per tire pass-through; 90-day pause; July 31 Federal Circuit; Citi 18.6% tariff average) rather than qualitative language, and cite these precisely. (5) reconcile conflicts by presenting a single base-case with two explicit alternate paths, each with distinct triggers and invalidation rules (e.g., if EU auto-relief timetable misses published dates, switch to Alt-2; if India Aug 27 tariff hits as scheduled, reinforce Upside/Downside balance). (6) clean up formatting and remove any non-compliant or extraneous lines (the current Neutral line and extraneous long prose) so the output matches the SECTION FOCUS exactly: four Movers, and one Outlook line if non-tradable. (7) tighten the causal chain from tariffs to margins to earnings to inflation with crisp channel mapping; ensure every numeric claim has a source citation and that all critical sources (RHFWI02JT; 2SJORBV6H; 9W8ZUIBDY; QRX2HD4X0; WLXM1819K; DGG6HXUFZ; AJTHKYXQ3; S15934PBQ; 194059448.html; VCZKKPORO; 184224630.html; RHXDOHQQX) are consistently represented and reconciled. (8) after revisions, verify the line economy labels, time windows, and watchlist items align with the exact catalyst timelines (e.g., July 31 Federal Circuit, 90-day pause renewal, UK DCTS 2026, CUSMA-origin rulings) and avoid any stray assertions beyond the sourced material.",
