  "content": "SEOUL, Aug. 12 (UPI) --North Korea conducted artillery firing drills to boost combat readiness, state-run media reported Tuesday, as the United States and South Korea prepare to kick off a large-scale joint military exercise.\n\nA firing practice contest of tactical artillery sub-units was held on Monday under a \"combat drill plan of the [Korean People's Army] General Staff for perfecting the capability to fight a war and battle readiness of the entire army,\" the official Korean Central News Agency reported.\n\nThe KCNA report said the participants hit and destroyed targets \"in the course of mastering rapid mobile and surprise operations and ... steadily increasing the efficiency and operation of the artillery weapon systems.\"\n\nThe drills \"served as an occasion to demonstrate the strong will of the army to thoroughly contain military gangsters in the land adjacent to the border,\" KCNA said.\n\nPak Jong Chon, vice chairman of the ruling party's Central Military Commission, oversaw the contest. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who usually supervises the military's artillery firing drills, did not attend.\n\nThe contest came a week before Seoul and Washington are scheduled to launch their summertime Ulchi Freedom Shield joint military exercise, set for Aug. 18-28. Pyongyang regularly denounces the allies' joint drills as rehearsals for an invasion.\n\nNorth Korea's defense chief on Monday condemned Ulchi Freedom Shield and warned of \"negative consequences.\"\n\nThe North will \"strictly exercise the sovereign right of the DPRK at the level of the right to self-defense in a case of any provocation going beyond the boundary line,\" Defense Minister No Kwang Choi said in a statement.\n\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea.\n\nThe allies have repeatedly stressed that the exercises are defensive in nature.\n\nOn Monday, a representative of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command said that No's statement was relatively restrained.\n\n\"If you actually look at North Korea's statement, it's a little bit tame compared to historical norms,\" the representative told reporters in a background briefing.\n\nThe administration of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has been making efforts to improve frayed relations with Pyongyang.\n\nLast week, the South's military removed loudspeakers that had been installed along the DMZ to blast anti-Pyongyang messages across the border. On Saturday, North Korea began removing its own speakers in some forward areas, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.\n\nHalf of Ulchi Freedom Shield's 44 planned field training exercises have been rescheduled to next month, with military officials citing a heatwave and flooding damage to training areas as the primary reasons. Local media have reported that the move was also made to help Seoul's bid to mend ties with the North.\n\nThis story was originally published August 12, 2025 at 5:05 AM.",

      "text": "SEOUL, Aug. 7 (UPI) -- The United States and South Korea will kick off a major joint military exercise this month, both countries announced Thursday, with a focus on deterring North Korea's growing threats amid unrequited diplomatic outreach from Seoul.\nThe annual Ulchi Freedom Shield exercise will take place Aug. 18-28 and will incorporate \"realistic threats, including lessons learned from recent conflicts ... to further strengthen the Alliance's readiness and capabilities through combined, joint, all-domain operations,\" the militaries said in a joint statement.\nThe exercise will include live field maneuvers, computer simulation-based command post exercises and related civil defense drills.\n\"This iteration of UFS 25 will be executed on a similar scale to the previous iteration,\" Col. Lee Sung-jun, spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a joint press briefing in Seoul on Thursday.\nSome 18,000 South Korean troops will take part, Lee said. U.S. Forces Korea did not disclose the number of participating troops.\nThe exercise comes as the administration of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung is attempting to improve frayed relations with Pyongyang, which frequently condemns the allies' joint drills as rehearsals for an invasion.\nCol. Lee said that roughly half of the 40 planned field training exercises will be rescheduled to next month, but dismissed any political motives behind the decision.\n\"The military has comprehensively assessed based on multiple factors, including ensuring training conditions due to the recent heat wave, as well as maintaining a balanced ROK-U.S. combined readiness posture ... and made the decision to reschedule certain training events to next month,\" Lee said.\n\"Any training events linked to the combined exercise scenario as well as [those] having any deployed assets or personnel to the Peninsula by the U.S. will proceed as planned,\" he added.\nNorth Korea, which has strengthened military ties with Russia and continues to develop its nuclear and missile programs, will be a focus of the Ulchi Freedom Shield exercise, U.S. Forces Korea spokesman Col. Ryan Donald said at the briefing.\n\"We'll work to deter and defeat the DPRK's various threats, such as their weapons of mass destruction,\" Donald said, using the official acronym for North Korea.\nThe training will draw on information from ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, he said, as well as the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.\n\"We take those lessons learned from the modern battlefield and incorporate that,\" Donald said. \"We are focused on assuring the alliance remains strategically sustainable, credibly deters aggression from the DPRK and addresses broader regional challenges.\"\nThe exercise will also address threats from terrorism, drones, GPS jamming and cyberattacks, both officials said. It will include a scenario on a North Korean missile launch but would not cover nuclear use by Pyongyang, Lee added.\nNorth Korea has not yet publicly commented on this year's exercise. Last week, Kim Yo Jong -- the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Yo Jong -- condemned Seoul's \"blind trust\" in its military alliance with Washington and rejected efforts by the Lee Jae Myung administration to improve relations.\nIn their joint statement released Thursday, the allies stressed that the exercise is \"defensive in nature.\"\nIn addition to U.S. and South Korean forces, personnel from other member countries of the United Nations Command will join the exercise, while the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will observe to monitor compliance with the Armistice Agreement.\nThe U.S.-led UNC plays a key role in maintaining and enforcing the armistice agreement that halted fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War, with duties that include controlling DMZ access and communicating with the North Korean military."

      "text": "SEOUL, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- South Korea completed removing loudspeakers that had been installed along the DMZ to blast anti-Pyongyang messages across the border, military officials said Wednesday.\nAround 20 speakers were completely dismantled by Tuesday afternoon, officials said. The military began the project on Monday, calling it a \"practical measure that will help ease tensions between the South and the North.\"\nIn June, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung ordered the suspension of the broadcasts, which included news, K-pop music, and information about democracy and life in South Korea.\nSeoul had resumed the Cold War-style propaganda campaign one year earlier in response to a series of provocations by North Korea that included floating thousands of trash-filled balloons across the border.\nRelated\nThe North countered by broadcasting bizarre noises such as metallic screeching and animal sounds, disturbing residents in areas near the DMZ. Pyongyang quieted its own speakers after the initial suspension but has not yet appeared to take corresponding action to remove them.\nAs of Tuesday, there were \"no movements by the North Korean military to dismantle their loudspeakers,\" Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Col. Lee Sung-jun said at a press briefing.\nPresident Lee has made an effort to improve inter-Korean relations since taking office in June. In addition to the loudspeaker suspension, his administration has also cracked down on activists floating balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.\nLast month, Seoul repatriated six North Koreans who drifted into southern waters on wooden boats and announced plans to return the remains of another North Korean national found near the maritime border.\nPyongyang did not respond to the repatriation plan by a deadline on Tuesday afternoon, South Korea's Unification Ministry said. Local government officials will conduct \"a respectful funeral in accordance with procedures for handling unclaimed bodies,\" the ministry said.\nNorth Korea has rebuffed Seoul's attempts at rapprochement so far.\nLast week, Kim Yo Jong -- the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- said Pyongyang had \"no interest\" in responding to efforts by the Lee administration to thaw relations, citing Seoul's \"blind trust\" in military ties with the United States.\nThe allies are scheduled to hold their annual large-scale Ulchi Freedom Shield joint military exercise this month. Pyongyang frequently condemns the joint drills as rehearsals for an invasion."
