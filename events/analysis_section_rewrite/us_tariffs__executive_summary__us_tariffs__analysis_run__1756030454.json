Actionable edits: (1) restructure as a concise house view with Base Case plus one bullish and one bearish path, each in one sentence, so the causal chain and decision logic are crystal clear; (2) tighten the first-principles chain: show how tariffs/subsidies and deregulation drive import costs, pass-through (60–70% near-term), inflation risk, margins, and capex re-optimizations, anchoring all links with the explicit numbers (e.g., 15% MFN on most EU goods, ~18.6% average tariff, 60–70% pass-through) drawn directly from RHFWI02JT, 12, 19; (3) sharpen catalysts/triggers with concrete milestones and data signals (EU autos relief timing; UK DCTS rollout milestones; USMCA/CUSMA origin uptake progress; DOE Group14/Sila battery-material builds) and define invalidation events (rapid tariff relief or escalation, material energy-market stress) to make path-dependency and probabilistic framing actionable; (4) ensure the Adyen example is tethered to a general mechanism (digital-payments resilience under policy shocks) rather than treated as a standalone proof point; (5) reconcile conflicts across sources (e.g., 9W8ZUIBDY vs. 2SJORBV6H on regulation/deregulation momentum) and explicitly state how the deregulation vs enforcement tension could reprice risk premia; (6) prune repetition and lock horizon to “structural, multi-year regime” with near-term read on pricing (3–6 months) clearly labeled, while keeping the watch list to 4–5 concrete items tied to the base path; (7) verify every substantive assertion cites an ID and avoid insertions beyond the provided material.",
