      "feedback": "Solid starting point, but upgrade with a true multi‑year regime framework and explicit catalysts/invalidation to satisfy the horizon focus. Tie your narrative to unambiguous anchors: a Fed‑anchored inflation regime (2% target with flexible average inflation targeting; Powell Jackson Hole remarks and the Fed’s five‑year framework review) and regime transitions defined by the path of inflation, unemployment, and the level of real policy rates vs neutral; state the regime thresholds (e.g., CPI deceleration sustained for 4–6 quarters and the futures curve pricing in sustained rate cuts). Build a two‑to‑three regime transition map and then a causal chain: policy stance shifts drive financial conditions, which lift risk appetite, which in turn prices in crypto and AI infra cycles. Quantify with concrete channels: ETH outperformance under regulatory tailwinds and ETF inflows; corporate treasury activity (Bitmine Immersion’s $45m ETH purchase); AI infra funding running ~$50b/quarter private credit and CMBS exposure up 30% to $15.6b on 20–30 year tenors (OBQMETU6O); in parallel, note the mixed micro signals in AI/healthcare names (e.g., Fortrea’s Q2 results and Regeneron’s cash flow strength) to avoid wholesale bubble talk (V9HASRVZA; OBQMETU6O; 5IMB47HCS). Specify base case versus risks: base case inflation gradually normalizes and policy begins to ease in the back half of 2025 with liquidity supporting re‑rating of growth assets (OGK8WLL69); risks include a sharp inflation rebound or policy misstep, AI cash‑flow disappointments triggering credit retrenchment (OBQMETU6O), and crypto‑regulatory shocks that temper the secular adoption trend (OGK8WLL69). For “what to watch,” define measurable triggers and bands (e.g., policy path implied by curves; private credit/CMBS flow inflection; ETH/BTC price corridors and ETF inflows) and reconciliation of bullish crypto narratives with cautionary AI‑credit signals. Tighten the write‑up by indexing every claim to IDs (OGK8WLL69, OBQMETU6O, V9HASRVZA, 5IMB47HCS) and present a crisp base case, clear risks, and a concrete watchlist rather than blended narrative.",
