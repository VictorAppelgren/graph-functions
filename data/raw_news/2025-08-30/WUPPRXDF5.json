  "content": "Here\u2019s a look back at what happened in the Chicago area on Aug. 30, according to the Tribune\u2019s archives.\n\nIs an important event missing from this date? Email us.\n\nHaving invented the reaper that would revolutionize agriculture, McCormick wanted to manufacture it near prospective customers, the farmers who were fanning out across the Midwest.\n\n1933: George Halas returned to coaching the Chicago Bears, replacing Ralph Jones. Jones ran the Bears for three seasons \u2014 posting a 24-10-7 record \u2014 and won a title in 1932. He was the father of the T-formation, an innovator credited with being the first coach to position the quarterback under center.\n\nHalas had stepped away from the team in late 1929, but a stock market collapse saw him resume coaching duties in an effort to save on salary. Halas left the Bears again to return to the U.S. Navy during World War II.\n\n1981: Arlington Park hosted the world\u2019s first million dollar race, The Arlington Million. The result of the race was immortalized in bronze at the top of the paddock, where the \u201cAgainst All Odds\u201d statue of jockey Bill Shoemaker riding John Henry to a thrilling come-from-behind victory over 40-1 long shot The Bart.\n\n2015: Chicago Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta threw his first no-hitter (Arrieta\u2019s second followed in 2016) and the team\u2019s first in seven years.\n\nThe Cubs beat the Dodgers 2-0 at Dodger Stadium and wore onesies on their flight back to Chicago.\n\n2017: Hedge fund billionaire and former Chicago resident Ken Griffin gave $16.5 million to the Field Museum, which paid for the new cast of a titanosaur \u2014 nicknamed M\u00e1ximo \u2014 in the central hall and the hall\u2019s makeover. (Sue the T. rex was bumped upstairs.) The gift also established the Griffin Dinosaur Experience at the museum. In 2016, Griffin also gave the Field $5.5 million toward a new traveling dinosaur exhibit and educational efforts.\n\n\u201cEvolving Planet\u201d opened in 2006, also thanks to a donation by Griffin. The $17 million permanent exhibit used video, interactive displays, paintings and lots and lots of fossils to chronicle the evolution of life on Earth over 4 billion years.\n\nSubscribe to the free Vintage Chicago Tribune newsletter, join our Chicagoland history Facebook group, stay current with Today in Chicago History and follow us on Instagram for more from Chicago\u2019s past.\n\nHave an idea for Vintage Chicago Tribune?

      "text": "Field Museum Announces $5.5 Million Gift from Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund\nPhotographer(s): M. Northey (c) None (all rights reserved)\nFor Immediate Release:\nJuly 6, 2016 PR Contact\n312.665.7100\nmedia@fieldmuseum.org\nField Museum Announces $5.5 Million Gift from Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund\nContribution to Support New Dinosaur Exhibition and Education in Chicago and Around the World\nThe Field Museum is honored to announce a gift of $5.5 million from the Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund, a fund created by the Founder and CEO of Citadel. The contribution will fund a new traveling exhibition, Antarctic Dinosaurs, and robust educational programming that will provide students, educators and the public with further access to the Museum\u2019s renowned learning experiences.\n\u201cWe are delighted by Ken\u2019s generous investment,\u201d said Richard Lariviere, Ph.D. President and CEO of The Field Museum. \u201cOver the past fifteen years, Ken has been an invaluable partner in our mission to engage and educate the public, giving more than $10.5 million to the Museum.\u201d\nSixteen years ago, The Field Museum set a new standard in dinosaur learning experiences with the debut of SUE, the largest and most complete T. rex ever found. In 2006, Griffin helped the Museum raise the bar again with the opening of the Griffin Halls of Evolving Planet, an interactive exhibit which invites visitors to learn about charismatic dinosaurs within the larger themes of evolution and environmental change. Griffin\u2019s support of Antarctic Dinosaurs and new educational programming is an extension of previous investments dedicated to sharing the Field\u2019s dinosaur collection and learning experiences with Chicago and the world.\nCurated by Field Museum paleontologist Dr. Pete Makovicky, Antarctic Dinosaurs will open at The Field Museum in summer 2018 and then embark on a five-year tour, engaging visitors at major museums across North America. Today, Antarctica is a forbidding landscape of rock and ice, but 200 million years ago it was wooded and lush, and part of the Pangaea supercontinent where dinosaurs thrived. The exhibition will showcase newly discovered dinosaur species alongside some of the first scientific specimens collected in Antarctica at the turn of the 20th century. Antarctic Dinosaurs will bring to life the exhilarating hunt for never-before seen fossils, while shedding new light on dinosaur evolution and the Earth\u2019s climate and geology.\nIn addition to bringing Antarctic Dinosaurs to a global audience, the Charitable Fund\u2019s gift will enable the Field to introduce new dinosaur educational programming, including a multimedia educator toolkit and an immersive educational video game. The dynamic suite of resources will invite the public to go back in time through animated, digital 3D objects and specimens.\n\u201cWe are incredibly fortunate to have a world-class institution like The Field Museum in Chicago,\u201d said Griffin. \u201cThis important institution provides visitors from around the world with unparalleled opportunities to experience and learn about our planet and its history.\u201d\nThe Field Museum is one of the world\u2019s premier natural history institutions. Its staff maintains an irreplaceable collection of more than 30 million artifacts and specimens, which are made available to scientists around the globe. Additionally, the Museum maintains more than 350,000 square feet of permanent exhibitions. Since 2000, The Field has created 15 critically acclaimed traveling exhibitions, engaging more than 12 million people worldwide.\n###"
