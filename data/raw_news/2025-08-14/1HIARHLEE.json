  "title": "Examining claim violent crime in Washington, DC, is at 30-year low",
  "description": "Critics have expressed skepticism at data coming from the Metropolitan Police Department of the U.S. capital. Snopes looked at FBI data.",
  "content": "The violent crime rate in Washington, D.C., reached a 30-year low in 2024.\n\nLooking at total numbers of violent crimes since at least 1991 reported by D.C. police, Snopes found the 2024 number was at its lowest since not only 1995, but at least 1991. (The city has not provided a crime rate per 100,000 people for 2024.) Based on FBI numbers, Snopes found that the violent crime rate for the city had reached its lowest level since 1966.\n\nIn August 2025, after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the law enforcement takeover of Washington, D.C., by the National Guard, citing \"out of control\" crime in the nation's capital, a claim began to spread that violent crime in the city was in fact at a 30-year low.\n\nFor example, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser's account posted this statistic on X (archived), adding that D.C. was a \"beautiful city\":\n\nAs of this writing, the post had more than 2 million views and 23,000 likes. The claim circulated widely on X, including in a post (archived) by former U.S. Under Secretary of State Richard Stengel, who added that the capital wasn't even among the 10 most dangerous cities in the country. Facebook users also shared the claim.\n\nThe claim stemmed from a Jan. 3, 2025, announcement by the U.S. attorney's office for the District of Columbia, based on 2024 data from the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), the city's law enforcement agency. The announcement referred to total violent crime in the city, not adjusted for population.\n\nDigging into annual reports on the MPD website, Snopes found data going back to 1991 and compiled it into a chart, looking specifically at total numbers for violent crime as well as the crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants. We found that indeed, in absolute terms, the number of violent crimes had dropped to its lowest point not just since 1995, but since at least 1991. The violent crime rate, however, told a slightly different story, as it showed an uptick in 2023 after a historic low in 2022 (authorities had not shared a violent crime rate for 2024; Snopes contacted the U.S. attorney's office and will update this report should it respond):\n\nBoth the D.C. police and the FBI \u2014 which compiles crime statistics from agencies across the country to track national trends \u2014 include four types of crime under the umbrella term of \"violent crime,\" though they define some of the subcategories differently. Overall, they both include homicides, rapes, robberies and certain assaults; in the last subcategory, for example, the FBI includes all types of aggravated assaults, while according to its annual reports starting some time between 2005 and 2007, the MPD included only assaults committed with a dangerous weapon, which at least one analyst suggested may overestimate how much overall numbers for violent crime fell.\n\nOther critics expressed skepticism (archived) about recent MPD numbers due to reports that one department commander had been placed under investigation in July 2025 for allegedly downgrading reported violent crimes into lesser crimes in an effort to deflate the city's violent crime numbers.\n\nThough it was true that MPD data showed total violent crime at a 30-year low in Washington, Snopes also looked at the FBI's numbers because of the misgivings about the D.C. agency's data.\n\nIn August 2025, the FBI released a report that showed national crime rates overall had dropped in 2024 from the previous year, revealing that the trend in Washington was not unique. Violent crime, in particular, dropped by 4.5% from 2023 to 2024. It also had fallen by 5.5% from 2020 and 0.7% from 2015. This was based on data reported by nearly 17,000 agencies.\n\nThe absolute numbers showed that violent crime in the capital was at a level not seen since 2018 (note that not all violent crime gets reported). Before the pandemic, violent crime in the city was trending down (we did not take into account the gaps in the data in 2021 and 2022 as local law enforcement agencies transitioned from one reporting system to another):\n\nHowever, a more revealing indicator is the violent crime rate, which accounts for the size of the population. Washington's population dropped from roughly 800,000 in the mid-1960s to a low of 519,000 in 1999, then rebounded to 702,250 in 2024, according to the Saint Louis Federal Reserve based on U.S. Census data. Taking into account these variations, FBI data revealed that violent crime in D.C. was not only at a 30-year low, but at a low not seen since 1966 (as noted above, we did not take into account the gaps in the data in 2021 and 2022).\n\nSnopes used the FBI Crime Data Explorer to examine violent crime numbers from 1960 and 1995:\n\nIn other words, without relying solely on MPD data, the numbers reveal that the city's violent crime rate has been dropping since 1993 and reached a low in 2024 not seen in nearly six decades.\n\n\"FBI Releases 2024 Quarterly Crime Report and Use-of-Force Data Update | Federal Bureau of Investigation.\" Federal Bureau of Investigation, Aug. 2025, www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2024-quarterly-crime-report-and-use-of-force-data-update.

The leave came approximately one week after he filed an equal employment opportunity complaint against Executive Assistant Chief Andre Wright, according to multiple law enforcement sources.\n| POLICE1 NEW RESOURCE: How to fund drone as first responder programs\nFive sources familiar with the matter told News4 that Pulliam is being investigated for questionable changes to reported crime data. Pulliam has denied the allegations.\nThe Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which represents D.C. officers, has raised concerns about what it says is a broader practice of manipulating crime classifications to show declines in violent crime. FOP Chairman Gregg Pemberton said officers are frequently instructed by supervisors to downgrade serious felony reports to lesser offenses.\nThe union claims the practice is being directed by the MPD command staff in an effort to keep reported crime figures low.\nAccording to MPD data reviewed Monday, violent crime in D.C. was reported as down 28% compared to the same time last year. By Thursday, the figure was listed at 25%, with overall crime down 8%.\nPemberton called the numbers misleading.\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way crime could be down 28%. Last year they suggested that it went down 34%,\u201d he said.\nThe investigation into Pulliam follows a separate incident involving his wife, Capt.

      "text": "Assessing DC's Violent Crime Trends\nMurder is plunging in DC but what about overall violent crime?\nTo paraphrase Bart Simpson, Washington DC\u2019s violent crime data and trends make it a land of many contrasts. As such, the theme of this post on DC\u2019s violent crime trends is that multiple things are true.\nDC\u2019s publicly available crime data is mostly good with the city publishing some innovative datasets. DC has incident-level crime data available going back almost 15 years. They publish monthly staffing reports, a carjacking dashboard, clearances, arrests, ShotSpotter, and much more. But the agency's publicly available data may be overstating the degree that violent crime is declining right now.\nReviewing the agency\u2019s data clearly shows the city\u2019s trends:\nMurder has consistently fallen since peaking in late 2023 and is tracking the city\u2019s pre-COVID trend so far in 2025.\nCarjackings in DC had an enormous surge in 2023 but have fallen consistently since then to levels consistent with the start of the pandemic (and are still falling). Yet carjackings are more frequent now than they were before COVID.\nMeasuring DC\u2019s overall violent crime trend is a bit more complicated. Violent crime in DC is down a huge amount from where it was in the early 1990s and down a good bit from where it was a decade ago. Violent crime in DC fell in 2024 after increasing in 2023, that much is clear from DC\u2019s reporting to the FBI. The exact picture for 2025 is a bit murkier though violent crime is likely falling this year. DC\u2019s open data is likely overstating the degree of the city\u2019s decline in violent crime right now though.\nLet\u2019s start with murder.\nWashington DC recorded 482 murders in 1991 placing the city\u2019s murder rate as the highest in the United States. That fell to an astoundingly low 88 murders in 2012 but has picked up in the last 10 years following trends seen in many US cities.\nMurders in DC peaked in 2023, began falling in 2024, and have been steadily falling through July 2025. There were 96 murders through July 2025 in DC, down 11 percent relative to the same timeframe in 2024, down 34 percent relative to the first 7 months of 2023, and exactly the same number as was reported through July 2019.\nNext, carjackings.\nDC has an excellent carjackings dashboard which clearly shows the city\u2019s trends. Carjackings increased in 2020 and then nearly doubled in 2023 before peaking and firmly declining since the start of 2024. Carjackings are still reported more frequently now than they were before COVID, but there has been a consistent drop for more than 18 months. The 16 carjackings reported in DC in July 2025 were the fewest reported in a month since May 2020 \u2014 before the surge \u2014 and represented an 87 percent drop from July 2023\u2019s total.\nThe available data suggests that carjackings tend to be disproportionately committed by juveniles. Less than 8 percent of Washington, DC arrests in 2024 were juveniles per MPDC data, but more than half of carjacking arrests involve a juvenile. So it\u2019s also noteworthy the degree to which juvenile arrests for carjackings have fallen, at least through 2024 (2025 arrest data isn\u2019t available yet).\nMurder\u2019s falling, carjacking\u2019s falling, but what about DC\u2019s overall violent crime trend?\nThe bottom line is that violent crime in DC is currently declining and the city\u2019s reported violent crime rate is more or less as low now as it has been since the 1960s (Standard disclaimer that not all crimes are reported to police). The city\u2019s official violent crime rate in 2024 was the second lowest that has been reported since 1966.\nAt the same time, the publicly available data from MPDC appears to be overstating the degree of the decline in 2025. If you go by DC\u2019s publicly available data, you'll see that violent crime is down 26 percent as of early August compared to the same timeframe in 2024.\nBut, as Lee Corso might say, \u201cnot so fast, my friend.\u201d\nIf you look closely, you might see something unexpected in the above table from MPDC\u2019s website. The city publishes crime categories loosely based around Uniform Crime Report Part I offense types, but not exactly. As explained on DC\u2019s website, \u201cThese numbers are based on DC Code Offense definitions and do NOT reflect Part I crime totals\u2026\u201d\nSo instead of publishing data on aggravated assaults, we get assaults with a deadly weapon. Instead of data on rapes, we get sex abuse offenses. That\u2019s not inherently problematic, but comparing what is being published by DC to the numbers being reported to the FBI suggests that the department\u2019s website is overstating the decline in violent crime over the last two years. Violent crime is still declining, but probably not as much as is being reported.\nDC reported 1,026 aggravated assaults with a dangerous weapon in 2024 per MPDC\u2019s website, but they reported 3,004 aggravated assaults to the FBI. The growing discrepancy between data reported to the FBI and the publicly available website can be seen in the below graph comparing aggravated assaults reported to the FBI to DC\u2019s publicly available data rolling over 12 months.\nDC reported a 7 percent increase in aggravated assaults in 2024 (which was offset in the violent crime count by large drops in robberies, rapes, and murder) but MPDC\u2019s public data showed a 27 percent drop in assaults with a dangerous weapon. This contrasts sharply with 2020 when DC reported a 3.6 percent increase in assaults with a dangerous weapon compared to a 2.1 percent increase in aggravated assaults.\nMPDC\u2019s public data and the data reported to the FBI mostly agreed about 2023 (+39 percent increase in violent crime vs + 41 percent respectively). The data for 2024 (and most likely) 2025 is more problematic though given just how sharply the decline in MPDC\u2019s public data differs from the decline reported by DC to the FBI via the Crime Data Explorer (CDE). Note that in the below chart that there\u2019s no data from the FBI in 2021 and 2022 because of the NIBRS transition.\nAs you can see, it\u2019s not unusual for MPDC\u2019s publicly available data to suggest a larger drop in violent crime than is reported to the FBI (probably due to the former measuring incidents vs the latter measuring victims), but the percent changes are usually reasonably close. For 2024, however, the FBI\u2019s data shows a 9 percent drop while MPDC\u2019s public data shows a 35 percent drop.\nWe don\u2019t have 2025 data from the FBI to know for sure that the department\u2019s 26 percent decline from 2024 is an overstatement, but I\u2019d be very surprised if it was accurate.\nThere\u2019s still tons of evidence pointing to declining violent crime in DC in 2025, especially gun violence.\nWe trust the MPDC\u2019s murder and carjacking figures which both show sizable declines in 2025 \u2014 especially compared to 2023. There is also separate data from ShotSpotter showing a 16 percent drop in alerts through the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024 and a 45 percent drop relative to the first half of 2023.\nI\u2019m not sure why the discrepancy between MPDC\u2019s public data and what\u2019s being reported to the FBI has grown, but the enormous quantity and quality of open data provided by MPDC points strongly towards a data reporting issue rather than an intentional misrepresentation (though if you want to take the preceding paragraphs in bad faith and immediately jump to that conclusion, I guess that\u2019s your prerogative.)\nSo while we don\u2019t really confidently know exactly how much violent crime is falling in DC in 2025 from the public data, the drops in murder, and robbery this year \u2014 which conform much closer to what has been reported to the FBI \u2014 suggest violent crime is indeed dropping. Even if we can\u2019t say for certain from the publicly available data how far it\u2019s falling, there\u2019s no reason to suspect the overall trend being reported isn\u2019t correct.\nOne could rightly argue that 96 murders and 188 carjackings so far this year is still far too many heinous tragedies. But one must be able to differentiate between a crime\u2019s level leaving room for improvement while also acknowledging a strong downward trends in the crimes with the highest cost to society in the nation\u2019s capital.\nFrom NBC News in Washington July 18, 2025:\nThe union claims police supervisors in the department manipulate crime data to make it appear violent crime has fallen considerably compared to last year.\n\u201cWhen our members respond to the scene of a felony offense where there is a victim reporting that a felony occurred, inevitably there will be a lieutenant or a captain that will show up on that scene and direct those members to take a report for a lesser offense,\u201d Fraternal Order of Police Chairman Gregg Pemberton said. \u201cSo, instead of taking a report for a shooting or a stabbing or a carjacking, they will order that officer to take a report for a theft or an injured person to the hospital or a felony assault, which is not the same type of classification.\u201d\nThe union has been gathering evidence for some time now by looking at reports and talking with officers all over the city, Pemberton said.\nThank you for this incredibly insightful post and for exploring how categorization can result in differing interpretations of the same data. It is thus possible for experts to disagree despite sharing data sets.\nI was interested in the contrast between incidents/victims counts. I can see how both are useful units of measurement, though they could, perhaps, produce different counts. One could imagine several victims in a single incident (for example) or am I misreading this difference?\nThe other interesting point, for me, is the effect that categorizing can have on the conclusions one derives from data sets."

      "text": "Related Content\nPress Release\nPress Release\nWASHINGTON - Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and announced by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves. A breakdown of the data is available here.\nIn addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\n\u201cThe strategy this Office began to employ shortly after I came into this role has been to work with our law enforcement partners to focus on the drivers of violence - those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Graves. \u201cIt takes time to develop these investigations and prosecutions, but this is the fruit of that labor - a reduction in the violent crime - that D.C. is now seeing.\u201d\nA central component of this strategy has been targeting those crews who have preyed upon certain neighborhoods in our community, often operating drug trafficking networks in these neighborhoods. These proactive investigations and prosecutions have yielded immediate reductions in violence that have had lasting impact. For instance, an MPD analysis of crime trends in the area around MLK Mellon before and after a crew operating a drug market in that area was arrested revealed that there was a 66% reduction in violent crime in the area when comparing the six months prior to the arrests to the six months after the arrests. Even two years after these arrests, there was a 56% reduction in the number of homicides that occurred after the arrests when compared to the two years before.\nAnother key component of this proactive approach was implementing in April 2022, Project Safe Neighborhood - a daily review by the Office and our law enforcement partners of every firearms arrest in the District to determine, using objective criteria about the person arrested and the firearm recovered, whether the case should be charged in U.S. District Court or D.C. Superior Court. Since April 2022, the Office has accepted for prosecution in U.S. District Court more than 150 gun offenders under this initiative.\nFinally, the Office has continued to do all that it can to hold accountable those who commit violent crimes with firearms and those who illegally possess firearms. And the Office has committed to provide on a quarterly basis data related to these efforts - data that can be found here. This data reflects that in the first half of 2024, the Office was able to charge at the time of arrest more than 90% of arrests for violent crimes committed with guns and nearly 70% of gun possession arrests. The Office continues to investigate many of these arrests even if it does not charge on the day of arrest. Also in the first half of 2024, the Office obtained convictions in approximately 75% of these gun-related cases.\nThese numbers related to firearms offenses are critical and stand in stark contrast to the overall day-of-arrest charging rate for every arrest in the District of Columbia, which is a significantly less informative metric. The vast majority of arrests in the District of Columbia are for misdemeanor offenses that are often non-violent in nature. For such offenses, the Office has had a longstanding practice of giving great weight to victims\u2019 wishes about whether they want charges brought. For a variety of reasons, a substantial number of victims do not want criminal charges brought for these relatively minor offenses.\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Office expanded into a new section the number of prosecutors devoted to reviewing arrests and examining body-worn camera (BWC) footage - Fiscal Year 2018 was the first Fiscal Year where BWC had been fully deployed for the entire year - to determine whether the BWC footage reflected issues that would later require the Office to dismiss a prosecution or if there were otherwise fatal flaws with the case. This section is called the Early Case Assessment Section (ECAS). The combination of BWC footage and ECAS\u2019s early detection of arrests that, if charged, would later need to be dismissed led to relatively modest decreases in cases charged at the time of arrest in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.\nThe overall day-of-arrest charging rate dropped dramatically in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022, as the global pandemic brought the criminal justice system to a halt and the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences lost its accreditation in 2021.\nOur Office, along with our local partners, worked to overcome these challenges and the overall day-of-arrest charging rate in Fiscal Year 2024 of 57% is virtually identical to the 54% day-of-arrest charging rate that the Office reported in Fiscal Year 2019 after forming ECAS. More significantly, though, the Office dismissed far fewer of the cases it charged in Fiscal Year 2024 than it did in Fiscal Year 2018, so more arrests resulted in a prosecutorial outcome in Fiscal Year 2024 than in Fiscal Year 2018. For felonies, in particular, the percentage of cases with a prosecutorial outcome rose from 66% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 85% in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThere is value in addressing the issues, such as the lack of drug testing, that were preventing our Office from charging, at the time-of-arrest, non-violent misdemeanor offenses. While charging more non-violent offenses can benefit the community and offenders are often sentenced to periods of probation with services that hopefully aid in rehabilitation, these cases typically do not identify and remove violent offenders from the community. As is universally recognized, targeting the relatively limited number of individuals responsible for driving gun violence is the most impactful thing that prosecutors can do to contribute to the kinds of sharp declines in violent crime the District saw in 2024. To that end, multiple proactive investigations are already underway that should further reduce violent crime in 2025.\n##\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube\nOr at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc"

However, there are concerns regarding the accuracy of these statistics, as allegations have emerged that police commanders may have manipulated crime data to present a more favorable picture of crime trends. Despite the reported decline, discrepancies between local and FBI data suggest that the actual decrease in violent crime may not be as significant as indicated by the MPD's public reports.",
