  "title": "Is 2025 The Year Without A Song Of The Summer? \u2018Ordinary\u2019 Tops Charts As New Tracks Lag",
  "description": "\u201cOrdinary,\u201d the chart-topping ballad by Alex Warren, is clearly the biggest song of the summer on the charts, but critics have noted few big breakout hits compared to last summer.",
  "content": "\u201cOrdinary\u201d was the most-streamed song this summer on Spotify, the streaming service said Wednesday, and it also ranks No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Songs of the Summer chart, which is updated weekly based on the summer\u2019s best-performing songs considering sales, streaming and radio data. But music critics have noted few new songs made a dent in the charts this summer: Of the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s Songs of the Summer chart, only five were released this year as some 2024 smashes, like Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cDie with a Smile\u201d and Kendrick Lamar and SZA\u2019s \u201cLuther,\u201d continue to dominate. This summer\u2019s hits also seem to lack the upbeat energy of 2024\u2019s summer smashes like Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEspresso\u201d or Shaboozey\u2019s \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d\u2014behind \u201cOrdinary,\u201d the next three songs on Billboard\u2019s summer chart are all Morgan Wallen country ballads. Critics\u2019 lists declaring this year\u2019s songs of the summer have largely skipped the chart-toppers, as lists from both the New York Times and the Guardian have almost zero overlap with either Spotify\u2019s picks or the Billboard chart.\n\nWhy Are Critics Saying There May Not Be A Song Of The Summer?\n\nCritics have lamented the lack of breakout hits this year. On an episode of Slate\u2019s Culture Gabfest podcast, Slate writer and music critic Chris Molanphy called the options for this year\u2019s song of the summer \u201chazy\u201d and \u201cboring,\u201d calling 2024 a much better summer for hit songs. \u201cThere are two problems with this year\u2019s song of summer competition,\u201d Molanphy said, stating one is \u201csome of the songs that were competing last year are still on the damn chart.\u201d The other problem, Molanphy said, is that \u201cthere is actually a very clear victor for song of the summer, it\u2019s just kind of a snooze of a song,\u201d referring to \u201cOrdinary.\u201d NPR music writer Stephen Thompson wrote earlier this month \u201cOrdinary\u201d is the song of the summer \u201cbased on raw chart numbers, but it's hardly a windows-down beach banger like, say, \u2018Espresso.\u2019\u201d Thompson said many of this year\u2019s summer song contenders feel \u201cso stale,\u201d blaming streaming algorithms and radio airplay for making hit songs stick around the top of the charts for \u201cwhat feels like an eternity,\u201d referring to hits like \u201cDie With a Smile\" and \u201cLuther.\u201d The Guardian music writer Sam Wolfson suggested there is no song of the summer this year, noting new releases from artists like Justin Bieber, The Weeknd and Miley Cyrus didn\u2019t produce any smash hits. Wolfson noted Carpenter\u2019s 2025 song \u201cManchild,\u201d which hit No. 1 this summer, couldn\u2019t recreate the huge success of her 2024 smash hits \u201cEspresso\u201d and \u201cPlease Please Please.\u201d\n\nWhat Have Critics Picked As The Song Of The Summer?\n\nWhile acknowledging there \u201cmight not be a clear \u2018Espresso\u2019 this season,\u201d The Guardian journalists picked songs including PinkPantheress\u2019s TikTok-viral song \u201cIllegal,\u201d Haim\u2019s \u201cRelationships\u201d and Addison Rae\u2019s \u201cHeadphones On\u201d as deserving of the song of the summer title. The New York Times consulted 10 \u201ctastemakers,\u201d ranging from actor Jeff Goldblum to New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, to compile a songs of the summer list. The Times list, including picks ranging from Bieber\u2019s \u201cDaisies\u201d to Laufey\u2019s \u201cLover Girl,\u201d didn\u2019t overlap at all with the top summer songs according to the Billboard charts. British music publication NME also selected songs from Haim and PinkPantheress alongside \u201cGnarly\u201d by the buzzy pop group Katseye and \u201cCatch These Fists\u201d by the Grammy-winning group Wet Leg.\n\nAround 940 million. That\u2019s how many streams Warren\u2019s \u201cOrdinary\u201d has on Spotify.\n\nLast year, all but one of the top 10 songs on Billboard\u2019s 2024 Songs of the Summer chart were released that year, including hits like Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEspresso,\u201d Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us\u201d and Morgan Wallen and Post Malone\u2019s \u201cI Had Some Help.\u201d In 2025, only half of the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s Songs of the Summer chart were actually released this year.\n\nDo we have a song of the summer this year?

      "text": "Last year there were contenders aplenty for the title song of the summer \u2013 and then some. There was the entirety of Charli XCX\u2019s \u2018Brat\u2019 album, the rapid rise of Chappell Roan with \u2018Good Luck, Babe!\u2019, Shaboozey\u2019s historic chart run with \u2018A Bar Song (Tipsy)\u2019 and a shot of \u2018Espresso\u2019 from Sabrina Carpenter \u2013 and these are just the obvious ones. Needless to say, we were spoiled for choice in 2024.\n2025, however, hasn\u2019t necessarily played out in the same way. While there are songs that have shown some potential to claim the crown, none has emerged as a clear frontrunner just yet. As summer looms, join NME as our staff weigh in on the best soundtrack for this season in the sun.\nZiwei Puah, Associate Commissioning Editor (Music)\n1T1, Th\u00e9omaa \u2013 \u2018Bouwey\u2019\nBouyon (pronounced boo-your) is the unruly cousin of soca \u2013 a riotous, pulse-racing subgenre born in Dominica, the small yet mighty Caribbean powerhouse where French-based creole (Kw\u00e9y\u00f2l) flows through the streets. Its carnival chaos didn\u2019t stay put \u2013 it voyaged and landed in Black Francophone scenes, sparking up in France\u2019s rap game with artists like 1T1 and Th\u00e9omaa.\nTheir track \u2018Bouw\u00e9y\u2019 immortalises the rum-soaked, waistline-shackling frenzy of bacchanals, loaded with crashing cymbals, taunting pianos, whirling sirens and piercing organs. A slick blend of French-Creole and English, it\u2019s a borderless anthem proving bouyon is more than a sound \u2013 it\u2019s the soundtrack of the summer.\nKyann-Sian Williams, Junior Staff Writer\nAleksiah \u2013 \u2018The Hit\u2019\nSummer romances rarely turn out the way we hope \u2013 but on her latest single, \u2018The Hit\u2019, Australian singer Aleksiah makes the passionate delirium of a misguided love affair sound like it might just be worth all the heartache and turmoil.\nOver sparkling synths and hazy production, the budding popstar likens a bittersweet fling to the artificial high of a drug: \u201cIt\u2019s the hit that gets me through the night / Leaves me thinkin\u2019 that I\u2019m fine / In the mornin\u2019 I\u2019ll be all yours.\u201d\nBut the real magic hits when Aleksiah strips down the instrumental during the first half of the final chorus, leaving just her vulnerable voice and sparse soft synths \u2013 before it all rushes back in a euphoric, heart-pounding rush. Fleeting (and potentially toxic) summer love has never sounded so good.\nZiwei Puah, Associate Commissioning Editor (Music)\nFontaines D.C. \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s Amazing To Be Young\u2019\nJust as \u2018Brat\u2019 summer lingers, that neon green glow of \u2018Romance\u2019 bleeds into another year courtesy of Fontaines D.C.\u2019s recent bumper edition of that album, which gave us this gem. Inspired by Carlos O\u2019Connell\u2019s newborn child, the song sighs with a pure and innocent euphoria and optimism. You\u2019re young, savour these times. With just a handful of chances to see Dublin\u2019s finest at some mega outdoor gigs and festival spots in the months ahead, grab a can, grab your mates, celebrate life, and know everything\u2019s (probably) gonna be alright.\nAndrew Trendell, News Editor\nHaim \u2013 \u2018Relationships\u2019\nSeven years in the works and five years after their last LP, \u2018Relationships\u2019 marked the long-awaited comeback from Haim and the breezy first preview of their new album \u2018I Quit\u2019. Exuding \u201800s R&B vibes and ethereal vocals from Danielle, this song from the Los Angeles sister trio is the ultimate anthem for those embracing a single girl summer, and one that hits the spot whether you\u2019re living your best life at a festival or simply enjoying not being stuck in a situationship. Top of the playlist, please!\nLiberty Dunworth, Staff Writer\nKatseye \u2013 \u2018Gnarly\u2019\nWhen Katseye first dropped the chaotic juggernaut that is \u2018Gnarly\u2019 in April, it was a whiplash-inducing U-turn from the cutesy sounds of their previous viral hit \u2018Touch\u2019. But gradually, what once seemed bonkers has become the most addictive, maximalist banger of the summer.\nIt\u2019s the ultimate hype song for any situation \u2013 driving to a festival with your mates, getting ready for a big night out, or just strutting under the sun to do your groceries. It\u2019s a reminder that to be cringe is to be free (we\u2019ll admit lines like \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me, you\u2019re gnarly / I\u2019m not\u201d could do with some work) and that calling yourself a \u201chottie, hottie / Like a bag of Takis\u201d is an instant confidence and mood booster. You\u2019ll either love it or you\u2019ll hate it, but that\u2019s all part of \u2018Gnarly\u2019\u2019s charm.\nRhian Daly, Music Editor\nPinkPantheress \u2013 \u2018Tonight\u2019\nHonestly, you could soundtrack your whole summer with the entirety of PinkPantheress\u2019 \u2018Fancy That\u2019 \u2013 from the chirpy self-introduction of \u2018Illegal\u2019 to the transatlantic dalliances of \u2018Stateside\u2019, this bright, bouncy project feels perfect for the season.\nBut there\u2019s a special something about the lead single \u2018Tonight\u2019, which is as light and addictive as candy floss. Pink nails the frisson of flirtation with effortless quotables: \u201cYou want sex with me? (Uh huh) Come talk to me!\u201d and \u201cYou can ruin my makeup / Yes, it\u2019s fine / You could even ruin my life.\u201d With lines like these, even the most introverted among us can summon the casual cheek for a short-lived summer fling.\nKaren Gwee, Managing Editor (Music)\nTurnstile \u2013 \u2018Never Enough\u2019\nThere\u2019s something in the dreamy synths and wistful lyrics of this contemplative post-hardcore gem that makes you think of warm, hazy summer evenings spent lounging in the park. It drifts along, like a balloon on a light breeze, until caught in the sudden gust of wind that is guitarist Pat McCrory\u2019s thunderous riff-making, which kickstarts the euphoric chorus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never enough/Never enough,\u201d sings frontman Brendan Yates \u2013 and though he\u2019s talking about the emotional exhaustion of chasing fulfillment in a world that constantly demands more, it could just as easily be a rant about how those short, sunny months in the middle of the year always pass too quickly.\nAlex Flood, Managing Editor (Entertainment & Partnerships)\nWet Leg \u2013 \u2018Catch These Fists\u2019\nYou may have first gotten to know Wet Leg as a quirky, deadpan duo from the Isle of Wight \u2013 but you\u2019ll find now they\u2019re spikier, stand-on-business and no longer taking any shit.\nAn anthem of frustration and confrontation, \u2018Catch These Fists\u2019 sees Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers speak for women everywhere: \u201cI just threw up in my mouth when he just tried to ask me out / Yeah, don\u2019t approach me, I just wanna dance with my friends / I know all too well just what you\u2019re like / I don\u2019t want your love, I just wanna fight.\u201d\nBubbling basslines, scratchy guitar riffs and pummelling drum fills help make their chaos-driven message crystal clear: leave the girls alone. This summer, choose fun. Choose a night out with your friends. And if push comes to shove, choose violence.\nSurej Singh, Senior Staff Writer"

      "text": "A spectre is haunting America \u2013 the spectre of Shaboozey.\nDespite it coming out in April 2024, Shaboozey\u2019s huge hit A Bar Song (Tipsy) is still, billions of streams later, at No 5 on this week\u2019s Billboard chart. Its country-tinged refrain of \u201ceverybody at the bar gettin\u2019 tipsy,\u201d an interpolation from J-Kwon 2004 hit Tipsy, has stuck around well past closing time.\nIt\u2019s not the only one. It\u2019s joined in this week\u2019s Billboard Top 10 (which combines streaming and radio airplay data in the US from a given week) by Teddy Swims\u2019s Lose Control, which was released in June 2023; Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga\u2019s Die With A Smile, which was released in August 2024; and Luther by Kendrick Lamar and SZA, which came out in November 2024.\nChart analysts say that 2025 has produced the fewest new hit songs in US history. The mid-year report from Luminate, the company that produces the data for the Billboard charts, shows that of the top 10 most listened to songs so far this year in the US, only one was released in 2025: Ordinary by Alex Warren. All the others are tracks from 2024 and 2023 \u2013 No 1 is Luther.\nAs a result it kind of feels like this year\u2019s song of the summer is sort of \u2026 nothing. Or just the same as last year\u2019s? Despite a slew of recent releases from artists Lorde, Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, Miley Cyrus and Lil Wayne, nothing is really crossing the threshold of hit song.\nObviously what makes a summer hit is a somewhat vibes-based determination that is hard to put an exact number on, but in the industry getting close to a billion global streams means you have had an unavoidably massive track - and only Ordinary, along with the two Bad Bunny songs DTMF and Baile Inolvidable that were mostly streamed outside the US, have managed that.\nThings were very different this time last year, when almost the entire Top 10 was filled with huge new hits: Not Like Us by Kendrick, Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter, Beautiful Things by Benson Boone and the aforementioned Shaboozey \u2013 back when it was a new song. All of these reached the billion streams mark, with Chappell Roan and Charli xcx making multiple chart entries later on in the year.\nOf course there are thousands of smaller and medium-sized artists who are having great years, but why have things become so stale at the very top of the charts?\nIn part it is because the overall volume of new music (defined as the songs released in the last 18 months) being listened to is down slightly year on year, around 3%, but it\u2019s more pronounced in genres such as pop and hip-hop, where listeners are turning towards nostalgia and delving into back catalogues.\nArtists that have produced a lot of hype releases this year like Addison Rae, Lorde and Haim have not produced radio songs that appeal to a mass audience, arguably putting more focus on creating an album and aesthetic that works for committed fans. Even stars such as Lizzo and Justin Bieber, who have topped a billion streams in the past, have made records with less obvious choruses and pop production.\nSome artists just are trying and missing. Carpenter, one of the most successful artists of last year, could nott quite recreate the magic this summer with Manchild, which was a small hit and did hit No 1 for a week before falling down the charts. Her album slated for release later in the summer might still provide a song with more chart staying power.\nIt has long been the case that the pipes through which new music is discovered have become calcified. Less people listen to Top 40 radio, or watch late-night shows, meaning it\u2019s harder for a band to have that one big moment when they break into the mainstream. And while TikTok does help certain songs filter into the consciousness, there\u2019s still not a fail-safe mechanism for getting them off the app and into the charts.\nIt does not help that the one song that is unambiguously a breakout mega hit this year, Ordinary by the 24-year-old California singer-songwriter Warren, is a little insipid and forgettable, a song desperately indebted to mid-2010s Hozier and Imagine Dragons. Hardly a feelgood song of the summer.\nBut, as Jaime Marconette, the vice-president of music insights and industry relations at Luminate, says, this drift away from new music is not present in every genre.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that in some genres, like R&B and hip-hop, people are listening to less new music, whereas with Christian and country in particular, they\u2019re actually gaining listeners to new music.\u201d\nHe points to Hard Fought Hallelujah, by Christian singer-songwriter Brandon Lake and country star Jelly Roll, as an example of the way the genres are combining to reach wider audiences. \u201cChristian is the most current streaming genre right now [with the largest proportion of streams to new tracks]. These are genres where their fans were a little bit later to the streaming game but are now starting to really embrace it.\u201d\nMarconette also says that this is not unprecedented - there have been other years, particularly during the Covid pandemic, when there were fewer new songs in the charts \u2013 after which new music bounced back.\n\u201cIn the Covid period, there was a lot of dramatic things happening in our world. So, it is interesting that now in a period where there\u2019s uncertainty out there, we\u2019re seeing it again,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s just a coincidence, but we\u2019re also starting to notice a jump in people streaming recession pop [music released around 2008 with escapist themes from artists such as Taio Cruz and Nicki Minaj] and it does point to a sort of this communal yearning for things that bring comfort from the past.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not all bad news: a couple of pop songs this year are streaming pretty well: Bad Bunny has had a string of huge hits outside of the US. Carpenter, Ty Dolla $ign, Maroon 5 and Drake all have records coming out this summer that might change things. Marconette also pointed to the return of K-pop group BTS and the success of the soundtrack to Netflix\u2019s animated movie KPop Demon Hunters as big players for the second half of the year.\nOf course, there is plenty of superlative new music, filed away in millions of private playlists, that might be someone\u2019s personal sound of the summer. The charts have never been guardians of taste or even vibes.\nBut it is much harder for one such song to become a communal and inescapable hit. Whether this year is an anomaly or just another sign of ongoing cultural fragmentation remains to be seen."

      "text": "Do we have a song of the summer this year?\nThe idea that each year produces a few unofficial \"songs of the summer\" has been rattling around for ages. And, though it's an inexact science, the concept has generally existed as a form of cultural carbon dating: If you're thinking about the summer of 2012, for example, you can imagine Carly Rae Jepsen's \"Call Me Maybe\" or Gotye's \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" emanating from the nearest loudspeaker. There's no title or trophy that goes with releasing the song of the summer, but it's meaningful to have imprinted on the history of a given year. It's also, not for nothing, lucrative to have staked a claim to future nostalgia \u2014 the more joyful, wistful and/or infectious the better.\nEach week, we use this column to break down major takeaways from the latest Billboard albums and singles charts. But it seems like a good week to break down a larger question about the charts circa August 2025: Do we have a true \"song of the summer\" this year? (For a few abbreviated takeaways from this week's charts, keep scrolling.)\nBillboard didn't launch a Songs of the Summer chart until 2010. Since then, it's been easy to determine, using data, which tracks can rightfully claim song-of-the-summer status. Take the music-rich summer of 2024, when two country songs \u2014 Post Malone's \"I Had Some Help (feat. Morgan Wallen)\" and Shaboozey's \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" \u2014 triumphed over pop bangers (Sabrina Carpenter's \"Espresso\" and \"Please Please Please\"), hip-hop titans (Kendrick Lamar's eventual Grammy-winner \"Not Like Us\"), left-field hits (Tommy Richman's \"Million Dollar Baby\") and the entirety of Charli xcx's Brat. Though nothing from Brat made the cut, Billboard's final Songs of the Summer chart for 2024 rounded up a solidly inclusive cross section of superstars and newcomers that cut across multiple genres, while truly representing much of what you'd hear if you were to flip on a commercial radio station or pop into a store last summer.\nBut what about this summer? Well, as the latest Songs of the Summer chart will tell you\u2026 it's pretty grim.\nAt No. 1, of course, is Alex Warren's \"Ordinary,\" which combines the hooky persistence of Imagine Dragons, the choir-adorned uplift of Coldplay and the fervent devotion of praise music; it's topped the Billboard Hot 100 for nine of the last 10 weeks and appears unlikely to loosen its grip as the summer wears on. \"Ordinary\" is the Song of the Summer based on raw chart numbers, but it's hardly a windows-down beach banger like, say, \"Espresso.\" It follows the letter, but not the spirit, of the song-of-the-summer law.\nThen, at Nos. 2, 3 and 5, you've got three Morgan Wallen songs, all from his latest overstuffed mega-album, I'm the Problem. \"What I Want (feat. Tate McRae)\" has been I'm the Problem's biggest hit, as well as the current Wallen single with the easiest claim to song-of-the-summer status: It dresses the singer's sullen vocal in trap beats, tosses in a few of McRae's frothy vocal flourishes and calls it a day. And, since Wallen's name headlines two massive recent-vintage songs of the summer \u2014 2024's \"I Had Some Help\" and 2023's \"Last Night\" \u2014 it certainly doesn't sound out of place in a song-of-the-summer conversation. \"What I Want\" just isn't terribly eventful, and it's not having half as much fun as Wallen and Post Malone were having at this time a year ago.\nBack on the Songs of the Summer chart, Kendrick Lamar's \"Luther (feat. SZA)\" is No. 4 but has resided on the Hot 100 for 36 weeks; Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' \"Die With a Smile\" sits at No. 6 after 50 weeks; and Chappell Roan's \"Pink Pony Club\" holds on at No. 7 after 59 weeks. Songs are only eligible for the Songs of the Summer chart if they haven't hit that particular chart in a prior summer \u2014 that's why \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" and Teddy Swims' \"Lose Control\" miss out on this year's Songs of the Summer chart, even though they remain in the Hot 100's top 10 \u2014 but that doesn't make \"Luther,\" \"Die With a Smile\" or \"Pink Pony Club\" feel particularly tied to the summer of 2025.\nAll of which speaks to a big part of what makes this summer's hit songs feel so stale: Thanks in large part to streaming algorithms \u2014 and radio programmers who often take their cues from what's getting played on streaming services \u2014 the biggest songs loll around on the charts for what feels like an eternity. \"Lose Control\" is currently in its 71st week in the top 10, amid 101 weeks on the Hot 100; both of those numbers obliterate the previous all-time records. The song still sits, motionless in more ways than one, at No. 7.\nBut there's another issue at work here: For a variety of reasons, many of the biggest A-list stars in pop, hip-hop and R&B have sat out 2025 so far \u2014 or, in the case of Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar, timed their latest albums in such a way that their largest impact had already faded by the time summer rolled around. Some contenders have underperformed commercially compared to expectations (Miley Cyrus, Lorde) or failed to ascend as rapidly as expected (Haim, Addison Rae), while others decided to wait until late summer (Sabrina Carpenter) or early fall (Drake) to release new albums. It's all added up to an uncharacteristically sleepy summer.\nBillboard's Songs of the Summer chart has its own structural flaws when it comes to conferring song-of-the-summer status, starting with the fact that it weighs each summer week equally. That setup makes it virtually impossible for late-breaking hits to compete with songs that have been charting for months. (It also helps explain the absence of tracks from KPop Demon Hunters, which has blown up entirely within the last six weeks.)\nStill, a few songs have surged on the Songs of the Summer chart in recent weeks, and those belong in the song-of-the-summer discussion. Sabrina Carpenter's \"Manchild,\" at No. 8, provides a worthy reminder that Carpenter has more summery anthems in her as her new album (Man's Best Friend) approaches later this month. And Ravyn Lenae's \"Love Me Not,\" at No. 9, is everything a song of the summer should be: frothy and fun, with a hint of nostalgia. And, though it hasn't cracked the Songs of the Summer chart \u2014 it's only been on the Hot 100 for three weeks now \u2014 Justin Bieber's \"Daisies\" feels like a late-breaking smash. Elevated by the distinctive guitar sound of rising star Mk.gee, the track ought to stick around long enough to enter the song-of-the-summer conversation in hindsight.\nWhether it's \"Manchild,\" \"Love Me Not,\" \"Daisies\" or HUNTR/X's \"Golden\" from KPop Demon Hunters, it's hard not to root for a new song to dominate the charts while the weather's still hot. It'd be nice, after all, to hear a song of the summer that's anything but \"Ordinary.\"\nTOP ALBUMS\nLast week, Tyler, The Creator's Don't Tap the Glass debuted at No. 1, making it the rapper's fourth consecutive record to top the Billboard 200 albums chart. This week, Don't Tap the Glass drops to No. 4, clearing the way for the return of Morgan Wallen's streaming blockbuster I'm the Problem, which now spends a ninth nonconsecutive week atop the chart. It's still solidly ahead of the album at No. 2: the soundtrack to KPop Demon Hunters, which continues to close the gap by a little bit each week.\nElsewhere, three new albums debut in the top 10: the K-pop group Tomorrow X Together lands at No. 3 with The Star Chapter: TOGETHER; the rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again scores his 16th top 10 album with MASA at No. 6; and singer-songwriter Tyler Childers hits a new career high as Snipe Hunter bows at No. 7. Also worth noting: The 2003 compilation The Essential Ozzy Osbourne remains in the top 10 for a second week in the aftermath of the rock legend's death.\nTOP SONGS\nFor a ninth nonconsecutive week, Alex Warren's \"Ordinary\" sits atop the Billboard Hot 100, thanks largely to massive airplay on commercial radio stations. But KPop Demon Hunters continues to pile up milestones. Now, both of the soundtrack's fictional bands \u2014 HUNTR/X, a girl group voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, and Saja Boys, a boy band voiced by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee \u2014 have landed songs in the top 10. HUNTR/X's \"Golden\" holds at No. 2, while Saja Boys' \"Your Idol\" climbs to No. 9."

      "text": "Addison Rae \u2013 Headphones On\nSummer is for out-of-office email bouncebacks, smashing your laptop shut at 4pm and putting it off until tomorrow. This year, no song represents the simple thrill of shrugging it off better than Addison Rae\u2019s Headphones On. With a detached, lobotomy-chic delivery that\u2019s drawn comparisons to Y2K-era Madonna, the TikTok star turned serious pop scholar breezes through a list of anxieties, from her parents\u2019 relationship to the ever-present thrill of being bumped down a notch by \u201cthe new it girl\u201d. Ultimately, our laconic heroine swaps a panic attack for slipping those headphones on and riding it all out with a song. Clocking in at exactly four minutes, there\u2019s a straightforwardness to it all that I can\u2019t help but appreciate. Rae will make you dance without working too hard. And that\u2019s all I want right now. Alaina Demopoulos\nKatseye \u2013 Gnarly\nThis song, sung by a six-woman international K-pop group, begins with an analysis of how malleable English slang is. \u201cThey could describe everything with one single word, you know? / Boba tea, gnarly / Tesla, gnarly / Fried chicken, gnarly,\u201d one member of Katseye sings, the bass thumping every time she says the most versatile descriptive word in the language, signifying intensity, both positive and negative. It\u2019s the early 2010s, and we\u2019re so back. The song is as maximalist as can be, similar to Skrillex\u2019s 2011 Bangarang or Kesha\u2019s 2010 hit TiK ToK. The music video, in which the group assembles a grotesque sandwich, calls back to 2010\u2019s Telephone, when Lady Gaga does the same. The song is fun and rowdy. It speeds forward, apt for TikTok (the app), where it first gained popularity with a distinctive, jerky dance. If you like Gnarly, I would suggest going in search of other songs by one of the song\u2019s writers, Alice Longyu Gao. Rich Bitch Juice and 100 Boyfriends feature the same mix of heavy bass and saccharine, electrified vocals and instrumentation. Blake Montgomery\nJade \u2013 Plastic Box\nSince squishing a NOW! compilation\u2019s worth of ideas into three minutes on her solo single Angel of My Dreams, Jade has backed up what Little Mixologists always suspected \u2013 that she knows pop as if she has an MA in Bangers. Ahead of the release of her debut album That\u2019s Showbiz, Baby!, there\u2019s something invitingly scrappy to the way she\u2019s dovetailed from brash EDM to orgasmic disco, discarding cheap wigs and Jade-branded buttplugs in her wake. (To my mind, the only other pop act exploring genre this boldly is Sabrina Carpenter, who is something like a spiritual sibling to Jade as well as her stylistic opposite.) Plastic Box bottles a certain Scandinavian strain of sweet melancholy, with Jade playing the jilted lover over seductive electro-pop. Co-producers Grades and Oscar G\u00f6rres, the latter of whom helmed most of Troye Sivan\u2019s slick Something to Give Each Other, hug her voice with rosy synths and a chorus that explodes in a cloud of confetti. It\u2019s an end of summer party that\u2019s chicer than SSENSE \u2013 and despite Jade\u2019s antics that made her so much fun to follow, Plastic Box proves that she\u2019s just as magnetic when she strips them away. Owen Myers\nPinkPantheress \u2013 Illegal\nTo me, summer feels like going at terminal velocity down a waterslide: an unstoppable blur that before you know it has spat you out in the run-out pool of autumn, dazed and blinking. PinkPantheress\u2019s new 20-minute, 30-second mixtape Fancy That feels the same way, a rush of UK dance music history \u2013 heavy with samples of Basement Jaxx and Underworld and nods to Fatboy Slim and Groove Armada \u2013 guided by a flirt laying down the law in girlish RP. Illegal is the only time Pink\u2019s grip loosens, thanks to a hero dose of THC that leaves her tangled in lust, paranoia and shame. Between the reality-obliterating synth strobes, her sensory production makes you feel all the freedom and frustration of being high, close breaths and screams flickering through the slipstream. Laura Snapes\nforty winks \u2013 commie bf\nThere are plenty of songs of the summer about falling in love or partying or breaking up or going for a long, gorgeous drive, but there are hardly enough songs for summer lethargy. When the mercury hits 90 degrees, all my friends go insane, my technology stops working, and I start napping for at least one hour a day. Enter commie bf, a blunt buzzsaw of a song on which forty winks singer Cilia Catello yells that \u201ceveryone and everything makes my ears ring\u201d right before she and her bandmates unleash a maelstrom of nasty, dementedly catchy punk-pop. This is a funny, and fun, and ferocious track \u2013 loud and unruly, but so intensely catchy that even the guitar-music-averse among us would have to admire its moxie. Catello\u2019s sheer frustration rings through every second of the song, enough to shake you from that heatwave-induced stupor and get your ass back into gear, no matter how sweaty and malcontent you may be. Shaad D\u2019Souza\nMK \u2013 Dior (featuring Chrystal)\nWhile pop fans fret about there not being a good enough song of the summer this year, the UK has gone ahead and anointed its choice anyway. MK\u2019s Dior is now at No 1 in the UK charts, standard behaviour for a country whose inhabitants need only the faintest hint of a 4/4 pop-dance beat on a temperate day to crack open a tinned cocktail at 11am and go \u201cwheeeeey\u201d with arms stretched wide. US producer MK, AKA Marc Kinchen, has been around since the early 90s (he\u2019s behind the still-ubiquitous Push the Feeling On) and therefore brings a level of craft to bear on his productions that puts them into a different league to all other mirrored-wall nightclub fodder. 2017\u2019s 17 still shines like the white walls and high-tensile glass of an Ibizan villa; 2023\u2019s Asking is as good as build-and-drop dance gets. 2025\u2019s offering Dior is more coiled and sensual than those tracks, with a really dramatic delayed drop: silence and Chrystal\u2019s a cappella vocal fill the space where you expect the beat, creating a simple but spine-tingling effect. The high fashion references meanwhile make it a sort of sequel to 2023\u2019s equivalent dance-pop song of the summer, Cass\u00f6\u2019s Prada. Ben Beaumont-Thomas\nHaim \u2013 Relationships\nBest efforts notwithstanding, the vibes aren\u2019t great this summer. The news is terrible, the AI ominous, the culture still in an extended hangover from last year\u2019s Espresso buzz and Brat bumps. There is no obvious song of the summer \u2013 the charts are basically tracks from 2024 or Morgan Wallen (though you wouldn\u2019t know it in godless New York); Charli xcx basically headlined Glastonbury; people are too busy arguing over Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s album cover to remember her Espresso follow-up Manchild. In this muggy malaise, I\u2019ve been stuck on Haim\u2019s Relationships \u2013 the LA trio\u2019s best pop song to date, a bright, deceptively airy anthem for being fucking over it. Lyrically, this lead single off the sisters\u2019 aspirationally titled fourth album I Quit describes the messy end of some ill-defined entanglement. But its spare, intoxicating production \u2013 simple piano chords, ambling bass, synths glimmering like barlights at 9pm dusk \u2013 evokes a more general, potent summer ennui. I normally want the bpm up when it\u2019s hot, but this summer, I\u2019ve been circling blocks to Danielle\u2019s dreamy falsetto, ascending with her rhetorical questions \u2013 fucking relationships, don\u2019t they end up all the same? \u2013 and then crashing back to earth with her \u201cwhen there\u2019s no one else to blame\u201d. Feelings? In this strung-out summer? Try me next year. Adrian Horton\nThe Beths \u2013 No Joy\nThe most joyous sounding song of this summer addresses depression, numbness and the futility of it all. No Joy, by the tuneful New Zealand quartet the Beths, provides an ideal object lesson in the thrill of mixed messages in pop. The music couldn\u2019t feel more summery or light, fired by bouncy powerpop chords and chirpy backup vocals. The video, set in a candy-colored child\u2019s playroom, follows suit, with lead singer/writer Elizabeth Stokes deadpanning her way through lyrics like: \u201cAll my pleasures, guilty / Clean slate looking filthy\u201d and \u201cI feel nothing,\u201d all while her bandmates smile with satirically exaggerated pleasure. It\u2019s impossible to keep a straight face while watching or listening to it, despite the fact that the numbness Stokes reports in her words reflects something sadly real. The lyrics chronicle her experience on the dulling SSRI drug she has used to deal with her depression. True as that may be for her, the song winds up giving the opposite feeling to the listener. When she sings \u201cno joy\u201d over and over we feel nothing but \u2013 a twist that could make this the most ironic song of this summer, as well as the most irresistible. Jim Farber\nsombr \u2013 we never dated\nWelcome to sombr season. Summer \u201825 seems to have given us a new star, and he\u2019s Shane Boose \u2013 otherwise known by his melancholy moniker, sombr. A native of New York\u2019s bustling Lower East Side, at just 19 he has effectively launched his mainstream career with a series of chart-topping singles which flaunts the artist\u2019s emotional, guitar-propelled lyrics. Yes you read that right, the new generation has officially rediscovered actual instruments, with the teenage artist seemingly channelling alt-rock acts like Arctic Monkeys and Radiohead, the latter of whom he\u2019s cited as a major influence. Songs like We Never Dated flaunt brutally honest lyrics accented by guitar-picking led it to become an instant breakout upon its late June release, which makes it a no-brainer when it comes to Song of the Summer status. Meanwhile, he\u2019s riding high on other explosive singles including Back to Friends, which recently was anointed as the most-streamed song on Spotify\u2019s global charts. Rob LeDonne\nKhamari \u2013 Head in a Jar\nWithout a factory-made earworm to invade our every waking moment, the floor has opened up to a wider selection of artists this summer and, as there always should be in my opinion, a wider selection of vibes to go with it. Songs of the summer are typically characterised by the infectious perk and sweaty overwhelm of mid-afternoon sun but there\u2019s another seasonal feeling we all know, as the brightness starts to fade, that also deserves its space. Boston-born singer Khamari knows it too and in delicate downer Head in a Jar, he captures a brand of summery sadness that\u2019s also rather seductive, a deliberate dive into dark feelings that\u2019s as refreshing as an early evening breeze. It\u2019s a song about being pushed away from the centre of someone\u2019s life, forced to watch from a distance instead and, with a voice that has rightly earned comparisons to the mostly awol Frank Ocean, Khamari pierces right through. He\u2019s quietly been gaining buzz since his similarly reflective 2020 EP Eldorado and this one deserves to vault him from the outside in. Benjamin Lee\nMat\u00edas Aguayo \u2013 El Internet\nYou know you\u2019re in the right party if someone throws down this tune. The Chilean-German firebrand Mat\u00edas Aguayo returned in May with a subversive dancefloor heater that has been building in notoriety over the subsequent months. It\u2019s sung in Spanish but translates to, Aguayo says: \u201cwalking through the city on hot summer nights looking for the perfect dancefloor\u201d. But it\u2019s also a mission statement, longing for \u201crevolutions in music and dreams in community\u201d away from homogenisation, social media likes and solely facing the DJ booth. In the track, Aguayo remembers the freewheeling days of YouTube rips where you could hear \u201craw, primitive and direct music\u201d from, say, a Syrian wedding or Angolan teenagers dancing on the streets \u2013 references for El Internet\u2019s own jittery, restless rhythm and also his live DJ sets, where he sings and dances inside a circle in the audience, inviting onlookers to move freely with him and let loose. It\u2019s lithe, gonzo techno for sticky evenings in search of catharsis and connection. Kate Hutchinson\nTom Rasmussen \u2013 Gay Bar\nTaken from London-based polymath Tom Rasmussen\u2019s High Wire, a remixed and reimagined version of last year\u2019s excellent Live Wire album, new song Gay Bar \u2013 not a cover of Electric Six, apols \u2013 showcases two of my favourite summer past-times; trashy storytelling and gossip. Who doesn\u2019t love a steamy page-turner on the beach, interrupted only by the details of last night\u2019s escapades wafting over from the gaggle of pals nearby? On Gay Bar, Rasmussen details three attempts at a night out; the first is interrupted by a pint to the face, and then completely ruined by the gay bar now being a Slug & Lettuce. Night two, meanwhile, involves going to the place where \u201cDanielle sucked on that MP\u2019s armpit\u201d, but \u2013 shock horror! - it\u2019s now a Crossfit gym full of \u201cmuscled up yuppies\u201d. By night three, with hope dwindling, Rasmussen takes a straight friend giving off \u201cbi vibes\u201d to a busy gay bar. As the song\u2019s hi-NRG dance pop ratchets up, you find yourself gripped as the story reaches its climax; will Cassandra get off with anyone? What\u2019s Rasmussen doing in the basement? When will the decimation of queer nightlife end? It\u2019s a real page-turner. Michael Cragg\nComments (\u2026)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

  "argos_summary": "Spotify named Alex Warren\u2019s \"Ordinary\" the most\u2011streamed song of summer 2025, and it also tops Billboard\u2019s Songs of the Summer chart, but critics argue the track is bland and that the charts are dominated by older hits such as Kendrick Lamar & SZA\u2019s \"Luther\" and Morgan Wallen\u2019s country ballads. The lack of fresh summer anthems has led commentators to question whether there is a true song of the summer this year, citing streaming algorithms and radio play that keep older tracks in the spotlight. While some outlets name alternative tracks such as PinkPantheress\u2019s \"Illegal\" or Haim\u2019s \"Relationships\" as contenders, no single song has emerged as a definitive summer hit, reflecting a broader sense of stagnation in the pop landscape.",
