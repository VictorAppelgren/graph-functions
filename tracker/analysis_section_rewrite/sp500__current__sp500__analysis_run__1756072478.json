      "feedback": "Actionable edits to lift to world‑class in 0–3 weeks: (1) formalize a tight base/bull/bear scenario specifically for the 0–3 week window, with explicit catalysts and an invalidation/flip‑point for each (e.g., if Houthi escalation widens to multiple Red Sea chokepoints or UKMTO/Shipping indexes worsen for a sustained 3–5 days, switch to bear; if geopolitical signals calm and Shopify GMV growth sustains >25% YoY with no margin deterioration, push to bull; otherwise stay base). (2) anchor the immediate drivers with precise numbers from sources: for Shopify, GMV +27% YoY, revenue +29% YoY, and valuation at roughly P/E ~70, P/S ~18; for geopolitics, cite the I2SJU04DF detail of Israel strikes on Houthi targets near the presidential palace, two power plants, a fuel depot and Red Sea ports, plus the NBX9RA9WX note of a Moscow gas‑cylinder blast with casualties; (3) sharpen the causal chain: geopolitics affects cross‑border growth and shipping risk premia (I2SJU04DF), Moscow shock adds general risk sentiment pressure (NBX9RA9WX), and Shopify’s execution and AI‑driven ecosystem determine near‑term upside versus multiple‑compression risk (QGXA2WQJ3); (4) add explicit trigger/monitor points and thresholds: track near‑term shipping disruption indicators (UKMTO advisories, Red Sea port activity), oil/gas price moves, and any escalation signals; for Shopify watch GMV/revenue momentum and margin trajectory over the next 2–3 weeks, plus price action (a material move ±X% over 3–5 sessions) as your invalidation; (5) improve scenario logic with first‑principles grounding: treat the window as a risk‑premium repricing phase where high‑growth, high‑multiple names like Shopify are vulnerable to rising discount rates unless top‑line momentum and AI‑driven margins sustain; (6) tighten the “what to watch next” list to concrete datapoints (Houthi/Israeli developments, Red Sea shipping indices, Shopify GMV growth pace, AI‑driven margin leverage); (7) guard against overstatement by clearly attributing each assertion to its source IDs and noting any conflicts or uncertainties (I2SJU04DF, NBX9RA9WX, QGXA2WQJ3) so readers can reconcile differences; (8) deliver a leaner, more readable arc by reducing repetition and clearly separating exogenous risk signals from micro‑signal the Shopify print provides, with one succinct, cited paragraph per driver.",
