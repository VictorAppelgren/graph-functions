  "content": "Gold is another way to diversify your portfolio and hedge against inflation. With a Thor Metals gold IRA , you can invest in gold with a tax-advantaged account. Their gold IRA can help stabilize your finances, allowing you to invest directly in physical precious metals rather than stocks and bonds.\n\nFrom their 23 exits so far, Masterworks investors have realized representative annualized net returns like +17.6%, +17.8% and +21.5% among assets held for longer than one year. To see if you qualify, you can find out more about investing with Masterworks here .\n\nMasterworks has helped over one million users invest in pieces from artists including Banksy, Basquiat and Picasso. How it works is simple: Browse their collection of potential pieces of art, choose the number of shares you want to purchase and let Masterworks handle the rest.\n\nFor instance, one asset that has historically been somewhat insulated from stock market fluctuations is art. Once the domain of the ultra-wealthy, you can now invest in fine art with Masterworks to diversify your portfolio.\n\nWhile investing in the stock market doesn\u2019t come without its risks, it can also yield a greater return than keeping your cash in a standard savings account. Investing in alternative assets can also help shield your retirement fund from inflation or being at the mercy of stock market volatility.\n\nThe best way to do that is to invest strategically by diversifying your assets.\n\nRecent data from Schroders found that 37% of retirees consider themselves comfortable, while 5% say they're living the dream. But 84% of Americans would like to better protect their nest egg from inflation.\n\nBut a big part of enjoying retirement to the fullest is approaching it strategically. Here are some of the top things Americans do well in retirement \u2014 and why you should aim to emulate them.\n\nWant an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan \u2018works every single time\u2019 to kill debt, get rich in America \u2014 and that \u2018anyone\u2019 can do it\n\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement \u2014 what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nRetirement represents a significant transition that most people are eager to make. A recent Wealth Enhancement survey found that 90% of older Americans don't regret retiring when they did, and 33% of retirees say their senior years are going better than expected.\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nBy opening a Gold IRA, you could be looking out for your future self while bolstering your retirement. Thor Metals also offers a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases.\n\nJust keep in mind that gold is often best used as one part of a broader portfolio diversification strategy.\n\nRead more: Do you own rental properties in the US? These 6 hacks can help you boost your income and lower your tax burden\n\nA recent Allianz survey found that 64% of Americans are more concerned with running out of money in retirement than dying. To protect yourself from that happening, you need to have a carefully planned withdrawal strategy and be willing to make adjustments when needed.\n\nFor years, financial advisors have promoted the 4% rule, which advises withdrawing 4% of your savings in the first year of retirement and then adjusting future withdrawals based on inflation.\n\nHowever, a 4% withdrawal rate won\u2019t always be optimal. That\u2019s because interest rates can play a big part in making this strategic decision. In May 2025, Morningstar reported that Bill Bergen, the financial advisor behind the 4% rule, now believes that the safe withdrawal rate is closer to 4.7%.\n\nThe figure is up for some debate, which is why it's a good idea to work with a financial professional who can help you stretch your nest egg during retirement. They will take into account your income needs as well as market conditions.\n\nAdvisor.com can help, you find a vetted financial advisor that offers personalized advice, guiding you towards the right choices for the retirement of your dreams. Advisor\u2019s experts are also pre-vetted fiduciaries, meaning they\u2019re legally obligated to act in your best financial interests.\n\nHow it works is simple: Just punch in a few basic pieces of information like your postal code and what you\u2019re looking for, and Advisor.com will match you with a professional near you in just a few minutes. Then they can help you get your retirement mapped out today.\n\nTaking care of your health in retirement may not just lead to a longer life \u2014 it could also save you money if you can stave off serious medical issues and keep your healthcare costs down.\n\nA recent Transamerica survey found that 67% of retirees today are prioritizing being healthy and fit. A fitness routine is a solid way to ensure you\u2019re moving regularly.\n\nWhat exactly that will look like depends on your needs and preferences. For example, if you enjoy swimming, getting a membership at a community pool and doing laps three days a week could be a great activity. Or you could schedule a regular tennis match with a friend. It\u2019s also a good idea to consult with a doctor before you start any new fitness regimen.\n\nStaying active doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Walking is also a great form of exercise and is gentle on the body.\n\nIf you love animals and can afford one, consider getting a dog. Companionship aside, it's a great way to push yourself to walk consistently.\n\n4. They prioritize time with loved ones\n\nWhen you're working a full-time job and running a busy household, it can be challenging to find the hours to spend with the people who mean the most to you.\n\nOne benefit of being retired is having the time to spend with the people you care about. Transamerica found that 58% of retirees today are spending more time with family and friends. So if that's what makes you happiest, make it a priority.\n\nIf in-person contact isn't something you can do regularly, schedule a standing FaceTime date with your grown children, siblings and other important people in your life to stay connected.\n\nBut there are other, off-camera ways to show your loved ones that you care and to protect them from becoming financially vulnerable in the event of your passing.\n\nWith Ethos, you can get term life insurance in 5 minutes, ensuring your family\u2019s financial security in the event of an unexpected death. Most applicants won\u2019t even need to go through medical tests before purchasing their policy.\n\nEthos provides policies with up to $2 million in coverage, which can start at just $2 per day. Their application process gets you flexible coverage options quickly and transparently, allowing you to focus on what matters most during your golden years.\n\nIt's not uncommon for retirees to lose a sense of purpose once they stop working. Unfortunately, many people tie their identities to a job. So once retirement age hits, it's easy to feel like you don't have a purpose or to grow depressed as a result.\n\nThat's why it's crucial to discover a sense of meaning in retirement. And there are many ways to do just that.\n\nVolunteering is a great way to give back to your community. According to the National Library of Medicine, studies have found that volunteer work is associated with improved self-esteem, reduced depression and an overall better quality of life.\n\nFinding a cause to support, or several causes, could give you something meaningful to do with your newfound free time. If you\u2019re financially stable, you may also wish to find ways to support the next generation in your family.\n\nWith financial aid only covering about 27% of college expenses, your grandkids may find it challenging to afford tuition in this inflationary environment.\n\nHelping them turn their dreams into reality can be a truly generous way to give back. You can even help them through tools such as College Ave loans, which secures private student loans at the lowest available rates. Typically, Federal loans like FAFSA only cover specific college expenses. A private loan, like one from College Ave, can help fill in the gaps.\n\nThe process is simple. Once a college student starts the application, you can become a borrower with your student as a dependent, or become the guarantor for their own student loan.\n\nThe stress-free user experience also includes an instant credit decision \u2014 so there\u2019s no waiting and wondering about how much you\u2019ll be approved for. Plus, the whole process can be completed in as little as three minutes.\n\nWhat to read next\n\u2022 Robert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US \u2014 with millions of Americans going poor.
