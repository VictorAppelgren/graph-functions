  "title": "Just say no to Big Dope \u2014 and its push for even more legal marijuana",
  "description": "Donald Trump should ignore the well-funded cannabis lobby: What matters is that more and cheaper marijuana will mean nothing good for ordinary Americans.",
  "content": "Will more marijuana use make America a better place?\n\nNot many who\u2019ve seen and smelled what legalizing the drug has done to cities like New York, Washington, DC, and San Francisco would say so.\n\nYet President Donald Trump is contemplating a change to marijuana\u2019s federal classification that would make it easier to buy and more profitable to sell.\n\nThe pot industry \u2014 Big Dope \u2014 is heavily invested in getting its product recategorized from a Schedule 1 to a Schedule 3 drug.\n\nIndustry leaders ponied up for a $1-million-a-plate Trump fundraising dinner earlier this month to hear what the president had in mind, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe president should ignore the well-funded cannabis lobby: What matters is what more and cheaper marijuana will mean for ordinary Americans.\n\nTwenty-four states have legalized recreational use of the drug, despite the ugly results experienced by the first state to do so.\n\nTaking advantage of high Democratic turnout the year of President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election, activists passed a Colorado ballot measure to make pot legal back in 2012.\n\nLegalization didn\u2019t take effect until 2014, but by 2022 marijuana use in Colorado and other states that had then legalized was 24% higher than in states where recreational use remained illegal.\n\nA study by the South Korean scholar Sunyoung Lee published in the International Review of Law and Economics this year examines what\u2019s happened to crime levels in US states that legalized pot.\n\nLee reported his findings \u201cdo not yield conclusive evidence supporting a reduction in crime rates after legalizing recreational marijuana. Rather, they underscore notable positive associations with property crimes and suggest potential correlations with violent crimes.\u201d\n\nThe marijuana lobby claims that drug prohibition, not the drug itself, drives violent crime.\n\nThat would be a bad argument even without evidence like Lee\u2019s, which suggests legal weed makes crime worse.\n\nAfter all, any profit-driven criminal enterprise could be shut down by simply legalizing the crime in question.\n\nIf bank robbery were legal, bank robbers wouldn\u2019t need to use guns.\n\nIf auto theft were legal, carjackers wouldn\u2019t have to use force, and there wouldn\u2019t be any violence associated with black-market chop shops because the chop shops would all be as legal as the commercial marijuana industry is today.\n\nLegalize everything Tony Soprano does, and Tony won\u2019t have to get rough \u2014 but he\u2019ll only do more of what he was doing before.\n\nLibertarians who argue for legalizing drugs to stop drug violence are closer than they realize to the radical leftists who argue property crimes shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted.\n\nThe psychology is the same: They sympathize with the people who make it harder to live in a civilized society and reject society\u2019s right to defend its rules.\n\nThere are downsides to laws against marijuana, just as there are costs to protecting private property and citizens\u2019 bodily safety.\n\nBut the costs are well worth paying when the alternative is passivity in the face of aggression, handing your belongings or your life over to any thug who makes a demand.\n\nFor a time marijuana legalization was sold to voters as just a matter of leaving people alone to consume whatever they want in private, without bothering anybody else.\n\nYet millions of Americans have now lived long enough with pot legalization, or the non-enforcement of laws still on the books, to know the pot lobby perpetrated a fraud.\n\nWhat the country has actually had to deal with is pot smoking so rife in public that the offensive smell \u2014 and the sight and sounds of intoxication \u2014 smacks you in your face.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly different from dope-users blowing smoke right in your eyes on the street.\n\nThat\u2019s not the worst crime in the world \u2014 but neither is shoplifting, and there\u2019s no reason to tolerate that, either.\n\nTolerating such things only breeds more tolerance for worse abuses, which is what has led progressives to treat even violent criminals with the utmost leniency.\n\nTwo scenes in the suburbs of DC convinced me pot tolerance has gone too far.\n\nFirst was seeing an African-American bus driver, on a blazing hot summer day, order two dope-smoking teens to put out their joints and be aware there were children around.\n\nTo the extent our cities work at all it\u2019s because of working-class men like him \u2014 and the rest of us have to decide whether we\u2019re on his side or the punks\u2019.\n\nA year or so later I watched a young mother one bright October afternoon hold her small daughter\u2019s hand as they walked through a neighborhood reeking of high-potency pot.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar weed industry got to advertise its product to a little girl about 4 years old that day.\n\nIt\u2019s an industry that notoriously even sells its drug in candy form, as \u201cgummies.\u201d\n\nOur cities and towns shouldn\u2019t be open-air drug dens \u2014 and Trump shouldn\u2019t let a lobby get high off of making Americans\u2019 lives worse.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review and editor-at-large of The American Conservative.",

  "summary": "President Donald Trump is considering changing the federal classification of marijuana to make it easier to buy and more profitable to sell. The pot industry, known as Big Dope, is lobbying for this change, with industry leaders attending a $1-million-a-plate Trump fundraising dinner to hear what the president's plans to make. This comes amid concerns that this change to the drug's federal classification could lead to more affordable and cheaper products for ordinary Americans. However, a study by South Korean scholar Sunyoung Lee suggests that crime levels in US states that legalized pot have increased significantly after the drug was legalized, but did not support conclusive evidence of a reduction in crime rates. The libertarian side of the pot argument suggests that drug prohibition, not the drug itself, drives violent crime, but that any profit-driven criminal enterprise could be shut down by legalizing the crime in question.",

      "text": "An explosive Post exclusive revealing that legal weed is fueling a wave of addiction is fresh proof of Albany\u2019s feckless legalization.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the stupidest things our society has done \u2014 they legalized cannabis during the opioid crisis,\u201d grumbled Luke Nasta, president and CEO of Camelot Counseling of Staten Island.\nThing is, neither the Legislature\u2019s leaders nor Gov. Andrew Cuomo (then eyeing a 2020 presidential run) cared about the risks, the clear downsides or even elementary practicality when they rammed through legalization in 2019.\nThey let social-justice obsessions write the new rules, then installed a clueless crew to run the new state Office of Cannabis Management.\nAs the OCM dithered over awarding the new licenses, illegal shops popped up all over the city and state \u2014 shielded from law enforcement by the new laws\u2019 lunatic provisions.\nSo the outlets that had proven their ability by selling under the 2014 medical-marijuana law got crushed even as qualified new potential sellers couldn\u2019t open for business.\nOh, and Albany didn\u2019t even allow for common-sense limits on smoking dope in public, so the reek of weed is everywhere.\nWorst of all, the politicians shut their ears to warnings about the impact of cannabis on young brains \u2014 a prime reason the Medical Society of New York opposed legalization.\nSo the state saw an explosion of flavored weed products and edibles, plainly aimed at hooking young people susceptible to addiction.\nAny legalization risked bringing an avalanche of new addicts, but New York\u2019s move might as well have been timed and designed to maximize the damage.\nHow mad does it get? Consider the nonprofit Housing Works, which runs drug-treatment services and a cannabis-dispensary arm.\nIt tells its pot customers they\u2019re \u201chelping fund lifesaving services that support thousands of New Yorkers each year\u201d \u2014 except that its treatment centers on the addict-enabling \u201charm reduction\u201d approach.\nProspering by feeding misery: That\u2019s pretty much the essence of Albany\u2019s approach to legalization."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

It\u2019s hard. But, \u2018Just say no,\u2019 \u201d said Dillet Delancey, a 23-year-old Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, resident in residential rehab treatment at Camelot.\nDelancey, who has smoked pot since he was 11 and been in treatment for four months, said the \u201cnegatives outweigh the positives\u201d of legalizing cannabis.\n\u201cWeed is the new cigarette. But it\u2019s considered more fun because you can get high,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gateway drug. Eventually it won\u2019t get you high any more, and you\u2019re going to look for something greater. It tears families apart. I can testify to that.\u201d\nShaquan Shannon, 19, said he\u2019s been smoking weed since he was 12.\n\u201cIt made me feel invincible,\u201d Shannon said.\n\u201cIn the midst of brushing my teeth, I would have a blunt, ready to spark it, ready to smoke it. I would smoke when I woke up. I wouldn\u2019t eat all day without smoking,\u201d said Shannon, a Staten Island resident who has been in treatment more than a month.\nHe said he would get so stoned on doobies that \u201cI forgot who I was.\u201d\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here!\nChance Buckner, 20, said he\u2019s in rehab as an alternative to spending time in jail for actions tied to his drug abuse.\nHe eventually mixed his pot with opioids and other drugs \u201cto chase the higher high\u201d and initially used weed as a coping mechanism.\n\u201cI became disconnected from myself and reality. I became a person who seeks chaos,\u201d said Buckner of Flatbush, Brooklyn.\n\u201cI became numb. It was a long dark road. \u2026 I started to lose my mind.\u201d\nAll three noted that pot is now more accessible than ever, including even the most potent cannabis, with it coming from licensed and unlicensed stores including local delis and not just from street dealers anymore.\n\u201cI see a lot of things happening I\u2019ve never seen before. The local stores are selling marijuana,\u201d Shannon said.\nThere\u2019s more flavored cannabis that attracts young people, and the weed that is accessible is \u201cway more potent\u201d than what was the most readily available before, he said.\nLegalization has de-stigmatized weed in society\u2019s eyes \u2014 seemingly giving the green light for youths to fire up the blunts, too, the addicts said.\nThere are now 444 licensed cannabis stores in the state, nearly half in the city\u2019s five boroughs.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide it anymore,\u201d Shannon said.\nBuckner called the legalization of the sale of cannabis a \u201cdouble edge sword.\u201d\n\u201cIt clouds the brain,\u201d he said of pot.\nDelancey said he consumed marijuana at 14 to deal with personality disorder and later mixed it with ecstasy. Meanwhile, his mom grappled with drug addiction.\nHe has been in rehab three previous times.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to stop once you start. Now, we have easy access to it. There\u2019s a dispensary on every corner in New York. You\u2019ve got delis cashing food stamps [for cannabis],\u201d Delancey said.\nHe said he sees more pot addicts in the city post-legalization.\n\u201cThe peer pressure is thick out there\u201d to use, Delancey said.\nA new federal study shows there are 11 million more cannabis users in the US than just a few years ago, after 24 states including New York legalized cannabis for recreational use and 40 states for medicinal use.\nThe percentage of Americans age 12 and older doing ganja increased from 19% of the population, or 53.2 million, in 2021 to 22.3%, or to 64.2 million, in 2024, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\nThe percentage of US residents age 26 or older consuming weed increased from 17.3% or 38.2 million people in 2021 to 21.7% or 49.3 million in 2024.\nNearly a quarter of New York City adults age 21 and older consumed cannabis in 2023, second only to alcohol, according to a study included in the city Health Department\u2019s \u201cThe State of Mental Health of New Yorkers\u201d report.\nThe same report said 15% of city public high-school students used marijuana that year.\nProponents\u2019 push to legalize marijuana \u201cdownplayed the risk\u201d, said Tamara Levin, Camelot\u2019s clinical director on Staten Island.\n\u201cMarijuana is addictive. It causes a lot of issues,\u201d Levin said.\n\u201cThe perception is that because it\u2019s legal, it\u2019s Ok. But for some people, it destroys their lives.\u201d\nThe impact of cannabis on young people\u2019s brain is among the reasons the Medical Society of New York opposed legalization.\nThe city\u2019s district attorneys, now on the sidelines in terms of prosecution since marijuana has been legalized, are now monitoring abuse.\n\u201cMarijuana, like any drug, legal or illegal, has the potential to be used and abused to deleterious effects\u201d Staten Island DA Michael McMahon said in a statement.\n\u201cAs co-chairman of the Staten Island Fentanyl & Overdose Task Force, I know that addiction illness comes in many forms and I strongly believe that now is the time for the government to increase not decrease funding for our borough\u2019s treatment providers.\u201d"

Subscribe here!\nAdams\u2019 public pot puffing pooh-poohing came as he argued that tackling quality-of-life issues such as street homelessness and public urination will make New Yorkers feel safer.\nA revival of \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing and cracking down on disorder has been a major plank of Adams\u2019 public safety policy, which he has been touting during his re-election battle as an independent.\nBut his comments about constant wafting weed smell contrast with the mayor\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of the legal cannabis industry.\nAs recently as Saturday, the mayor visited a legal weed festival in Harlem and declared he wants the Big Apple to be the \u201ccannabis capital of the globe,\u201d AMNY reported.\nHizzoner also laughed off a record-breaking surge of odor complaints during the summer of 2022 by saying it wasn\u2019t sun-ripened garbage that he was smelling.\n\u201cThe No. 1 thing I smell right now is pot. It\u2019s like everybody\u2019s smoking a joint now,\u201d Adams said at the time, chuckling.\n\u201cYou know, everybody has a joint.\u201d\nAdams \u2014 who launched a sweeping crackdown on illegal pot shops to help protect the burgeoning legal weed industry \u2014 also showed he\u2019s not adverse to whiffing reefer.\nFull Episode\nHe drew laughs last year when he took a big, seemingly admiring sniff of a bag stuffed with illegal weed, moments before it was incinerated.\nBut lest the city\u2019s potheads think Adams is Tommy Chong-ing it in Gracie Mansion, he has claimed to not partake.\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t smoke,\u201d he told The Daily Show in 2023, although he jokingly copped to getting it secondhand.\n\u201cAll you got to do is walk down the block. Secondhand is everywhere now.\u201d\nAdams added he didn\u2019t want children smoking marijuana on the way to school or eating cannabis \u201cgummy bears and other bulls\u2013t.\u201d\nHis concern for children taking drugs goes way back \u2014 as his infamous, much-mocked PSA from 2011 proves.\n\u201cSomething simple as a baby doll\u201d could be a place to \u201csecrete, or hide\u201d drugs, Adams warned parents in the video, demonstrating with a giant bag of presumably fake weed."

      "text": "New York is seeing the hidden toll of legal weed: violence, psychosis and mayhem\nNew York City ended 2024 with a series of horrific subway incidents linked by a hidden thread: the state\u2019s choice to legalize marijuana.\nJust days before Christmas, Debrina Kawam, a troubled New Jersey woman, was set on fire on an F train and burned to death, allegedly by Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala.\nZapeta-Calil was deported from the United States in 2018 but returned and was living in a Brooklyn homeless shelter. According to a shelter roommate, Zapeta-Calil was generally a normal, pleasant person who spoke with \u201cgood manners and respect\u201d \u2014 unless he was drunk or high on K2, a synthetic cannabinoid.\nHe was said to have a habit of chain-smoking K2, spending $30 daily on the illegal drug.\nK2 became a scourge in New York City about a decade ago. This unregulated substance \u2014 composed of plant material sprayed with hallucinogenic chemicals \u2014 was associated with erratic, sometimes violent behavior, in some cases reducing users to a \u201czombie-like\u201d state. A notorious 2018 incident saw 56 people hospitalized after smoking a bad batch.\nNew York cracked down on K2 by making the production of synthetic cannabinoids illegal in 2012 and banning their sale entirely in 2015. The city\u2019s health department launched an ad campaign warning users: \u201cK2: 0% Marijuana; 100% Dangerous.\u201d\nThe message was clear: Don\u2019t mistake K2 for a harmless substance like marijuana.\nBut this unusual public health crusade may have inadvertently contributed to the decriminalization of marijuana in 2019, as researchers declared that \u201cmore permissive cannabis law\u201d had the \u201cunintended benefit\u201d of reducing use of dangerous K2.\nMarijuana advocates have touted such studies to press for decriminalization or outright legalization of marijuana \u2014 with great success.\nHowever, K2 has persistent appeal.\nThe 2022 murder of Christina Yuna Lee in her Chinatown apartment shocked New Yorkers with its brutality. Her 25-year-old killer, Assamad Nash, when arrested a few days prior for another offense, was found with K2 in his pocket.\n\u201cCan I get my K2 back?\u201d he reportedly asked the arresting officer. \u201cI love K2.\u201d\nJordan Neely, the homeless and mentally ill man whose May 2023 outburst on the subway led to his incapacitation and death, was high on K2 at the time, which defense pathologists testified contributed to his demise.\nAdditionally, the legalization of marijuana in New York may have increased K2\u2019s availability.\nFollowing pot decriminalization, thousands of \u201csmoke shops\u201d sprang up throughout the city, sometimes several on a block, selling drug paraphernalia, unlicensed marijuana, and little bags of K2, labeled as \u201cpotpourri\u201d or \u201cincense.\u201d\nThe courts have thwarted police efforts to quickly close and padlock these illegal stores, ruling that doing so without a warrant or means of appeal is unconstitutional.\nIn practice, this allows the stores to keep selling illegal products \u2014 both unlicensed pot and synthetic drugs \u2014 under the counter.\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether \u201c100% marijuana,\u201d without any K2, is entirely benign.\nMarijuana has been linked to the early onset of schizophrenia in young people and is widely recognized for intensifying serious mental illness in those already affected.\nAdvocates often claim that pot has a calming effect on users, but overlook the fact that this mellowing typically gives way to irritability, crankiness and anger as the drug\u2019s effects wear off.\nTraffic fatalities in New York have risen sharply since marijuana was legalized. Pot advocates dispute this trend, but data from Canada reveal a surge in cannabis-related car crashes in the period immediately following national legalization.\nMarijuana legalization in New York has coincided with a rise in overdose deaths from stronger drugs. In 2019, the city saw 20.7 overdose deaths per 100,000 residents; by 2023, that number had more than doubled, to 44 per 100,000 \u2014 an increase that far outpaces the national rise during the same period.\nThe data suggest that marijuana legalization may condition people to view the use of harder drugs as more acceptable and \u201csafer.\u201d In this sense, pot may act as a societal \u201cgateway drug.\u201d\nOn the last day of 2024, horrified New Yorkers witnessed video of a man getting shoved directly into the path of a speeding 1 train in the tony Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. The alleged culprit, Kamel Hawkins, was arrested and charged with attempted murder.\nHis father, who lives with him, told reporters that his son\u2019s frequent pot smoking had affected his personality.\n\u201cWe think somebody put something in his weed,\u201d Hawkins\u2019 father said. \u201cAbout three weeks ago he was all right and then he started acting weird. We wanted to get him help but he refused.\u201d\nMaybe someone did put something in his weed \u2014 or maybe his weed was just weed.\nLinking any specific crime to the use of legal marijuana or illegal synthetic cannabinoids is hard enough, much less correlating legalization to broader crime trends.\nBut there certainly seem to be enough pot-related incidents occurring on the streets and in the subways of New York to raise the question of whether our laissez-faire experiment with drug use is working.\nSeth Barron\u2019s next book, \u201cWeaponized,\u201d will come out in 2025. Adapted from City Journal."

Ron DeSantis\nA push in Florida to legalize recreational marijuana is projected to fall short \u2014 in a win for Gov. Ron DeSantis who\u2019s railed against the measure.\nAmendment 3 needed a 60% supermajority in order to become law, but it received just shy of 56% support, according to the AP.\nThe amendment would have made Florida the 25th state in the country to fully legalize marijuana use for all purposes for people 21 years and older. Medicinal marijuana use is already legal in the state.\nDeSantis campaigned hard against Amendment 3, decrying it as a movement lobbied by the marijuana business to line their own pockets instead of something intended to expand the rights of voters, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t immaculately conceived. It was put on the ballot because one big weed company has now spent $100 million trying to pass it,\u201d DeSantis said at an event in late October. \u201cThis amendment is written to benefit this one big weed company.

      "text": "Cannabis use among seniors continues to rise \u2014 and so do the health risks\nNew data has revealed that cannabis use among older adults is at an all-time high.\nResearchers at UC San Diego and NYU discovered that marijuana use by Americans aged 65 and older increased by nearly 46% from 2021 to 2023, according to an NYU press release.\nAs more states legalize marijuana for recreational use, as well as for medicinal therapies, accessibility to the drug is more widespread, particularly among aging adults.\nThe research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that 7% of 15,000 adults in this age range reported using cannabis in the last month, according to 2023 data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\nThis was an increase from 4.8% in 2021 and 5.2% in 2022.\nWhile marijuana use surged in both men and women, it was more prevalent among women.\nThe research found that increased use was associated with health conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nThose with a college or post-grad degree, an annual income of $75,000 or more, married status and residence in a state with legalized medical cannabis were also more likely to partake.\n\u201cAdults with the highest incomes initially had the lowest prevalence of cannabis use versus other income levels, but by 2023, they had the highest prevalence, which may indicate better access to medical cannabis given its costs,\u201d the researchers noted in the study discussion.\n\u201cThe substantial increased prevalence in states with legalized medical cannabis highlights the importance of structural educational support for patients and clinicians in those states.\u201d\nThe researchers also warned that the use of cannabis products, especially with psychoactive properties, could cause complications in chronic disease management in older adults.\nThe study did not look at the frequency of cannabis use, cannabinoid type or recreational versus medical use.\nIn a statement sent to Fox News Digital, senior author Joseph Palamar, PhD, associate professor of population health at NYU Langone, noted his concern about cannabis use increasing among older populations.\nPalamar suggested the increased use is likely due to a combination of greater availability, decreased stigma and previous marijuana users aging into the 65+ cohort.\n\u201cMy worry is that some of these people may have adverse psychiatric reactions, especially if they use edibles,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to accidentally eat too much, and then there\u2019s no turning back once it\u2019s already ingested.\u201d\nIn a previous interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Barbara Krantz, medical director at Caron Treatment Centers in Florida, confirmed that she\u2019s seen a \u201csignificant uptick\u201d in cannabis use by individuals over 50.\nWhile polls have shown that most older Americans use cannabis to improve sleep, reduce pain, alleviate mental health issues and to relax, Krantz shared some potential dangers of the habit.\nThose include increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, stroke, increased hypertension and tachycardia, as well as worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nCannabis may also lead to interactions with other medications, which can increase their toxicity or decrease their effectiveness, Krantz cautioned.\nOther potential risks include balance issues, delayed reaction times, increased confusion or cognitive impairment, and heightened anxiety, depression or anger.\nThere could also be surgery-related risks, including complications due to anesthesia and delays in healing, the expert noted.\n\u201cSeniors should talk to their healthcare provider and their pharmacist before using any marijuana or cannabis product, because there are very real and specific dangers for older adults when using these substances,\u201d Krantz advised.\nFox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel commented on these findings during an appearance on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d on Tuesday, noting that regular use of cannabis can be dangerous if not tracked.\n\u201cYou might use a gummy to go to bed, and then the next thing, you\u2019re using two gummies, or three gummies, and it could increase anxiety, it can increase discombobulation, you\u2019re not thinking clearly, ER visits are on the increase,\u201d he cautioned.\n\u201cWe know about problems with the lungs,\u201d Siegel added. \u201cIt can accelerate dementia and can affect behavior.\u201d\nThe doctor likened the use of marijuana to the effects of smoking cigarettes in terms of damage to the heart and lungs.\n\u201cIt is absolutely an active chemical we need to watch out for, and I\u2019m very disturbed that the elderly are using it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve completely jumped the gun [on legalization] because people are going to the ER with psychosis. They\u2019re going there with vomiting disorders. They\u2019re having car accidents as a result,\u201d he went on.\n\u201cWe are studying Colorado ever since it was legalized there, and the results are not pretty. We definitely jumped the gun by not anticipating all the medical risks here.\u201d\nFox News Digital reached out to UC San Diego Medicine researchers for comment.\nFox News Digital\u2019s Melissa Rudy contributed to this report."

Anybody that would smoke cannabis knows there\u2019s no comparison, and that\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Tyson told the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d hosts on Monday.\nThe \u201cCoalition of Athletes and Entertainers Supporting President Trump\u2019s Policy Objectives,\u201d which also includes NBA star Kevin Durant and former NFL star Dez Bryant, penned a letter to the White House to plead their case.\nThe letter highlighted three main points in their proposed reform: clemency for \u201cnonviolent\u201d marijuana offenses, support for marijuana rescheduling, or, in other words, changing its current classification as a Schedule I substance to a Schedule III substance, and ending \u201cdiscriminatory banking practices.\u201d\nTyson said the group is working on \u201copen[ing] up\u201d safe banking for those in the cannabis business who are currently unable to get loans.\n\u201cThere\u2019s over 500,000 people that can\u2019t get loans because they\u2019re in the cannabis business alone and that\u2019s just so ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great income for the country\u2026\u201d\nHe also argued that cannabis is not a drug and is, instead, a form of medicine that gave him a new lease on life.\n\u201cI could not live, I was going crazy without cannabis. I was just going absolutely mad, fighting people in the street, giving wild responses back to people who said, \u2018Can I help you?\u2019 And then it\u2019s done so much for me. It\u2019s given me a new life, so to speak\u2026 all the reckless trouble I was getting into [as a kid], that\u2019s not happening now as an adult.\u201d\nThe letter from the series of athletes and entertainers also criticized former President Biden for failing to take action with regard to those incarcerated for the substance.\n\u201cNot only did he leave office without commuting the sentences of those incarcerated for marijuana, but in one of his final acts, he denied nearly every pending marijuana-related clemency application,\u201d the letter stated.\n\u201cThis betrayal only underscores the urgent need for bold leadership, we believe, and represents an opportunity to correct glaring disparities as part of your [the Trump] Administration\u2019s ongoing push for criminal justice reform.\u201d\nFox News\u2019 Jackson Thompson contributed to this report."

      "text": "Trump eyes reclassifying marijuana as less dangerous drug: report\nPresident Donald Trump is reportedly eyeing reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a move that could expand medical marijuana research and ease industry restrictions.\nAt a $1-million-a-plate fundraiser at his New Jersey golf club earlier this month, Trump told attendees he\u2019s interested in pursuing the change, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.\nFundraiser guests included Kim Rivers, chief executive officer of Trulieve, a top marijuana company, who encouraged Trump to pursue the change and expand medical marijuana research, said the report.\nFormer President Joe Biden was considering such a classification change that would have also made it easier to buy and sell weed before losing last year\u2019s presidential election to Trump.\nPot companies have poured millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s political groups and have hired some of Washington\u2019s top lobbyists and advisers to Trump, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nTrump last year backed a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in Florida, which narrowly failed to secure the 60% of voters\u2019 support it needed to pass.\nWeed has been legal in New York for medical purposes since 2016 and recreational purposes since 2021.\n\u201cAll policy and legal requirements and implications are being considered. The only interest guiding the president\u2019s policy decisions is what is in the best interest of the American people,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson."

Critics argue that legalization has led to increased public drug use, crime rates, and addiction, particularly among youth and vulnerable populations. Studies indicate that marijuana use has risen significantly since legalization, with some experts warning of its potential to exacerbate mental health issues and contribute to a rise in addiction rates. The article also touches on political movements surrounding marijuana reform, including President Trump's consideration of reclassifying the drug to facilitate its sale and research.",
