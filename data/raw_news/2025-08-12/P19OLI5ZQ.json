  "description": "How to book indigenous travel, sustainable travel and nature travel with the Navajo, whose old ways teach us to forge deeper connections in our modern world.",
  "content": "The Navajo Nation in northern Arizona encompasses a profoundly beautiful landscape, painted in a turquoise and adobe palette as far as the eye can see. When the Colorado River carved out the Grand Canyon, it sliced through many miles of red rock country to sculpt Horseshoe Bend and Antelope Canyon, some of the most extraordinary natural wonders in the world.\n\nThe Navajo own more than 27,000 square miles in Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, more than Rhode Island, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Delaware combined. With the exception of the Grand Canyon, which runs adjacent, this haunting southwestern landscape is home to over 250,000 Navajo people. (In total, there are over 450,000 Navajo, the largest Native American tribe in the United States.)\n\nNothing brings the land and indigenous culture alive like being guided and hosted by the Navajo themselves, together with Navajo Parks and Recreation,a the national park service for the Navajo Nation. In the area known as the Four Corners, outside Page, Arizona, the Navajo own and operate a growing number of tourism businesses, many family-run in this tight-knit community. They open their land, share traditional foods and hospitality, offer guided tours through the majestic slot canyons and horseback riding around Horseshoe Bend. They share their music and culture of story-telling. For visitors, it can be a life-changing experience.\n\nDriving north of Flagstaff near Cameron, a small town about an hour and a half from the Grand Canyon's South Rim, sisters Brenda and Velda Begay of Ts\u00e9 Bighanilini Tours point out breathtaking views in the direction of Lake Powell and the Vermilion Cliffs. Mesquite and sagebrush dot the sandstone cliffs. Signs for \u201cNavajo Arts and Crafts for Sale,\u201d point to small stands where Navajo artists and jewelry makers sell their work.\n\nCameron Trading Post, a roadside restaurant, features fry bread, Navajo tacos, elk burgers, venison stew and local trout, and it is well worth a stop. There are vegetarian dishes, too: three sisters (corn, beans and squash), pumpkin bread or sumac pudding, with berries, agave and sumac. The Trading Post is also an indigenous retail hub that carries beautiful hand-woven blankets, jewelry, clothing.\n\nPulling into Page, Arizona, mid-afternoon is a perfect time to tour Owl and Rattlesnake canyons with Black Streak Canyon Tours. Most visitors to Northern Arizona tend to bypass these lesser-known canyons, and that is a big mistake. Owl and Rattlesnake are smaller than the flashier Upper and Lower Antelope canyons, for sure, but each holds its own special attraction. Chances are, you and your knowledgeable guide will be the only visitors. If you are lucky, Owl Canyon will share something priceless. Look up and you may see a huge owl peering down at you like a statue, perched on the rust-red rock.\n\nFor an experience unlike any other, book a stay in a hogan at Shash Din\u00e9 EcoRetreat, a Native American off-the-grid glamping retreat on a private ranch on the Navajo Nation.\n\nThe hogan is a traditional Navajo dwelling, according to Baya Meehan, owner of Shash Din\u00e9 (Din\u00e9 means \u201cBear People,\u201d which is what the Navajo call themselves), and it holds a place of cultural and spiritual significance. The Shash Din\u00e9 hogans were constructed from juniper logs by a master craftsman, then covered with mud or clay. \u201cNo screws or nails hold the logs together, they\u2019re simply placed correctly,\u201d she says. \u201cFor us, a hogan is like coming back to your roots, or grandma\u2019s house.\u201d There is a male and female style (the female is octagonal, the male is more of a conical shape) which is representative of the duality of life, she says: \u201cMore like yin and yang, less directly related to traditional gender.\u201d\n\nIn addition to two hogans at Shash Din\u00e9, guests can choose between three glamping tents, one \u201ckyoob\u201d\u2014a modern cube-shaped structure\u2014or two sheepherder wagons (restored from actual 19th-century trail wagons).\n\n\u201cShash Din\u00e9 is so beautiful and serene,\u201d says Rupert, \u201cand it can be life-changing. They teach you that you can live without a 30-minute shower, a heater, or air-conditioning.\u201d Depending on the season, temperatures can be quite comfortable; spring and fall are perfect times to go.\n\nMeehan lives on the ranch with her husband and children, who care for a herd of grazing Navajo Churro Sheep and Angora Goats, along with several very friendly Great Pyrenees. When it\u2019s time, she shears the sheep and gives the wool to local weavers. The puppies find homes with local farmers and ranchers.\n\nShe prepares dinner, which could be a delicious lamb and squash stew soaked up with fry bread, followed by vibrant storytelling and drumming. In the remote setting, the full moon radiates a bright light, the sky is thick with stars and there is an unearthly quiet as you tuck under a handwoven Navajo blanket, fire crackling in the wood stove, sipping Navajo tea\u2013made with Green Thread, a flowering plant with a long stem that is chopped, then roasted.\n\nIt\u2019s not for everyone. You need a taste for the rustic, a deep curiosity and an adventurous spirit. There is a shared bathhouse (with modern sinks and showers), an outhouse and the hogans have dirt floors. The home-cooked food is delicious, but you don\u2019t get to choose from a menu. Nonetheless, a stay at Shash Din\u00e9 offers a deep dive into Navajo culture, and it may just be the best vacation you never knew you needed. In this otherworldly landscape, of this earth and not of this earth, everything is off the grid because, \u201cThe point of being here is to connect with nature,\u201d says Meehan. \u201cPeople are in love with the idea that Native Americans are so connected to the earth,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut we all are. Everyone is. And regardless of who you are, that\u2019s what everyone needs.\u201d\n\nThe morning may bring a sunrise hike, followed by breakfast\u2013corn porridge, fresh fruit, coffee or more Navajo tea\u2013then a long-anticipated visit to Upper and Lower Antelope canyons. Antelope Canyon starts or ends at Lake Powell and goes on for 18 miles, with curved red rock formations carved deep into the earth, though of course, visitors only explore a small part of it.\n\nExplore the Slot Canyons on the Navajo Nation\n\nA Lower Antelope Canyon Tour, with Dixie\u2019s Lower Antelope Tours, begins with a 74-foot descent down five flights of stairs into the canyon\u2013carved by wind, water and erosion\u2013followed by a climb on ladders with handrails through 1.1 miles, all easily traversed with the right shoes. A tour of Upper Antelope with Ts\u00e9 Bighanilini Tours (\u201dthe place where water runs through rocks\u201d) features a few narrow passageways and ends with a beautiful 20-minute hike around the top of the canyon. Touring the canyons with Navajo guides not only provides personal history and cultural context, there may be singing, an exquisite acoustical experience in this setting.\n\nIf you go in the early afternoon, the light shoots in like a sunbeam, and reflections from the sky may lend a haunting bluish tinge. Sunlight reflects back on the surrounding sandstone cliffs, painting a new picture every minute. The Navajo call it \u201cwhere water makes a picture of itself in the stone,\u201d and it is truly humbling.\n\nEnd the day at the Red Heritage Indigenous Entertainment Hall in Page, and savor green pork chili, Navajo fry bread, beans and rice while watching traditional hoop dance drumming, weaving demonstrations.\n\nTravelers are left filled with respect and awe for people whose old ways and time-tried knowledge of land stewardship and sustainable practices have a lot to teach us about forging deeper connections in our modern world. \u201cWe just do what Mother Nature allows us to,\u201d says Tilford Bedoni, co-owner of Dineh Tours, offering awe-inspiring tours of Horseshoe Bend and Upper and Lower Antelope canyons.\n\nEverything on the Navajo Nation is owned and operated by the tribal people, keeping it in \u201cthe family\u201d so to speak, which provides economic development and enables them to control their own narrative. Meanwhile, visitors gain unique access to remote land and forge one-on-one connections with generous and hospitable Navajo tour guides, hotel and restaurant owners, designers and craftspeople who open a wide window to their culture, land and traditions\u2014and a truly life-changing experience that is uniquely at one with nature.\n\nHow to Book Sustainable Travel with the Navajo\n\nThere are 574 federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and villages, according to AINTA. Not all host sustainable travel experiences, but fortunately, many do. It\u2019s easy to book a trip through nativeamerica.travel. In the Navajo Nation area near Page, AZ, the award-winning Navajo tour operators highlighted in this story all offer an incredible experience.",

      "text": "From elephant sanctuaries up north in Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai to the beautiful beaches of Phuket and Koh Samui, Thailand is a tropical vacation paradise, and has been long before White Lotus chose it as the location for Season Three.\nSince then, however, the Land of Smiles has seen a sustained spike in tourism\u2013especially among wellness-seekers. The new Destination Thailand visa, which allows visitors to remain for up to 180 consecutive days over a course of five years, is attracting a lot of newcomers, too.\nBut guests won\u2019t find any crowds at Trisara, one of the most luxuriously understated, supremely relaxing spots on Phuket. Trisara translates to \u201cgarden in the third heaven,\u201d and you will surely feel as though you\u2019ve found your own slice of heaven right there. Set on a protected 17-acre nature preserve with lush gardens and a tropical rain forest, Trisara also hugs one of the most pristine horseshoe beaches on the island, facing the crystalline Adaman Sea\u2013and it\u2019s private. Surrounded by nature, embraced by warm hospitality, tranquility and well-being envelops you like a soft breeze as you settle in for a serenely restorative stay.\nThe breathtaking Thai-owned estate features 39 villas\u2013each with its own infinity pool, along with jaw-dropping views of the Sea\u2013and was designed by Mom Tri Davkul, an acclaimed Thai artist and architect, to include classic Thai elements (dramatic sloping roofs with terracotta tiles for the resort buildings, elegant minimalist interiors for the villas) that feel modern and timeless, \u201cbringing Thai culture and the beauty of Thai artistry to the forefront,\u201d says Claudia Schwarze, General Manager.\nNew Ecotherapy Initiatives\nIn addition to its beauty and authentic sense of place, there is a respect for nature at Trisara, reflected in a deeply rooted commitment to sustainability. For example, when the resort was built 15 years ago, rather than cutting down trees, the builders moved them, then moved back after construction.\nTrisara recently brought on a new Director of Ecotherapy (ecotherapy is the idea that experiences in nature improve mental, physical, spiritual wellness) and is in the process of creating new wellness programs and nature therapies inspired by the extraordinary natural setting, especially the crystal clear water.\nA massive coral reef, visible from the beach, is a protected part of Surinet National Park, which also features magnificent mangrove forests and beaches. Schwarze brought in a team of marine biologists for a reef audit. \u201cWe were amazed at the health of the reef,\u201d she says, \u201cand the incredible number\u2013and variety\u2014of fish. You don\u2019t walk on the reef, because it damages the ecosystem. We are finding the right way to work with rangers and biologists to provide education and be socially responsible,\u201d she continues.\nIn addition to snorkeling and diving programs already in place, there will free-diving at the reef, based on the Wim Hof breathing method. \u201cBreath is related to mindfulness,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you get anxious, you need to get back to breath.\u201d\nThai Wellness Spa\nThe award-winning Jara Spa features six treatment rooms and a menu of Thai-inspired wellness treatments with some products, such as the heady lemongrass oil and balm, made on property from locally grown plants and Thai herbs. Natural light floods the spa cabines and if your eyes flutter open during a Thai Luk Pra Kob Massage (with herbal compresses drawn from Thai Medicine) and you peer down from the massage table, you\u2019ll see beautiful white lotus flowers in a black lacquer bowl.\nMichelin Green Cuisine\nTrisara was recently awarded a Michelin Key and hosts two uniquely different Michelin-starred restaurants. The elegant PRU (Plant. Raise. Understand), the first Michelin-starred restaurant in Phuket, is helmed by Chef Jimmy Ophorst. And Jampa, a zero-waste, closed-loop Michelin Green Star restaurant run by Chef Rick Dingen, is surrounded by the idyllic Pru Jampa Farm, source of organic locally grown fruit, vegetables, herbs and edible flowers, grown and harvested for the restaurants by a team of local farmers. It is a short drive away, at Tri Vananda, an integrative residential wellness community connected to Trisara.\nEcotherapy offerings are expanding at Pru Jampa Farm, where free-roaming geese, ducks and chickens live surrounded by cacao trees and jasmine and pink ginger flowers, and bee-keeping provides a source of honey. Guests can enjoy a farm-to-table outdoor lunch and sign up their children for the Little Farmers program, where kids can help plant trees, and learn about sustainable agriculture and gastronomy. (There is also a Little Mariners program at Trisara, where kids explore marine life on the beach, and learn how to protect it.)\nCoral Reef and Beach Bounty\nIf you want to spend low-key days lolling around on the beach or at the pool, fair enough. Activities in the water also include snorkeling, kayaking, windsurfing, sailing and stand-up paddle boarding, as well as fishing, private charters and diving out by the reef. There is a range of classes, for example, beach stretching, yoga, trail hikes, marine discovery, Muay Thai (Thai boxing). Take a nature walk before dinner and listen to the chatter of the birds. Sip a cocktail at the Thai Library, serving southern Thai cuisine, or the new open-air 7.8 N bar (reflecting the coordinates of Phuket) and watch the sunset stripe the sky in shades of lavender and rose.\nFor casual dining, the Cielo & Spice menu reflects the Silk Road, from Asia to Italy. It is the spot where guests enjoy a delicious breakfast. La Crique is a \u201creimaging of nouvelle cuisine,\u201d with counter dining for solo guests. Menus change often, depending upon what is available at the Farm.\nNo matter how much you decide to dial it up or down, you cannot help but tap into the heart of a very soulful spot, where relaxation comes as naturally as breathing. At Trisara, even the plants are happy. You can read their body language as they stretch toward the sun. No doubt you will, too.\nGetting There\nI\u2019ve traveled on Cathay Pacific since my very first trip to Thailand years ago. The hub is Hong Kong, which makes it easy to connect anywhere in Asia, including Phuket\u2013and the airline just launched nonstop flights from Dallas to Hong Kong.\nCathay keeps elevating (no pun intended) and has recently partnered with two of Hong Kong\u2019s top Michelin-starred restaurants, Duddell\u2019s and Louise, to create delicious new dining options in business class. They started a recycling program back in 2001, and continue to set new and loftier goals each year. And they were the first airline to invest in sustainable biofuel research and development, with a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\u201cOur environmental focus continues to be on climate change and a circular economy,\u201d says CEO Ronald Lam. \u201cAs a pioneer and early adopter of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), we continue to work towards fostering a local SAF ecosystem and expanding SAF usage globally, while acknowledging the challenges and opportunities ahead.\u201d"
