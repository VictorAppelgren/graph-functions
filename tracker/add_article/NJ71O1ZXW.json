      "summary": "U.S. businesses are grappling with pricing decisions amid six months of White House tariffs, especially on imported copper, with companies like Thompson Traders uncertain if consumers will accept higher costs. A Fed survey shows 38% of firms are unsure about pricing and 60% unsure about material costs for 2025, while Fed Chair Powell notes tariff effects on consumer prices are now visible and likely to accumulate. Small‑medium businesses lacking financing face heightened risk, with 13% fearing survival in two years, and mid‑market firms report rising supply‑chain concerns. Tariff uncertainty is reshaping pricing, supply chains, and financial planning across the U.S. economy.",
