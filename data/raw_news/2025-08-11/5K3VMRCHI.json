  "content": "At least one person is dead as another person remains missing with at least 10 injured following a series of explosions at a steel plant in Clairton, Pennsylvania, on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, on Monday, Aug. 11, officials said.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said that the U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works plant was the site of \"multiple explosions,\" and that search-and-rescue efforts continued at the scene as of a statement posted to social media just after 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Allegany County Police Department confirmed that one person died in a statement posted to Facebook just before 4:30 p.m. ET. The department stated that one person previously believed to be missing had been located and transported to a local hospital. The second person believed to be missing remains unaccounted for, the statement added.\n\nNine other people were transported to area hospitals to receive treatment for a variety of injuries, according to the department.\n\nVideo of the explosions, which took place around 10:30 a.m. ET, was captured by the BreatheProject, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit that advocates for improvements to air quality in southwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nThe video shows a plume of dark smoke rising from the plant that continued to spew for over 25 minutes.\n\nThe Allegheny County Department of Health issued a statement saying it was \"actively monitoring the explosion\" in coordination with first responders.\n\nResidents within one mile of the plant were being advised \"out of an abundance of caution\" to remain indoors, close windows and doors and set their home cooling units to recirculation. Air quality monitors had not detected levels of toxins above federal standards, the department said.\n\n\"If you\u2019re in the area, continue to follow the instructions of local authorities,\" Shapiro said in his statement.\n\nU.S. Steel Executive Vice President Scott Buckiso told reporters at an afternoon news conference that the plant is stable except for the two coke oven batteries that were shut down after the 10:50 a.m. explosion. An investigation into the cause has begun as part of the search for the missing worker.\n\n\"It's an ongoing rescue effort for the one person that is still not accounted for,'' Buckiso said. \"We think we know the general location of that employee, but we're not 100% sure.''",

      "text": "Explosion 'like thunder' rocks Pa. steel plant; 1 dead, 10 injured: Live updates\nOne person has been killed, one is missing and 10 were injured following an explosion Monday at a steel plant in Clairton, Pennsylvania, on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, officials said.\nAllegheny County Emergency Services and the Allegheny County Police Department responded to the blast at the U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works plant and confirmed the fatality in a social media statement.\nOne the two persons initially reported missing was rescued, joining the list of those injured and transported to a local hospital, according to Victor Joseph, assistant superintendent of the county police.\nU.S. Steel Executive Vice President Scott Buckiso told reporters at an afternoon news conference the plant is stable except for the two structures shut down after the 10:50 a.m. explosion. An investigation into the cause has begun amid the search for the missing worker.\n\"It's an ongoing rescue effort for the one person that is still not accounted for,'' Buckiso said. \"We think we know the general location of that employee, but we're not 100% sure.''\nConstruction worker Zachary Buday, who was near the steel plant when the explosion happened, told WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh that it \"sounded like thunder.\"\n\"It shook my chest. It shook the building, then we saw the dark smoke rising from the steel mill,\" he said. \"Put two and two together. It's like something bad happened.''\nThe station also reported five of the 10 injured persons had been released from the hospital by 4 p.m. ET.\nThe moment of the blast, followed by large plumes of smoke shooting high into the air, is captured live in video from the BreatheProject, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit that advocates for improvements to air quality in southwestern Pennsylvania.\nGov. Shapiro says 'multiple explosions' took place at plant\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said on social media the steel plant was the site of \"multiple explosions,'' and that his administration will provide whatever resources are required.\n\"Injured employees have now been transported to local hospitals to receive care, and search-and-rescue efforts remain active at the plant,'' Shapiro said. \"If you\u2019re in the area, continue to follow the instructions of local authorities.''\nU.S. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania said on social media he went to the plant Monday and spoke with officials, workers and members of the community.\n\"Search and rescue still underway, air is safe but remain inside,'' he said. \"This is still an active scene.''\nResidents near plant advised to stay indoors\nThe Allegheny County Department of Health issued a statement saying it was \"actively monitoring the explosion\" in coordination with first responders.\nResidents within one mile of the plant were being advised \"out of an abundance of caution\" to remain indoors, close windows and doors and set their home cooling units to recirculation. Air quality monitors had not detected levels of toxins above federal standards, the department said.\nTwo workers at steel plant injured in February fire\nA fire at the plant Feb. 5 injured two workers after a buildup of gases ignited, the Allegheny Front reported.\nThe Allegheny County Health Department said in a statement at the time that the incident was the result of a \u201chydraulic failure in a switch of the batters which led to a buildup of combustible material,\u201d which then ignited.\nThe statement said a \u201cboom\u201d was heard and emissions leaked from the facility. The workers received first aid at the plant, were taken to a local hospital and released, the Allegheny Front reported.\nThe Allegheny County Department of Health has a webpage that includes recent legal actions dating to 2018 against the plant, including penalties for emissions violations, leaks and process and equipment failures.\nWhere is U.S. Steel Clairton Coke Works?\nClairton is about 20 miles south of Pittsburgh. The Clairton Plant is the largest coke manufacturing facility in the country and serves the commercial coke market as well as U.S. Steel's steelmaking facilities, according to U.S. Steel.\nThe longtime manufacturing icon, whose origins date back to the 19th century, was acquired in June by Nippon Steel, Japan's biggest steelmaker, in a $14.9 billion transaction.\nThe Clairton plant operates 10 coke oven batteries and annually produces more than 4 million tons of coke, a type of fuel used in the steelmaking process, per U.S. Steel.\nWhat is a coking plant?\nA coking plant turns coal into coke, which is in turn used to make steel in a blast furnace. The coal is softened, then liquified and re-solidified into coke. Coal in a coking plant is heated without oxygen to temperatures as high as 1,125 degrees Fahrenheit, removing its impurities. The resulting coke is a porous, carbon-heavy material.\nContributing: Reuters"
