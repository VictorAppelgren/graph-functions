  "title": "New Authentication Bypass in Active Directory and Entra ID Environments",
  "description": "At Black Hat USA 2025, Dirk-jan Mollema showed how low-privilege cloud accounts can be turned into hybrid admins, bypassing API controls undetected.",
  "content": "At last week\u2019s Black Hat event in Las Vegas, Dirk-jan Mollema, hacker, security researcher, and founder of Outsider Security, outlined a set of techniques for bypassing authentication in hybrid Active Directory (AD) and Entra ID environments. If successfully executed, these methods can allow an attacker to impersonate any synced hybrid user, including privileged accounts.\n\nIn the intro for his presentation, Mollema wrote: \u201cIs there a security boundary between Active Directory and Entra ID in a hybrid environment? The answer to this question, while still somewhat unclear, has changed over the past few years as there has been more hardening of how much \u2018the cloud\u2019 trusts data from on-premises. The reason for this is that many threat actors, including APTs (advanced persistent threats), have been making use of known lateral movement techniques to compromise the cloud from AD.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding the weaknesses in Active Directory and Entra ID\n\nIn one demonstration, Mollema showed how a low-privilege cloud account could be converted into a hybrid user, thereby granting him administrative rights without raising any alarms in the process. He also demonstrated how it\u2019s possible to modify internal API policies and bypass access enforcement controls under certain conditions.\n\nBut the vulnerabilities don\u2019t stop there. By taking advantage of hybrid configurations with Microsoft Exchange, the hacker can impersonate virtually any Exchange mailbox \u2014 ultimately giving them access to all of the emails, documents, and attachments within.\n\nMicrosoft has been aware of these flaws for some time. The company has issued patches to address some of the more serious vulnerabilities, such as strengthening security for global administrators and removing certain API permissions from synchronized accounts. However, the vulnerability won\u2019t be fully solved until the separation of Microsoft\u2019s hybrid Exchange and Entra ID services occurs in October 2025.\n\nIn the meantime, Microsoft Exchange users can minimize their risk by implementing these security measures:\n\u2022 Auditing any and all synchronization servers.\n\u2022 Restricting users to only the necessary permissions.\n\nHybrid environments are only as strong as their weakest link. Until Microsoft finalizes its service separation, the best defense against these AD and Entra ID vulnerabilities involves consistent server log auditing, proactive API monitoring, and maintaining least-privilege access policies across the board.\n\nSecurity in the hybrid era isn\u2019t just about waiting for the next patch; it\u2019s also about staying one step ahead of hackers and remaining vigilant at all times.\n\u2022 Black Hat 2025: Security Researcher Unpacks Cybercrime\u2019s Evolution\u2026 and How AI Is Changing the Game\n\u2022 What Keeps Cyber Experts Up at Night?

      "text": "\u201cSingle sign-on\u201d (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to enter one set of authentication credentials to access multiple websites, applications, and services. The goal of SSO is to streamline the authentication process by eliminating the need to enter different usernames and passwords for each resource.\nAlthough several SSO options exist, they all strive to offer benefits to both users and businesses.\nHow Single Sign-on Works\nSingle sign-on involves authenticating a user\u2019s identity and then authorizing them to access the service or application that the user is requesting. It achieves this by retrieving the user\u2019s profile, which is securely stored in the SSO system, HR system, or a directory like Microsoft\u2019s Active Directory.\nSSO validates the user\u2019s credentials, such as their correct username and password. It can also add extra security layers and validate additional information like the user\u2019s IP address, location, time of day, device info, and physical checks to add additional layers of security beyond the traditional login methods.\n- IP address: Some SSO solutions offer a security feature that verifies the user\u2019s IP address when they attempt to log in.\n- Date and timestamp: Verifies the current date and time on the device against an authentication server to validate that the device is synced with the server.\n- Geolocation: Checks the user\u2019s location before granting access to resources to prevent unauthorized access from suspicious locations.\n- Device information: Examines the status of the device. These checks can include operating system versions, if the device has the most up-to-date security patches and updates, or if the organization approves and manages the device.\n- Biometrics: Scans a user\u2019s physical attributes, such as facial features or fingerprints, to validate the requestor\u2019s identity.\nAs previously mentioned, the goal is to add extra layers of security to validate user authentication. SSO is similar to another authentication method known as multi-factor authentication.\nTypes of SSO Solutions\nAll SSO services aim to streamline the authentication process. However, several types of single sign-on (SSO) solutions exist to be considered. These include password synchronization, enterprise SSO, federated SSO, web SSO, and mobile SSO:\n- Password Synchronization: This is the simplest and most common form of SSO, where a single username and password are automatically updated and used across different systems or platforms.\n- Enterprise SSO: This service captures user credentials via a browser extension or software agent. The service then replays the credentials to different applications or websites.\n- Federated SSO: Federated SSOs use a standard protocol, such as OAuth or OpenID Connect, to exchange user credentials and information between different systems or domains. The user logs in to an identity provider (IdP), like Google or Microsoft, and then the IdP sends a token to the requested service provider (SP), like Spotify. The service verifies the user\u2019s identity with the identity provider and grants access.\n- Web SSO: This service uses cookies to maintain user sessions across different web applications or resources within the same network. The user logs into a centralized server and is granted a session cookie to access all resources on the same server. Although web SSOs can improve the user\u2019s web browsing experience, they can also lead to security issues if the cookie is stolen or tampered with.\n- Mobile SSO: Mobile SSOs leverage a mobile device\u2019s native features, such as biometric authentication with a face scan or fingerprint, to authenticate users on mobile applications or websites without entering their credentials.\nWhen choosing the type of SSO service, organizations must review their networks and infrastructure to determine which one works best for them. However, there are also several benefits to implementing the right SSO service.\nKey Benefits of Using SSO for Organizations\nUsers and organizations can benefit from using SSO solutions. Some of these benefits include improved security, better access control, and an overall increase in production:\n- Improved security: SSO can improve security by enabling security features like strong passwords, multifactor authentication, and device checks before granting access.\n- Centralized access control: Administrators and IT staff can manage permissions and access levels from a single point. SSOs can also help with logging and monitoring user accounts and activities.\n- Increased user productivity: SSO enhances productivity by eliminating the need to use and remember multiple passwords to gain access to every resource. SSO requires users to use one set of credentials to access multiple applications. Users can leverage more resources to improve their productivity and efficiency by reducing password fatigue.\nSSOs benefits depend on the type of SSO service and vendor. For example, enterprise password managers provide a single place for users to authenticate and manage their credentials. This offers credential management for each integrated resource and delivers an SSO experience to the user.\nAdditional administrative features in enterprise password managers include assigning and revoking access to certain apps, viewing password health among the user base, triggering additional authentication measures, and connecting to services like Microsoft Active Directory.\nIntegrating SSO with Multi-factor Authentication\nSSO is all about users gaining access to all of their resources with a single authentication. In contrast, multi-factor authentication (MFA) focuses on the stronger verification of the user\u2019s identity, which is often used for a single application. MFA requires users to authenticate by providing additional information beyond their login credentials. Examples of the extra information are things you may know, currently possess, or have biologically:\n- Something you know: These can be things users must memorize, like PIN codes or answers to personal questions.\n- Something you have: This form of authentication involves using a physical object like a physical token, an app on your device that produces a code, or an authentication key like a YubiKey or USB device.\n- Something you are: Users authenticate into the resource by using their physical attributes. These include biometric scans like fingerprint and retina scanners.\nWhile SSO can be used for most systems and applications, MFA can be added to access more sensitive information. For example, SSO credentials can give users access to several routine systems, such as email. But when you try to use the corporate VPN or enter systems via a smartphone, an MFA code is required as a further authentication method. After validating the user, the single sign-on system allows access to the requested resource.\nAs cloud networks, work-from-home, and bring your own device (BYOD) have evolved, tiered access has become more prevalent. In addition, as most network breaches occur through stolen or hacked passwords, multi-factor authentication and network access controls increasingly complement single sign-on. Finally, MFA is often a requirement for regulated data as a way of satisfying government mandates.\n3 Best SSO Providers\nSSO products help teams manage user identities and grant access to company applications. They play a critical role in protecting sensitive data and applications because SSO reduces the risk that a threat actor could hack an application. While there are many to choose from, three that stand out: Okta, OneLogin, and Microsoft Entra ID.\nOkta\nOkta is a popular IAM and SSO provider that offers many identity management features, including temporary access and device assurance policies. Okta\u2019s thousands of prebuilt app connectors make it one of the best SSO solutions.\nOkta offers a 30-day free trial with their SSO service starting at $2 per user, per month. They also offer several other features for an additional cost per feature.\nOneLogin\nOneLogin is an enterprise-grade IAM platform for workforces and customers. It offers MFA, advanced directory features, mobile identity management, command line tools, and API access for developers.\nOneLogin has a free trial, their advanced plan starts at $4 per user a month, and professional plans start at $8 per user a month when bundled with other services. They also provide pricing options for SMBs under 50 employees.\nMicrosoft Entra ID\nMicrosoft Entra ID is an identity governance and management platform for Windows organizations. Entra ID integrates with other Microsoft products like Defender for Cloud and Sentinel. It also offers passwordless authentication, lifecycle management, and custom session length features.\nMicrosoft has a free plan that has some partial IAM features. Their P1 plan starts at $6 a user and their P2 plan starts at $9 per user a month after a 30-day free trial.\nTo the full list of solutions with their features, pros and cons, and pricing, read our best single-sign-on solutions article.\nSSO solutions can bring many benefits to your organization. However, IT and security team members must implement them properly to avoid potential complications.\nCommon Challenges of Implementing SSO\nAs mentioned before, SSO has many benefits. However, SSO also has limitations and potential risks if not implemented properly. Not knowing what applications and resources you have before installing new technologies can cause compatibility issues, bottlenecks, and security risks:\n- Compatibility issues: While SSOs integrate with several applications and programs, many are incompatible. Organizations should be careful when choosing an SSO provider. Otherwise, they can face challenges when integrating it into their network.\n- Single point of failure: While SSOs provide simplicity by only using one set of credentials to access several resources, it is also a significant concern that SSOs can create a single point of failure. For example, if the SSO system crashes, users may be unable to access any connected applications or services.\n- Phishing: If a user\u2019s SSO credentials are compromised in a phishing or social engineering attack, the attacker could gain access to all connected systems associated with that user.\nAs with any technology, it\u2019s important to have a full and clear picture of the landscape before implementation. Performing routine checks of your network and systems not only helps you keep your infrastructure secure and up to date, but it also will help you prepare for any upgrades like implementing SSO services.\n4 Best Practices for Using SSO\nSSO systems will not be effective if organizations aren\u2019t following best practices. They must clearly understand their infrastructure, employ strong authentication policies, use encryption to protect sensitive information, and keep a close eye on your network. Here are some key practices to assist you in your implementation process:\n- Clearly define the SSO strategy: Organizations must ensure the SSO solutions they explore are compatible with their existing networks and infrastructure. They should also consider options for their organization\u2019s growth and scalability, unique needs for the company, compliance with standards and regulations, and other needs.\n- Use strong authentication: If your password is compromised, attackers will have access to all your applications. Therefore, you should use strong passwords or passkeys and add multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security.\n- Use strong encryption: Ensure all credentials and data transmitted across your network are encrypted. This helps prevent malicious actors from intercepting tokens during a user\u2019s session. Encryption protects sensitive data and ensures the information remains confidential.\n- Implement logging and monitoring: Real-time monitoring allows IT and security teams to see who is accessing what resource, when they are doing it, and from where in real-time. This allows them to more efficiently detect and respond to any issues or suspicious activity and enhance your organization\u2019s security posture.\nEnsuring a robust SSO system involves more than just finding the best technology or vendor. It is recommended that companies thoroughly review their network security architecture and research different vendors and solutions before deploying it.\nBottom Line: SSO Provides a Strategic Approach to Security\nSingle sign-on streamlines access and bolsters security. However, while the benefits of SSO are significant, organizations must also carefully consider potential challenges. By following best practices, businesses can use SSO to create a secure and efficient environment. Therefore, a well-planned strategy is essential for any organization to enhance its security posture and increase user productivity and overall experience.\nFor more information on security best practices and their benefits, check out this article."

The light free software requires no integration and has low system requirements.\nPros\nCons\nTop 5 Features of Active Directory Security\nThe top five features of Active Directory security harden, monitor, and enable quick reactions to attacks through examination of connections, integrating with existing security infrastructure, change monitoring, rapid alerts, and inspection of user and group permissions.\nAD Forest Inspection\nAD Forest inspection examines the connections between assets (data, devices, etc.), users (individuals, system functions, APIs, etc.), and groups (authorization categories). The examination focuses on Tier0 assets that can directly control the most secure levels of Active Directory and checks for excessive permissions and dangerous attack paths.\nAlert & Log Integration\nSecurity professionals require alerts and logs from AD security to integrate with existing SIEM, SOAR, and other network security tools. The sheer volume of information coming from security infrastructure will quickly overwhelm a team if they need to implement, learn, and monitor separate processes just for Active Directory.\nAD Changes Auditing\nAD security tools monitor and record details related to changes to active directory and permit change auditing to verify authenticity. All tools need to record changes, better tools enable roll-back of unauthorized changes, and the best tools can automatically detect and reverse unapproved changes.\nReal-Time Alerts\nReal-time alerts enable security teams to capture information on potential threats promptly and react quickly. In an environment of continuous attacks, security teams can no longer wait to check log files individually and require systems to identify, prioritize, and rapidly bring potential threats to the forefront.\nUser & Group Access Auditing\nUser and group access auditing inspects access rights for individuals and the user group classifications used to manage group permissions. AD provides manual functionality, but effective AD security tools enable users to quickly expose potentially dangerous issues such as excessive administrator rights, weak passwords, non-expiring passwords, and continuing access for terminated employees.\nHow I Evaluated the Best Active Directory Security Tools\nThe evaluation of the AD security tools weighed five different criteria, with the most emphasis placed on overall features. Each category contained a number of sub-criteria with their own weights that helped produce a five-point rating for each category and in total. After determining the top six tools based on their overall score, I considered the tools\u2019 pros, cons, and features to identify strong use cases for each solution.\nEvaluation Criteria\nTo evaluate the tools, I focused primarily on the breadth of features needed for active directory security. Next, I considered usability, support availability, and price and licensing information.\n- Audit and harden features (30%): Assesses tool capabilities to check accounts for vulnerabilities, identify attack paths, harden security, and manage rights effectively.\n- Criterion winner: Tenable Identity Exposure\n- Monitoring, response, and recovery features (30%): Examines tool capabilities to monitor changes, issue alerts, aid investigations, and provide compliance reports.\n- Criterion winner: Netwrix Auditor\n- Ease of use (15%): Considers the number of installations, dashboards, and agents to provide AD security, other identities managed (Okta, 365, etc.), and installation options.\n- Criterion winner: Tenable Identity Exposure\n- Price and licensing info (15%): Bases evaluations on price and licensing information transparency, the number of licenses required, and free tools and trials available.\n- Criterion winner: SolarWinds Access Rights Manager\n- Support availability (10%): Considers the different support options for everyday use and initial installation, support hours, and premium support options.\n- Criterion winner: SolarWinds Access Rights Manager\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nHow Are AD Security Tools Helpful?\nAD security tools help manage Active Directory more intuitively, rapidly, and comprehensively to tighten control over the critical functions that AD delivers. They also analyze existing identities for potential issues, track changes for signs of malicious activity, and provide alerts for any detected attacks.\nWhat Is the Difference Between AD Security & ITDR?\nAD security secures the lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) functions delivered by AD and similar tools. Identity threat detection and response (ITDR) expands the scope to include integration with MFA, SOAR, identity and access management (IAM), privilege access management (PAM), and other tools for a more comprehensive overview and integration into the security stack.\nHow Does AD Security Satisfy Compliance Requirements?\nAD security adds controls to protect the access management required by all major cybersecurity compliance standards. AD security tool reports should directly provide information that proves user activity and data access fall within specific compliance requirements to avoid additional efforts to meet regular compliance requirements.\nBottom Line: AD Security Provides Fundamental Protection\nActive directory stores access permissions and authorization throughout a network and literally defines who holds the keys to the kingdom. Make sure to implement effective AD security to provide this critical component with the protection and monitoring necessary to provide a foundation for the rest of an organization\u2019s security stack. Start by selecting the most promising option and experience a demo or try out the free version.\nThis article explains how to secure AD against future attacks, but to determine if past attacks have been successful, read about how to tell if Active Directory is compromised."

  "argos_summary": "At the Black Hat event, security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema presented techniques for bypassing authentication in hybrid Active Directory (AD) and Entra ID environments, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate any synced user, including privileged accounts. He demonstrated how low-privilege accounts could gain administrative rights and access Exchange mailboxes, highlighting vulnerabilities that Microsoft is addressing with patches, though full resolution is expected only after the separation of services in October 2025. To mitigate risks, organizations are advised to audit synchronization servers and enforce least-privilege access policies.",
