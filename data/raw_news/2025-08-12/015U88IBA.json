  "title": "How To Turn The Airbnb Post-Earnings Panic Into A First-Class Upgrade - Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB)",
  "description": "While investors were disappointed with Airbnb's Q3 guidance, ABNB stock is now flashing a compelling reversal signal.",
  "content": "One of the drawbacks of success is that investors want more. In many ways, online homestay marketplace Airbnb Inc ABNB revolutionized the lodging industry. In a stable sector, the company successfully integrated its business model into the sharing economy. This groundbreaking strategy has eventually led to strong earnings performances. Unfortunately, that hasn't been enough to convince skeptical investors. Still, the red ink may create an opportunity for contrarian traders.\n\nFor the second quarter, Airbnb reported a 13% year-over-year lift in revenue to $3.1 billion, beating Wall Street analysts' consensus view of $3.03 billion. In the year-ago period, the company generated sales of $2.75 billion. On the bottom line, management disclosed earnings of $1.03 per share, jumping above the consensus estimate of 93 cents per share. Last year, the company posted 86 cents.\n\nIn terms of major line items, gross booking value hit $23.5 billion, representing a lift of 11% year-over-year. Further, Airbnb's Nights and Experiences booked landed at 134.4 million, up 7% against the same quarter one year ago.\n\n\"Despite global economic uncertainty early in the quarter, travel demand picked up, and nights booked on Airbnb accelerated from April to July,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nStill, ABNB stock crumbled despite the seemingly robust earnings print. Investors seemed to take a dim view of the company's third-quarter revenue guidance, with management anticipating the top line to land between $4.02 billion and $4.10 billion. This range represents year-over-year growth of 8% to 10%, which is conspicuously below the second-quarter's growth rate of 13%.\n\nNevertheless, investors might be panicking without considering the bigger picture. Perhaps most notably, Airbnb stated that nights booked on an origin basis in its expansion markets have grown at about twice the rate of its core markets. This would indicate that despite tough economic conditions, consumers are still prioritizing travel.\n\nAs intriguing as the narrative may be, it's incredibly difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to reliably forecast where (and when) a publicly traded security may end up. For retail traders, there is no edge in reading opinions on the internet. First, everybody else is probably thinking the same thing. Second, if the idea is so compelling, black box algorithms have already acted on the data.\n\nHere's the reality: the institutional and professional traders will always be bigger, stronger and faster. If you insist on running the ball up the middle, you're not going to be winning too many games. What we need to do is to outthink the competition, and that can be done through discrete-state analysis.\n\nThe beauty of analyzing ABNB stock (or any publicly traded company) under the framework of discrete objects rather than through the frame of continuous scalar signals is epistemological continuity. An analyst can't just imply that ABNB is a \"good opportunity\" without explaining how $121 per share is \"good.\" As far as I'm aware, numbers are just numbers \u2014 they don't have objective characteristics.\n\nIn science, what is objective is the difference between stasis and kinesis. In the equities sector, the objective truth is that, at the end of the day, the market is either a net buyer or a net seller.\n\nThat, my dear readers, is everything. The rest are arbitrary details that, when applied consistently, can lead to insights that very few (if any) are seeing. For example, in the trailing 10 weeks (including this one), the market voted to buy ABNB stock four times and sell six times. During this period, the security incurred a downward trajectory. For brevity, we can label this sequence as 4-6-D.\n\nOf course, before we initiate a position, we must establish the null hypothesis of ABNB stock or the probabilistic performance assuming no mispricing. In other words, the chance that a long position will be profitable is 53.06%, a solid upward bias. So, a trading setup has to beat the null, so to speak.\n\nFrom past analogs, the 4-6-D does exactly that. In the following week when the sequence flashes, the upside probability jumps to 65.62%, with a median return of 4.69%. What's really intriguing is that if the bulls can maintain control for a second week, the upside performance is an additional 1.99%.\n\nIf ABNB stock manages to end this week at $122, it would theoretically be on course to exceed the $130 level.\n\nPutting the Math Together for a Compelling Call Spread\n\nFrom the market intelligence above, arguably the most compelling may be the 125/130 bull call spread expiring Sep. 19. This transaction involves buying the $125 call and simultaneously selling the $130 call, for a net debit paid of $158 (the most that can be lost in the trade). Should ABNB stock rise through the short strike price ($130) at expiration, the maximum profit is $342, a payout of over 216%.\n\nTo me, the payout being so robust is a clear indication that the market makers are using a completely different risk-assessment model compared to mine. I believe that they're using stochastic calculus and narrowing down the error range to as tight of a window as possible.\n\nObviously, it's your choice as to which methodology you believe to be more credible. But if you want my opinion, I believe my approach is superior because it is a descriptive model \u2014 it calculates forward probabilities based on identical conditions (relative to the last 10-week framework).\n\nA key criticism of my model is that there is no proof that the last 10 weeks of price action is inherently meaningful. However, of the ideas I present, I try to only discuss signals that feature a p-value of 0.20 or less. This way, there's less chance that I'm dealing with random noise and a greater possibility that I'm working with actionable signals.\n\nFor ABNB stock and its 4-6-D sequence, the p-value comes out to 0.1055, which means that there's a 10.55% chance that the implications of the signal could materialize randomly as opposed to intentionally. Given the stock market's open and entropic nature, there's something interesting going on with Airbnb.\n\nThe opinions and views expressed in this content are those of the individual author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Benzinga.

      "text": "Consumers are increasingly turning to comfort foods, with frozen pizza sales experiencing a significant surge, a trend some experts view as a potential indicator of shifting consumer behavior amid growing economic uncertainty.\nWhat Happened: Consumers are reaching for more frozen pizza, especially the premium option, amid economic unease, according to a report by Business Insider. This pattern has been noted during past economic downturns as well.\nCraig Zawada, the Chief Visionary Officer at Pros Holdings, a price optimization firm, clarified that while it may seem paradoxical for consumers to choose high-priced frozen pizzas during a downturn, it\u2019s a trade-off as they substitute dining out with eating at home. \u201cThis happens every sort of downturn in the economy,\u201d Zawada said.\nDuring the 2009 recession and the 2020 pandemic, frozen food sales, particularly frozen pizza, significantly increased. According to market research firm IBISWorld, the U.S. frozen pizza industry generated $6.5 billion in annual revenue in 2024 and remains well above its pre-pandemic level.\nSee Also: Not Dogecoin, Shiba Inu \u2014 Here\u2019s Why Whales Are Piling Into Fartcoin\nWhy It Matters: As economic anxiety stirs up once again, consumers are leaning towards eating at home and stocking up from the grocery store\u2019s frozen aisle. This trend is reflective of a more home-centric consumer behavior, driven by factors such as inflation and the ongoing global uncertainty.\nThe shift in consumer behavior towards home dining and frozen foods is not a new phenomenon. The average person consumed close to 40 pounds of pizza a year before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic only amplified this trend.\nMoreover, recent data showed that U.S. retail sales only slightly increased in February, falling short of expectations and raising concerns about consumer strength.\nRead Next:\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Get in before Q3 trades take off \u2192\nAirbnb Inc ABNB reported financial results for the second quarter on Wednesday after the bell. Here\u2019s a look at the key metrics from the period.\nQ2 Earnings: Airbnb reported a 13% year-over-year increase in second-quarter revenue to $3.1 billion, which beat analyst estimates of $3.03 billion. The company reported second-quarter earnings of $1.03 per share, beating analyst estimates of 93 cents per share, according to Benzinga Pro.\nGross booking value totaled $23.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Nights and Experiences booked came in at 134.4 million, up 7% year-over-year.\nAirbnb said it generated $1 billion of free cash flow during the second quarter. The company ended the period with $11.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash.\n\u201cDespite global economic uncertainty early in the quarter, travel demand picked up, and nights booked on Airbnb accelerated from April to July,\u201d the company said in a letter to shareholders.\nThe company added, \u201cAs of June 30, 2025, we had the authorization to purchase up to $1.5 billion of our Class A common stock under our current share repurchase plan and today, we're announcing a new share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to an additional $6 billion of our Class A common stock.\u201d\nWhat's Next: Airbnb expects third-quarter revenue of $4.02 billion to $4.1 billion. The company expects year-over-year growth of Nights and Experiences booked to be \u201crelatively stable\u201d in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.\n\u201cWhile we have seen an acceleration of nights booked growth in July, particularly in North America, we are mindful of the tougher year-over-year comparison towards the end of the quarter,\u201d the company said.\nAirbnb executives will further discuss the quarter on a conference call that starts at 4:30 p.m. ET.

That would be a most welcome development,\u201d he said in a note this week.\nYardeni envisions an AI-driven \"Roaring 2020s\" in which productivity growth fuels real GDP gains while keeping inflation subdued.\nIn that scenario, he projects the S&P 500 could reach 10,000 by 2030.\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO is already up 9% in 2025 and has surged more than 33% since its April tariff-driven low.\nRecession Talk Is Fading Fast\nDespite market chatter about tariffs and slowing growth, recession fears are notably absent from corporate boardrooms.\nAccording to FactSet data, only 16 S&P 500 earnings calls this quarter mentioned the word \"recession,\" compared with a 5-year average of 74 and a 10-year average of 61.\nThat's an 87% drop from the first quarter 2025, when the term appeared on 124 calls. Overall, just 4% of the 442 calls held between June 15 and Aug. 7 cited recession.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

  "argos_summary": "Airbnb reported a strong second quarter with revenues of $3.1 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, and earnings of $1.03 per share, also above forecasts. Despite this success, the stock fell due to conservative third-quarter revenue guidance, which projected growth lower than the previous quarter. Analysts suggest that while investor sentiment may be negative, there are opportunities for contrarian traders, especially as Airbnb's nights booked in expansion markets are growing at a faster rate than in core markets.",
