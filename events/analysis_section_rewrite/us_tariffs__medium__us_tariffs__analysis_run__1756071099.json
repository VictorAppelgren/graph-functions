      "feedback": "Strong start tying tariff policy, enforcement, and litigation to corporate margins, but to reach world-class, overhaul into a dated, four‑quadrant scenario map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and quantified channels, anchored strictly to the cited IDs. Actionable edits: 1) replace the narrative paragraph with a structured 3–6 month scenario map (Base, Alt1, Alt2, plus a watch-list tilt) each with a clear trigger window (e.g., July 31 oral arguments in the tariff litigation; potential CIT/Federal Circuit/Supreme Court moves; UK DCTS implementation in early 2026; Asia Regional Cumulation Group effects). Tie each scenario to a single transmission channel (pricing/pass-through, capex/shipping, and margins) and assign a probability range. 2) deepen causality and path-dependency by spelling out how a base-case outcome (tariffs persist with incremental settlements) could erode margins via pass-through in Goodyear (AJTHKYXQ3: ~$350m annualized tariff cost; ~1,800 layoffs; ~$4 per tire pass-through) and how that interacts with supply-chain shifts; and how a favorable ruling or partial settlements could lessen pass-through or accelerate nearshoring. 3) expressly quantify catalysts using available numbers from sources: use AJTHKYXQ3 figures (tariff cost, layoff count, pass-through per tire) and WLXM1819K figures (18-country Asia Regional Cumulation Group; Sri Lanka’s 350k direct apparel workers; June 2025 apparel exports + 439.39m) to illustrate diversification benefits vs domestic cost headwinds; also note 55GVT420Q to reflect tech-price sensitivity and Apple tariff-cost dynamics. 4) integrate legal risk by incorporating the Supreme Court/tariffs trajectory mentioned in the 6th/related Yahoo Finance pieces as a separate optional channel with a defined invalidation path (if the Court denies review or stays, pricing/risk can calm; if it upholds authority, risk tilts higher). 5) ensure alignment with horizon focus by constraining each trigger to a discrete timing window and ending with a base case, 1–2 clear alts, explicit risks, watch-list signals, and a calibrated, stated confidence (avoid generic platitudes; cite only IDs). 6) tighten wording to remove broad statements; replace vague “tariffs persist” with concrete inflection points (e.g., “Base: tariff costs remain ~$350m/year for 2025–26; Alt1: settlements or sector carve-outs cut pass-through by X%; Alt2: expanded tariffs keep cost base elevated and compress margins in autos/industrials”). 7) explicitly map to sectors and assets (Goodyear and other manufacturers via AJTHKYXQ3; UK/Sri Lanka supply chains via WLXM1819K; consumer hardware pricing via 55GVT420Q; broader policy framing via EPJYXB7DX; DOJ enforcement via OFY11YO0I) and reconcile any conflicting signals by presenting the highest-probability path as base, with clearly labeled upside/downside pivots. This will deliver a true world-class, first-principles, scenario-driven view with precise timing, triggers, and market transmission.",
