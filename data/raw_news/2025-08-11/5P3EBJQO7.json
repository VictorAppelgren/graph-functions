  "content": "Fashion Is Transforming\u2014And It's Not Just About Style\n\nThe global fashion industry is at a pivotal moment. The rise of e-commerce, shifting consumer values, and demand for sustainable practices have exposed cracks in traditional go-to-market models. Creativity and craftsmanship remain core\u2014but speed, data, and agility now define who leads and who lags.\n\nEnter \u2014a fashion-forward business solution that weaves together real-time fabric insights, AI-driven recommendations, and immersive virtual experiences. More than just a digital tool, SmartFabric represents a strategic shift: from reactive production to proactive innovation, from guesswork to intelligence.\n\nFrom Swatches to Strategy: What Is SmartFabric?\n\nSmartFabric is a next-generation fashion fictitious platform that empowers brands to make better decisions earlier in the product lifecycle. It enables companies to:\n\u2022 Capture fabric performance using embedded sensors for stretch, durability, and moisture-wicking.\n\u2022 Use generative AI to analyze consumer behavior, product performance, and sales history.\n\u2022 Track sustainability metrics in real time\u2014like water usage and material waste\u2014by style, season, or division.\n\nTogether, these capabilities help brands accelerate design decisions, reduce costs, improve fit accuracy, and build more sustainable collections\u2014without compromising creativity.\n\nTraditional fashion calendars rely on fixed timelines, physical sampling, and siloed teams. SmartFabric disrupts that with a business model built for responsiveness.\n\nThis is not just digitization\u2014it's business model innovation.\n\nBusiness Use Cases: Value Across the Fashion Org\n\nSmartFabric delivers ROI across departments, not just tech teams.\n\u2022 Identify underperforming fabrics and swap them before production.\n\u2022 Get recommendations for material substitutions that improve durability or stretch.\n\u2022 Use virtual fittings to reduce physical sampling and shorten design cycles.\n\u2022 Track which fabrics and styles are trending in real time.\n\u2022 View dashboards for water, energy, and waste usage across the collection.\n\u2022 Integrate virtual try-ons into campaigns to increase conversion and reduce returns.\n\nThis unified approach aligns every department with a smarter, faster, and more sustainable product lifecycle.\n\nConsumers are demanding better personalization. SmartFabric helps brands deliver this through immersive, data-backed fitting experiences:\n\u2022 Smart mirrors and AR apps let shoppers garments before they're made.\n\u2022 Fitting data is captured and used to improve pattern grading, size runs, and comfort features.\n\nThis isn't just convenience\u2014it's a competitive advantage. Fewer returns. Better reviews. Stronger loyalty.\n\nFashion's environmental footprint is under a microscope. SmartFabric treats sustainability as a core business metric, not an afterthought.\n\u2022 Water and energy use monitoring linked to fabric performance.\n\nThese insights help brands meet regulatory expectations, achieve ESG goals, and market sustainability with integrity-all while optimizing cost and performance.\n\u2022 The product team is working on Spring 2025 outerwear.\n\u2022 IoT-enabled fabric samples are tested for stretch, durability, and wicking.\n\u2022 AI analyzes the data and flags that offers superior performance in stretch (25.86%) and wicking (5.75%) but lower durability (245N).\n\u2022 Cost analysis shows a $1.25 increase per unit, but with a 30% projected reduction in return rate.\n\nBusiness Result: The brand proceeds with a limited release, markets it as a and monitors customer satisfaction to inform future rollouts.\n\nSmartFabric in Action: How Brands Are Benefiting\n\u2022 \ud83d\udd01 Significant drop in returns due to improved fit and material selection\n\nSmartFabric enables brands to lead with , not instinct.\n\nSmartFabric isn't just a product innovation\u2014it's a business strategy for the next era of fashion. It empowers brands to:\n\nAs consumers demand more transparency, better experiences, and responsible choices, the brands that invest in platforms like SmartFabric will be the ones that thrive.\n\nIllustration: A side-by-side of traditional development and SmartFabric\u2014enabled workflows\u2014from concept to consumer.\n\u2022 Korpinar, G.

      "text": "Latency in virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (XR)\nLow latency is extremely important for mixed, augmented, and virtual reality content. The main reasons why lower latency is better are the elimination of cybersickness and achieving a deeper immersion.\nAs a person moves their head, a headset should display the resulting changes almost immediately. If there is a significant delay, the user\u2019s brain will reject the virtual world, causing them to lose immersion. This can, in turn, cause nausea and reduce the effectiveness of learning outcomes, for example.\nIn research, a meaningful latency threshold for virtual and mixed reality has been determined to be around 20 milliseconds. While humans can detect very small relative delays in parts of the visual field, when absolute delays are below approximately 20 milliseconds, they are generally imperceptible. Going below this threshold eliminates a major cause of cybersickness and achieves much deeper immersion, especially when combined with high resolution.\nAchieving this is somewhat easier in virtual reality, where the user is shut out from the real world and only sees digital content. It is much more challenging in mixed reality. Mixed reality using video pass-through uses cameras to digitize the world in real-time. That data is then combined with virtual content inside our GPU and shown to users through the mixed reality device \u2013 completely blurring the lines between real and virtual. where digital objects blend with the real world, and the digital content needs to react to the real world fast enough so immersion does not break.\nRead more:"

      "text": "Impact of number of clicks on user experience\nReviewing the relationship between usability and number of clicks through 3-click rule\nFrom past to present, UX experts have come up with various theories about this, assuming that the number of clicks has a significant impact on user experience. Some of them:\n- The fewer clicks required to achieve a user\u2019s goal, the greater the usability.\n- Every page should be accessed with 3 clicks at most.\n- Users who have clicked too much give up their journey.\nYou may frequently encounter a stakeholder claim like \u201cThere are too many clicks! User must get there immediately.\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s do something to decrease the number of clicks.\u201d These demands might make sense at first glance; however, measuring usability with only the number of clicks rule or rigorously sticking to this rule while designing may be quite wrong approach that can lead users to leave your product.\nFor instance, suppose that a user on a flight purchasing website must navigate a complex and unintuitive way in order to land on the ticket detail page in just 3 clicks. That probably will not reflect a usable and enjoyable experience. The user\u2019s journey to the ticket page should be more discoverable and learnable. In this manner, redesigning with more than a few clicks can provide a more accurate user experience. Since not only do the users establish their connection with the product by evaluating how quickly they got the result, but they also have numerous parameters such as how much research they do, how much time they spend, and how safe they feel when they find the information they\u2019re looking for.\nActually, clicking less does not always mean less time spent, although it seems like there is a direct relationship between the number of clicks and the time spent.\nUsability is directly related to how effective and efficient it is to achieve the desired goals, rather than how few clicks it takes.\nIf a better approach is proposed for the number of clicks, that could be like;\nEvery decision and action taken by the user in the system, which includes any click, swipe, tap, or some other interaction, should get the user closer to why they are there and keep them away from things out of purpose.\nIn the words of John Morkes, who is a UX strategist and consultant: \u201cUsability does not equate to a specific number of clicks, taps, swipes, pinches, flicks.\u201d\nIn the article that Paul Laubheimer wrote for Nielsen Norman Group in 2019, he says that: \u201cWhile it is important to keep key information easily accessible, the 3-click rule is an arbitrary rule of thumb that is not backed by data, so it\u2019s a myth.\u201d\nLet\u2019s take a look at the history of the 3-click rule, which is one of the most rampant theories about the number of clicks.\nIn 2001, an American entrepreneur and web designer, Jeffery Zeldman\u2019s book \u201cTaking Your Talent to the Web\u201d was the first source to mention the impact of the 3-click approach on user experience(Page: 98). Tough, Zeldman addressed a possibility rather than demonstrating a solid declaration or data based on research, and he stated exactly as follows: \u201cIt\u2019s widely agreed, even by people who are not idiots, that web users are driven by a desire for fast gratification. If they can\u2019t find what they\u2019re looking for within three clicks, they might move on to somebody else\u2019s site.\u201d\nRight, depending on the action that users would like to take, they may have a low level of attention and patience; they also may quit the system if they are unable to find the data they\u2019re looking for quickly. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t always have to be valid; it can differ entirely depending on the user\u2019s motivation and the task they want to do. Indeed, Zeldman had come up with an idea mentioning a possibility; however, research over the years has indicated that clicking less is not as important as consideration in making decisions and staying in the system.\nNow let\u2019s go back to 2001, when Zeldman proposed this theory, and look at the website design of Apple that\u2019s one of the biggest companies worldwide.\nSo we can understand that it is possible to access everything with only 3 clicks. Many other websites were also like this at that time. Reasons for it:\n- The Internet was not widely accessible; furthermore, fewer and fewer of the world\u2019s population were able to utilize it in comparison to now.\n- Because of some limitations, like bandwidth and architectural languages, designers had to go with minimalism.\n- Users didn\u2019t have too many options to access their destinations.\n- Designing a website was expensive.\n- It was cost-effective for companies to generate simple things that required no complex coding.\nAs a result, the click-number rule that aims to lead users to their goals was trusted. Therefore, the number of clicks became more important than aesthetics in the user experience.\nAt the present time, hierarchical structures in UX have achieved growth, and there are numerous options to accomplish a goal in an app or website. Consequently, user experiences configured with a paradigm of minimizing the number of clicks might not be efficient. Because this may result in an overabundance of design components on one page, users may need to follow their tracks to remember what and where to choose.\nWell then, is the 3-click rule useless anymore?\nIn fact, if you look at it closely, it\u2019s not quite like that; some cases where it works exist. Although it varies according to the user\u2019s motivation, purpose, and connection established with the system s/he interacts with; the 3-click rule can be useful in some circumstances, such as navigation. Nonetheless, the rule may be implemented in some navigation systems containing too many subcategories. In such cases, it can be necessary to embrace a design approach that prioritizes a broad information architecture (IA) over a deep and sequential one.\nBoth of the above navigation systems have some usability problems on their own.\nFor the left \u2014 contains navigation structures that have a broad IA with multiple categories:\n- It may be hard for users to analyze and evaluate.\n- It could happen that more UI areas are required than are necessary.\nFor the right \u2014 contains navigation structures that have multiple layers and fewer categories:\n- Excessive stratification may result in sub-categories with numerous irritating mouse gestures or confusing sequences.\n- Waiting for sub-category pages to open may take too much time.\nThen, as designers, we look into the system requirements rather than a strategy, like we must design considering the 3-click-rule when enhancing a system. We can sure go with this rule, but if we design a navigation with fewer categories and enough space.\nSo how do we distinguish them apart, since there are cases where it works?\nIn truth, it is not accurate to say that the 3-click rule is applied in situations like this. It is an approximation, and the number of click actions is not significant; the context and necessity of it are. In a nutshell,\nAll approximations regarding how many clicks users need to make would neither exceed a forecast nor work every time. Instead of that, while users accomplish their reason for being in the system, it will be enough to not be demotivated for them, which can only be possible by making a decision in the triangle of the relevant system \u2014 user, and work to be done.\nIn a recent study conducted by the UIE team on this subject;\nA test was carried out in which 620 tasks were assigned to 44 users, and their click numbers were analyzed at those moments. During this period, more than 8.000 clicks were captured. The outcomes were quite interesting. The majority of users completed a task until they clicked 25 times. What\u2019s interesting is that there is not a direct correlation between the number of clicks and the number of tasks completed successfully.\nAs shown in Graph-1, there is no relationship between participant satisfaction and the amount of clicks. (The satisfaction rate changes around 46% and 61%.) In Graph \u2014 2, there is the analysis of the relationship between accomplished task rate and click numbers. We can see that 80% of the tasks were performed with 15 clicks.\nAnother research on this topic,\nUser tests about the number of clicks in which the book \u201cPrioritizing Usability\u201d written by Jacob Nielsen; demonstrate that reaching the target becomes 600% easier after replacing the other design where the product page is four clicks away from the home page rather than three.\nAs a result,\nAccording to research, some flows designed to be sticky with the 3-click rule cannot be more useful. Furthermore, heavy content packed on a few screens to make the user click less may cause analysis and perception issues.\nAs designers, it should be more significant for us to create designs that will comprehend users\u2019 needs and help them achieve their goals than how many times they click. We must also take into account what they want to do, where they come from, where they are now, and where they are headed.\nConsequently, the 3-click rule is a problematic method to estimate interaction cost and task efficiency because reading and processing a long list of options as a result of this rule can increase cognitive load. Therefore, rather than focusing on the number of clicks, designers should prioritize;\n- to make the user\u2019s path through the system obvious and discoverable,\n- to provide information about the step\u2019s before and after circumstances,\n- to give the information they need at the right time,\nso they can obtain more efficient and productive outcomes in terms of usability principles.\nKAYNAK\u00c7A\nhttps://www.nngroup.com/articles/3-click-rule/\nhttps://uxdworld.com/2020/01/28/3-click-rule-and-usability/\nhttp://usabilitytesting.sg/blog/web-usability/new-25-click-rule/\nhttps://qualaroo.com/blog/3-click-rule/\nhttps://www.zeldman.com/talent/Taking_Your_Talent_to_the_Web.pdf"
