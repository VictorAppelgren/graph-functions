  "description": "The potential privatization of Australia\u2019s Big Bash League continues to be closely monitored by owners of America's Major League Cricket.",
  "content": "The potential privatization of Australia\u2019s Big Bash League continues to be closely monitored by American investors with another Major League Cricket franchise signalling interest.\n\nAn independent report from Boston Consulting Group has recommended Cricket Australia sell minority stakes in the eight BBL clubs.\n\nThe BBL, which started in 2011 and enjoys immense popularity in the heart of Australia\u2019s cricket season in December and January, is an outlier among cricket\u2019s T20 franchise leagues, with CA and the state associations having ownership control.\n\nThe developments have sparked major interest around the world, with IPL franchises and American tech entrepreneurs among those watching on closely.\n\nOn the back of Washington Freedom co-owner Sanjay Govil expressing interest, the powerbrokers of Seattle Orcas are also closely monitoring the BBL situation.\n\nOrcas are the only small market team in the six-team MLC, having beaten out Chicago and Atlanta in the inaugural list of teams.\n\nBut the Pacific Northwest franchise has a high-profile ownership consortium that includes Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella and ties with GMR Group, the co-owner of the Indian Premier League\u2019s Delhi Capital.\n\nGMR Group, an Indian multinational conglomerate, recently secured a 49 per cent stake in Southern Brave after the recent sale of the Hundred franchises in the England competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely evaluate it if it happens,\" Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar told me. \u201cI think the best players and the best cricket comes out of India, Australia and the U.K. Being part of an Australian league would interest many people.\u201d\n\nThere is an Australian footprint in the well-heeled and fledgling MLC, with Freedom having a strategic partnership with New South Wales Cricket and San Francisco Unicorns enjoying a similar arrangement with Victoria. A slew of top Australian players have been part of the MLC\u2019s first three seasons.\n\nWith BBL privatization still likely some way off, Orcas are contemplating following the lead of Freedom and Unicorns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been monitoring the partnerships of those franchises and contemplating whether we should partner with an Australian team,\u201d said India-born Somasegar, who made his fortune in the U.S. having spent 27 years working at Microsoft.\n\n\u201cWe are very interested in seeing what type of partnership we can find.\u201d\n\nAnother headliner of the report was for the BBL to consider expansion. New Zealand and Singapore have been floated as possible overseas locations, while it is learned that Malaysia has also expressed interest.\n\nIt comes as MLC is set to expand into Canada, with Toronto likely to be one of the two new franchises to come into the competition in 2027.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an interesting concept,\" Somasegar said. \"An expanded BBL is no different than what we are thinking about with Canada in the MLC.\n\n\u201cIf you look at most American sports leagues, there is expansion into other countries and a lot of good can come out of it.\u201d\n\nSomasegar, who these days is a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group, is also part of the ownership group of the Seattle Sounders in Major League Soccer. He has seen close up soccer\u2019s big rise in the U.S. and believes there are parallels with cricket.\n\n\"If you go back to the 1980s, soccer was not well understood in this country,\" he said. \u201cBut there has been a big rise for soccer since and I think you will see that with cricket development in the U.S.\u201d",

      "text": "In the late afternoon sunshine, with the spectacular Oakland Hills in the backdrop, Major League Cricket on Thursday made history with its first game at the iconic Coliseum, a world famous ground once home to the Athletics and Raiders.\nThe terraces of the 40,000-seat ground were about a quarter full but it was undoubtedly a momentous moment for the fledgling American T20 domestic franchise league, hoped to ignite the No.1 targeted growth market for cricket.\nApart from the initial intrigue over the MLC launching in 2023, finally ending decades of unfulfilled grandiose plans, playing games at the Coliseum has made splashy headlines with the announcement widely reported, including in The New York Times, Axios and mainstream media in the Bay Area.\nIt\u2019s given nationwide exposure for a league entering a pivotal third season amid change. The league has expanded to 34 games and nestled into the earlier slot of mid-June in the hope of cementing a permanent spot in cricket\u2019s congested calendar.\nThe Coliseum has shifted the tournament to the west coast for the first time after games previously were played solely in Dallas, the hub of American cricket, and a small ground in Morrisville, North Carolina.\nThis season will also see games in Lauderhill, Florida, where many international games have been played over the years, along with the Bay Area and Dallas.\nThere are plans for the six teams to have home grounds, but for all the franchises bar Texas Super Kings - even the Coliseum is currently only a one-season arrangement with San Francisco Unicorns - putting the suitable infrastructure in place has proven challenging.\nIt\u2019s unlikely new stadiums will be unveiled in the next couple of years ahead of expansion in 2027 when two new teams will be added. As I\u2019ve reported previously, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta and Toronto are the cities in the mix.\nThrough significant investment of more than $100 million, the well-heeled MLC has been able to attract top stars from major cricket nations, especially Australian players such as superstars Pat Cummins, Steve Smith and David Warner.\nThe MLC salary cap of $1.1 million per team has not changed over the short history of the tournament, with top players earning around $175,000 for a minimum of five games - rivalling the highest figure per game in T20 leagues outside of the money-spinning Indian Premier league.\nBut stiff competition in an increasingly congested franchise circuit ensures MLC must continue to offer healthy salaries in order to attract top talent. Currently the tournament has a domestic media rights deal with Willow TV, a subscription app and minor satellite and cable channel.\nThere are also partnerships with FUBO, a streaming television service, and CBS Sports Network, while Unicorns games will be shown live on NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California.\nThe current deal with Willow is five years, but believed to come with a three-year out clause. \u201cWillow has been a great partner for us. But the questions are what is next and can we do better?\u201d Seattle Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar told me.\n\u201cThere is an opportunity for a good amount of revenue to come into the league from media rights. That will open up not only more opportunities to keep attracting top players but also sponsorship.\u201d\nFranchises have been focused on investment since the advent of MLC, but a media rights boon could start seeing profits for owners by the end of the decade.\n\u201cWe have currently a kind of a starter deal when we launched the league,\u201d Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman said. \u201cAs the league gains popularity, my hope is that the the second broadcast deal is what takes us to profitability.\u201d\nThere has been significant off-field change for MLC with Johnny Grave taking the reins as chief executive having replaced Vijay Srinivasan, who will helm one of the new franchises.\nGrave was the Cricket West Indies chief for seven years up until late last year and before that was commercial director at the Professional Cricketers\u2019 Association in England for almost a decade.\n\u201cThere\u2019s less pressure (on the salary cap) compared to those leagues that clash in January, where in that window there\u2019s been big wage inflation, a sort of inflationary effect on salary caps,\u201d Grave said.\n\"We\u2019ve got a domestic player cap that will be reviewed and then linked to that would be the international salary cap as well.\n\u201cBut I think there are opportunities that exist here for players in terms of growing their own brands and profile within the U.S. market,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019re a great proposition for any player in the world.\u201d\nMLC\u2019s exposure internationally is growing with the league announcing a two-year broadcast deal with JioStar, India\u2019s premier sports and entertainment network.\nThis season is also being broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven, a free-to-air television network, as the ongoing World Test Championship final between Australia and South Africa is shunted behind an online streaming service.\nThose tuning into MLC\u2019s season-opener from around the world witnessed Finn Allen, a globetrotting T20 batter, smash a world record 19 sixes in non-stop entertainment alongside American rising star Sanjay Krishnamurthi as a new sporting chapter started at this warhorse of an Oakland institution."

      "text": "New Zealand Cricket will provide high-performance support and expertise as part of a ground-breaking partnership with a new franchise in Major League Cricket that is expected to be based in Toronto or Atlanta.\nAs I\u2019ve reported previously, MLC, the fledgling T20 tournament in the U.S. that is about to start its third season, is set to expand from six teams to eight by 2027.\nTrue North Sports Ventures will launch one of the expansion franchises and is majority-owned by MLC co-founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan, the league\u2019s former chief executive. The investment arm of the San Francisco 49ers is among the private equity investors in TNS.\nIn a bold initiative, NZC will become the first national governing body to invest in an overseas T20 franchise league.\nNZC, a foundation investor in TNS, will provide operational support, including coaching, management and support staff, along with offering expertise in cricket infrastructure and turf management.\nIt is also an opportunity for NZC, a smaller cricket nation battling to retain its leading players to lucrative franchise leagues, to work closely with a growing T20 competition that already boasts a number of its top players, including stars Matt Henry, Rachin Ravindra, Finn Allen and Trent Boult.\n\u201cAs franchise cricket grows globally, NZC needs to adapt to seize strategic opportunities that ensure the sustainability of our cricket network,\u201d NZC chief executive Scott Weenink said.\n\u201cThis helps diversify our revenue streams, expands our global brand and fan base, and creates new talent development and retention pathways for both our players and coaches.\u201d\nIt is a new footprint for the well-heeled league aimed at developing cricket in the world\u2019s biggest sports market.\nThree of the six current franchises in the MLC are owned by Indian Premier League team owners - Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings - while Seattle, the only small-market franchise in the league, have ties with Delhi Capitals.\nSan Francisco and Washington have partnerships with Australian states - Cricket Victoria and Cricket New South Wales.\n\u201cAs founders of start-ups that have rapidly grown to established businesses, we see NZC as a perfect fit for our new franchise,\" said Srinivasan, who along with Mehta co-founded Willow TV, North America\u2019s premier cricket broadcaster.\n\u201cWith NZC\u2019s expertise, our expansion franchise will elevate MLC\u2019s world-class T20 product and support cricket\u2019s rapid growth in our region.\n\u201cThe potential for cricket in North America is immense, and we look forward to working with NZC to deliver on both our ambitions and theirs, including broader strategic and corporate opportunities globally.\"\nAfter numerous markets were explored, the new franchise will be based in Atlanta or Toronto, cities with significant South Asian communities. If Toronto is chosen then MLC will move into Canada which already boasts a T20 league.\nMLC co-founder Satyan Gajwani will launch the other new franchise with Philadelphia and Chicago on the shortlist. Final decisions on the two new franchises are expected later in the year.\nMLC is expected to eventually expand to 10 teams - mimicking the IPL - by early next decade. \u201cI think this league is capable of supporting 10 teams in the medium term,\u201d San Francisco Unicorns co-owner Anand Rajaraman told me.\n\u201cI think 10 is probably the right number for the North American market, which significantly also includes Canada. But we\u2019ve got a big geography and we\u2019ll have to think through the complications of that.\u201d\nAn expanded MLC might mean more games and a longer duration of the competition, which could lead to wider implications for a sport struggling to breathe due to an increasingly congested calendar.\nFor this upcoming season, the monthlong MLC will start earlier than its previous two editions as it attempts to nestle into a June-mid July slot that does not clash with rival leagues in the U.K and Caribbean.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to own the calendar for a month in T20 cricket in this part of the world and position it very much as a league for the U.S. market,\u201d new MLC chief executive Johnny Grave told me recently.\nThe new MLC season starts on June 12 with a rematch of last season\u2019s final between defending champions Washington Freedom and San Francisco Unicorns at the iconic Oakland Coliseum, which will host nine games overall."

      "text": "Boasting arguably the most inventive name - although there are other contenders in a field with the monikers of \u2018Unicorns\u2019 and \u2018Freedom\u2019 - along with such a vivid color scheme, Seattle Orcas are a Major League Cricket franchise that thinks outside the box.\nAfter all, the smallest market in the well-heeled American T20 competition have a bold vision to eventually become \u2018America\u2019s team\u2019 - and they are making strides with a growing number of fans calling themselves the \u2018Pod Squad\u2019.\nSo it\u2019s little surprise that the franchise - which boasts ownership ties to Indian Premier League giant Delhi Capitals - are considering ambitious plans in regards to its proposed cricket ground.\nThe Orcas are moving closer to building in King County\u2019s Marymoor Park, around 15 miles from Seattle.\nThere are still some bureaucratic hurdles to get through, but local authorities are supportive knowing that a cricket ground would be a boon for not only the area but the entire Pacific Northwest.\nThere are grand plans being contemplated. Inspired by the Utilita Bowl in Southampton, England, - home to Hampshire County Cricket Club, which has ownership ties to Orcas - a resort-type complex comprising a hotel and golf course is under consideration.\n\u201cWe are thinking about what are the real estate development possibilities and potential and who might be interested in that?\u201d Orcas co-owner Soma Somasegar told me in a phone interview.\n\u201cSport stadiums around the country and the world are now becoming much more than just watching sport.\u201d\nSomasegar had originally hoped an Orcas stadium could be built well before the 2028 Los Angeles Games and possibly be part of cricket\u2019s slate of Olympic games.\nBut with nothing built, and with Olympic officials wanting the event to be played entirely in Los Angeles, cricket\u2019s Olympic return will be played in Pomona although - as I first reported - its stadium plans have been shrouded in uncertainty due to the USA Cricket crisis.\nWhile the timing wasn\u2019t quite right for the Olympics, the Orcas stadium will likely be an appealing venue for international cricket and a gateway for the Pacific Northwest, a vast region home to a growing South Asian demographic that also includes world famous cities Portland and Vancouver.\nAs I reported recently, the West Indies - the only Full Member cricket nation in the Americas - are keen on expanding their footprint in the U.S. having regularly hosted white-ball series in nearby Florida.\n\u201cWe would absolutely like to be attractive to the West Indies and other international teams,\u201d Somasegar said. \"The U.S. national team are also playing more and more so it would be good to host them.\n\u201cAnd when the U.S. next hosts the Olympics after L.A. then we would be in position to host cricket games by then.\"\nIt was a tumultuous season for Orcas, runners-up in the inaugural season in 2023 but missing the playoffs for the second straight season. They went through major leadership changes midway through the season after the firing of Australian coach Matthew Mott, while South African Heinrich Klaasen stepped down as captain.\n\u201cI think he (Mott) wasn\u2019t able to figure out how to build a cohesive relationship in the group in a very short amount of time, which is what we\u2019re working with in the MLC where players are only together briefly,\u201d Somasegar said.\n\u201cAfter he went back to Australia, we had a good conversation and the relationship is still there. But we\u2019re excited about launching a new era for the Orcas.\u201d\nThe Orcas will soon start a process to find their next head coach, which should be an attractive proposition with MLC boasting numerous high-profile coaches including Australian legend Ricky Ponting who is at the helm of Washington Freedom.\n\u201cThe big learning for us is that we\u2019re assembling a team that is coming together for a month,\u201d Somasegar said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of more time like other sports leagues.\n\u201cWe need to find someone able to understand the roles and responsibilities of each player and each member of the staff from the get go.\u201d\nAs they wait for the game-changing stadium development, the Orcas after three seasons are slowly building a visible brand in the northwest seaport city and beyond.\n\u201cWe feel really good about how we\u2019ve built the franchise - the name and the colors and design,\u201d said Somasegar, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group having spent 27 years working at Microsoft.\n\"We\u2019re making this family-friendly and we\u2019re doing a bunch of things in the community to keep building the brand.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going from strength to strength and we\u2019re so excited about the future.\u201d"

They were founding partners of early ecommerce company Junglee, which was acquired by Amazon in 1998 for $250 million.\nThey also later founded Kosmix, which was acquired by Walmart and were early investors in Facebook.\n\u201cThis world-class group of investors brings deep strategic expertise and a shared vision for growing the game of cricket in the Bay Area and across the United States,\u201d Rajaraman said.\n\u201cWith their support, we\u2019re building a team that reflects the global spirit of the sport and the innovation-driven culture of the Bay Area.\u201d\nThey've also tapped into Hollywood with British-born Indian actor and producer Nayyar, who became world famous for his role as Raj Koothrappali on The Big Bang Theory, is also part of the Unicorns\u2019 investor group.\n\u201cGrowing up in New Delhi, cricket has always been close to my heart.

It is the Unicorns\u2019 most significant commercial partnership to date.\nUnicorns' bid for a first MLC title was boosted by the signings of rising Australian international cricketers Cooper Connolly and Xavier Bartlett, who will both make their debuts in the well-heeled American T20 competition."

      "text": "On the back of a whirlwind, attention-grabbing slate of games at the iconic Oakland Coliseum, next year's Major League Cricket season might expand its footprint into Maryland with Washington Freedom moving closer to building a home ground.\nAfter three seasons of the six-team MLC, only Texas Super Kings have a permanent cricket facility after repurposing a vacant baseball ground in Dallas, which has become the hub of American cricket and hosted a big chunk of the MLC games so far.\nThere is an unknown over whether San Francisco Unicorns will continue to play its home games at the Oakland Coliseum, with it currently a one-season arrangement.\nWhile this season also saw games being played in Lauderhill, 30 miles north of Miami and a regular site for international cricket, there is unlikely to be new locations in the next season or two other than possibly in Maryland.\nAfter plans to build a cricket stadium at George Mason University were scrapped, Freedom have earmarked a site in Frederick, about 45 miles north of Washington D.C. and near a local airport.\nBut the proposal still needs local government approval with residents raising concerns over environment impacts, traffic congestion, parking allowance and effects on nearby historic sites.\nA decision from the council is expected in September.\n\"I want to have a temporary stadium up and running by next year,\" Freedom owner Sanjay Govil told me. \"We respect what the community is saying and our intent is to listen to them and come up with a reasonable approach.\n\"We truly believe that this would be great for the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area.\"\nFreedom's vision is for a 5000-seat multi-purpose stadium that would cater for a range of sports, including lacrosse, rugby and flag football.\nA home ground could also lure international cricket with the U.S. men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams likely to host series ahead of the Los Angeles Olympics, cementing the country as a big ticket destination beyond traditional boundaries.\nAs I reported recently, the West Indies are hoping to play more cricket in the world's biggest sports market, home to a significant Caribbean diaspora.\nWest Indies power brokers aren't just merely focused on bringing international cricket to the U.S., with regional Caribbean cricket an alluring prospect. Games between rivals Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago in Maryland has an enticing ring to it.\n\"First things first, we need to get the stadium through but we want to bring international cricket here. That's the goal,\" Govil said. \"There are lots of opportunities to explore with such a South Asian and Caribbean diaspora in the area, so it's all quite exciting.\"\nFreedom came within an inch of defending their MLC title after losing to MI New York in an entertaining final. Stepping into a wretched D.C. sports scene, Freedom have provided a change of luck for tortured local fans although the franchise still remains invisible to many.\n\"The first thing is to make sure we have a great product on the field, but we are continually trying to expand the brand in a bid for more people to know who we are,\" Govil said.\n\"A lot of focus right now is on getting the stadium up and going, which will be critical for developing cricket in Maryland.\"\nGovil, a highly successful tech entrepreneur born in Montreal and raised in India, has been riding the rollercoaster of sports ownership, which has expanded since he invested in a 50 per cent stake in Welsh Fire - a franchise in the Hundred competition in England.\n\"It's stressful because I'm passionate about the sport, especially passionate about the team and the area,\" said Govil, who built his fortune after he moved to Washington D.C. and started Infinite Computer Solutions in 2001.\n\"We have a great management team and it's been an amazing experience so far that we hope will be legacy defining for cricket in the D.C. area and beyond.\""

      "text": "Washington Freedom owner Sanjay Govil, an India-raised American tech entrepreneur, says he is \u201cabsolutely\u201d interested in potentially investing in the Big Bash League, the Australian T20 franchise competition contemplating privatization and expansion.\nAn independent report from Boston Consulting Group has recommended Cricket Australia sell minority stakes in the eight BBL clubs.\nThe BBL, which started in 2011 and enjoys immense popularity in the heart of Australia\u2019s cricket season in December and January, is an outlier among cricket\u2019s T20 franchise leagues, with CA and the state associations having ownership control.\nBut there are winds of change, particularly after the recent sale of Hundred franchises in the England competition with the teams valued at $1.3 billion.\nGovil, Montreal-born but grew up in India before making his fortune in the U.S. after launching Infinite Computer Solutions in 2001, secured a 50 per cent stake in Welsh Fire, a professional cricket team in the Hundred that has a $110 million valuation.\nAlong with no doubt many other investors, particularly in the U.S. and India, Govil is monitoring the BBL developments closely. While privatization is widely anticipated, there has been pushback from some states and a decision is not expected for a while.\n\u201cAbsolutely (interested). Monitoring it with great interest and when the time is right then we will evaluate,\u201d Govil told me in a phone interview.\n\"I\u2019m obviously a little biased with Major League Cricket, but I believe that the top four leagues in the world are going to be IPL (Indian Premier League), MLC, BBL and the Hundred.\n\u201cJust based on economic size and popularity of the sport in those countries, even in the U.S, which has so many expat Indians.\u201d\nWith Australian superstar batter Steve Smith on the books of both Freedom and Fire, and with Washington having a partnership with Cricket New South Wales, Govil does seemingly have an early preference\n\u201cI have an admiration for Sydney,\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll keep my options open.\u201d\nAnother headliner of the report was for the BBL to consider expansion. New Zealand and Singapore have been floated as possible overseas locations, while it is learned that Malaysia has also expressed interest.\nIt comes as MLC is set to expand into Canada, with Toronto likely to be one of the two new franchises to come into the competition in 2027.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great concept,\u201d Govil said of possible BBL expansion. \u201cIf you look at MLC planning to expand into Canada, and if the BBL expands into New Zealand and South-East Asia, then it supports my view that the four big leagues basically represent large parts of the world.\u201d\nThe affluent city-state of Singapore looms as an intriguing option as it attempts to re-emerge as a cricket destination reinforced by recently hosting the International Cricket Council\u2019s annual meeting.\nIt hosted a trio of ODI tournaments around the turn of the century, and now sports a magnificent 55,000-seat national stadium, the showpiece of the Singapore Sports Hub in Kallang on the south coast of the island.\nThe national stadium has hosted major sports events, including regular soccer games featuring some of the world\u2019s biggest clubs but, disappointingly, cricket has never been played there.\nThere had been discussions of the IPL being based in Singapore in its early years and so too the Pakistan national team when they were unable to host matches due to security issues. A T20 international match between Australia and Sri Lanka was also once mooted.\nHaving hosted many tournaments, becoming a hub for Associate cricket in South-East Asia, neighboring Malaysia are keen to get in on any possible BBL expansion although the country does not boast the type of showy stadium for cricket like in Kallang.\nIt is all for CA and its states to consider, as interest from abroad heightens."
