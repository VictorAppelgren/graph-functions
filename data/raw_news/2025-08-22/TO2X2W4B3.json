  "title": "Bank Fires Workers in Favor of AI Chatbot, Rehires Them After Chatbot Is Terrible at the Job",
  "description": "Yet another tale of AI's less-than-stellar employee track record has emerged.",
  "content": "Companies all over the world are currently racing to shrink their workforces and replace them with AI. Often, it seems, this isn\u2019t working out for the firms involved. Case in point: A bank in Australia recently did so, but then had to ask its workers to come back after it turned out that the chatbot that it had launched to replace them couldn\u2019t cut the mustard.\n\nLast month, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced that it would be laying off 45 customer service workers as it rolled out a new AI-powered \u2018voice bot\u2019 that could supposedly do their job, Bloomberg reports. The bank claimed that the chatbot reduced the bank\u2019s call volume significantly. However, the workers\u2019 union got involved and says it has determined that wasn\u2019t the outcome.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Finance Sector Union, which represents workers in the banking industry, called BS on the bank\u2019s claims and engaged CBA in a workplace relations tribunal. Now, it appears that the bank has admitted it made a grievous mistake, telling Bloomberg that its initial assessment that the customer service reps were no longer needed \u201cdid not adequately consider all relevant business considerations and this error meant the roles were not redundant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have apologized to the employees concerned and acknowledge we should have been more thorough in our assessment of the roles required,\u201d a bank spokesperson told the news outlet. The same spokesperson said that the fired workers were being offered several options, including continuing in their old positions. Gizmodo reached out to CBA for more information.\n\nFSU put out a statement on Thursday, sharing details about the situation. \u201cCBA last month announced the jobs would be made redundant due to the introduction of a new AI-powered \u2018voice bot\u2019, which they claimed had led to a reduction in call volumes. Members told us this was an outright lie and did not reflect the reality of what was happening in Direct Banking,\u201d FSU writes. \u201cCall volumes were in fact increasing and CBA was scrambling to manage the situation by offering staff overtime and directing Team Leaders to answer calls.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting CBA to rescind these job cuts is a massive win \u2013 but the damage has already been done for our 45 colleagues who have had to endure the stress and worry of facing redundancy, some of whom have been with the bank for decades and were suddenly confronted with the prospect of being unable to pay their bills,\u201d the union added.\n\nWhile the particulars of this whole episode aren\u2019t readily available, it certainly seems like yet another example of a company putting the cart before the horse with AI. Ultimately, AI is still an experimental technology, and its results are hit or miss. A much-publicized MIT study recently claimed that 95 percent of AI pilot programs at companies have, so far, been failures. With numbers like that, companies would be wise to keep their headcount high for the time being.",

      "text": "Good morning. Companies are betting on AI\u2014yet nearly all enterprise pilots are stuck at the starting line.\nThe GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, a new report published by MIT\u2019s NANDA initiative, reveals that while generative AI holds promise for enterprises, most initiatives to drive rapid revenue growth are falling flat.\nDespite the rush to integrate powerful new models, about 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration; the vast majority stall, delivering little to no measurable impact on P&L. The research\u2014based on 150 interviews with leaders, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments\u2014paints a clear divide between success stories and stalled projects.\nTo unpack these findings, I spoke with Aditya Challapally, the lead author of the report, and a research contributor to project NANDA at MIT.\n\u201cSome large companies\u2019 pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,\u201d Challapally said. Startups led by 19- or 20-year-olds, for example, \u201chave seen revenues jump from zero to $20 million in a year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools,\u201d he added.\nBut for 95% of companies in the dataset, generative AI implementation is falling short. The core issue? Not the quality of the AI models, but the \u201clearning gap\u201d for both tools and organizations. While executives often blame regulation or model performance, MIT\u2019s research points to flawed enterprise integration. Generic tools like ChatGPT excel for individuals because of their flexibility, but they stall in enterprise use since they don\u2019t learn from or adapt to workflows, Challapally explained.\nThe data also reveals a misalignment in resource allocation. More than half of generative AI budgets are devoted to sales and marketing tools, yet MIT found the biggest ROI in back-office automation\u2014eliminating business process outsourcing, cutting external agency costs, and streamlining operations.\nWhat\u2019s behind successful AI deployments?\nHow companies adopt AI is crucial. Purchasing AI tools from specialized vendors and building partnerships succeed about 67% of the time, while internal builds succeed only one-third as often.\nThis finding is particularly relevant in financial services and other highly regulated sectors, where many firms are building their own proprietary generative AI systems in 2025. Yet, MIT\u2019s research suggests companies see far more failures when going solo.\nCompanies surveyed were often hesitant to share failure rates, Challapally noted. \u201cAlmost everywhere we went, enterprises were trying to build their own tool,\u201d he said, but the data showed purchased solutions delivered more reliable results.\nOther key factors for success include empowering line managers\u2014not just central AI labs\u2014to drive adoption, and selecting tools that can integrate deeply and adapt over time.\nWorkforce disruption is already underway, especially in customer support and administrative roles. Rather than mass layoffs, companies are increasingly not backfilling positions as they become vacant. Most changes are concentrated in jobs previously outsourced due to their perceived low value.\nThe report also highlights the widespread use of \u201cshadow AI\u201d\u2014unsanctioned tools like ChatGPT\u2014and the ongoing challenge of measuring AI\u2019s impact on productivity and profit.\nLooking ahead, the most advanced organizations are already experimenting with agentic AI systems that can learn, remember, and act independently within set boundaries\u2014offering a glimpse at how the next phase of enterprise AI might unfold.\nSheryl Estrada\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nLeaderboard\nMichael A. Discenza was appointed VP and CFO of The Timken Company (NYSE: TKR), effective immediately. Discenza has 25 years of experience at Timken in roles of increasing responsibility, including the last 10 as VP of finance, and group controller.\nJohn Cole was appointed CFO of ELB Learning, a provider of immersive learning solutions. He brings more than 25 years of experience leading finance and operations for Fortune 100 and 500 companies, according to ELB. Cole aims to strengthen the financial infrastructure to support the company\u2019s next phase of growth.\nBig Deal\nThe report\u2019s findings are based on a survey of more than 1,500 manufacturing leaders across 17 major manufacturing countries. Cybersecurity now ranks among the top external risks, second only to inflation and economic growth. One-third of respondents hold responsibilities spanning both information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) cybersecurity.\nNearly half (48%) of cybersecurity professionals identified securing converged architectures as key to positive outcomes over the next five years, compared to just 37% of all respondents.\nHowever, a shortage of skilled talent, training challenges, and rising labor costs remain major hurdles. As manufacturers recruit the next generation, cybersecurity and analytical skills are becoming hiring priorities\u2014reinforcing the need to align technical innovation with human development, according to the report.\nGoing deeper\nOverheard\n\u201cEvery single Monday was called 'AI Monday.' You couldn\u2019t have customer calls, you couldn\u2019t work on budgets, you had to only work on AI projects.\u201d\n\u2014Eric Vaughan, CEO of enterprise software company IgniteTech, told Fortune in an interview that he established a mandate: on Mondays, staff could only work on AI. In early 2023, convinced generative AI was an \u201cexistential\u201d transformation, Vaughan saw that his team was not fully on board. His ultimate response? He replaced nearly 80% of the staff within a year, according to headcount figures reviewed by Fortune."
