  "description": "Conservative talking head Jesse Watters told a story about a personal gripe with a famous actor\u2014and added new details.",
  "content": "Fox News host Jesse Watters is still nursing a grudge after an alleged explosive encounter with actor Shia LaBeouf\u2014and he brought it back into the spotlight on live TV.\n\nHowever, during Tuesday night\u2019s Jesse Watters Primetime, the conservative host added new details to his story, claiming that the 39-year-old told \u201cme to go eff myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a guy who stands up and he wants to do good for a friend of his who went to jail, so he steals for the friend to get him a lawyer,\u201d Mamet said.\n\n\u201cThen he goes to jail and gets involved in a shootout in jail. He gets a lot of people killed, he stages a riot. It\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nWatters took the opportunity to bring up a personal gripe. \u201cWell, Shia LaBeouf told me to go eff myself at a Delta lounge at the airport a couple years ago,\u201d Watters said. \u201cSo, tell him I said hi. Will you do that for me?\u201d\n\nMamet laughed at the comment but gave no indication that he\u2019d pass along the message. The anecdote isn\u2019t new\u2014but it\u2019s grown more explicit.\n\nWatters first aired his grievance back in 2019, while guest-hosting The Ingraham Angle. The version he told then was tamer.\n\n\u201cThe other day, I was at a lounge at the Delta Sky situation trying to take off for a flight with my family,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAnd the actor Shia LeBeouf or whatever his name is\u2014I think it was him, it looked exactly like him\u2014I walk by and he calls me \u2018trash\u2019 right in front of my kids, you know? And I didn\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t lose it. But, you know, these things happen.\u201d",

      "text": "All the world\u2019s a con to David Mamet, and if that viewpoint has long characterized his work\u2014resulting in at least two masterpieces, Glengarry Glen Ross and American Buffalo\u2014it continues to feel fresh in Henry Johnson.\n(Henry Johnson will be available on the film\u2019s website, henryjohnsonmovie.com, and select theatrical screenings starting May 9.)\nAn adaptation of his 2013 stage play, the dramatist\u2019s first film in 17 years charts the descent of its title character.\nThat happens in four scenes whose staginess is offset by their blistering investigation of morality, manipulation, individual and social responsibility, and masculine power.\nInvigoratingly sharp and bleak, it\u2019s proof of Mamet\u2019s still-formidable talents, as well as a stirring reminder of why Shia LaBeouf was once crowned Hollywood\u2019s Next Big Thing.\nOver the past decade-plus, Mamet has fallen out of mainstream-liberal favor thanks to his turn to conservatism and, then, MAGA extremism. While Henry Johnson isn\u2019t a vehicle for his effusive opinions about President Donald Trump, its hardness and cynicism\u2014and belief that every interaction, big or small, is in some way transactional\u2014is acutely attuned to the present national climate.\nIn Henry Johnson, everything is done for a reason, and that reason is usually to acquire something, be it relief, leverage, revenge, freedom, domination, or emotional or sexual satisfaction. A word is not uttered, a gesture is not performed, and an altruistic act or sacrifice is not made without an eye toward compensation, and those that come out on top are the ones who understand that, no matter the venue, life is a game of survival of the canniest.\nSplit into quadrants, Henry Johnson opens with lawyer Henry Johnson (Evan Jonigkeit) meeting with his boss Mr. Barnes (Chris Bauer), whom he\u2019s asked to hire an unnamed friend who\u2019s facing murder charges for trying to surreptitiously instigate his girlfriend\u2019s abortion.\nNone of this, however, is immediately clear; Mamet\u2019s script dives headfirst into their conversation without providing context, the better to let audiences slowly piece together the scenario at hand through bits and pieces of fragmented dialogue.\nAs always, Mamet\u2019s prose is a staccato wonder, full of stops and starts, half-formed questions and answers, and retorts that cause the chat to double back on itself until things twist into knots, even as the material forges onward at a rapid clip. It\u2019s an exhilarating dance, and Bauer is more than up to the challenge of the writer\u2019s scripting\u2014a fact that cannot quite be said of Jonigkeit, who proves, from the film\u2019s early going, its weakest link.\nBarnes is curious about Henry\u2019s precise relationship to his now-incarcerated buddy, whose way with women, and him, is chalked up to \u201cbeyond an allure\u2026an easy power.\u201d Questions of murder and rape, guilt and complicity, shame and desire, and exploitation run rampant throughout their discussion, and their scene ends with the revelation that Barnes has really just been keeping Henry busy while authorities were solidifying their case against him for stealing $300,000 of company funds.\nWhen we next see the caught-red-handed lawyer, he\u2019s entering a jail cell, and he\u2019s soon joined by his bunkmate Gene (LaBeouf), whose intensely stern glares\u2014and scruffy goatee and tattooed torso\u2014mark him as a less-than-welcoming roommate.\nBarnes argued that Henry was groomed by his rapist/murderer friend into becoming a willing accomplice, and then he proved Henry\u2019s gullibility by hoodwinking him. Behind bars, Gene explains, through repeated references to Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, that regardless of pretexts, everyone is after something. \u201cHere\u2019s the wisdom: Everything\u2019s as it seems.\nAll the cards are in the deck, it just depends on how you cut them,\" he states, and to Gene, the trick is figuring out people\u2019s aims so you can not only avoid being taken by them, but take them first. \u201cInside, outside, you need something to get over on those you want to try to control,\u201d and in this contest between the strong (i.e. cunning) and weak (i.e., naive), the goal is to be the savage hunter rather than the helpless prey.\nAided by terse direction, Henry Johnson\u2018s back-and-forths crackle with Mamet\u2019s trademark clipped, rat-a-tat-tat rhythms. LaBeouf is adept at handling his enormous, winding monologues, including during a third passage in which the two, in the prison library, discuss Henry\u2019s therapist, whose confessions and sympathy strike Gene as ruses fueled by ulterior motives.\nLaBeouf\u2019s performance is ferocious to the point of mesmerizing, and that\u2019s crucial to the proceedings, since Gene is a teacher casting a spell on his pupil, at once indoctrinating him to see things as he does, and perpetrating the very sort of deception he\u2019s warning Henry to avoid. It\u2019s a clever sort of mind-fuck, and so long as LaBeouf is the center of attention, the film\u2014mired in talk about dupes, punks, mobs, manliness, and feminization\u2014sings with that old-time Mamet toughness.\nGene\u2019s scheme regarding Henry\u2019s therapist\u2019s gun foreshadows Henry Johnson\u2018s finale, which finds its protagonist holed up in the library with guard Jerry (Dominic Hoffman), whose bloody collar\u2014paired with Henry\u2019s crimson-stained garb and the pistol in his hand\u2014indicates that Henry fell for his new buddy\u2019s plan, to disastrous ends.\nDuring the course of an extended police standoff, Jerry\u2019s thoughts about masculinity, purpose, fear, and legal system efficacy create a further tangle in Henry\u2019s fractured mind, all as he barricades the door, ignores a ringing office phone, and prepares for a showdown with authorities whose nearby presence is indicated by the sounds of airborne helicopters and illumination from their spotlights.\nGiven his own prolonged opportunity to shine, Hoffman demonstrates comfort with Mamet\u2019s mouthfuls of dialogue, thankfully taking the focus away from Henry, whom Jonigkeit embodies as a stilted and unconvincing sort of sucker.\nLike so much of Mamet\u2019s output, Henry Johnson is about men who treat each moment of every day as a battle between prospective winners and losers, victims and victimizers.\nWith caustic clarity and a decided lack of sympathy, it envisions the world as an uncompromising place where even basic ideas about right and wrong, fairness and justice, merely serve as additional tools of oppression and manipulation\u2014a perspective that, in a 2025 dominated by corruption, duplicity, disinformation, and elastic truths, feels brutally, depressingly timely."

      "text": "Playwright David Mamet continued his conversion to full-blown MAGA mouthpiece by tearing into Bill Maher for suggesting that the Jan. 6 riots were inspired by Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to formally concede the presidency in 2020.\nMamet, who previously said Trump was the \u201cbest president since Abraham Lincoln,\u201d was on Maher\u2019s Club Random podcast Sunday when the conversation inevitably drifted to his well-documented swing to conservatism.\nA particularly testy to-and-fro started about 10 minutes into the pod, when Maher made the point that Trump never conceded the 2020 election. The Glengarry Glen Ross writer suggested that Trump should not have to admit defeat if he had already literally lost.\nMaher then brought up the Jan. 6 riots, which he claimed were \u201cinspired\u201d by Trump\u2019s failure to yield. \u201cHow did he inspire people to riot?\u201d Mamet asked.\n\u201cBy not conceding the election!\u201d Maher shot back.\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright lamented. \u201cSo, he didn\u2019t say the words \u2018I concede\u2019 and that meant people rioted?\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d Maher, a longtime Trump critic criticized for attending a White House dinner in March, responded emphatically. \u201cWhat do you think January 6th was about?\u201d\nMamet batted the question right back at the Real Time host, who responded: \u201cIt was about people who did not hear their leader say, as every other leader in this country has said after an election [loss], \u2018OK, I lost. We welcome the new guy. We had disagreements, but now we\u2019re all Americans....\u2019 When Obama took over, George Bush stood next to him and said he wanted him to succeed, Trump didn\u2019t do any of that.\u201d\n\u201cOK, so what?\u201d Mamet shrugged. Maher said: \u201cSo what?! It inspires half the country to not accept the basic democratic principle that when you lose you go away and become the loyal opposition.\u201d\nMamet then went nuclear. Starting with flattery, he talked about his and Maher\u2019s career arc, before delivering a knockout blow.\n\u201cYou, like me, have built a career out of nothing except talent and a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work, but you\u2019re full of s---t!\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand when you say that he did not say the words \u2018I concede,\u2019 caused half the country, which you just said, to riot.\u201d\nMaher walked back on the \u201chalf of the country\u201d bit and said the point he was trying to make is that millions of people, mainly Trump\u2019s MAGA base, will refuse to accept future electoral results because of the current president\u2019s refusal to accept his defeat five years ago.\nTrump continues to claim that the election was \u201crigged\u201d and that he was the rightful winner, not Joe Biden. \u201cThey rigged the election, and I became president,\u201d he said as recently as March, during a White House press conference alongside Gianni Infantino, the president of soccer\u2019s governing body, FIFA.\nThis is despite numerous court rulings rejecting claims of widespread voter fraud and affirming the legitimacy of the results.\nIn one of the first acts of his current presidency, Trump enacted a sweeping series of pardons and commutations for individuals involved in the Capitol riots.\nMamet has firmly planted his flag in the \u201crigged\u201d camp. Despite his liberal upbringing, he affirmed a swing to the right by flirting with Trump\u2019s claims during a 2022 interview with The Guardian.\n\u201cThe idea that people are not going to steal elections is ignorance because people steal elections all the time. The question is: \u2018What was the extent of the election rigging?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. But was it questionable? Yes,\u201d he said.\nMamet added that \u201cTrump did a great job as president\u201d before being replaced by Joe Biden.\nEarlier in Sunday\u2019s bust-up with Maher, he said a phone call with Trump saw his flirtation turn to devotion. Maher pointed out that Mamet has become more emboldened in his MAGA views since a previous appearance on his show.\n\u201cYou know what happened me the next morning?\u201d Mamet explained. \u201cI was on your show and you said \u2018Are you implying that the election was stolen?\u2019 and I was kind of iffy on it.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cNext morning, 8 o\u2019clock, the phone rings. Woman on the phone says \u2018Mr Mamet, will you hold for the president?\u2019 I said, \u2018Wait a second, Biden\u2019s calling me?\u2019 It\u2019s Trump! During the Biden administration.\n\u201cHe says \u2018David, it\u2019s Donald Trump.\u2019 I say \u2018To what do I owe the honor?\u2019 He said \u2018I saw you on Bill Maher yesterday, you were great. But you wussed out on the question of the stolen election. And then he talked to me for like 20 minutes about how the election was stolen.\u201d\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Maher offered.\n\u201cWell, I think it was,\u201d Mamet responded."

      "text": "Jesse Watters has a bizarre suggestion for Sydney Sweeney\u2019s next move: marrying Barron Trump.\n\u201cYou know how this ends? She\u2019s gonna marry Barron,\u201d quipped Watters on a Monday night episode of his talk show The Five. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna create the greatest political dynasty in American history.\u201d\nWatters, 47, shared his strange fantasy about the first son, 19, and the Euphoria star, 27, as part of a segment on Sweeney\u2019s controversial American Eagle ad campaign.\nThe ad\u2019s central concept\u2014photos of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Sweeney emblazoned with the words \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans\u201d and the corresponding commercial in which the actress boasts \u201cMy genes are blue\u201d\u2014drew immediate criticism online from some who saw the imagery as derivative of Nazi ideology.\nHowever, the ad also made Sweeney a right-wing icon, with everyone from Fox pundits to U.S. senators stepping in to slam the \u201cwoke\u201d backlash.\nWatters himself has been one of Sweeney\u2019s strongest defenders. Just hours after running a nearly 10-minute segment on Sweeney\u2019s sex appeal during his solo show, Jesse Watters Primetime, the Fox host took even more time during The Five to skewer critics of Sweeney\u2019s ads.\n\u201cEvery girl wants to look like her, and every guy wants to look at her,\u201d said Watters to laughter from his co-hosts. \u201cAnd the Democrats think, wait a second, why don\u2019t we call her a Nazi and boycott the company?\u201d\nThough Watters\u2019 fantasy about the actress marrying President Donald Trump\u2019s teenage son was certainly unique, he\u2019s hardly the only MAGA face publicly lusting after Sweeney.\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz, 54, was an early defender of Sweeney, tweeting on July 29, \u201cNow the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women.\u201d\nVice President JD Vance, 41, also threw his support behind the actress, calling Sweeney an \u201call-American beautiful girl\u201d during a rant on the conservative \u201cRuthless\u201d podcast Friday.\nSince then, even the Pentagon has joined the MAGA thirst-fest, tweeting a photo of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday with the caption, \u201c@sechegseth has great jeans.\u201d\nEven the president joined in on the MAGA thirst-fest this weekend after Sweeney was revealed to be a registered Republican in Florida.\nResponding to a reporter who informed him of Sweeney\u2019s party affiliation, Trump, 79, said, \u201cIf Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.\u201d\nHe later took to Truth Social to continue praising the Anyone But You star, writing, \u201cSidney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the \u2018HOTTEST\u2019 ad out there. It\u2019s for American Eagle, and the jeans are \u2018flying [off] the shelves.\u2019 Go get \u2018em Sydney!\u201d\nUnlike his dad, Barron Trump has remained mum on his suggested future wife\u2019s controversial ad. In fact, the first son has been rarely seen since the inauguration, despite having joined his father on many campaign stops before the election.\nThough first lady Melania Trump and the president\u2019s four other children have all joined him at various events this year, the youngest Trump scion has been consistently out of sight.\nWhile Barron Trump hasn\u2019t weighed in on the controversy, Watters used his Monday night segment to declare the ad discourse a resounding victory for President Trump.\n\u201cTrump, who is in the culture because he watches TV all the time\u2026 champions this great American clothing company, and the Democrats lose another culture war battle,\u201d said Watters on Monday. \u201cThey are winless in the culture war.\u201d"
