      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world‑class level you need a disciplined, source‑anchored 3–6 month scenario map with a tight causal chain and explicit triggers/invalidation points. First, sharpen the causal tether from AI‑driven productivity to macro outcomes: specify the mechanism Range describes (1–1.5% productivity gains annually could lift GDP and dampen inflation) and trace how that lifts corporate earnings, hiring demand, tax receipts, and potential rate relief; explicitly reconcile this with Japan’s ongoing wage/ labor tightness (A7VLN74BK). Second, build a formal 3–6 month scenario structure: Base Case (modest but credible AI productivity uplift and gradual policy easing), Alternative Upside (strong AI uptake with meaningful rate relief and broader risk‑on asset allocations), Alternative Downside (AI productivity disappoints or inflation reaccelerates, delaying easing); for each, list triggers, timing windows, and invalidation events drawn from the sources (Range/AUVSI‑style productivity, Pacaso/Mogul/Gameflip liquidity/returns, UAS job data, and wage signals). Third, operationalize timing and path‑dependence: specify monthly readpoints (e.g., Range signal cadence, Pacaso/Mogul/Gameflip liquidity updates, US inflation prints, and UAS/job data cadence from FOM34PUWA) and spell out how a shift in one channel reweights the scenario. Fourth, augment quantification with concrete numbers and ranges from sources, not adjectives: include Pacaso’s 21% annual co‑ownership growth and roughly 10% house appreciation since 2021 (and the size of the addressable $1.8T vacation‑home markets), Mogul’s 10–12% cash‑on‑cash with 18.8% annualized return including appreciation, Gameflip’s 7.4M users and $200M lifetime sales, Range’s claim of 1–1.5% productivity uplift, and UAS data showing 1,400 UAS jobs nationally in 2025 with average $105,912 salary; and contrast against the defunct AUVSI projection to avoid over‑reliance on outdated benchmarks (FOM34PUWA; ILYC1M41F; UPV3X2MQ6; FOM34PUWA; AUVSI note in FOM34PUWA). Fifth, tighten the risk set and invalidation logic: enumerate 3–4 concrete risk catalysts (AI productivity disappointment; sustained inflation or wage pressures in Japan/global drag from A7VLN74BK; policy missteps that delay easing; liquidity risk in alt assets) and map clear invalidation thresholds (e.g., Range signal softness below a predefined band for 2–3 consecutive reads; Pacaso/Mogul/Gameflip liquidity drop below historical norms; inflation prints exceeding target for two consecutive quarters). Sixth, ensure format parity with SECTION FOCUS: end with a base case, 1–2 explicit alts, 3–4 watch signals, key risks, and a clearly stated confidence level (quantify as “moderate” with a rationale). Seventh, tighten the citation practice: attach each quantitative claim to its exact ID(s) and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., AUVSI’s defunct projections vs. Grand Forks/UAS data; ensure every numeric datum is traceable to V8TEZOR8R, FOM34PUWA, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, or A7VLN74BK). Eighth, trim non‑core items (e.g., peripheral tire/maintenance anecdotes) unless you explicitly tie them to cost‑of‑ownership or inflation sensitivity, and replace generic statements with precise consequence paths. Ninth, improve internal logic by adding a mini‑map of market transmission channels (macro to earnings to flows to asset prices; real assets to private markets; tech productivity to equities) so readers can audit the transmission. Finally, deliver a concise one‑paragraph executive version that embodies the base case, alts, triggers, invalidations, timing windows, watch list signals, and a clear confidence stamp, with all claims squarely sourced to the listed IDs (UPV3X2MQ6; ILYC1M41F; FOM34PUWA; A7VLN74BK; V8TEZOR8R as needed).
