      "feedback": "Your draft mixes several unrelated storylines (Ukraine, sanctuary‑jurisdiction funding, a truck‑driver crash, and the Maxwell‑Epstein scandal) into one “market‑risk” narrative, which dilutes the 0–3‑week focus. Re‑structure it into four concise sections: (1) **Immediate geopolitical driver** – Russia’s capture of Sredneye/Kleban‑Byk (ID 7YQN9WX3) and the stalled summit; (2) **Domestic policy shock** – the preliminary injunction blocking Trump’s funding cuts to 30 sanctuary jurisdictions (ID U1KRCQOYR); (3) **Border‑enforcement flashpoint** – the ICE detainer and legal outcome for the illegal‑immigrant truck driver (ID 2LYI30HBA); and (4) **Political‑reputational risk** – Maxwell’s denial of Trump’s involvement (ID FOA2XZ9D3). For each, list a clear causal chain, a near‑term catalyst (e.g., a new cease‑fire announcement, Treasury’s response to the injunction, ICE policy update, or DOJ statement on the Maxwell case), and a quantitative reaction function: e.g., oil prices above $80/barrel → Fed stays hawkish, Treasury yields 4.5–5.0 % → dollar strengthens; oil below $70 → risk premium compresses. Add specific thresholds (oil < $70, 10‑yr yield < 4.0 %) and invalidation scenarios (cease‑fire, injunction reversal, ICE policy shift). Cite each source by ID, avoid generic platitudes, and reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., note that the truck driver’s license issue shows a gap between state licensing and federal enforcement). This will sharpen depth, clarity, and actionable insight for the 0–3‑week horizon.",
