  "description": "Pronto has raised $11 million in an all-equity Series A round co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital at a post-money valuation of $45 million.",
  "content": "In 2025, the average urban Indian no longer needs to wait very long for much (except at government offices and in traffic): They simply have to order what they need from an app, and it\u2019ll be delivered within minutes. The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes.\n\nIt seems investors, too, don\u2019t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called Pronto, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days.\n\nIt was only in May when Pronto raised a $2 million seed round at a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round.\n\nThe new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago.\n\nThe startup now has bookings numbering in the \u201cfour-digits\u201d every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures.\n\n\u201cIt largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,\u201d Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round.\n\nFor investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. \u201cWe were very impressed by Anjali,\u201d said Rahul Garg, a partner at General Catalyst. \u201cGiven how young she is, given that she spent a lot of her time in the U.S. after she\u2019s come to India, what she\u2019s been able to achieve, the feedback from supply partners, the feedback from customers, her thought process, and how she wants to build and scale this business, we found it very inspiring.\u201d\n\nPronto is not the only startup connecting domestic workers with consumers. Lightspeed Venture Partners recently backed Snabbit, and IPO-bound Urban Company also offers a similar service.\n\nGarg told TechCrunch that India has 180\u2013190 million nuclear families who are potential customers for household services, and a semi-skilled and unskilled workforce of 35 million that could tap a $35 billion cumulative wage pool in this space.\n\n\u201cWhichever way you look at the market, this is large enough for multiple players to build an endurable business,\u201d he said.\n\nPronto now has six hubs in Gurugram, a satellite city of New Delhi, up from two in May. Each of these hubs serves customers within 1.5 miles.\n\nThe startup initially met 70% to 80% of demand from within 500 meters of households, as its first two hubs were located in densely populated residential areas. It has now set up hubs at intersections so its workers can reach multiple smaller, spread-out sectors quickly.\n\nPronto\u2019s primary customers are working professionals, and it is seeing high demand. \u201cHousehold help is very prevalent in India. And therefore, these are use cases where demand is quite concentrated, even in small catchment areas,\u201d Garg said.\n\nThe startup now plans to expand both within Gurugram and into new markets, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, and other major cities, in the next 12\u201318 months.\n\nPronto has a headcount of 33 people and has around 750 workers signed up on its platform.",

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "Urban India is becoming increasingly used to not having to wait \u2014 at least when it comes to getting goods and services delivered. You only need to look at the breakneck pace at which instant delivery apps like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart have grown and continue to see adoption soar in the country.\nPronto, one such startup that lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry, and home services within 10 minutes, is capitalizing on that change in consumer behavior, and it\u2019s now come out of stealth with a $2 million seed round led by Bain Capital Ventures at a post-money valuation of $12.5 million.\nInvestors are likely stoked to invest in such startups given their potential for growth, but Pronto\u2019s funding is coming at a time when people are increasingly sensitive to how gig workers are treated by platforms.\nJust two months ago, another venture-backed home services provider, Urban Company, faced intense public backlash for launching a similar service. Called Insta Maids, the 15-minute home cleaning service quickly sparked an uproar on social media, mainly for the language Urban Company used in its promotional campaign. The company later renamed the service to Insta Help, but many, including gig worker unions, didn\u2019t seem satisfied with just a rebranding.\nFor its part, Pronto offers cleaning, laundry, and cooking prep services with three different timing options: instant (10 minutes), scheduled, and recurring. Services are offered 24/7, and the startup guarantees 10-minute service access in all supported areas. The company claims more than 1,000 customers in the North Indian city of Gurugram.\nPronto\u2019s founder and CEO, Anjali Sardana, says her company aims to address gig workers\u2019 concerns with an approach that is \u201cwin, win, win business\u201d for all stakeholders.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s missing from a lot of the language around these services is that they treat workers like commodities. They treat them as inputs. That\u2019s not the way we operate,\u201d she told TechCrunch. \u201cWe sit at the same hubs where these workers are coming in and out every day. And the reason being that, as soon as you start putting separation between yourself and the worker, you lose empathy for them.\u201d\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nGovernment sources estimate India has nearly 4 million domestic workers, though unofficial sources say that number is more in the area of 50 million. Nonetheless, most of these workers are part of the informal labor market, which Pronto sees as a key competitor.\nPronto says its workers can earn about \u20b922,000 (about $258) a month if they work eight hours a day for 30 days. It also offers performance bonuses that can take their total pay to \u20b925,000-\u20b926,000 (about $293 to $304) a month.\nThese amounts are significantly higher than what domestic helpers in urban locations like the Delhi-NCR region are typically paid, which is around \u20b99,000, per the International Domestic Workers Federation (PDF). Sardana says her startup also functions as an agency to help workers when they face exploitation or abuse \u2014 a problem domestic helpers have struggled with in the country for decades.\nThe quick-service model\nSpeed has become the new normal for many urban Indians, but does that mean people don\u2019t want to wait even an hour to have their home cleaned? Sardana thinks so.\n\u201cWhen they need something, they need it right away,\u201d she said. \u201cFor that customer, having 10 minutes of service is huge because they no longer have to plan ahead.\u201d\nPronto started piloting its service in December in Gurugram before launching its first hub in late March. So far, the company claims 70% of its customers have requested its services twice within 14 days.\nThe startup operates two hubs in Gurugram, each serving customers within a two-mile radius. Sardana said 70% to 80% of Pronto\u2019s demand comes from within 500 meters \u2014 about two to three minutes \u2014 of each hub. Workers aren\u2019t required to return to the hub between jobs, though they must start and end their shifts there.\nEschewing commissions\nPronto eschews the commission model employed by most services that employ gig workers, instead paying its workers per four-hour shift, once every two weeks. The company keeps the fees it charges customers.\nThe company said it plans to start paying workers weekly, and even let them choose to be paid any time during their payment cycles, which domestic workers often ask for in such unorganized setups.\n\u201cEventually, we are going to build a lot of \u2018almost-fintech\u2019 products for workers to provide services that they need, as a lot of these people struggle to access those resources otherwise,\u201d Sardana said. The startup also plans to launch a health insurance product for its workers \u201cvery soon,\u201d she added.\nTo assure its customers that its workers are verified and vetted, Pronto does in-house training, government ID and police verifications, and court record checks, Sardana said. It also considers giving training and upskilling services to workers based on customer feedback.\nThe startup plans to open 10 new hubs in Gurugram over the next three months, and grow its worker network to 700, and its staff count to 50 \u2014 up from over 150 workers and 21 employees currently.\nUltimately, it plans to offer more services beyond cleaning and laundry, but its focus currently is on expansion \u2014 going deeper into Gurugram and entering new markets like Mumbai and Bengaluru."
