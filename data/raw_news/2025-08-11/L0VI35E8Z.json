  "title": "Aurora Theatre moves to lay off staff, vacate downtown Berkeley venue",
  "description": "If it ceases to exist, Aurora will join a list of recently closed or hibernating companies and venues that, in of themselves, could sustain a theater scene in a midsize city.",
  "content": "Since Aurora Theatre Company announced in May that it was suspending production next season, Bay Area theater fans have feared the worst: permanent closure of yet another beloved institution.\n\n\u201cWe have begun the process of laying off our staff, finding a home for our archives and emptying out this beautiful building on Addison Street in downtown Berkeley,\u201d he said in a video recorded from the theater\u2019s peninsula-shaped stage. Still, both the video and an accompanying letter maintained that it was only \u201cpossible,\u201d not certain, that the company would shutter forever.\n\nOne week of performances remain for \u201cThe Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,\u201d Jane Wagner\u2019s one-woman play, starring Marga Gomez, of interrelated monologues anchored by a self-described \u201cbag lady\u201d who gets beamed into other people\u2019s consciousnesses. In September, Marin Theatre is partnering with Aurora on the Tony Award-winning \u201cEureka Day,\u201d but those performances take place at the Mill Valley company.\n\n\u201cThe economic situation in the Bay Area today simply no longer allows for the small professional nonprofit theater model on which Aurora was built,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs with so many theaters, attendance never recovered from the pandemic \u2014 my sense is that social media and a broader cultural shift away from in-person socializing are as much to blame as COVID.\u201d\n\nOther cited causes include skyrocketing expenses, an untenable cost of living for artists and arts workers, tech titans\u2019 lack of support for the arts (in contrast to philanthropy by other industrialists in previous generations) and \u201cdisarray\u201d in public and other private support.\n\nEstablished in 1992, the theater eked out a high-quality but anti-razzle-dazzle niche, specializing in contests of ideas that played out like boxing matches or lit tinderboxes. It presented A-list performers such as James Carpenter, Margo Hall, Carrie Paff, Aldo Billingslea and Danny Scheie up so close that, especially if you sat in the front row, you were basically a part of the set.\n\nBehind the actors? Most likely fellow audience members, thanks to the theater\u2019s rare deep-thrust shape. When everyone laughed together in the theater\u2019s blockbuster world premiere of \u201cEureka Day\u201d or cringed and tittered at Mark Jackson\u2019s production of \u201cThe Arsonists,\u201d the room became an echo chamber in a way that\u2019s just not possible when spectators are anonymous in the dark, facing the backs of others\u2019 heads.\n\nIf it does cease to exist, Aurora will join a list of recently closed or hibernating companies and venues that, in of themselves, could sustain a theater scene in a midsize city: California Shakespeare Theater, Cutting Ball Theater, Bay Area Children\u2019s Theatre, PianoFight, TheatreFirst, American Conservatory Theater\u2019s master of fine arts program, foolsFury, Exit Theatre\u2019s Eddy Street venue, Custom Made Theatre Co., Mugwumpin and 42nd Street Moon.\n\nOther still-standing companies are making massive cuts, too. In late July, Magic Theatre announced it was indefinitely postponing its autumn show, \u201cJerry Garcia in the Lower Mission,\u201d because it couldn\u2019t raise the funds. \u201cI am crushed and confounded to have to make this painful and disappointing decision,\u201d Lead Director Sean San Jos\u00e9 said in a statement.",

  "summary": "Aurora Theatre Company, a Bay Area theater company, has announced it is moving to lay off its staff and vacate its downtown Berkeley venue, Addison Street. The decision was made in a video posted from the theater's peninsula-shaped stage, but it is uncertain that it will be closed forever. The economic situation in the Bay Area is cited as the primary reason for the decision, with social media and a shift away from in-person socializing being blamed for attendance decline. Other factors cited include rising expenses, an untenable cost of living for artists and arts workers, tech titans' lack of support for the arts, and public and private cuts. If Aurora continues to operate, it joins a list of recently closed or hibernating companies and venues that could sustain a theater scene in a midsize city.",
  "shortSummary": "Aurora Theatre Company is cutting staff and vacating its historic downtown Berkeley venue, citing economic challenges and social media influence, while other Bay Area companies like Aurora and Magic Theatre face similar challenges.",

      "text": "Dear Friends-\nTheatre teaches us that impermanence can be a virtue. A theatre performance is by definition ephemeral. It happens once. If you\u2019re not in the room, you miss it. No recording can capture the experience of that moment, that visceral connection between the actors and the audience in the room. And yet that unique, brief, fleeting moment can change your life forever.\nThirty-three years is a lot more than a fleeting moment. Aurora has had thousands of performances of hundreds of plays since its inception in 1991, each one a unique experience. Hundreds of artists have found a home in this remarkable organization, often doing the best work of their lives right here. I am one of them, and I consider myself very lucky. Audiences have been enraptured, transported, provoked, challenged, and entertained. Aurora\u2019s plays have inspired conversations, opened hearts and minds, and brought our community together.\nAs we mourn the possible ending of Aurora\u2019s thirty-three years of intimate, inspiring theatre in Berkeley, we also celebrate the remarkable achievements of this small but mighty organization. From its founding in 1992 by Bay Area legend Barbara Oliver, Aurora\u2019s commitment to rich language, nuanced acting, and exploration of ideas has generated a long run of exquisite theatre. Barbara and Tom Ross, my predecessors as Artistic Director of Aurora, set very high standards for both the quality of the work and the integrity with which this organization operates. The plays and their accumulation of awards and accolades are impressive, and so are the deep connections this organization has nurtured with our community of artists and patrons and staff.\nI\u2019m tremendously sad that this is happening, and that it\u2019s happening on my watch. Despite the best efforts of our staff and board and supporters, the economic situation in the Bay Area today simply no longer allows for the small professional nonprofit theater model on which Aurora was built. As with so many theaters, attendance never recovered from the pandemic \u2013 my sense is that social media and a broader cultural shift away from in-person socializing are as much to blame as COVID. Other fundamental challenges include vastly increased expenses, the cost of living in the Bay Area and consequent hiring and staff retention challenges, the lack of a culture of arts philanthropy in the Bay Area tech community, and the disarray of foundation and government funding. Aurora is not the first Bay Area theatre to cease operations in the wake of all this, and unfortunately it is unlikely to be the last.\nThis is a tragedy, of course. The in-person shared visceral experience that theatre provides is precisely the antidote to the so-called epidemic of loneliness that is sweeping our nation, and to the mistrust and fear that have allowed forces of hatred to ascend to power. Without theatre, we are poorer as a community and as individuals.\nBut theatre as an art form will not disappear. Organizations will continue to come and go. We'll see new models for funding theatre; new models for making theatre. We're living in rapidly changing times; we need new stories, new narratives, new generations of storytellers and audiences. You can be a part of this. I urge you to support and attend the many amazing theaters that continue to find ways to serve this community. Support the big institutions that employ many local artists, and the small, innovative companies that are discovering new ways to tell meaningful stories. That\u2019s how Aurora began, after all.\nAurora Theatre Company will always be an inspiration for me. I am so grateful for my thirteen years as part of this remarkable organization, and for the many many people who have been on this journey with me. While this moment is a sad one, I encourage everyone to look back on all that Aurora has accomplished, all the lives it has touched, all the stories it has told, and join me in celebration of Aurora, the ultimate intimate theatre company.\nThank you all.\nJosh Costello\nArtistic Director"

  "argos_summary": "The Aurora Theatre Company in Berkeley is facing potential permanent closure after announcing a suspension of its upcoming season due to financial difficulties exacerbated by the pandemic and a lack of support for the arts in the Bay Area. The theater, established in 1992, has been known for its intimate performances and has contributed significantly to the local arts scene. As attendance has not recovered post-pandemic and operational costs have soared, the company is now laying off staff and seeking to find a home for its archives, while other local theaters are also struggling to survive.",
