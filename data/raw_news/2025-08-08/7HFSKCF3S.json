  "summary": "Fast food chains Wendy's and McDonald's are reportedly seeing a decline in their breakfast business due to decreased consumer spending. This comes despite discounts offered by the companies. Wendy's interim CEO and CFO Ken Cook stated that when consumer uncertainty increases, consumers often choose to eat another meal at home due to home uncertainty. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski also commented that breakfast is the \"weakest daypart\" for his company. McDonald\u2019s reported that growth at its U.S. outlets slowed to 2.5% in the spring quarter due to pressure on lower-income consumers. Despite this, PYMNTS noted that U.K. households are proving to be resilient in terms of consumer spending, particularly back-to-school spending and travel.",

      "text": "Many consumers have been re-evaluating their spending priorities amid higher prices on goods and services over the past 12 months, with the potential for tariffs to cause further increases sharpening that reconsideration. Yet new data from PYMNTS Intelligence reveals surprising areas where consumption stays steadfast, along with widening disparities in how consumers across different financial lifestyles plan to adapt to price increases. The data uncovers the critical price thresholds that can trigger a widespread pullback in spending across technology and digital services, groceries and dining out, household and lifestyle, and personal care.\nPYMNTS Intelligence finds that the share of consumers living paycheck to paycheck\u201465% of U.S. adults in March 2025\u2014remained stable throughout the first three months of the year. For these shoppers, especially those who struggle to pay their monthly bills (22% of all consumers), rising prices are not an abstract economic trend but a daily decision-making challenge.\nFrom changing where they shop to skipping entire categories of purchases, the picture is one of consumers feeling increasingly pushed to make difficult decisions in every aisle. Yet insights into shoppers\u2019 evolving spending habits reveal surprising resilience, especially in the household/lifestyle and personal care sectors. For instance, a vast majority of consumers who have had at least one manicure within the last 12 months say they will continue to indulge even if costs go up, indicating the inherent value they place on such services.\nBut even loyal consumers will walk away when prices reach double their prior levels. These shifts, compounded by uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s constantly shifting global tariff regime, hold significant implications for retailers as they strategize pricing in an increasingly cost-conscious and economically sensitive market.\nThese are just some of the findings detailed in this edition of \u201cNew Reality Check: The Paycheck-to-Paycheck Report,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence exclusive series. This edition, \u201cNavigating the Shifting Sands of Consumer Spending Amid Rising Prices and New Tariffs,\u201d examines the impact of inflation on the financial lifestyles of U.S. consumers through insights from a survey of 2,280 U.S. consumers conducted from March 12, 2025, to March 31, 2025. The report explores the impact of inflation and tariffs on consumers\u2019 purchasing habits.\nPrice-Proof Products: Personal Care and Child-Related Spending Show Resilience\nAs prices climb, the average consumer negotiates a complex landscape of needs and wants, making tough choices about where to tighten their belt and what to keep purchasing at all costs. Buying less of something or cheaper variants are popular options, with more than two-thirds of consumers combined taking these routes. Yet certain expenditures show remarkable price inelasticity, meaning they are resistant to pullbacks from price increases.\nData shows that 30% and 23% of all consumers surveyed, respectively, would continue to buy personal care and household/lifestyle products when faced with price increases. Notably, only 5.1% of consumers who have visited a nail salon in the last 12 months would forgo professional manicures or pedicures if prices were to rise. These findings underscore the service\u2019s deeply ingrained value or perceived necessity among consumers, making them willing, to a degree, to pay higher prices.\nConsumer loyalty to household/lifestyle and personal care products reflects both the inherent value placed on these items and demographic purchasing. For instance, 81% of high-income individuals earning more than $100,000 a year made a select personal care purchase in the past year, compared to 50% of their lower-income (those earning less than $50,000) counterparts. In other words, since these product categories (household/lifestyle and personal care) are consumed at higher rates by high-income individuals, any price increases would likely not have as much of an impact on purchasing compared to other product categories with a wider consumer base, such as dining out.\nPrice inelasticity is mirrored in spending related to children. While 34% of parents would buy cheaper and 19% would buy less, just 2.9% report they would stop paying for children\u2019s extracurricular activities even if their cost increased. At 42%, consumers are more likely to buy less designer clothing, while vacationers are more likely to buy cheaper when prices rise. In contrast to children\u2019s extracurricular activities, vacations, at 7.1%, and designer clothing, at 14%, face significantly higher abandonment rates, signaling where consumers draw the line on discretionary spending.\nThese findings highlight the priority many consumers place on these personal well-being and developmental activities as they embed them into essential household spending. Moreover, inclusion of child-related costs within the household and lifestyle categories further contributes to their overall price stickiness, reflecting strong parental emphasis on these investments.\nWithin consumer spending on groceries and dining out, a clear hierarchy of necessity emerges. Again, two-thirds of consumers\u2014half of them buying less, the other half, cheaper\u2014report that they would take either of those routes when purchasing groceries or dining out. But while restaurant dining is viewed as discretionary, just 14% of consumers are willing to eliminate it entirely after price increases. Only 3.4% would stop purchasing milk (dairy or plant-based), demonstrating its essential status in household budgets. These findings underscore specific areas where consumer demand demonstrates less sensitivity to price increases, providing valuable insights for businesses operating in these sectors.\nThe Economic Resilience Gap: How Finances Impact Spending Choices\nWhat shoppers are willing to cut back on or abandon altogether varies significantly according to their financial lifestyle (which does not always correlate with income, as some high-income consumers live paycheck to paycheck). Consumers who do not live that way are 2.4 times more likely to keep their purchasing habits at the same level amid price increases compared to those struggling financially. Specifically, 31% of financially secure consumers reported they would continue buying at their current quantity and frequency. By contrast, only 13% of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers with issues paying their monthly bills indicate the same.\nThis \u201ceconomic resilience gap\u201d illustrates the profound relationship between financial security and consumer price elasticity. Furthermore, paycheck-to-paycheck consumers are more inclined than those not living that financial lifestyle to seek cheaper alternatives or reduce the quantity or frequency of their purchases when prices increase.\nConcerns about tariffs are also influencing consumer responses to rising prices. Across all financial lifestyles, 8.2% of consumers who think tariffs will negatively impact their finances plan to stop buying certain goods and services if prices increase, compared to 6.1% of those who view tariffs in a positive light\u2014a 34% difference. Again, most shoppers say they will buy less or buy cheaper, further indicating how broader economic concerns can amplify a consumer\u2019s sensitivity to prices.\nAcross all product categories, consumers not living paycheck to paycheck are more inelastic, meaning they are more likely to continue purchasing all types of products and services when faced with higher prices. Across financial lifestyles, however, certain purchases show more vulnerability. Whereas 41% of consumers not living paycheck to paycheck would continue buying personal care products regardless of how much more they cost, only 14% of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers struggling to meet their monthly financial obligations would do the same. In fact, financially stable consumers are 193% more likely to keep buying personal care products than struggling consumers. Likewise, data on spending habits shows that financially stable consumers are 93%, 114%, 169% and 150%, respectively, more likely than crimped consumers to keep buying technology, groceries and dining out, and household and lifestyle goods and services. This disparity in consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions highlights the constrained options faced by financially vulnerable consumers and their heightened sensitivity to price fluctuations, contrasting with the greater capacity of financially stable consumers to absorb cost increases.\nPrice Sensitivity Threshold: When Prices Double\nBeyond gradual price increases, a critical point is reached when prices rise 10%. Nearly 52 million consumers would abandon spending on select types of technology and digital devices\u2014from laptops to Netflix subscriptions\u2014as well as on groceries and dining out, household and lifestyle items, and personal care products and services, once the price goes up by 10%. Nearly 11 million more would draw the line at prices doubling. Collectively, 62.8 million individuals would stop making certain purchases. Notably, more than 1 in 4, or 27%, of shoppers said they would abandon purchases in the household/lifestyle category when their prices doubled. This suggests that even categories initially showing price inelasticity have a limit to consumer tolerance.\nWhile overall trends show increased abandonment at higher prices across all product categories, an interesting exception emerges among financially struggling consumers. Consumers living paycheck to paycheck with issues paying bills (14%) are less likely to give up their retail memberships compared to financially secure consumers (15%) when prices increase, suggesting the perceived value of savings from retailers such as Costco and Amazon Prime. This unique pattern suggests that membership-based savings models provide essential economic utility to financially vulnerable households, prioritizing maintaining their memberships even under price pressure. Meanwhile, other discretionary categories, including dining out, video streaming subscriptions and premium cosmetics, show the expected pattern, with struggling consumers much more likely to abandon purchases. Consumer sensitivity to price thresholds thus underscores the potential for a drop-off in buying if retailers\u2019 pricing strategies lead to extreme price hikes across various product categories.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the trends driving the economy and how paycheck-to-paycheck consumers respond.

The report explores the impact of inflation and tariffs on consumers\u2019 purchasing habits. Our sample was balanced to match the U.S. adult population in a set of key demographic variables: 51% of respondents identified as female, 33% were college-educated and 28% declared incomes of between $50,000 and $100,000 per year."

      "text": "To that end, the website Nation\u2019s Restaurant News reported Friday (May 2), the company is leaning into value offerings to attract diners after releasing earnings showing a 2.1% decline in same-store sales.\n\u201cWe like the second half of the year for the activity that we have,\u201d CEO Kirk Tanner said on an earnings call.\nThis includes the debut of Frosty Fusions later in the month, a partnership with Takis snacks, and a \u201c100 Days of Summer\u201d program.\n\u201cI think it reflects the balanced approach of getting after the customer and solving customer issues and opportunities,\u201d said Tanner, adding that driving consumers into restaurants was key.\n\u201cIt will definitely create consumer love and noise, and it\u2019ll drive traffic.\u201d\nThese efforts come at a time when consumers are dialing back on their spending. Earnings from companies such as Block have shown that Americans are focusing more on the essentials as their budgets grow tighter.\nThe NRN report also noted that Wendy\u2019s is continuing with its technological investments to enhance the customer experience.\n\u201cFrom enhancing our mobile app and scaling our loyalty program to implementing digital menu boards and Fresh AI order-taking, we are making technology an integral element of our strategy to deliver a seamless, physical and digital experience,\u201d Tanner said.\nAs covered here last week, part of the company\u2019s technological upgrades have involved its collaboration with Palantir, which helped Wendy\u2019s improve its supply chain.\nPalantir developed a digital twin of Wendy\u2019s to track the company\u2019s supply chain network in real time across 3,500 trucks, railcars, ships and barges, connecting them to 60 main partners, more than 250 shipping points, 34 distribution centers and the chain\u2019s 6,450 restaurants in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe digital twin automatically alerts Wendy\u2019s to things like supplies likely to go out of stock and raw materials the company should order to avoid shortages, Anita Beveridge-Raffo, lead deployment strategist at Palantir, said in an interview with PYMNTS.\nFor example, the platform uncovered a network-wide shortage of 10,200 cases of syrup used for soft drinks and was able to find 8,300 cases available at other distribution points. It was an issue that would have \u2014 at one time \u2014 taken 15 people an entire day of phone calls to solve. Now, the report said, Wendy\u2019s resolved it in five minutes."

      "text": "Fast-food chains are still ringing up sales, but the diners they serve look different from a year ago.\nMcDonald\u2019s said this week that profit for the spring quarter rose 11% to $2.25 billion, helped by a 3.8% gain in worldwide same-store sales. But growth at U.S. outlets slowed to 2.5%. Executives pointed to \u201ccontinued pressure\u201d on lower-income customers even as the company leaned on value meals and mobile-app deals to keep traffic moving.\nYum Brands\u2019 Taco Bell, meanwhile, logged 4% comparable-store growth at home and double-digit gains overseas, offsetting weaker numbers at sister chains KFC and Pizza Hut. The results track with industry data showing fast food outpacing sit-down restaurants as inflation squeezes household budgets.\nConsumers \u201care watching every dollar,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Sean Dunlop. \u201cThey\u2019ll still spend for convenience, but only if they feel they\u2019re getting a deal.\u201d\nThat bargain hunt is reshaping the business. McDonald\u2019s reported that buying tied to its loyalty program reached about $9 billion in the quarter, part of roughly $33 billion in digital sales over the past year. Yum said online and app orders across its brands now top $30 billion annually, with Taco Bell leading the charge.\nTech is doing more than book sales. Chains are automating kitchens, drive-thru lanes and back offices to blunt rising labor and food costs. Square research shows labor as a share of sales edging lower at quick-service restaurants, crediting kiosks and order-ahead apps that let outlets run with smaller crews.\nMcDonald\u2019s is testing voice-controlled drive-thru ordering and automated beverage stations. Taco Bell\u2019s newer \u201cGo Mobile\u201d stores use dual drive-thru lanes, curbside pickup and computer vision to alert cooks when an app customer pulls in. Smaller footprints help trim rent while handling more cars per hour.\nArtificial intelligence is also making menus more personal. Software that weighs weather, local events and purchase history can swap in a breakfast sandwich for a burger on a cold morning or push a late-night combo on a college campus. Consulting firm ZS says such targeting can lift ticket sizes by as much as a quarter.\nInvestors have rewarded the efficiency play. McDonald\u2019s shares are up about 15% this year, while Yum has climbed 11%. Still, both companies struck a cautious tone for the rest of 2025. With student-loan payments back on the calendar and wage gains cooling, executives said they plan to lean harder on low-price bundles to protect traffic.\nAnalysts expect the next leg of growth to come from further retooling the drive-thru. Chains are rolling out dual- or even triple-lane formats timed by AI that predicts when each car will reach the pickup window. Some are experimenting with buy-now, pay-later options and card-linked discounts that apply automatically at checkout.\n\u201cDigital isn\u2019t a side door anymore \u2014 it\u2019s the front door,\u201d said Greg Creed, former Yum chief executive and a consultant to several restaurant companies. \u201cThe brands that win will be the ones that treat the app as the restaurant.\u201d\nFor now, diners seem to agree. They may be pinching pennies, but if an app can shave a few minutes off lunch and throw in a free fries, they\u2019ll keep coming back \u2014 even if they order the $5 bundle instead of the $10 combo."

      "text": "The current tariff landscape can be boiled down to one theme: uncertainty.\nAs several news outlets have reported, a new tranche of duties hit at 12:01 a.m. Thursday (Aug. 7), but many carve-outs and enforcement details remain cloudy, forcing governments to scramble for side deals while the White House sketches sector-specific levies that could soar to 250%.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the Treasury has already booked $82 billion in tariff revenue in just three months, a 241% jump from a year ago. However, the path forward is anything but clear.\nThis comes as no surprise to PYMNTS readers. PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s year-long \u201cUncertainty Project\u201d has turned its attention to the tariff issue since President Donald Trump took office. As the tariff picture continues to develop (or not), we thought it a good opportunity to summarize some of the PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s findings across four groups: consumers, SMBs, mid-market companies and CFOs. Below are the latest sector-specific insights.\nConsumers:\n- Sticker shock spreads beyond imports. June\u2019s \u201cStock Out\u201d survey found 47% of U.S. shoppers could not find or afford everyday items because tariffs disrupted supply chains or inflated price tags.\n- Regressive impact intensifies. Millennials and Generation Z consumers, who rely heavily on lower-priced imports, face a tariff-related cost burden 1.6 times higher than that of baby boomers, according to the same report.\n- Trading down becomes the default. Nearly one-third of respondents delayed or canceled discretionary buys \u2014 electronics, home d\u00e9cor, even back-to-school supplies \u2014 while 42% said they now compare prices at three or more retailers before purchasing, up from 27% in January. Psychological scarring looms, the report says. PYMNTS analysts warn that prolonged out-of-stocks can \u201ctrain\u201d shoppers to regard once-routine purchases as risky, embedding thrift into long-term habits and eroding lifetime customer value for brands.\n- Takeaway: Tariffs are no longer an abstract policy lever. They are a daily pain point at the checkout aisle. Retailers must brace for a consumer who is both price-sensitive and chronically unsure whether the product will even be on the shelf.\nSmall- to Medium-Size Businesses:\nSurvival anxiety deepens. In \u201cBrewing Storm,\u201d we found 13% of SMBs lack access to any form of financing and believe their survival is at risk in the next two years, an 86% increase compared to the 6.9% of all SMBs surveyed who express this concern.\n- Precarious reliance: Half of SMBs currently depend solely on their daily sales or owners\u2019 personal savings for survival, indicating a limited financial safety net in a volatile operating environment.\n- Tariff preparedness gap: SMBs with access to financing and readily available cash are 23% more likely to be very confident in their ability to navigate potential tariffs. In contrast, SMBs without access to financing are 75% more likely to have no plan in place to help offset any additional costs arising from tariffs.\n- Counterintuitive disconnect: Surprisingly, 3 out of 4 SMBs that lack any access to financing paradoxically claim they do not need it. This finding is highlighted as counterintuitive given that survival in an uncertain business environment often depends on timely access to funding.\nMid-Market Businesses:\n\u201cTariffs and Business Uncertainty: The Current State of Play\u201d reveals a significant shift in sentiment among U.S. middle-market firms, with more than half of heads of payments at goods firms now believing tariffs will negatively impact their companies. This represents a sharp increase from previous months, when positive and negative outlooks were equally split at 35%. In contrast, services firms remain largely ambivalent regarding the tariffs\u2019 effects.\n- Supply chain concerns: The study highlights widespread concerns over supply chain disruptions, with nearly 9 in 10 goods firms anticipating product delivery delays or shortages and higher raw material costs due to tariffs. These expectations have climbed 9 percentage points since February, indicating increasing strain on supply chains for physical goods.\n- No confidence vote: Confidence in managing these potential disruptions remains low across sectors. Only 35% of heads of payments at both goods and services companies expressed strong confidence in their firms\u2019 ability to adapt to supply chain challenges. Furthermore, 1 in 4 heads of payments surveyed reported being not or only slightly confident in their firm\u2019s adaptability.\n- Pressure: In response to tariff pressures, middle-market firms are actively adapting their strategies. For goods firms, 63% plan to renegotiate pricing with existing suppliers, and 53% intend to replace overseas providers with domestic ones. Despite these proactive steps, a notable portion of firms have taken no action, including 16% of goods firms and 24% of services firms, with this figure rising to 27% for high-uncertainty firms.\n- Takeaway: Mid-market CEOs call 2025 \u201cthe reset year.\u201d Growth bets are shelved in favor of liquidity hoarding, defensive tech and supply-chain relays \u2014 moves that help them survive today but risk dulling competitive edge tomorrow.\nChief Product Officers:\nOur report, \u201cThe CAIO Report: Tariff Turbulence: Product Leaders Shift Strategy to Blunt Fallout,\u201d reveals crucial insights into how companies of varying sizes are perceiving and responding to current trade policies. It found that pessimism surges among the largest firms: Eighty percent of product leaders at the largest U.S. enterprises, defined as those with annual revenues exceeding $10 billion, now anticipate mostly or completely negative impacts from tariffs. This represents a significant 24 percentage point increase in pessimism since May, when 56% expected similar outcomes.\n- Universal expectation of disruptions for largest companies: One hundred percent of the largest enterprises are bracing for specific negative consequences, including costs associated with reconfiguring supply chains, shortages or delays in acquiring necessary products, and difficulties with exports. Furthermore, all of these large firms also anticipate potential layoffs or reduced hiring.\n- Proactive measures: In response to tariff pressures, most of the largest enterprises are actively implementing strategies. Specifically, 57% are reducing operational costs, while 50% are negotiating better prices with their suppliers and 50% are adopting just-in-time inventory strategies to manage their stock more tightly.\n- Emerging opportunities: Despite widespread concerns, the report indicates some positive outlooks. Ninety-two percent of all surveyed enterprises anticipate positive impacts from new opportunities to support local economies. Additionally, 82% expect enhanced supply chain resilience as a result of adapting to the current trade environment.\n- Takeaway: The finance suite is the new nerve center for tariff strategy, toggling between cash-flow triage and real-time scenario modeling. Yet PYMNTS warns of a bifurcation: proactive CFOs sprint ahead with contingency playbooks, while a sizable minority remain frozen just when foresight is most valuable.\nAcross every layer of the economy, PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s Uncertainty Project paints the same picture: tariffs have shifted from macro headline to micro reality. From checkout aisles to boardrooms, the new mantra is conserve, delay, hedge \u2014 and hope clarity arrives before cash runs out."

      "text": "There\u2019s a prevailing sense of caution, a consumer mood that can even be called gloomy.\nBut thus far into earnings season, a bit less than a month old, there are indications that, overall, U.S. households are proving to be resilient. There are categories, particularly essentials and packaged goods, which are drawing their fair share of the monthly budget.\nWithin retail, a standout example is the record-high back-to-school spending, as documented here, suggesting that items such a backpacks and dorm rooms are non-negotiable for many families as funds earmarked for those (and other) items are set to grow by 4% year over year, and touch the highest levels since 2021, at more than $628 per student. That signals an \u201cintent to spend\u201d that will last through the summer months and into the fall.\nIn the meantime, June\u2019s retail numbers came in better than expected, with sales rising 0.6% from May and climbing 3.9% year on year. Health and personal care stores surged by 8.3% and clothing and accessories sales climbed 3.9%, outstripping inflation, which in turn means that at least in some cases, consumers are buying more items.\nBut there are some puts and takes in an environment where sentiment is still muted. Travel, and by extension, luxury spending have seen headwinds, as luxury brands have noted pullbacks from U.S. consumers. As for the essentials \u2014 the items sold by CPG companies and by retailers \u2014 PYMNTS has found that a third of consumers are purchasing fewer items, which leaves a majority (two-thirds) spending at current levels, or boosting their spending.\nSome Pressure in the Mix\nGet a bit more granular, and income makes a difference. Our data found that consumers who do not live paycheck to paycheck with issues paying their bills are 2.4 times more likely to keep their purchasing habits at the same level amid price increases compared to those struggling financially. Specifically, 31% of financially secure consumers reported they would continue buying at their current quantity and frequency. By contrast, only 13% of paycheck-to-paycheck consumers with issues paying their monthly bills indicate the same.\nDeals and promotions matter, as they move consumers to spend online and in-store, and where, for example, Costco saw a 5.8% rise in same store sales. For the merchants, the balancing act between navigating tariff-underpinned costs and price increases is becoming a fact of life. As PYMNTS reported at the end of last month, consumer packaged goods bellwether Procter & Gamble (P&G) is raising prices. In its latest quarter, the company logged a 2% increase in net sales.\nChief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said the price hikes would be in the \u201cmid-single digits\u201d on about 25% of products in the U.S. Management said it was projecting a slight downturn in consumption among both higher-income and lower-income consumers in response to economic conditions.\n\u201cThe volatility the consumer is seeing, I think, is maybe not necessarily grounded in their current reality, but more on what to expect for the future,\u201d Schulten said.\nThere\u2019s a breaking point, so to speak, for consumers, and PYMNTS Intelligence has documented the impact of hypothetical price increases, down to the millions of customers that would be lost. A doubling in prices would translate into a 21% additional loss in the customer roster, documented in the accompanying chart."

Executives from both companies noted that breakfast is the weakest meal period, with many customers opting to eat at home instead. Despite efforts to attract diners through discounts and value meals, growth remains sluggish, particularly among lower-income consumers, highlighting a broader trend of cautious consumer spending influenced by rising prices and tariffs.",
