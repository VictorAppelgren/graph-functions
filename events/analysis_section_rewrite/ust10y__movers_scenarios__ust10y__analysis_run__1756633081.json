      "feedback": "The draft fails the asset‑mapping requirement (no canonical handle appears) and lacks citations, causal clarity, and realistic probabilities. Rewrite each line to target a single handle (e.g., ust10y, dxy, spx), use a concise driver/mechanism phrase, and specify a concrete catalyst (e.g., “Fed September 25 FOMC” or “core PCE release on Aug 30”). Ensure each line is one sentence, ends with a single probability %, and includes an inline citation for every factual claim (e.g., (U21K4ALYQ) for the 85% cut probability). Replace generic “Fed rate hike/cut” with the specific effect on the chosen asset (e.g., “Fed cut → ust10y ↓ 10–15 bp” or “Fed hike → dxy ↑ 50–100 bp”). Adjust probabilities to match market expectations (e.g., 85% for a September cut, 15% for a hike). Finally, verify that the time window matches the catalyst (e.g., “3‑month” for September FOMC, “6‑month” for mid‑year core PCE revision). This will satisfy the format, provide a clear causal chain, and meet the evidence requirement.",
