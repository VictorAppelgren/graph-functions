  "title": "With Amazon's Ad Dominance Looming, Investor Anxiety Over Future Growth Sours Sentiment For The Trade Desk Stock - Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD)",
  "description": "Shares of ad-tech firm Trade Desk Inc (NASDAQ: TTD) are trading sharply lower Thursday afternoon, as recent results are being overshadowed by mounting concerns about future growth and competitive pressures.",
  "content": "Shares of ad-tech firm Trade Desk Inc TTD are trading sharply lower Thursday afternoon, as recent results are being overshadowed by mounting concerns about future growth and competitive pressures.\n\nWhat To Know: The stock\u2019s recent sell-off has occurred despite the company reporting second-quarter revenue of $694 million, comfortably beating analyst expectations of approximately $685 million. The company also provided an optimistic third-quarter revenue forecast of at least $717 million.\n\nDespite the earnings beat and robust customer retention of over 95%, investor sentiment soured due to a flurry of cautious analyst revisions. Bank of America led the pessimistic turn, downgrading the stock from a Buy to an Underperform rating and drastically cutting its price target from $130 to $55.\n\nSeveral other firms, including BMO Capital and Piper Sandler, also lowered their price targets, citing concerns about the sustainability of the company\u2019s high growth rate and its premium valuation.\n\nThe primary headwinds facing The Trade Desk this week are competitive threats posed by tech giants. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s AMZN advertising division reported a 23% revenue surge to $15.68 billion, and its recent partnerships to sell ad inventory for companies like Roku amplify its market power.\n\nA Thursday report also indicated that Walmart Inc WMT may be distancing itself from The Trade Desk, further fueling investor anxiety. The combination of slowing growth, a CFO transition and intensified competition from dominant players has led investors to question the company\u2019s long-term trajectory, sparking Thursday\u2019s sharp decline.\n\nBenzinga Edge Rankings: According to Benzinga Edge stock rankings, The Trade Desk presents a sharply contrasting profile for investors. The company earns an exceptionally high score for Growth (92.28) and a strong score for Quality (68.12), reflecting its robust revenue expansion and solid financial health.\n\nHowever, these positive metrics are severely undermined by its other scores. A very low Value score of 19.09 indicates the stock is considered expensive relative to its fundamentals, a key concern highlighted by analysts.\n\nThis is compounded by a dismal Momentum score of just 6.30, which quantifies the stock\u2019s recent poor price performance and the significant negative sentiment driving the current sell-off.\n\nPrice Action: According to data from Benzinga Pro, The Trade Desk shares are trading lower by 7.24% to $50.43 Thursday afternoon. The stock has a 52-week high of $141.53 and a 52-week low of $42.96.\n\nRead Also: Amazon\u2019s Grocery Delivery Expansion Seen As Game-Changer In $90-Billion Online Market Opportunity\n\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Trade Desk \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\n\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u201cfractional shares,\u201d which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.\n\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u201cgo short\u201d a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.",

As analysts weigh in, the results reveal a deeper narrative about the company\u2019s future growth prospects and market position.\nShares of Trade Desk tanked in early trading on Friday, despite the company reporting upbeat second-quarter revenues on Thursday.\n- TTD is experiencing unusually high volume. Track live prices here.\nThe announcement came amid an exciting earnings season. Here are some key analyst takeaways.\nBofA Securities On Trade Desk\nAnalyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich downgraded the rating from Buy to Underperform, while slashing the price target from $130 to $55.\nThere had been concerns around whether Trade Desk could sustain long-term growth of 20% to support its premium valuation, Reif Ehrlich said in the downgrade note. The company\u2019s third-quarter outlook, which implies \"a deceleration in underlying growth,\" fuels these concerns, especially since its peers reported robust advertising growth, she added.\n\"While we see several potential long-term growth drivers for TTD, visibility into the timing and magnitude of these benefits is limited,\" the analyst wrote. She lowered the 2025 revenue and adjusted EBITDA projections from $2.88 billion to $2.86 billion and from $1.14 billion to $1.12 billion, respectively.\nRBC Capital Markets On Trade Desk\nAnalyst Matthew Swanson maintained an Outperform rating, while reducing the price target of $100 to $90.\nTrade Desk reported strong quarterly results, with upside to revenue and adjusted EBITDA, Swanson said. \"Investors focused on the scale of the beat as diminishing macro concerns raised expectations into the print,\" he wrote.\nWhile management's guidance was \"underwhelming,\" in view of macro uncertainties, several trends suggested re-accelerating growth in 2026, the analyst stated. Although the company is more susceptible to tariffs, the underlying trends around CTV, JBPs and Kokai could gain momentum into 2026, he added.\nCheck out other analyst stock ratings.\nDA Davidson On Trade Desk\nAnalyst Tom White reaffirmed a Buy rating, while reducing the price target from $92 to $80.\nTrade Desk reported revenues of $694 million, beating the consensus of $685 million, with EBITDA of $270.8 million topping expectations of $261 million, White said. Management's third-quarter guidance of at least $717 million came in slightly higher than the consensus of $716 million, while the EBITDA guidance was in line, he added.\nThe company announced the surprise departure of its CFO Laura Schenkein, who is to be replaced by early investor Alex Kayyal, the analyst stated. Although Trade Desk is witnessing some headwinds due to tariff uncertainty, \"the company remains extremely well-positioned to leverage the broader secular trend of CTV ad spend growth,\" he further wrote.\nRosenblatt Securities On Trade Desk\nAnalyst Barton Crockett reiterated a Buy rating and price target of $78.\nTrade Desk's revenues grew 18.7% year-on-year in the second quarter, representing a slowdown from the 25% growth reported in the previous quarter, Crockett said. While adjusted EBITDA of $271 million topped consensus by around 4%, this was much less than the 40% beat in the first quarter, he added.\nAlthough the company indicated rapid growth in CTV, it did not provide the growth rate, the analyst stated. \"The Trade Desk remains a strong business, but a slower grower now than in years past,\" he further wrote.\nTTD Price Action: Trade Desk shares were down 39.13% at $53.76 at the time of publication on Friday, according to Benzinga Pro.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "If you're interested in learning how to short stocks, get an edge over other traders with Benzinga Pro while we're currently offering a 14-day trial.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand that you make money after buying a stock when the stock price increases. Traders who want to profit from a declining market can use a strategy called shorting stock. Continue reading to find out how you short a stock.\nQuick Look at How to Short a Stock:\n- Research: Identify a stock that you believe will decrease in value.\n- Borrow Shares: Borrow shares of the stock from your broker through a margin account.\n- Sell Shares: Sell the borrowed shares on the open market at the current market price.\n- Wait for Price to Drop: Monitor the stock\u2019s price and wait for it to decrease.\n- Buy Back Shares: Once the price drops to your desired level, buy back the shares from the market.\n- Return Shares: Return the shares to your broker to close out the short position.\n- Profit/Loss: The difference between the price at which you sold the shares and the price at which you bought them back determines your profit or loss.\n- What Does it Mean to Short a Stock?\n- How Do You Do It?\n- An Example\n- See All 13 Items\nWhat Does it Mean to Short a Stock?\nTraders called short sellers use a short selling strategy to speculate on a future market fall of a particular share price.\n- Shorting a stock first involves borrowing the stock you wish to sell at a market-determined interest rate and then selling the borrowed equities to take advantage of a future market decline.\n- You profit by selling the borrowed stock at a higher price and subsequently buying it back at a lower price if the stock price falls. The profit consists of the difference between the price at which the trader sold the stock and the price they buy it back at less any borrowing and transaction costs.\nYou can also lose money if the market rises instead of declines as you expected when you initiated the position. This can be particularly problematic and cause something called a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d if a large short position accumulates in a stock and significant buying interest subsequently emerges. Retail investors can take action here if they feel comfortable, and they will simply wait as the price declines further.\nStockbrokers generally have a stock loan arrangement with other clients and brokers where the broker pays a certain amount to borrow requested stock, if available. This arrangement allows the broker to use its customer\u2019s stock held in margin accounts or to borrow stock from other brokers to facilitate its other clients\u2019 short sales.\nSome market participants feel that this is a form of market manipulation, but it\u2019s akin to seizing on an opportunity. Stocks often don\u2019t fall into a position where shorting will make sense, and that\u2019s it\u2019s not a popular investment strategy.\nTypically, the fee for a stock loan on a liquid exchange traded stock is 0.30% per annum. If the stock is difficult to borrow, the stock loan fee could go up substantially.\nIn 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implemented its alternative uptick rule, known as Rule 201, that lets investors in a stock exit their long positions before any short selling can legally occur. The rule becomes active if a stock\u2019s price falls more than 10% in a single day. Short selling is then only allowed \u201cif the price of the security is above the current national best bid.\u201d The goal of this rule is to preserve investor confidence and promote market stability during times of high volatility and extreme selling pressure in a stock.\nHow Do You Do It?\nWhile it may sound complicated because of the borrowing aspect, the process of shorting a stock is actually pretty easy to put into practice. Shorting a stock can be explained in four simple steps:\n- The short seller asks their broker to borrow the stock they intend to sell from a holder willing to loan out their stock. They will need to pay a certain interest rate to the stockholder known as the broker loan rate.\n- They then either sell the stock they borrowed at the current market price or they place a limit order to sell it at a specific price and await execution of that order.\n- Once the short seller has successfully established a short position in the stock, they can close out that position by buying back the stock in the market, ideally at a lower price. This is known as \u201cbuying to cover.\u201d\n- The borrowed stock is then returned to the owner with interest via the short seller\u2019s brokerage account along with any dividends earned while the stock was borrowed.\nAn Example\nThe following example illustrates the concept of shorting stock using a specific company that had dropped significantly in January 2021.\nThe Company\nAcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRX) is a specialty pharmaceutical company that saw its shares drop by over 16% in late January of 2021. The decline was attributed in large part to the company\u2019s announcement of a secondary stock offering of 14.5 million new shares that would generate an additional $27.5 million for the company. This created quite a lot of downside risk.\nBeginning the Short Selling Process\nA short seller might expect that AcelRx\u2019s stock price would decline after the stock offering was announced. To take advantage of this anticipated drop, the short seller would contact their broker to borrow the shares they need. As an example, they might ask for a loan of 1,000 shares of AcelRx. The short seller then places an order to sell the borrowed shares at a desired sell price.\nThe short seller could have sold the borrowed AcelRX stock at $2.80 on January 20 and bought back their short stock the next day for $2 per share. Had they done that, they would have realized a profit of $0.80 per share or $800 on a 1,000 share position.\nThe Result of Shorting a Stock\nAfter the announcement of the secondary offering, AcelRX stock declined significantly. This gave the short seller the opportunity to cash in their profits the very next day. If the short seller had not covered their short position quickly, the stock\u2019s subsequent rebound may have cost the short seller money instead of allowing them to realize a profit.\nKeep in mind that the short seller is liable to pay any dividends received from the borrowed stock to the lender of the stock being shorted. The formula used for calculating the rate of return on a shorted security is as follows:\nRate of Return = (Sales proceeds from the short sale - dividends paid to stock lender - purchase price of the stock) / Initial margin requirement\nIn the above equation, the initial margin requirement is the proportion of the total market value of the securities that the short seller has to put up in cash to hold their short position.\nA margin account holder can borrow up to 50% of the equity in their trading account for the purchase of new securities or for short sales on normally traded stocks. A margin account also stipulates a maintenance margin that is typically 30% of the equity value. If the account\u2019s equity falls below this maintenance margin level, the broker will issue a margin call to ask the client to take steps to bring the equity back to 50% within a given time frame. If that is not done promptly, then the client\u2019s positions can be liquidated by the broker.\nMargin trading accounts have their own set of rules and minimum deposits depending on the broker and the stock you plan on shorting. Remember to check with your broker for information about how much of a particular stock you can sell short in your margin account and what your account\u2019s maintenance margin level is.\nBest Online Brokers\nTake a look at these recommended stock brokers for your shorting needs.\n- Best For:Active and Global TradersVIEW PROS & CONS:Securely through Interactive Brokers\u2019 website\n- Best For:Momentum tradersVIEW PROS & CONS:securely through Centerpoint Securities's website\n- Best For:Day Traders and ScalpersVIEW PROS & CONS:securely through Guardian Trading's website\n- Best For:Active Short Sellers With Modest CapitalVIEW PROS & CONS:securely through TradeZero's website\n- Best For:High-Capital Short SellersVIEW PROS & CONS:securely through Cobra Trading's website\nWhat to Know Before Short Selling\nIf you\u2019re considering shorting a stock, make sure you\u2019re informed about your broker\u2019s requirements before you borrow stock to short. You should also be aware of any special circumstances that could make the stock rally before you cover your short position. The following list includes some things you should keep in mind before selling a stock short.\n- The security used for shorting should be liquid since illiquid stocks tend to be harder for brokers to borrow.\n- A trader who intends to short a stock should maintain a funded margin account with their broker, since margin is needed for shorting a stock.\n- Shorting is done by borrowing stock, so the broker will charge interest on that loan to pay to the stockholder. A short seller\u2019s profit earned will be trimmed to that extent.\n- Short selling may be restricted on some stocks due to a low supply of available stock.\n- Stock borrowing costs can rise significantly under certain market conditions.\n- Shorting stocks is not allowed in your IRA account or in any other tax-deferred account.\nUsing Put Options\nShorting could lead to staggering losses if the shorted stock continues to move higher. A safer alternative to shorting a stock is buying a put option that gives you the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at the strike price on or before the expiration of the option.\nFor example, if you buy one $50 strike put option on ABC stock for $1.50 when it is \u201cat the money\u201d so that the underlying stock\u2019s price is equal to the put option\u2019s strike price, then that gives you the right to sell 100 shares of ABC stock at $50 up until the option\u2019s expiration. You stand to make a profit on that option if the price of the stock drops below $48.50 by expiration since you paid $1.50 to purchase the put option.\nWhen you exercise the put option, you sell the stock at the strike price. You can then pocket the difference between the strike price minus the $1.50 you paid for it and the sale price of the stock.\nAlternatively, you can sell the put option contract before it expires. If the market has since declined, you might make a profit on your initial investment. This can sometimes fetch you better returns than what you might gain by shorting the stock, especially if relatively little time has passed and volatility in the stock has risen.\nRisks\nBefore you begin shorting stocks, it\u2019s important to understand all the risks associated with this type of trade.\nBeware of a Short Squeeze\nOne of the key risks associated with shorting stocks is known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d This can occur when unexpected positive news concerning the company or the market triggers a notable upward move in a stock that has attracted considerable short interest. This can then send shorts sellers scurrying to cover their positions to minimize their losses.\nA perfect example of a short squeeze can currently be seen in the stock of GameStop. Some analysts estimate that the stock has a short interest of almost 140% of the total float of the company\u2019s stock. When short sellers chase the security higher to cover their short positions, demand perks up from technical traders, which can trigger a further sharp rise in the price of a stock.\nAnother risk that can fuel a short squeeze comes from something called buy-ins. This occurs when a broker is forced to close out a short position in a highly non-liquid stock since the lender demands their security back, perhaps because they want to close out their long position.\nBuy-ins and short sellers rushing to cover their positions have thus far pushed the price of GameStop stock to dizzying heights well beyond its fundamental valuation as a company. The massive short squeeze has also bankrupted professional hedge funds that have been short the stock for years.\nDespite such pitfalls, shorting as a trading strategy is here to stay, primarily because it offers traders the opportunity to make money even in a downward trending stock market.\nIs Shorting Stock Right for You?\nAlthough shorting stocks has its associated risks, the trading strategy can show high returns if done correctly and at the right times. Make sure to carefully perform your research on any stock before initiating a short position.

Some stocks may be hard to borrow or have restrictions.\nWhat fees or costs are associated with short selling?\nShort sellers may incur borrowing fees, margin interest and any dividends paid if the stock pays them while you are short.\nIs short selling recommended for beginner investors?\nShort selling is generally considered risky and may not be recommended for beginners due to its complexity and potential for significant losses.\nAbout Ryan Peterson\nRyan Peterson is a seasoned personal finance writer with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Business from Indiana University.
