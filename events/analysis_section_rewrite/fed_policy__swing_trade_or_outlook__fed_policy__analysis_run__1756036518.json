      "feedback": "This draft has solid macro scaffolding but needs tightening to world-class standards: enforce the Movers block to exactly four lines with 2 Up and 2 Down and a strict 3–6 month horizon, ensure each line rests on a clear first-principles causal chain (policy regime map → rate differentials/dollar/asset risk) and cite concrete, testable catalysts from the material (e.g., Regime 1’s September 50bp cut, Tencent AI monetization, Congo/mineral sanctions, BoJ divergence signals) using in-text IDs only when asserting facts; consolidate the four lines around a single coherent base-case macro narrative while clearly labeling the regime or path being assumed, and avoid mixing disparate signals without a stated alternative; make “What to watch” highly actionable with explicit triggers and price/level thresholds rather than generic prompts; quantify probabilities transparently by tying them to shifts in the cited data (e.g., a 50–60% likelihood tied to a clearly described trigger, not an unlabeled percentage) and reconcile conflicts between regimes by defining a primary base-case and a secondary scenario with guardrails; in the Swing Trade plan, provide one clean, tradable-line outcome for ACMR plus a complete set of fields: Long ACMR | 3–6 months | Entry around 30.50–31.00 | Stop 28.50 | Target 34.76 | R/R ≈2.1x | Invalidation: close below 28.00 or failure to progress toward 2025 guidance milestones | Trigger: a durable break above 32 on volume or a confirmed September rate-cut path | Probability %: e.g., 60–65% | Confidence 70; ensure the Outlook line (if not tradable) or the Swing Trade line is the sole conclusion beyond the Movers, with the same disciplined, data-grounded tone; finally, scrub the draft for citation density and consistency, using only the IDs that are essential to the asserted facts (GX057ADL7, 37UZC9X8I, SK994CBWR, Q7VVGNSQE, C22MKA9VY, H9WSBYP3D, YB758UDBU, S7M6BJSRT, 0G3A676BP, 0G3A, J99EM2TPZ, 48JXC9VDP, QF) and reconciliation of any conflicting signals to present a tightly argued, numerically anchored, scenario-driven swing outlook.",
