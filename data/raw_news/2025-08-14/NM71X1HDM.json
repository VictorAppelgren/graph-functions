  "description": "\"Molly Coleman is one to watch, since she long ago showed a willingness to take on the powerful,\" Rochelle Olson writes.",
  "content": "Molly Coleman is one to watch, since she long ago showed a willingness to take on the powerful. As a second-year law student at Harvard in 2018, Coleman was an author on a letter in the student newspaper that asked whether Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh would continue to teach in light of sexual assault allegations raised during his confirmation hearing. At that point, Kavanaugh had taught at Harvard for a decade, but the school ended his employment the following semester. Let\u2019s hope Coleman keeps posing uncomfortable questions throughout her nascent political career. Every level of government could benefit from fearless questioning of the status quo.\n\nJeers to the slog of Minnesota\u2019s legal weed rollout\n\nWe finally have a permanent commissioner for the office. But there\u2019s low supply and few opportunities to purchase, especially in and around the Twin Cities and southern Minnesota. Those seeking to buy medicinal marijuana have plenty of options, but the rest of us have to make a day trip of it, as evidenced by the Minnesota Star Tribune\u2019s homegrown cannabis map. The new commissioner is already on the job and should be able to get this operation running smoothly so we don\u2019t have prevail upon friends in Chicago and Colorado for supplies.\n\nGenerally, but especially this week for collaring a black wolf for the first time in 11 years. Black wolves are common in parts of North America, but not in the Greater Voyageurs Ecosystem, the boreal forest where the project tracks wolves in and near Voyageurs National Park, hard against the Canadian border. The collared young black wolf is a beauty, and we can now learn its travel patterns. After collaring, the wolf already was quickly on the move, headed eastbound near the Echo Trail and out of the Voyageurs ecosystem. The project reports there\u2019s never been a black wolf in the current 19 packs it\u2019s tracking. We can\u2019t wait to see what surprises await in the tracking of this unusual visitor.\n\nJeers to the lead up to a $1.6 million settlement\n\nHennepin County\u2019s legal payout to former Assistant County Attorney Amy Sweasy was the second payout to Sweasy, who received $190,000 in 2022 after filing a sex discrimination complaint with the state Department of Human Rights. Before this mess with the bosses, Sweasy was a strategic and savvy trial prosecutor, a leader in the office. Her workplace troubles began under former County Attorney Mike Freeman and continued under Mary Moriarty. Both Freeman and Moriarty claimed differences of opinion with Sweasy over prosecutorial decisions. OK, but isn\u2019t debating decisions part of the job of running such an office, and shouldn\u2019t the elected leaders do better? The county claimed the settlement with Sweasy was made to avoid the uncertainty of a jury trial, but it\u2019s a hefty sum that signaled her complaints carried weight. Most unfortunate in this dispute is that the county lost the experience and skill of a veteran prosecutor at the peak of her career. Freeman and Moriarty should have cleaned up the mess before it reached a cumulative payout approaching $2 million. Cheers to Sweasy for pursuing the lawsuit and to her attorney, Sonia Miller-Van Oort, who has an impressive and long streak of wins on behalf of employees.\n\nCheers to the Vikings\u2019 first male cheerleaders in decades\n\nLouie Conn and Blaize Shiek made their U.S. Bank Stadium debut at the first home preseason game last Saturday and were a hit with fans in person and on social media. Both men are longtime students of dance who broke the gender barrier on their high school and college programs in their native states. Conn was a dancer at Iowa State. Shiek made North Dakota State\u2019s dance team as a freshman. Congratulations to these gentlemen and to the Vikings for embracing gender diversity on the dance team.\n\nThe 34-year-old Republican operative claimed in a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court that he wasn\u2019t trafficking teenage girls, he was dating them. Lazzaro was convicted in 2023 of multiple counts, including conspiring and recruiting and paying teenage girls for sex. In his petition to the high court, Lazzaro said \u201cthe conduct alleged to be criminal consisted of little more than dating 16 and 17-year-old females.\u201d I highly doubt the court will buy it. Let\u2019s all thank U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz for sentencing Lazzaro to 21 years in prison. The judge said Lazzaro sought out emotionally vulnerable girls and got them drunk before sex. Lazzaro, a former friend of Nisswa Mayor Jennifer Carnahan, the former state GOP chair, will be locked up long enough to do some hard thinking about his sick ideas about dating.",

      "text": "GREATER VOYAGEURS ECOSYSTEM\nAbout the Greater Voyageurs Ecosystem\nThe Greater Voyageurs Ecosystem (GVE) is a ~ 2,338km southern boreal forest area that includes Voyageurs National Park and the area southerly adjacent to the park. The northern border of the GVE is the United States-Canada border. The GVE contains numerous small and medium-sized idyllic Northwoods lakes that are commonly associated with the Canadian Shield region. The forest habitats are predominantly a mix of\n2\ndeciduous and coniferous forests, interspersed with rocky, pine-covered ridges and wetlands, such as beaver ponds and black spruce bogs. The GVE has harsh, cold winters with temperatures routinely dropping below -20 F to -30 F (-29 to -34 C) (the town of International Falls, MN, on the westernedge of the GVE, is commonly referred to as the \"Icebox of the Nation\") and the summers are often hot, buggy, and humid.\nThe GVE has a variety of wildlife including wolves, lynx, black bears, bobcats, coyotes, fishers, moose, deer, and snowshoe hare. However, no animal has had as dramatic of an impact on the GVE as beavers.\n2\nBeavers are incredibly abundant throughout the GVE with densities surpassing 2\u20133 colonies/km in some areas. In parts of the GVE, beavers have created enough wetlands over time to cover 15% of the landscape! Deer are the most common ungulate in the GVE with moose occurring at relatively low densities across the area. The GVE has maintained high wolf densities (35\u201345 wolves/1000 km ) for many years and was one of the only places in the contiguous United States that never had its wolf population extirpated.\n2\nEach fall, we conduct aerial surveys to identify all of the active beaver lodges (colonies) within the GVE. In 2018, we counted >1,000 active beaver lodges!\nWhy study wolves in the GVE?\nThe GVE was not delineated for any geologic or hydrologic reason, but rather so we could bound our study area and research efforts. Given the unique shape of Voyageurs National Park, very few wolf packs exist solely within the boundaries of the park, and even individuals in these 'park' packs generally wander outside of the boundaries of the park throughout the year.\nKnown wolf pack territories in the Greater Voyageurs Ecosystem in 2023-2024\nThough we are primarily interested in studying wolves that use parts of Voyageurs National Park, it became increasingly apparent as we started studying wolves in the area that we needed to understand the factors that affect wolves once they leave park boundaries if we wanted to understand the wolves of Voyageurs National Park, and more generally, wolves in the boreal forest.\nThe land south of Voyageurs is primarily owned by logging companies, the state of Minnesota, and the United States Forest Service. There are a few large differences between how land in Voyageurs National Park and the area south of the park are managed. The first large difference is that there is no logging or timber harvest allowed in the park, whereas much of the land south of the park is actively logged. Because of logging activity, forest habitats south of the park are a mosaic of clear cuts, young and\nregenerating aspen stands, mature deciduous-conifer stands, and wetlands. In contrast, the park is dominated by mature forests as there have been few large-scale forest disturbances since the park was created in 1975. The second large difference is that recreational hunting or trapping of any wildlife in Voyageurs National Park is not allowed, but these activities are legal and popular just outside park boundaries. The most popular activities include bear, grouse, and deer hunting.\nThis map depicts just how territorial wolves are and how we derive territory boundaries. We created this map from 68,000+ GPS locations from 7 wolves in different packs during summer 2018.\nBecause of these differences, we try to study packs that have territories: 1) entirely within Voyageurs National Park, 2) territories that include Voyageurs National Park and area outside of the park, and 3) territories that are entirely outside of the park. By taking this approach, we are able to compare and contrast how the different management approaches of these landscapes impact wolves not only in the GVE, but across similar habitats throughout the southern boreal ecosystem."

Our presentation includes editorials and columns from members of the Star Tribune Editorial Board, columns from a roster of regular contributors, commentary and counterpoint articles from guest writers, letters from readers, and cartoons. It also collects opinions from the Star Tribune\u2019s full array of coverage areas so that readers may find them easily. Read on for details about each type of content.\nEditorials and Editorial Board columns\nEditorials represent the view of the Star Tribune Editorial Board and are published when the board feels its collective voice is both unified and needed. Board members are Phil Morris, David Banks, Jill Burcum, Denise Johnson and John Rash. Staff members Maggie Kelly and Elena Neuzil also contribute, and Star Tribune CEO and Publisher Steve Grove serves as an adviser to the board.\nBoard members offer their ideas at regular staff meetings. Those ideas come in response to news coverage, from sources members have developed in their areas of expertise, or from one of the meetings the board holds with community leaders, politicians, government officials and citizens\u2019 groups.\nBoard members discuss whether topics are worthy, how the editorial might be argued and what reporting will be needed to develop an informed opinion. Then a board member is assigned to do additional reporting and writing.\nMembers of the Editorial Board also write columns that are published under their bylines and reflect both their personal experiences in the community and analysis of subjects they encounter in their reporting and research.\nThe Editorial Board operates independently from the newsroom, meaning that news reporters and editors are not involved in determining the board\u2019s positions.\nOur columnists\nThe work you\u2019ll see at Strib Voices spans the spectrum of all that we cover at the Star Tribune. From News & Politics to Sports to Business to the Outdoors to Food & Culture, we\u2019ve assembled dozens of the smartest minds in our market to share their thoughts with you about the state we all call home.

Coleman's article asked: \"Will Harvard Law School take seriously the credible allegation of Kavanaugh's sexual assault against a young woman before he is allowed to continue teaching young women? Or will Harvard allow him to teach students without further inquiry \u2014 and continue paying him our tuition money?\"\nKavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court, but he won't be back at Harvard, where he had taught for about a decade. After Coleman's piece and scattered protests, the school announced last month that he wouldn't be back in January. Taking on a powerful figure and challenging the administration at the hallowed halls of Harvard was a no-brainer for her, Coleman said.\nShe said she received support from her most admired professors, as well as hundreds of students who joined a walkout. Of Kavanaugh's appointment, she said, \"It's so infuriating. \u2026 We are saying so loudly for everyone to hear that women don't matter.\"\nColeman has more writing in her future: She was recently elected co-editor of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review.\nA graduate of St. Paul's Central High School, where she was \"not even close\" to being valedictorian, and the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Coleman said she was drawn to the law to seek systemic change on racial and gender equity issues. \"Being at Central, it's hard not to think of things through a racial inequity lens,\" she said."

The settlement agreement was made public Tuesday evening.\nDuring a motion hearing in June, Judge Laurie Miller, who oversaw the case after it was reinstated by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, said: \u201cThere is nothing about this trial that isn\u2019t going to be awkward.\n\u201cI love jury trials, and I think this one will be fascinating,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cBut I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s a trial that anyone who is a party to it can be terribly comfortable with.\u201d\nThe two sides avoided the trial at the last minute, hammering out an agreement that nearly unraveled after the County Board refused to approve a settlement last month that had been signed by both parties.\nAttorney Sonia Miller-Van Oort, who represented Sweasy, said the settlement couldn\u2019t undo the damage done to Sweasy\u2019s career but it was a testament to her willpower.\n\u201cI just give a lot of credit to my client,\u201d Miller-Van Oort said. \u201cAmy had the courage and fortitude to take this on against an employer, against elected officials.

Her donors included well-known DFL givers and principals of some of the largest developers in the Twin Cities. Mayor Melvin Carter endorsed her run, as did former Council President Amy Brendmoen.\nShe comes from a political family\nColeman is the daughter of former Mayor Chris Coleman, who led St. Paul from 2006 until 2018 and saw St. Paul grow to more than 300,000 people for the first time since the 1970s. Coleman ran for governor in 2018.\nHer grandfather was Nick Coleman, a DFLer who served in the state Senate for almost 20 years, and who was the Senate majority leader from 1973 until 1981. He was the first Democrat to lead the Minnesota Senate in more than a century."

      "text": "Minnesota created a medical cannabis program in 2014 and legalized recreational use in 2023.\nBut so far, the rollout of the recreational cannabis market in the state has been slow-moving.\nTwo companies \u2014 RISE and Green Goods \u2014 exclusively provide marijuana to patients enrolled in the state\u2019s medical cannabis program. Both are expected to be licensed to sell adult-use cannabis as well in the coming months. Only a handful of tribally owned dispensaries currently offer recreational marijuana products for sale to adults 21 and older.\nThis summer, though, the industry reached a critical point as the state Office of Cannabis Management began issuing the first licenses to cannabis businesses. It may still be weeks or months before many of these businesses open their doors. The supply of adult-use cannabis products could be limited for some time.\nUse the map below to see every business authorized by the state or one of Minnesota\u2019s tribal nations to sell adult-use or medical marijuana. Adult-use dispensaries are denoted with a cannabis leaf icon, while those serving the medical market are marked with a red cross. Use the search field to filter by company name, address or city. Only retailers that are licensed and open for business are included.\nAs the industry rolls out, we\u2019ll update the map so you can see where cannabis dispensaries are opening across Minnesota."

Minnesota's cannabis market is facing a slow rollout, with limited supply and only a few dispensaries currently operational for recreational use, despite the legalization of adult-use cannabis in 2023. In a significant legal case, former prosecutor Amy Sweasy received a $1.6 million settlement from Hennepin County after alleging retaliation for her whistleblower actions related to police misconduct. Additionally, Anton Lazzaro was convicted of sex trafficking minors, highlighting ongoing issues of exploitation and justice in the community.",
