  "title": "Automated Sextortion Spyware Takes Webcam Pics of Victims Watching Porn",
  "description": "A new specimen of \u201cinfostealer\u201d malware offers a disturbing feature: It monitors a target's browser for NSFW content, then takes simultaneous screenshots and webcam photos of the victim.",
  "content": "Sextortion-based hacking, which hijacks a victim's webcam or blackmails them with nudes they're tricked or coerced into sharing, has long represented one of the most disturbing forms of cybercrime. Now one specimen of widely available spyware has turned that relatively manual crime into an automated feature, detecting when the user is browsing pornography on their PC, screenshotting it, and taking a candid photo of the victim through their webcam.\n\nOn Wednesday, researchers at security firm Proofpoint published their analysis of an open-source variant of \u201cinfostealer\u201d malware known as Stealerium that the company has seen used in multiple cybercriminal campaigns since May of this year. The malware, like all infostealers, is designed to infect a target's computer and automatically send a hacker a wide variety of stolen sensitive data, including banking information, usernames and passwords, and keys to victims' crypto wallets. Stealerium, however, adds another, more humiliating form of espionage: It also monitors the victim's browser for web addresses that include certain NSFW keywords, screenshots browser tabs that include those words, photographs the victim via their webcam while they're watching those porn pages, and sends all the images to a hacker\u2014who can then blackmail the victim with the threat of releasing them.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to infostealers, they typically are looking for whatever they can grab,\u201d says Selena Larson, one of the Proofpoint researchers who worked on the company's analysis. \u201cThis adds another layer of privacy invasion and sensitive information that you definitely wouldn't want in the hands of a particular hacker.\u201d\n\nProofpoint dug into the features of Stealerium after finding the malware in tens of thousands of emails sent by two different hacker groups it tracks (both relatively small-scale cybercriminal operations), as well as a number of other email-based hacking campaigns. Stealerium, strangely, is distributed as a free, open source tool available on Github. The malware\u2019s developer, who goes by the named witchfindertr and describes themselves as a \u201cmalware analyst\u201d based in London, notes on the page that the program is for \u201ceducational purposes only.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow you use this program is your responsibility,\u201d the page reads. \u201cI will not be held accountable for any illegal activities. Nor do i give a shit how u use it.\u201d\n\nIn the hacking campaigns Proofpoint analyzed, cybercriminals attempted to trick users into downloading and installing Stealerium as an attachment or a web link, luring victims with typical bait like a fake payment or invoice. The emails targeted victims inside companies in the hospitality industry, as well as in education and finance, though Proofpoint notes that users outside of companies were also likely targeted but wouldn't be seen by its monitoring tools.\n\nOnce it's installed, Stealerium is designed to steal a wide variety of data and send it to the hacker via services like Telegram, Discord, or the SMTP protocol in some variants of the spyware, all of which is relatively standard in infostealers. The researchers were more surprised to see the automated sextortion feature, which monitors browser URLs a list of pornography-related terms such as \u201csex\u201d and \u201cporn,\" which can be customized by the hacker and trigger simultaneous image captures from the user's webcam and browser. Proofpoint notes that it hasn't identified any specific victims of that sextortion function, but the existence of the feature suggests it was likely used.",

      "text": "When Jeff Bezos went public with his accusations of blackmail against the National Enquirer on Thursday, he was hailed by many online for his courage. In a post on Medium, the Amazon CEO alleged that Enquirer representatives threatened to publish intimate photos of him unless he stopped an investigation into the tabloid\u2019s reporting on him. Bezos refused. \u201cIf in my position I can\u2019t stand up to this kind of extortion,\u201d he wrote, \u201chow many people can?\u201d\nInstantly, Bezos became the most famous and powerful person to claim to be a victim of sextortion, the term often used to describe cases of extortion using intimate or sexually explicit photographs or videos. And experts quickly came out in praise of him for the way he handled the situation, calling it a \u201ctextbook\u201d example of how best to respond to extortion.\nBut Bezos operated from a particularly privileged stance. Factors like age and knowledge of legislation and laws regarding sextortion affect a person\u2019s ability to report sextortion and weather the fallout.\nLoosely defined, sextortion is when someone threatens to share intimate images of a person against their will\u2014usually by text or on social media, or even on a webpage set up just for them\u2014in exchange for a payout. It\u2019s different from revenge porn, where the aggressor shares the images just to be cruel.\nThere\u2019s no federal law against sextortion. It\u2019s also not tracked as a single crime, like, say, murder, which makes it difficult to collect data about the act. Compounding the data collection problem is that many victims don\u2019t report that it happened to them, according to experts WIRED spoke with. As with many intimate and domestic violence issues, victims often don\u2019t speak out for fear of being treated like they did something wrong.\nResearchers with the Brookings Institute and Lawfareblog attempted to quantify the problem in 2016 by tracking criminal cases\u2014finding 78 total nationwide\u2014and found that the phenomenon was not just underreported but also \u201cdramatically understudied.\u201d\n\u201cWhile [sextortion is] an acknowledged problem both within law enforcement and among private advocates, no government agency maintains data on its prevalence; no private advocacy group does either,\u201d the authors wrote, calling the cases they unearthed \u201cthe tip of a very large iceberg.\u201d\n\u201cThis stuff is wildly under prosecuted,\u201d says Leigh Honeywell, a former ACLU technologist and cofounder and CEO of TallPoppy, a company that helps companies assist employees who have been victims of sexual harassment.\nThe government does, however, seem to acknowledge it\u2019s a problem. Last year, the US attorney general\u2019s office created a Cyber-Digital Task Force to assess how well law enforcement was addressing cyber threats. In a July report, the task force concluded that sextortion and related nonconsensual pornography \u201cmay merit a federal response,\u201d owing to the \u201cincreasingly expansive nature of these crimes, in addition to the use of new technologies.\u201d\nMost academic research of sextortion focuses on teenagers, who experts say are common victims. Their youth, inexperience, and dependence on adults makes them uniquely vulnerable, and puts them at a serious disadvantage to deal with sextortion in the way a powerful adult might.\nIn a study published last fall, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire professor of criminal justice Justin Patchin surveyed a nationally representative sample of teenagers in the US and found that 5 percent admitted to being the victim of sextortion, and 3 percent said they\u2019d committed it themselves. A 2018 Pew survey of teen cyberbullying found that 7 percent report having had images of them shared without their consent. The FBI in 2016 wrote that sextortion of minors \u201chas become a major threat in recent years.\u201d\nAs minors, teens who share sexts could be technically guilty of sending child pornography, even when sexting it voluntarily to another teen. Patchin says most of the teens he and his coauthor spoke to for their research recognized this and feared being labeled a sex offender if it came out that they had taken nude photos or shared them.\n\u201cA sophisticated potential victim of this could flip the script and say, \u2018If you have the images you\u2019re in possession of child pornography, and I could call the police on you.\u2019 But in the vast majority of cases, the teens are freaking out too much to think about that,\u201d Patchin says. They\u2019re too busy worrying: \u201cWhat are my parents going to say? Am I going to get in trouble with the police or get kicked out of school?\u201d\nThose concerns are all valid, according to Patchin. Case in point: In 2017, school administrators in Chicago questioned a 16-year-old student about a recording he had on his phone of a consensual sexual act between him and another 16-year-old, calling it \u201cchild pornography.\u201d The boy later killed himself.\nAccording to Patchin, minors are very infrequently charged with child pornography, especially as law enforcement grow more aware of sextortion and choose to deal with it informally rather than actually prosecuting victims who are minors. But kids don\u2019t necessarily know that. Honeywell notes that she often sees teens in the subreddit r/legaladvice asking what to do about being sextorted, and very commonly adults respond that they should be worried about being charged with disseminating child pornography.\n\u201cThere needs to be legislation saying that if you are victimized by this we are not going to prosecute you, because it\u2019s horrific and it has a really chilling effect on these literal children\u2019s ability to get help,\u201d says Honeywell. Patchin notes that some states\u201420, according to a survey from late last year\u2014are beginning to pass laws protecting minors from child pornography allegations when sending consensual sexts to each other, like the Romeo and Juliet laws that make consensual sex between minors not a crime.\nBecause there isn\u2019t one singular federal law against sextortion, an act of sextortion could under certain circumstances violate a few different laws, according to Patchin and Honeywell, like the statutes against child pornography mentioned above. Patchin notes that if the victim isn\u2019t a minor, sextortion could be prosecuted as a classic example of criminal extortion, depending on the circumstances. He notes that if the images are actually shared, it could fall under some laws against revenge porn, which exist in some way in 41 states. (According to Patchin\u2019s study, about a quarter of the teens who were sextorted said the perpetrator posted a sexual image of them online; a roughly similar percentage said the image was sent to someone else without their permission.)\nAs it stands, legislation varies state by state, which makes it hard for victims of sextortion to even know what their rights are. Victims can check the nonprofit WithoutMyConsent.org, run by various academics and advocates, which keeps an updated list of state and federal laws concerning the \u201cnonconsensual distribution of sexually explicit images (as well as other forms of online harassment)\u201d to see what options are open to them. Some of these laws would only apply if the images are actually shared.\nFear of being judged is another reason victims of this crime stay quiet. Honeywell says the most important thing a sextortion victim can do if they are experiencing this kind of blackmail is to find someone to confide in who will be understanding and in a position to help them\u2014be that a parent, a friend, or someone else.\nIn Bezos\u2019 case, he confided in the whole world. The response has been overwhelmingly supportive\u2014and it might signal a step toward normalizing sexts.\n\u201cA lot of the 'quote-unquote' advice is to be very careful about who you send your nudes to, but that\u2019s not very realistic,\" Honeywell says. \"This is 2019, sexts are part of the realities of dating and being a sexual human in the modern world.\" Referring to American Media Inc., the company that owns the National Enquirer, she adds: \u201cThe people who should be ashamed in situations like this are the AMI\u2019s of the world.\u201d\nIf the rest of us can learn anything from Bezos becoming the world\u2019s highest-profile alleged sextortion victim, it\u2019s that he\u2019s far from alone in having his sex life weaponized against him. Hopefully, victims with less fame and fortune can be treated with the same compassion he\u2019s received.\n- A crypto CEO dies\u2014with the only key to $137 million\n- Probe your pupper\u2019s genetic secrets with these DNA kits\n- The WIRED guide to commercial human space flight\n- Apple, the iPhone, and the innovator\u2019s dilemma\n- The trash-talking furry dominating esports\n- \ud83d\udc40 Looking for the latest gadgets?

      "text": "Key findings\n- Proofpoint researchers observed an increase in opportunistic cybercriminals using malware based on Stealerium, an open-source malware that is available \u201cfor educational purposes.\u201d\n- Multiple other stealers share significant code overlap with Stealerium, such as Phantom Stealer. Throughout this blog post, we\u2019ll use the name Stealerium to refer to infostealers that share significant overlap with the original Stealerium.\n- Threat actors are increasingly pivoting to information stealers, as targeting identity becomes a priority for cybercriminals.\nOverview\nThreat actors are increasingly turning to information stealers in malware delivery, and Proofpoint threat researchers have observed an increase in the variety of commodity information stealers regularly used by cybercriminal threat actors. While many threat actors prefer malware-as-a-service offerings like Lumma Stealer or Amatera Stealer, some actors prefer to use malware that can be purchased one time, or openly available on platforms like GitHub. Stealerium is a good example of this. In 2022, it emerged as a freely available open-source malware on GitHub, and is still available to download \u201cfor educational purposes only.\u201d While open-source malware can be helpful for detection engineers and threat hunters to understand the patterns of behavior for which they can develop threat detection signatures, it also provides a different kind of education to malicious actors. These actors may adopt, modify, and possibly improve the open-source code, resulting in a proliferation of variants of the malware that are not so easy to detect or defend against.\nScreenshot of Stealerium\u2019s GitHub page.\nAlthough the malware has existed for a while, Proofpoint researchers recently observed an uptick in campaigns delivering Stealerium-based malware. A campaign linked to the cybercriminal actor TA2715 in May 2025 led to renewed analysis of Stealerium, which had not been widely campaigned in Proofpoint email threat data since early 2023. TA2536, another low sophistication cybercrime actor, also used Stealerium in late May 2025. Both of these actors recently favored Snake Keylogger (also known as VIP Recovery), so the use of Stealerium was notable. Proofpoint researchers identified additional campaigns through August 2025 that employed a variety of persuasive lures and delivery mechanisms. While most campaigns are not attributed to tracked threat actors, the initial TA2715 activity marked the first observed use of Stealerium in Proofpoint threat data in over a year.\nCampaign details\nDelivery methods and lures\nMessage volumes range from a couple hundred to tens of thousands of messages per campaign. Stealerium campaigns included emails with a variety of file types for delivery, including compressed executables, JavaScript, VBScript, ISO, IMG, and ACE archive files. The observed emails impersonated many different organizations, including charitable foundations, banks, courts, and document services which are common themes in e-crime lures. Subject lines typically conveyed urgency or financial relevance, including \u201cPayment Due\u201d, \u201cCourt Summons\u201d, and \u201cDonation Invoice.\u201d\nFor example, on 5 May 2025, Proofpoint identified a TA2715 campaign impersonating a Canadian charitable organization with a \u201crequest for quote\u201d lure. Messages contained a compressed executable attachment that, when executed, downloaded and installed Stealerium.\nTA2715 campaign impersonating a charitable organization.\nResearchers have also observed multiple campaigns leveraging travel, hospitality, and even wedding themed lures. For example, on 23 June 2025, Proofpoint identified a booking request theme with compressed executables that delivered Stealerium. This campaign targeted organizations in the hospitality sector, as well as education and finance organizations.\nTravel-themed lure impersonating a travel agency.\nLike many commodity malware campaigns, threat actors delivering Stealerium also regularly use payment or invoice lures. In a campaign observed on 24 June 2025, threat actors used a \u201cXerox Scan\u201d theme with a lure related to payments. The campaign targeted hundreds of organizations globally. These messages contained compressed JavaScript files that installed Stealerium and performed network reconnaissance to gather Wi-Fi profiles and nearby networks.\nLure posing as a scanned payment document to ultimately deliver a JavaScript payload.\nAnd finally, like many threat actors, campaigns delivering Stealerium often use social engineering that leverages fear, frustration, or excitement to get people to engage with their messages with a sense of urgency. We\u2019ve observed adult-themed content in some Stealerium lures, as well as the following example that tells the recipient they\u2019re being sued. This campaign was observed on 2 July 2025, with a \u201ccourt date\u201d of 15 July 2025 to increase the urgency of the email. These messages contained IMG (disk image) files with embedded VBScripts. The VBScript downloaded the payload as a compressed executable which installed Stealerium.\nLegal-themed lure with .vbs and .img attachments that lead to Stealerium.\nPayload execution and reconnaissance\nUpon execution, Stealerium issues a series of \u201cnetsh wlan\u201d commands to enumerate saved Wi-Fi profiles and nearby wireless networks. Several campaigns also leveraged PowerShell to add Windows Defender exclusions and used scheduled tasks for persistence and evasion.\nExample process tree:\nExample process tree.\nThe collection of Wi-Fi profiles and broadcasted networks suggests an intent to harvest stored credentials for lateral movement or to geolocate the infected host. SSID naming patterns and security configurations support reconnaissance efforts and may enable threat actors to stage access from nearby systems.\nIn some variants of Stealerium-based malware, we witnessed Remote Debugging being used, as indicated by the \u201c--remote-debugging-port\" argument in chrome.exe. Remote Debugging is a browser feature intended for developers, but it has been exploited by various information stealers to bypass browser security features (such as Chrome App-Bound Encryption) and extract sensitive data such as cookies and credentials.\nMalware details\nOverview\nStealerium is a full-featured stealer written in .NET and has the capabilities to exfiltrate a large variety of data including browser cookies and credentials, credit card data (via web form scraping), session tokens from gaming services such as Steam, crypto wallet data, and various types of sensitive files.\nAs Stealerium is open source and has been in operation for a while, there are a number of great writeups on the malware and its variants, including a blog from SecurityScorecard. In this report, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the capabilities that are particularly interesting or have otherwise not been widely documented publicly (to our knowledge). Some of the capabilities that we\u2019ll touch on in this report are:\n- Stealerium-based malware has a large variety of exfiltration mediums, including some uncommon ones such as Zulip chat and GoFile\n- Stealerium\u2019s usage of dynamic blocklists for anti-analysis\n- Stealerium\u2019s features include support for possible \u201csextortion\u201d tactics\n- Overlap with other malware families\nOverlap with other malware families\nAs with nearly all open-source malware, the origins and overlap with other malware is murky at best. Stealerium is available as open source on Github, previously at the address: https://github.com/Stealerium/Stealerium. This original repository has since been removed from Github. However, it was re-uploaded here: https://github.com/witchfindertr/Stealerium.\nAs Stealerium is open source, there are other stealers that share code overlap, such as Phantom Stealer. Phantom Stealer is marketed as an \u201cethical hacking\u201d tool for \u201ceducational purposes\u201d and is sold on its site hxxps://phantomsoftwares[.]site/home/.\nPhantom Stealer pricing model (from Phantom Stealer\u2019s website).\nIt is not clear to what extent Phantom Stealer relates to Stealerium, but the two families share a very large portion of code overlap and it's likely that Phantom Stealer reused code from Stealerium. Notably, many malware samples we analyzed hint at both Phantom Stealer and Stealerium, with references to both in their code. For example, below is a list of .NET namespaces from a sample of Phantom Stealer but with a reference to \u201cStealerium\u201d at the bottom:\nPhantom Stealer namespaces that include Stealerium.\nOther samples we analyzed contain no references to \u201cPhantom\u201d, only \u201cStealerium\u201d, such as the following example:\nStealerium namespace references.\nStealerium and Phantom Stealer can generally be differentiated by the function responsible for uploading the exfiltrated data. Stealerium prints \u201c*Stealerium - Report:\u201d to the top of its summary report, and Phantom Stealer prints \u201c*Phantom stealer\u201d to the top of its summary report:\nSterlerium reporting function snippet.\nPhantom Stealer reporting function snippet.\nProofpoint has identified other families with Stealerium code overlap which highly likely have \u201cborrowed\u201d code from Stealerium. One such example, as documented by Seqrite, is Warp Stealer.\nAs there is significant code overlap between Phantom Stealer,Stealerium, and Warp Stealer. Proofpoint groups all these variants under the label Stealerium. We will continue to group these variants together unless one significantly diverges in capabilities or code.\nCapabilities\nWhen Stealerium first executes, it does the following:\n- Runs some anti-analysis and anti-sandbox checks\n- Creates a mutex and terminates itself if the mutex cannot be created. This is a common check that malware uses to ensure it only has one instance running on the victim system at a time.\n- Creates a directory on the system where it temporarily stages the data it will eventually exfiltrate. This directory format varies among samples but is commonly in the format \u201cC:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\<random_hex_string>\\<user_name>@<computer_name>_<locale>\u201d. For example:\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\AppData\\Local\\c742f9b4f1ad3336673662d7213a56ca\\Paul@PaulPC_en-US\\\nThe random string is derived by gathering system data such as the victim\u2019s username and computer name, and MD5-hashing the data (which can be seen in the following code):\nGathering system information and creating an MD5 hash.\n4. Retrieves and verifies its configuration\n5. Proceeds to execute its stealer functions\nStealerium has the capability to extract a variety of data, seemingly trying to grab as much as it can. This data includes:\n- Keylogging and clipboard data\n- Banking/credit card data (scraped from web forms)\n- Browser cookies, cache, and stored credentials\n- Session tokens from gaming services (like Steam, Minecraft, BattleNet, and Uplay)\n- Email and chat data (Outlook, Signal, Discord, etc.)\n- System data such as installed apps, hardware info, and Windows product keys\n- VPN services data (NordVPN, OpenVPN, ProtonVPN, etc.)\n- Wi-Fi network information and passwords\n- Crypto wallet data\n- Files deemed interesting (such as various types of images, source code, databases, and documents)\nA few things are notable here. First, Stealerium does not seem to discriminate when it comes to data theft. Whereas some stealers may target specific data types, focusing on browser form data or email data, for example, Stealerium has the capabilities to steal a larger variety of data types.\nSecond, the malware has a feature that focuses on pornography-related data. It\u2019s able to detect adult content-related open browser tabs and takes a desktop screenshot as well as a webcam image capture. This is likely later used for \u201csextortion\u201d. While this feature is not novel among cybercrime malware, it is not often observed. The following code shows how Stealerium first detects pornography-related (\u201cNSFW\u201d) content in open web browsers, then takes both a desktop and webcam screenshot:\nAdult content themed features.\nThe malware queries the victim\u2019s open browser windows to check if any of the following strings appear in the titles of open web pages. These strings are configurable by the operator of the malware:\nAdult content themed search strings.\nData exfiltration\nOnce the previously mentioned data has been enumerated and staged, Stealerium is able to exfiltrate the data in various ways:\nSMTP\nSMTP seems to be the most common exfiltration method observed in Proofpoint data currently used by Stealerium-based malware. Though notably, this isn\u2019t available in the main version on GitHub. This method uses a recipient address (an actor-controlled email address that receives the stolen data) and a sender address. The sender addresses often used are legitimate companies or people that the threat actor is spoofing. The staged data that the malware collects is compressed into an archive file, attached to an email, and sent to the recipient's address. It\u2019s worth noting that the original Stealerium code may not have contained the SMTP exfiltration functionality, so it's a rather new feature seen in more recent Stealerium-based malware.\nDiscord\nStealerium can send the staged data to a Discord server, via Discord webhooks. Discord webhooks are effectively lightweight bots and are often used for logging and alerting but can be abused for data theft.\nTelegram\nUsing the Telegram API and a Telegram API key, Stealerium can exfiltrate data to an actor-controlled Telegram account.\nGofile\nStealerium can also be configured to exfiltrate stolen data to Gofile, a cloud storage solution with a free-tier account to upload files. Below is a code excerpt from Stealerium showing the GoFile exfiltration code:\nGofile data exfiltration.\nIn a nutshell, this code pulls the Gofile server list from https://api.gofile.io/servers, and gets the name of a server located in the \u201ceu\u201d (European Union) zone. It then uploads exfiltrated data to this file server via the Gofile API. It\u2019s worth noting that Gofile has a free tier, so this makes it a good method for abuse and staging of exfiltrated data or additional payloads:\nGofile free tier.\nZulip Chat\nPerhaps the most notable exfiltration method is via Zulip, which is a chat service marketed for distributed teams. Using the Zulip API, Stealerium can exfiltrate data to an actor-controlled account. Below is a screenshot of this code:\nZulip exfiltration.\nProofpoint did not witness the use of Zulip chat service as an exfiltration method in the samples we saw in our email threat data, but it\u2019s worth noting that this capability exists.\nMalware configuration and encryption\nStealerium is highly configurable, with all configuration settings stored in a structure. An example of the configuration structure is shown below:\nStealerium config structure.\nThe exfiltration and C2 configurations are stored here, as well as configurations for what types of data the threat actors wish to steal. These config items also contain data theft targets such as targeted banking service names (as seen below):\nBanking services example.\nSome of the malware\u2019s config and strings are encrypted using AES. Stealerium\u2019s config contains an AES key and salt, which are used to derive a decryption key that decrypts the malware\u2019s C2 configuration and other data. Below is an excerpt from Stealerium\u2019s decryption routine:\nStealerium decryption function.\nAnti-analysis\nStealerium has a multitude of anti-analysis and anti-sandbox tricks up its sleeve, including the following:\n- Delays its execution (generates a random sleep interval time) to evade automated sandboxes\n- Checks the target\u2019s username and computer name of the system against a list\n- Checks the target IP address against a large list of blocklisted IP addresses\n- Checks the target GPU against a list of blocklisted GPU adapter names\n- Checks the target\u2019s machine GUID against a blocklist\n- Contains anti-emulation capabilities (executes timing instructions and checks the delta)\n- Checks for blocklisted processes and services running\n- Checks if the malware executable started from its intended path\n- Ability to \u201cself-destruct\u201d (delete its files and terminate its processes) if any of these checks fail\nNone of these techniques is new or particularly advanced, but it is notable how many different techniques Stealerium can use.\nOne particularly interesting capability Stealerium has is that it can dynamically download new blocklists from public repositories. In at least a few samples we analyzed, the different anti-analysis blocklists were downloaded from a single GitHub repository::\nBlocklists example.\nThese lists appear to be public blocklists maintained by a security researcher on GitHub.\nConclusion\nAs Stealerium is open-source and freely available and has the capabilities to exfiltrate a large amount of sensitive data via a multitude of mediums, Stealerium (and its variations) is a stealer worth keeping an eye on.\nRecent campaigns observed between May and July 2025 demonstrate that Stealerium continues to be used in opportunistic operations. TA2715 was linked to renewed Stealerium use which triggered broader threat hunting and revealed additional campaigns, associated with multiple different threat clusters.\nOrganizations should monitor for activity involving \u201cnetsh wlan\u201d, suspicious use of PowerShell defender exclusions, and headless Chrome execution which are consistent with post-infection behaviors. Additionally, organizations should monitor for large amounts of data leaving the network, particularly to services and URLs that are not permitted for use in the organization, or prevent outbound traffic to these services altogether.\nEmerging Threats rules\n2037800 - ET MALWARE Win32/Stealerium Stealer Checkin via Discord\n2063893 - ET MALWARE Stealerium CnC Exfil via Discord (POST)\n2047905 - ET MALWARE Observed Malicious Powershell Loader Payload Request (GET)\n2864110 - ETPRO MALWARE Stealerium/Phantom Stealer Exfil via HTTP (POST)\n2864111 - ETPRO MALWARE Stealerium/Phantom Stealer Exfil via TCP\n2864112 - ETPRO MALWARE Stealerium/Phantom Stealer Exfil via SMTP\nExample indicators of compromise\n|\nIndicator |\nDescription |\nFirst Seen |\n|\nd4a33be36cd0905651ce69586542ae9bb5763feddc9d1af98e90ff86a6914c0e |\nTA2715 campaign using compressed executable (SCR file) |\n5 May 2025 |\n|\n41700c8fe273e088932cc57d15ee86c281fd8d2e771f4e4bf77b0e2c387b8b23 |\nFinancial-themed lure spoofing Garanti BBVA with VBScript |\n10 June 2025 |\n|\nb640251f82684d3b454a29e962c0762a38d8ac91574ae4866fe2736f9ddd676e |\nScanned payment lure with JavaScript payload |\n11 June 2025 |\n|\na00fda931ab1a591a73d1a24c1b270aee0f31d6e415dfa9ae2d0f126326df4bb\n|\nTravel-themed lure with compressed executable\n|\n23 June 2025 |\n|\ne590552eea3ad225cfb6a33fd9a71f12f1861c8332a6f3a8e2050fffce93f45e |\nPurchase inquiry lure with compressed executable.

      "text": "For the past two months, cybercriminals have advertised for sale hundreds of millions of customer records from major companies like Ticketmaster, Santander Bank, and AT&T. And while massive data breaches have been a fact of life for more than a decade now, these recent examples are significant, because they are all connected. Each victim company was a customer of the cloud data storage firm Snowflake and was compromised not through a sophisticated hack, but because attackers had login credentials for each victim company\u2019s Snowflake accounts\u2014a data-stealing spree that impacted at least 165 Snowflake customers.\nAttackers didn\u2019t grab this trove of logins by directly breaching Snowflake or through a targeted supply chain attack. Instead, they found the credentials in a hodgepodge of stolen data grabbed haphazardly by \u201cinfostealer\u201d malware.\nAfter years of operation, infostealers are having a moment. The malware, which often finds its way onto people\u2019s machines through downloads of pirated software, can steal usernames and passwords, cookies, search history, financial information, and more from web browsers. This data collected by infostealers is increasingly being used by all kinds of hackers to compromise companies\u2014and cybersecurity experts warn of more high-profile data breaches to come.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen nation-states leverage infostealers, we\u2019ve seen criminals leverage infostealers, and we\u2019ve seen teenage hacking crews leverage infostealers,\u201d says Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer of Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant. Russia\u2019s APT29 hackers and cybercriminal gangs such as Lapsus$ and Scattered Spider are among the many hackers using infostealers. Just days after the global CrowdStrike outage, hackers created a new infostealer in an attempt to capitalize on the chaos.\nInfostealers are defined less by their technical capabilities and more by their role in the malicious hacker ecosystem. Of course, to minimally qualify, they must be designed to steal information. But what separates infostealers from spyware or other malware used in espionage or targeted data breaches is that infostealers are spread opportunistically and indiscriminately. They grab data from the browsers of whatever computers they end up infecting. Then the attackers who run them compile and organize this chaotic and largely random assemblage of data\u2014often on a marketplace or in a public forum like a Telegram channel. It is only then that infostealer operators or their customers comb their haul for valuable credentials and access tokens amidst the massive amount of junk. Ian Gray, director of analysis and research at the security firm Flashpoint, says there are likely hundreds of variants of infostealers in circulation.\nThere are some account access tokens that would have obvious value for many types of cybercriminals. If a data dump included working login credentials for a corporate employee\u2019s enterprise accounts, a ransomware gang, business email compromise scammer, or state-backed actor could use the access as a jumping off point to launch their attacks. But in addition to selling these prized details, infostealer operators maximize the value of the data they collect simply by making their stolen data available. Platforms like Genesis Market, which was taken down by law enforcement last year, and Russian Market, organize infostealer logs and even make them somewhat searchable so hackers who are looking to target more niche organizations or those who don\u2019t have financial motivations can potentially find exactly what they need.\nThese platforms take cues in how they are designed and marketed from legitimate information and ecommerce services. Many markets and forums charge a subscription fee to access the platform and then have different pricing structures for data depending on how valuable it might be. Currently, Gray says, Russian Market has so much stolen data available from infostealers that it has been charging a low flat rate, typically no more than $10, for any subset of data users want to download.\n\u201cOrganizations have become very good with their security, and people have also gotten more savvy, so they're not the best targets now,\u201d for traditional tailored attacks, Gray says. \u201cSo attackers need something that\u2019s less targeted and more based on what they can make use of. Infostealers are modular and often sold on a subscription basis, and that evolution probably aligns with the rise of modern subscription services like video streaming.\u201d\nInfostealers have been especially effective with the rise of remote work and hybrid work, as companies adapt to allowing employees to access work services from personal devices and personal accounts from work devices. This creates opportunities for infostealers to randomly compromise individuals on, say, their home computers but still end up with corporate access credentials because the person was logged into some of their work systems as well. It also makes it easier for infostealing malware to get around corporate protections, even on enterprise devices, if employees are able to have their personal email or social media accounts open.\n\u201cI started paying attention to this once it became an enterprise problem,\u201d Mandiant\u2019s Carmakal says. \u201cAnd particularly around 2020, because I started seeing more intrusions of enterprises first starting from compromises of home computers\u2014through phishing of people's Yahoo accounts, Gmail accounts, and Hotmail accounts that were totally unrelated to any enterprise targeting, but to me look very opportunistic.\u201d\nVictoria Kivilevich, director of threat research at security firm KELA, says that in some instances criminals can use cybercrime markets to search for the domain of potential targets and see if any credentials are available. Kivilevich says the sale of infostealer data can be considered as the \u201csupply chain\u201d for various types of cyberattacks, including ransomware operators looking for the details of potential victims, those involved in business email compromise, and even initial access brokers who can sell the details along again to other cybercriminals.\nOn various cybercrime marketplaces and Telegram, Kivilevich says, there have been more than 7,000 compromised credentials linked to Snowflake accounts being shared. In one instance, a criminal has been touting access to 41 companies from the education sector; another cybercriminal claims to be selling access to US companies with revenues between $50 million and $8 billion, according to Kivilevich\u2019s analysis.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was one company that came to us and had zero accounts compromised by infostealer malware,\u201d Kivilevich says of the threat that infostealer logs provide to businesses, with KELA saying infostealer-related activity jumped in 2023. Irina Nesterovsky, KELA's chief research officer, says millions of credentials have been collected by infostealing malware in recent years. \u201cThis is a real threat,\u201d Nesterovsky says.\nCarmakal says there are multiple steps companies and individuals can take to protect themselves from the threat of infostealers and their aftereffects, including using antivirus or EDR products to detect malicious activity. Companies should be strict on enforcing multifactor authentication across their users, he says. \u201cWe try to encourage people to not synchronize passwords on their corporate devices with their personal devices,\u201d Carmakal adds.\nThe use of infostealers has been working so well that it is all but inevitable that cybercriminals will look to replicate the success of compromise sprees like Snowflake and get creative about other enterprise software services that they can use as entry points for access to an array of different customer companies. Carmakal warns that he expects to see this result in more breaches in the coming months. \u201cThere\u2019s no ambiguity about this,\u201d he says. \u201cThreat actors will start hunting for infostealer logs, and looking for other SaaS providers, similar to Snowflake, where they log in and steal data, and then extort those companies.\u201d"
