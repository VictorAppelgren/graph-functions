      "summary": "The Senior Citizens League is advocating for a one-time $1,400 catch-up payment for Social Security beneficiaries to help them cope with rising living costs, which many seniors feel are not adequately reflected in the current cost-of-living adjustments (COLA). A recent survey indicated that nearly 80% of seniors believe inflation was higher than reported, and many struggle with essential expenses, particularly healthcare. The proposal aims to provide immediate financial relief, especially for the 7.3 million seniors living on less than $1,000 a month, while also calling for a reevaluation of how COLA is calculated to better reflect seniors' spending patterns.",
