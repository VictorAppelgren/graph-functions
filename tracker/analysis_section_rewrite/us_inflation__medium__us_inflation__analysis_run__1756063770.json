      "feedback": "Your draft admirably threads Cadillac GM EV capex, tariff dynamics, and the GOP policy frame, but it needs a tighter, forecast-focused structure to hit world-class quality in a 3–6 month horizon. Concrete feedback: (1) Causal chain and transmission must be explicit and quantified—link policy events to observable market signals: tariff trajectory (25% broad auto tariff, per WTNT85IPR), GM/U.S. capacity ramps (GM’s $4B U.S. investment and 2M annual output target; next-gen EVs at Spring Hill/Orion), and tariff-induced demand shifts (Deutsche Bank note on pre‑tariff buying; second-half weakness as costs flow through). Tie these to measurable price/volume deltas and timescales (e.g., month-by-month demand pull‑forward, used-vehicle resale lift, and domestic content share). (2) Build a tight 3–6 month scenario map with a base case and 1–2 alt paths, each with triggers and invalidations: base (tariffs stable, GM ramp on track, tax policy supportive), Alt A (tariffs escalate or policy execution slows; auto pricing/inflation risk rises; pre-tariff demand accelerates then cools), Alt B (tariff relief or rollback; capex stays but pricing pressure eases). Define timing windows (0–45 days, 46–90 days, 90–180 days) and path-dependence (sequenced capex, supplier realignment, and consumer financing. (3) Increase domain specificity and rely on numbers from sources: anchor GM capex ($10–$12B through 2027), Pacaso expansion to 10 destinations and a ~1.8T vacation-market claim, 21% annual co-ownership growth and 18.8% EBITDA trajectory, 40% of Americans wanting a vacation home, Range’s 1–1.5% potential productivity uplift, and HeartSciences’ FDA/Medicare milestones; present ranges and attach probabilities. (4) Add explicit invalidation signals for each scenario (e.g., a sustained 200–300bp rise in auto-lease rates; material policy missteps on Medicaid/OBBBA; FDA/Medicare delays; or a faster-than-expected AI-adoption lag). (5) sharpen the healthcare/AI/real-estate threads as parallel transmission channels, but forecast their impact with comparable granularity to autos (e.g., AI-ECG reimbursement start, FDA timing, Range adoption velocity, mogul/Gameflip capital flows). (6) Tighten citations and reconcile conflicts: clearly attribute each claim to the IDs WTNT85IPR, EPJYXB7DX, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, and the Pacaso/mogul/Gameflip/HeartSciences pieces from UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, and V8TEZOR8R for non-core items only if directly relevant; avoid digressions or dual-source conflicts unless you quantify which reads are higher-probability. (7) Reformat toward a clean, decision-oriented output: single base case, 1–2 clearly defined alts, a concise risk/watch-list (tariff cadence, budget moves, policy reversals, supply-chain shifts), and an explicit confidence rating. Implement these edits as a concise, numbers-backed grid linked to the cited IDs, then end with a crisp base-case plus the two alt paths and the key signals and thresholds that would invalidate each path.”",
