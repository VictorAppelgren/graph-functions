  "description": "The companies that break through today aren't the ones avoiding conflict. They're the ones brave enough to pick a side and fight for it.",
  "content": "This isn\u2019t to suggest you need to create conflict for conflict\u2019s sake. But there\u2019s power in opposition. When you stand so clearly for something that you inevitably stand against something else, you create clarity. And in this very cluttered marketplace, that clarity isn\u2019t just helpful, it\u2019s essential for survival. The Problem with Playing it Safe When brands attempt universal appeal, they typically achieve universal mediocrity. People think you\u2019re \u201cfine.\u201d Fine pays the bills, but it doesn\u2019t create category leaders. The numbers prove it: distinctive brands see a 62% higher ROI than campaigns that lack distinctiveness. That\u2019s no small difference between being remembered and being forgotten. Distinctive brands put a stake in the ground and say, \u201cThis is who we\u2019re for,\u201d whether through visuals, tone, or messaging. Brands chasing universal appeal usually sand off their edges and end up forgettable.\n\nThe companies that break through today aren\u2019t the ones avoiding conflict. They\u2019re the ones brave enough to pick a side and fight for it. Why Your Enemy Isn\u2019t Your Competition Competition is tactical. It\u2019s about market share, features, and pricing. Your enemy is philosophical. It\u2019s a way of thinking, a set of values, or a specific worldview that your brand exists to challenge. Think of giving your business an enemy in this way:\n\u2022 Ideological: It represents a philosophy or approach you oppose.\n\u2022 Galvanizing: It gives your audience something to rally against.\n\u2022 Clarifying: It forces you to define what you really stand for. As humans, it\u2019s natural for us to pick teams and stick with our tribe. Our brand choices become part of our identity, from the coffee we drink to the phones we carry. It\u2019s those brands that establish clear us-versus-them psychology that win. They make customers feel \u201cthey get me.\u201d This creates tribal loyalty where the brand becomes part of someone\u2019s persona\u2014and they\u2019ll defend it at any cost. Here are some examples of how some of the most memorable brands took on an enemy:\n\nApple vs. Ordinary Apple positioned itself as the ultimate creative company, calling competitors \u201cOrwellian\u201d in its 1984 campaign and \u201cboring\u201d in the Mac vs. PC ads. It established its core as the creative side of humanity and never wavered. Sure, it\u2019s 1,000 times larger now, but its commitment to opposing \u201cordinary\u201d remains unchanged. Southwest Airlines vs. Complexity Southwest\u2019s enemy was airline complexity. Buy a fare, grab a seat, and bring your bags. No extra charges, no caste system with 11 boarding groups, no material guilt about your life choices if you weren\u2019t in the top five. Outsiders called this process a \u201ccattle call,\u201d but Southwest turned a deaf ear to the noise, and its core kept growing. However, Southwest recently announced it\u2019s adopting traditional airline practices in 2025\u201326, abandoning its differentiating enemy. We\u2019ll see how the loyalists respond now that there\u2019s nothing separating Southwest from its competitors.\n\nReady to find your company\u2019s natural opponent? Here\u2019s how to do it strategically:\n\n\n\nStep 1: Identify Your Natural Opposition Which way of thinking or doing business does your company naturally push back against? What frustrates your founders and leaders about the industry? What cultural perspective seems bonkers to you?\n\nWhy does this opposition matter? What\u2019s at risk if the \u201cenemy\u201d worldview wins? In its Mac vs. PC ads, Apple positioned the competition as out of touch and un-inventive, making the stakes crystal clear by casting itself as the creative outlet for the future. Communicate your position in a way that makes your ideal customers feel seen and understood. They should think: \u201cFinally, someone gets it.\u201d Dairy brand Tillamook rallied its core by leaning into quality over scale, unapologetically charging more for real ingredients and a small-batch approach, even when that meant losing price-sensitive shoppers.\n\nNot everyone will like you. That\u2019s the point. Oatly came out of the gate directly challenging Big Dairy with its \u201clike milk, but made for humans\u201d stance\u2014fully accepting that it would alienate traditionalists in order to build a cult following among plant-based loyalists. Why This Works Now More Than Ever Differentiation is survival. People are overwhelmed with choices and increasingly loyal to companies that feel authentic and purposeful. Having a clear enemy provides both.",

      "text": "Distinctive Brand Assets\nDistinctive Brand Assets\nDistinctive Brand Assets (DBAs), also referred to as brand codes, are learned associations that help us to notice, recognise, remember and think of a brand. Coined by Byron Sharp and Jenni Romaniuk of the Ehrenberg Bass Institute, these elements encompass non-brand name cues such as colours, logos, icons, characters, packaging, patterns, shapes, and audio devices.\nDistinctive Brand Assets (or distinctive assets) have come to the fore as a critical component of marketing effectiveness, with massive credit due to experts such as Jenni Romaniuk of the Ehrenberg Bass Institute in breaking down the marketing science behind the topic in the seminal book \u201cBuilding Distinctive Brand Assets\u201d. Now at the forefront of marketing science and effectiveness, understanding what your distinctive assets are and making a plan for how they are activated are crucial steps for any brand to take (See more here on Distinctive Brand Asset research and tracking). Below we break down why they are so crucial for your brand, along with an overview of the main types of assets you can use to propel your brand forward. You can also download our guide to distinctive assets here.\nWhy are Distinctive Brand Assets important?\nStand Up in Comms\nThe first job of advertising is to be noticed, the second job is for them to know it\u2019s you. Distinctive Brand Assets enhance creative effectiveness, increasing the likelihood of consumer recognition, recall, and memory association. A diverse range of assets helps encode ads in consumers\u2019 brains, something a brand name just won\u2019t do alone.\nAnd it\u2019s not just a case of mentioning the brand several times, there is no correlation between branding scores and the number of times a brand is mentioned1. Without plastering your logo everywhere (which itself is a blindspot), distinctive assets improve media efficiency & creative effectiveness. You can see uplifts of at least 34% where distinctive assets are embedded & used2 and with distinctive assets of note gain a 62% higher ROI than the average campaign3.\nUltimately, better branding of your communications will improve effectiveness and salience.\nStand Together\nDistinctive Brand Assets help to connect disparate marketing activities consciously or subconsciously. Activated well, they bridge the long and short across all touchpoints at all times.\nConsider the latest tagline meticulously developed for an integrated campaign. The reality is, only a handful of consumers are likely to recognise, let alone remember it. Put this theory to the test \u2013 can you recall the slogan of the last product or service you purchased? Unless it\u2019s a giant brand like Nike or McDonald\u2019s or your very own brand, chances are it has slipped your mind. Relying solely on an advertising slogan won\u2019t effectively unify your campaign efforts. It demands the combined impact of your Distinctive Brand Assets to connect the dots for busy consumers navigating through a sea of thousands of brand messages daily.\nStand Out Physically\nWith 30,000+ items in an average supermarket, standing out has never been more important on-shelf and online. Distinctive assets improve how easily your brand is found, ultimately making your brand more likely to be bought. On a packed shelf, distinctive assets help brands stand out amidst the clutter. Think of how a distinctive pack and product such as Kikkoman Soy sauce draws your eye, and you almost subconsciously add it to your basket. Or why a familiar cereal pack owns part of the fixture due to their strong colour. Or why you ask the waiter for an Aperol Spritz after noticing it at the next table over. These are distinctive assets in action.\nStand Out Mentally\nDistinctive assets improve how easily your brand comes to mind. They create shortcuts (mental heuristics) for consumers, the vast majority of whom neither care nor know anything about brands like us marketers. They create more dimensions for how brands come to mind in purchase and consumption occasions.\nOn average, brands with strong assets are 52% more salient than their rivals4, i.e. they are much more likely to spring to mind when consumers are shopping within the category. Consider how Corona comes to mind at a beach bar, thanks to the lime. Or how a tin of Pringles pops into your head on the way to the confectionary aisle. Creating a brand that is salient, i.e. comes to mind at purchase or consumption, is one of the most essential factors in how brands grow. Distinctive Brand Assets help get you there.\nThe DNA Of\nDistinctive Brands\nInspire your team and brand, by understanding how to achieve greater levels of distinctiveness with our guide to Distinctive Brand Assets\nTypes of Distinctive Brand Assets\nWhile Distinctive Brand Assets can manifest from any of the human senses, the majority of DBAs are visual in nature, with a small but increasing number of audio assets. Here we break down the most common types.\nLogo\nThe obvious place to start, logos are often the most recognisable brand asset driven by their usage and prominence. A well-embedded logo with depth and other features allows for creative usage and flexibility, opening the door for colours, shapes or even characters to play wider roles.\nPack or Product Shapes & Elements\nThough not applicable to all, packaging and/or products play a crucial role as Distinctive Brand Assets, especially for FMCG/CPG brands. They are often the highest reach & most common consumer touchpoint due to their visibility on shelf or at home. Most packaging falls into the average category, with time and consistency doing the heavy lifting, stand out packs can propel brands forward. Learn more about the key factors in distinctive packaging design here.\nColour\nWhether a single colour or a combination, colour plays a key role on its own or as part of multi-dimensional distinctive asset. While challenging to own in isolation, colour often requires support from shape or context. In most cases, it plays an essential supporting role.\nGuinness is an example of one brand which uses colour very well, with black and white used consistently for years (whilst also playing on the shape of the pint glass). Coca-Cola also has strong associations with red in the beverage category, while Tiffany & Co is renowned their trademarked \u201cTiffany Blue\u201d.\nDistinctive Asset Measurement: Brand Research That Provokes Action\nUsed by some of the world\u2019s most distinctive & leading brands\nShapes, Icons or Elements\nShapes represent some of the most strongly embedded DBAs, with iconic examples often jumping out from the brand logo. The McDonald\u2019s Golden Arches exemplify how colour and shape can combine to create something recognised the world over.\nAnother example is Heineken. Their red star helps, consciously and subconsciously, to make Heineken stand out against the sea of similarly coloured green competitor beers.\nNational Geographic also show how colour, shape & product can combine to create a powerful distinctive asset.\nWords, Taglines, Statements or Claims\nWhile iconic taglines may readily come to mind, these are often associated with global giants like Nike or Apple. In reality, embedding taglines is a challenging task that requires consistent use, creativity, time, prioritisation, and substantial budgets. Test it yourself \u2013 can you recite the tagline of Adidas or Samsung? This is not to undermine the importance of taglines in fostering distinctiveness, but caution is warranted when relying solely on them to connect marketing activity.\nOf the best-in-class examples, \u201cHave a break, have a _______\u201d is a tagline which goes beyond words, creating a wider creative platform for the brand. Delve deeper into the challenges of embedding taglines and gain insights on how to elevate distinctiveness in your brand messaging in our recent piece of research here.\nAdvertising Style\nHaving a distinctive approach to advertising pays back handsomely. When your advertising looks like you, it ensures your communications are linked and attributed back to your brand. It enhances creative effectiveness, increasing the likelihood of consumer recognition, recall, and memory association. But a logo isn\u2019t enough on its own and can be a blind spot.\nA distinctive ad style can help you stand out amongst the plethora of brands you compete with in the battle for attention. Following safe category norms in advertising can often just benefit the category leader. While category codes are sometimes required (for communicating Category Entry Points, for example), the brands that plough their own path stand out in the sea of sameness.\nWith all these challenges and the realisation that a good chunk of advertising reach is simply just a small nudge to remind people your brand exists, a key focus for brands is in creating a distinctive approach to advertising, which helps negate the aforementioned issues. Individual DBAs, such as characters, icons or jingles, amongst other asset types, can do a lot of the heavy lifting when featured as the hero in advertising. Some brands, however, look to create a distinctive ad style, and the ad style in its own right becomes a Distinctive Brand Asset. Read more about distinctive advertising styles and approaches here.\nCharacters or Mascots\nRonald McDonald, Colonel Sanders, Mr Muscle, Aleksandr Orlov AKA Compare the Meerkat, all examples of strong DBAs embedded with category buyers and wider culture itself. Characters represent some of the most fertile territory for DBAs, driven in part by our innate ability to better remember faces, but also by the ability for brands to play with their characters on pack and within creative. Check out more examples of character assets with cut-through in this blog article.\nAudio or Sonic Branding\nOften underutilised in modern times, audio devices are another weapon in creating a distinctive brand. It could be said that jingles, one such format, are a microcosm of marketing, an incredibly hard-working device that has gone out of favour in preference of trendier concepts.\nSome of the most successful instances involve brands using audio to reinforce taglines or brand names, such as McDonald\u2019s with \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It,\u201d or iconic jingles like \u201cHo ho ho, Green Giant\u201d and \u201cDid Somebody Say Just Eat.\u201d (Learn more about why jingles are considered one of the most underutilised asset types here.)\nSonic triggers too can act as an audio logo for brands such as Intel, PlayStation and Netflix.\nWith the rise of audio devices, podcast advertising, and the broader realm of audio-visual content, audio DBAs may be poised for a resurgence.\nTo find out more about Distinctive Brand Asset measurement, or to gain help in understanding the performance of your brand through a quantitative assessment, contact us today.
