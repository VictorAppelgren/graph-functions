  "content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nWhat just happened? It's been a very long wait, but Dolby Vision 2 has just been announced at IFA 2025. The latest iteration of the HDR standard introduces a slew of features, including a new and more powerful engine, creator controls, and, of course, AI capabilities, all of which supposedly push a TV's image quality \"beyond HDR.\"\n\nDolby Laboratories calls Dolby Vision 2 \"a groundbreaking evolution of its industry-leading picture quality innovation,\" i.e., Dolby Vision, which launched back in 2014.\n\nThe main feature of Dolby Vision 2 is Content Intelligence. It introduces a suite of new tools that can \"better bridge the creative suite to the viewer's living room.\" Essentially, it ensures that what filmmakers, TV producers, and game developers see during content creation matches as closely as possible to what viewers experience at home.\n\nContent Intelligence includes the likes of Precision Black technology, which is designed to ensure darker HDR remains visible and not too dark to make out (see Game of Thrones' The Long Night episode as an example).\n\nThere's also Light Sense. This detects ambient light and optimizes picture settings to create the perfect image to suit a room's lighting conditions.\n\nDolby Vision 2 has optimization features for gaming and sports, too, including white-point adjustments and motion controls.\n\nMotion smoothing is one of those TV features that pretty much everyone seems to hate. With Dolby Vision 2 comes Authentic Motion, which the company bills as the world's first creative-driven motion control tool designed to make scenes feel more authentically cinematic \u2013 and not like a soap opera. Creatives can enable Authentic Motion in their content on a shot-by-shot basis to reduce unwanted judder, though you'll obviously need a Dolby Vision 2 TV to experience it. You'll also be able to turn it off, presumably.\n\nElsewhere, there's a new image engine that works with bi-directional tone mapping, allowing TVs to deliver higher brightness, sharper contrast and deeply saturated colors, all while ensuring the image matches the creator's intent for the audience.\n\nDolby Vision 2 will arrive as two tiers: Dolby Vision 2 Max for premium televisions powerful enough to take advantage of the most-demanding features, and the standard Dolby Vision 2 for mainstream televisions.\n\nThe first manufacturer confirmed to implement Dolby Vision 2 is Hisense, which will introduce it in the firm's RGB-MiniLED televisions. These TVs feature MediaTek's Pentonic 800 processor with MiraVision Pro PQ Engine.\n\nAs for the creators, French media giant CANAL+ says it will be supporting Dolby Vision 2 across its movies, TV shows, and live TV broadcasts.\n\nAs with all new technologies, expect it to take quite a while before Dolby Vision 2 starts becoming widespread. It'll only be available on TVs from companies that support it, so Samsung, which favors HDR10+ and doesn't support Dolby Vision, might opt to avoid its successor.",

      "text": "Dolby Vision 2 Unlocks even more Potential from Your TV Through New Powerful and Intelligent Technology to Deliver Next-Level Viewing Experiences\nSan Francisco and Berlin, September 2, 2025 \u2013 Dolby Laboratories, a leader in immersive entertainment experiences, today announced Dolby Vision 2, a groundbreaking evolution of its industry-leading picture quality innovation. Hisense is the first TV brand to announce it will bring Dolby Vision 2 to its lineup of premium televisions, such as RGB-MiniLED TVs. This is complemented by the leading French media and entertainment company CANAL+, which has also announced its commitment to support Dolby Vision 2.\nFor over a decade, Dolby Vision has pushed picture quality forward as the gold standard for premium HDR. Dolby Vision 2 builds on this success and is designed specifically to meet the evolving opportunities of television experiences today, serving as one piece of Dolby's broader mission to advance picture quality across all entertainment and devices, from the biggest to smallest screens.\n\u201cWe've reached an inflection point where TV technology has dramatically changed while artists continue to demand even more innovative tools,\u201d said John Couling, Senior Vice President, Entertainment at Dolby Laboratories. \u201cDolby Vision 2 redefines how we think of Dolby Vision to unleash the full capabilities of modern TVs while giving artists unprecedented opportunities to push their creative boundaries further than ever before.\u201d\nDolby Vision 2 is powered by a redesigned and even more powerful image engine. This new engine when combined with Dolby Vision\u2019s extensive content ecosystem unlocks even more out of your TV. This is fueled by a robust content pipeline spanning today\u2019s most popular movies and TV shows, weekly live sports broadcasts, and an expanding library of games, all in Dolby Vision. And with new tools coming to the creative community, content in Dolby Vision will look even more astonishing when enjoyed on a Dolby Vision 2 display.\nContent Intelligence introduces new tools to better bridge the creative suite to the viewer\u2019s living room. This foundation allows Dolby Vision 2 to authentically and automatically optimize your TV to deliver a more captivating picture based on what you\u2019re watching and where you are watching. And with AI capabilities, Dolby Vision 2 will intelligently adapt to give the best presentation of the content fine-tuned for your device and viewing environment.\n- Precision Black reduces consumer frustration that the image is \u201ctoo dark\u201d by making it crystal clear and improving clarity in any viewing environment without compromising artistic intent.\n- Light Sense fine-tunes picture quality through advanced ambient light detection and new reference lighting data from the content source to optimize your TV for the ideal viewing experience.\n- Sports and Gaming Optimization introduce new enhancements such as white point adjustments and motion control designed specifically to address the unique needs of live sports and gaming.\nBuilding on Content Intelligence, Dolby Vision 2 introduces new tone-mapping that takes advantage of modern TV improvements. Today's TVs are brighter and more colorful than ever. With bi-directional tone mapping, creators now have new controls that let them make the most of these enhanced displays. This allows high-performance TVs to deliver higher brightness, sharper contrast, and deeply saturated colors while preserving the artist\u2019s creative vision.\nDolby Vision 2 expands the capabilities of Dolby Vision beyond HDR. This includes features like Authentic Motion, the world\u2019s first creative driven motion control tool to make scenes feel more authentically cinematic without unwanted judder on a shot-by-shot basis.\n- Dolby Vision 2 Max delivers the best picture on the highest performing TVs, adding additional premium features designed to utilize the full capabilities of these displays.\n- Dolby Vision 2 brings dramatically improved picture quality to mainstream TVs, delivering the core next-generation capabilities made possible through the new Dolby Image Engine and Content Intelligence.\nHisense will be the first TV brand to introduce Dolby Vision 2 to its lineup. These TVs will be powered by MediaTek Pentonic 800 with \u201cMiraVision\u2122 Pro\u201d PQ Engine, the first silicon chip to integrate Dolby Vision 2. Timing and availability will be announced at a later date.\n\"This represents exactly the kind of innovation Hisense customers expect from premium television experiences,\" said Sonny Ming, GM of Hisense TV Product Marketing. \"Dolby Vision 2 jointly with Hisense RGB-MiniLED Technology, can not only deliver dramatically astonishing picture, but also increase the potential of TVs with ultra-wide color and ultra-high brightness, which haven't been possible until today.\u201d\nJoining Hisense, CANAL+ is the first media and entertainment group to commit to enhance its lineup \u2013 from movies and TV shows to live sport \u2013 in Dolby Vision, leveraging the latest innovation to enrich the viewing experience for its subscribers.\n\u201cThis partnership with Dolby reflects CANAL+\u2019s pioneering spirit of innovation. Our commitment to delivering an unparalleled viewing experience to our subscribers remains unwavering. With the launch of Dolby Vision 2 - across movies, series, and live sports- that experience reaches breathtaking new heights. Dolby has been a valued partner for many years, and we are proud to be the first media and entertainment group to announce the integration of this new experience for our audience,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Baumier, Chief Technology Officer of CANAL+.\nAbout Dolby\nDolby Laboratories (NYSE: DLB) is a world leader in immersive entertainment.
