      "summary": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez condemned Europe’s response to the Gaza war as a failure, accusing Western powers of double standards compared to their handling of Ukraine. He called for stronger EU action against Israel, including financial sanctions, and urged the EU to adopt a consistent humanitarian stance. Sánchez also defended migration as an economic opportunity and criticized right‑wing parties for undermining climate and social policies. The remarks come ahead of a UK‑Spain summit and amid growing pressure on Sánchez’s government over corruption scandals.",
