  "content": "Stephen Miller \u2014 and 150 million other free-thinking, non-Clinton-Kool-Aid-drinking, patriotic Americans \u2014 are exactly right: It\u2019s time for the treasonous Hillary Clinton to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of every possible law, alongside her anti-American partner and financier George Soros (\u201cWhite House\u2019s Stephen Miller: Hillary Clinton, Obama officials should be prosecuted for \u2018coup,\u2019\u201d Web, Aug. 3).\n\nIt\u2019s mind-boggling how billions of Democratic National Committee donors and U.S. taxpayers\u2019 dollars have been intentionally wasted by both Clintons and their minions over the years, surreptitiously manufacturing premeditated false hatred to illegally target their final political opponent, President Donald J. Trump.\n\nThankfully, new evidence proving that crooked Hillary had wide-reaching control over our entire government, White House, Justice Department, intelligence community \u2014 including their various autopens \u2014 raises hundreds of other treasonous Clinton conspiracy questions.\n\nWhat other Clinton-concocted events, hoaxes, fake headlines, judges\u2019 rulings and even plan-demics did Hillary and her global cabal of operatives cook up and try to foist onto the American people, the world and even onto both the Obama and Biden administrations?\n\nWhat else did she conspire to do and sign off upon: The Jan. 6, 2021, entrapments? The Wuhan-COVID-19 launch? Both Trump impeachments? Every Ivy League campus protest? President JoeBiden\u2019s autopen? Even Butler, PA? Hmmm?\n\nThe real question is: Who has the courage to stand up, en masse, to finally rid Washington and the world of all Clinton-Soros political criminality?\n\nMake no mistake: This smoking gun and political bombshell must be widely articulated, posted and shared now, using all remaining non-deep-state media, before the vast \u201cClinton Broadcasting Service\u201d and \u201cClinton News Network\u201d bury it.\n\nThe bottom line is that anyone in U.S. government, media or legal roles \u2014 including everyone in the Trump administration \u2014 who remains unwilling to drag the deep state\u2019s highest kingpin before Congress and into court to face justice for each of her treasonous acts ought to \u201cDOGE\u201d themselves now, resign and invest their severance into a lame-duck pickleball club or aGeorgetown cupcake shop.",
