  "title": "Craig Mazin Talks Going Solo for 'The Last of Us' Season 3",
  "description": "Now that he's the lone showrunner and writer for 'The Last of Us,' things are and aren't all that different for Mazin.",
  "content": "Season two of The Last of Us came and went earlier this year, and we already know its third season is on the horizon. Whereas the first two seasons were a team effort between showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann and writer Hailey Gross, this next season will have Mazin as sole showrunner and writer\u2014Druckmann, who also runs game developer Naughty Dog, is devoting his time to the studio\u2019s next project, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Mazin discussed his writing process, which he said won\u2019t change now that his co-writers have exited the show. According to him, not much is going to change, since Druckmann\u2019s \u201calways had a full-time job running Naughty Dog, so it\u2019s always been me up in Canada [where the production is].\u201d Before Druckmann and Gross left, Mazin got \u201cso much\u201d out of them while working on the first two seasons, and they\u2019d already been thinking about the future while working on the second season.\n\n\u201cWe really did get that work in. You can\u2019t really tell half that story without thinking about what the whole story could be,\u201d Mazin continued, referencing adapting only half of The Last of Us Part II. When the show returns, audiences will see things from Abby\u2019s (Kaitlyn Dever) point of view before, during, and after the previous season. If you thought season was too short at seven episodes, the third may have more. Mazin told THR he and HBO are \u201ccurrently fiddling around\u201d with the specifics, but he\u2019s looking at making this next season \u201cmore on par\u201d with the first\u2019s nine episodes to provide \u201cmore bang for the buck.\u201d\n\nMazin didn\u2019t just create and write the show, he\u2019s also directed the first episode of each season. He revealed directing the premieres can be easy and allow for a full season prep, and now that that he\u2019s sole showrunner, it\u2019s on him to ensure \u201ceverything is fitting together tonally. We have directors alternating, and I\u2019m on set doing\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call it\u2014\u2019showrunner QC\u2019 sounds insulting to our directors, who are amazing.\u201d He\u2019s open to helming more than the premiere next season, but admitted it would be \u201chard to go prep something while I\u2019m also still writing. We\u2019ll see if I can get away with directing more than one [episode].\u201d\n\nThe Last of Us is set to return for season three in 2027, so we\u2019ve got time before we know how many episodes it\u2019ll have, what it\u2019ll change or update for Abby\u2019s side of the story, and how much longer it\u2019ll go on.",

      "text": "Craig Mazin will be The Last of Us season three\u2019s lone writer after co-creator Neil Druckmann and co-writer Halley Gross announced they were stepping away from the series. (Druckmann co-developed the original Last of Us game and directed The Last of Us: Part II, which he co-wrote with Gross.) Emmy-winning writer-director Mazin (Chernobyl), who this year is nominated for outstanding drama series, spoke to THR about how the HBO thriller focusing on the survivors of a mass fungal infection that collapses modern-day society has helped level up the art of game-to-small-screen adaptations and whether he\u2019s already busy writing the third season.\nRelated Stories\nVideo game adaptations are nothing new, but a TV spinoff earning Emmys is. Has The Last of Us proved that video game adaptations can hold their own?\nYeah. I think that in the wake of The Last of Us, a ton of video game projects got greenlit. Fallout was already happening, and that was fantastic in its first season, and I\u2019m really looking forward to the second season. There\u2019s just this incredible wave coming. Like anything, when people first said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s start adapting books into movies or television shows,\u201d some of them are going to be great, some of them will stumble. But the idea that the industry has woken up to how rich some of that storytelling is and how wonderful it is to adapt is fantastic.\nWhere are you with writing season three?\nThis is kind of my favorite time. It\u2019s very quiet. It\u2019s just sitting here with my wonderful ergonomic keyboard and clacking away. The pages are happening, and I get to be a monk for a while, which I love, and I just write. It\u2019s the purest form of what I do. And then in just a couple of months or so, that happy time will start to be less quiet because we begin a very long prep period while I\u2019m still writing, and then we begin to shoot while I\u2019m still writing. In seasons one and two, I finished writing about six weeks before we started shooting the last episode. I don\u2019t necessarily recommend this method other than to say this works for me, but it is insane.\nNow that Neil is stepping away to focus on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, will the writing process change?\nI don\u2019t think it is, in the sense that I was pretty much a monk just writing in a room by myself for most of the time regardless. And I\u2019ve gotten so much out of talking with them over the course of seasons one and two. When we made season two, we really were thinking about what comes after because you can\u2019t really tell half of that story without thinking about what the whole story should be. So we really did get that work in. Neil\u2019s always had a full-time job running Naughty Dog, so it\u2019s always been me up in Canada [where the production is], and, ultimately, things are pretty much going to proceed as usual.\nWhat were the most challenging scenes to shoot, logistics- and VFX-wise?\nEpisode two, the attack on Jackson, Wyoming, was an enormous undertaking for everybody. It was hard to write, it was hard to plan, it was hard to shoot. The prosthetics, the stunts and then the visual effects afterward were just massive. So we had [VFX houses] Weta and DNEG and about five other companies all working together to create all of the moments, and that was insane.\nThere were nine episodes in the first season but only seven in this one, and yet the pacing feels so different. Despite the fact that everything takes place in a span of three days, the attack on Jackson feels like it was ages ago. How does it compare to the game?\nThe attack on Jackson is not in the video game, so that\u2019s new to our show. It\u2019s one of those surprises that people who played the game would be like, \u201cOh!\u201d But, yeah, the characters have gone through quite a bit, but the way we use time, it\u2019s almost like so much of season two is really about three days, and I love being able to focus in on a period of time.\nThe Last of Us subreddit is quite a busy place. How closely do you keep track of the chatter and are there responses that surprise you?\nI don\u2019t look at them, so I don\u2019t know. Problem solved! I don\u2019t go on Reddit. I mean, I\u2019m always playing video games; I\u2019m playing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered right now. Sometimes I\u2019ll go on Reddit when I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat is the best bow for an archer build?\u201d That\u2019s about as much Redditing as I do.\nWhat lessons did you learn from Chernobyl that you brought with you to The Last of Us?\nFor starters, I learned how much attention to detail matters. [What] we showed in Chernobyl was really born out of a desire to be as respectful as possible to the culture. We were telling a story that impacted people who are still alive, who lost people.\nI just had a sense that stories that have been told in the West about the Soviet Union were not accurate, and why not go for as real, real, real as you can? That approach to being as grounded as we can, especially in a genre story where there are monsters, is something that I brought forward. The style of shooting is something I pulled through \u2014 and I say it every time \u2014 but everything I ever learned about directing, I learned by watching Johan Renck direct Chernobyl. I really internalized the way that he used multiple cameras as an artistic choice, as opposed to just [shoot] faster.\nThe other thing that I learned from Chernobyl was how important it was for the people who were at the creative helm to pay as much attention to visual effects as they do to anything else that you don\u2019t. In your mind, you think, \u201cI\u2019ll just send this away, it\u2019ll come back, I\u2019ll put it in the show.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work like that at all. It is almost like doing takes with an actor: \u201cGreat, now let\u2019s try this. Great, let\u2019s try this.\u201d And then, \u201cAh, there it is.\u201d And that process of working through visual effects is exhausting and exhaustive for everybody, but I think what we end up getting is pretty remarkable, and it makes the show better. I just believe that visual effects are beyond integral to the success of a show like ours.\nBefore Chernobyl, you worked on The Hangover films. How much are you itching to get back to comedy?\nNot strong itches. I mean, I spent a long time doing comedy, and even though I\u2019ve been doing drama \u2014 it\u2019s been about five, six years. Prior to that, it was like 25 years of comedy. Look, I think I\u2019ve told all the jokes. I think my comedy is used up. I like having moments. I like having moments inside of drama. And I love working with comedic actors in dramatic roles because we can find comedy in there. So you do a scene where you\u2019ve got Catherine O\u2019Hara and she has this very heavy scene with therapy and all the rest, but still we find the funny in it because, of course, we do. But going back to pure comedy, I think probably, no, I don\u2019t think so.\nDo you envision directing the first episode of TLOU season three as you\u2019ve done with the first two seasons?\nYeah. Honestly, I\u2019d love to direct more, but the problem is just logistics. I like to direct the first episode because you can prep the whole season. There are a lot of characters that get cast and there are a lot of decisions that get made about environments, so you can sort of prep a lot of the season by prepping and directing the first episode. As we\u2019re going along, you have to prep the other episodes. We have directors alternating, and I\u2019m on set doing \u2014 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call it \u2014 \u201cshowrunner QC\u201d sounds insulting to our directors, who are amazing. But [I\u2019m] just making sure everything is fitting together tonally. So it\u2019s hard for me to then go prep something while I\u2019m also still writing, but we\u2019ll see if I can get away with [directing] more than one.\nAre more people lining up for roles now that The Last of Us has more Emmy nods?\nIt\u2019s not quite like people knocking on your door as much as I think after season one. There may have been actors who were unaware of the video game or the show, but what they were aware of was that we were filling up those guest actor Emmy categories pretty extensively. We had fewer actual guest actors in season two, but we\u2019ve still got Jeffrey Wright, Joey Pantoliano, Kaitlyn Dever and Catherine O\u2019Hara, [who] all got nominated [for best guest acting in a drama series]. So when we pull people in, I think at least in the community, there\u2019s an understanding they\u2019re going to get something juicy to do. They\u2019re not glorified day players. We try and create these little tiny, impactful stories with really, really good actors. So as we head into season three, I hope that we\u2019ll see a couple of more fascinating additions like that.\nFor me, it\u2019s so much fun to [say], \u201cHey, let\u2019s just get Melanie Lynskey, why don\u2019t we?\u201d And to discover brilliant new talent, Keivonn Montreal Woodard, who had never acted before, and there he is getting an Emmy nomination for season one \u2014 that was just incredible. And Storm Reid won \u2014 obviously, she wasn\u2019t new, but it was giving actors these interesting things to do that maybe they don\u2019t normally get to do. Nick Offerman, who also won, normally doesn\u2019t get to play that guy. And I love doing that.\nWho\u2019s on your wish list for actors to write for?\nMy wishlist is Meryl Streep. I\u2019ve always had [her] on my wishlist since I started in this business. I\u2019ve never worked with her, but I met her when I was at the Golden Globes and I ran into somebody who was there with her. We were talking, and he was like, \u201cDo you want to meet Meryl? She\u2019s just around the corner. She\u2019s going to walk over.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI would love to meet Meryl Streep. Yes!\u201d\nSo she comes over and he [introduces us]. And I shook her hand and I went, \u201cPffff. You know!\u201d [Raises hands] And she was like, \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d I wanted to say, \u201cOh my God! I love you in this [and] this!\u201d But I just figured, everyone always says that. I\u2019m just going to package it into just, \u201cInsert here, me just freaking out.\u201d And she was really nice and seemed to accept that I was freaking out. So anyway, I short-handed it to, \u201cYou know!\u201d\nI have not spoken to Meryl Streep, I have not written anything for her \u2014 yet \u2014 but one day, one day!\nYou just announced you and podcast co-host John August are releasing a book based on ScriptNotes. Will Neil and Halley ever join the pod guests?\nNeil and I have done at this point, 16 podcasts for the show and Halley\u2019s been on, so that\u2019s sort of that. ScriptNotes, the show has been going on forever. It was just hardcore screenwriting nerds, and it sort of expanded a bit. And we\u2019ll get pitches from publicity people like, \u201cHey, would you like this person or this person?\u201d But John and I have always felt we will bring guests on the show, but mostly we\u2019re just keeping it a non-guest show so that it doesn\u2019t turn into a talk show.\nYou got a tattoo of Ellie\u2019s switchblade to commemorate The Last of Us\u2019 success. Any plans to get any more show-inspired ink?\nI don\u2019t have a specific plan, but I\u2019m thinking maybe when it\u2019s over. The other possibility is that I go for a tattoo-per-show method, so I only have the one. I may say, \u201cOK, this is my Last of Us tattoo, now let\u2019s see what comes next, and maybe that\u2019ll be the next one,\u201d but no plans yet. \u201cNo ragrets!\u201d\nSince the second season only covered the first half of the second video game, what will the pacing and episode count be like for this next installment and beyond?\nWe\u2019re kind of fiddling around with that \u2014 it\u2019s a little bit of a trade secret at the moment. But I will say that season three will be longer than season two. Season three will be more on par with season one. More bang for the buck.\nThis story first appeared in an August stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

      "text": "Trying to keep track of what\u2019s coming in the realm of Star Trek feels like trying to stop a tribble from procreating. Before even more new series are announced, here\u2019s our guide of when to expect all the new Star Trek shows, as well as returning familiar favorites, and what else is in the works right now. Engage!\nThis post was last updated 7/14/23.\nCurrently Airing: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 2\nThe Enterprise is back after a successful first season, and this time Captain Kirk will be along for the ride with another appearance by Paul Wesley after his surprise finale role in season one. Not much else is known about the season so far, other than one episode will see the show crossover with Star Trek: Lower Decks in a live-action/animated hybrid directed by The Next Generation\u2019s Jonathan Frakes. The show has also been renewed for a third season.\nSeason two recaps:\n\u201cTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\u201d\n\u201cCharades\u201d\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 4\nThe third season of the animated series following the misfit crew of the USS Cerritos\u2014and in particular its cadre of ensigns, Mariner (Tawny Newsome), Boimler (Jack Quaid), Tendi (No\u00ebl Wells), and Rutherford (Eugene Cordero)\u2014once again followed our heroic ensigns and the remaining bridge officers aboard the Cerritos. Season four will be arriving in late summer. The show has also been renewed for a fifth season.\nUpcoming: Star Trek: Discovery Season 5\nExpected in early 2024, Discovery\u2019s fifth season will be 10 episodes long, down from the 13 of prior seasons. In the wake of season four\u2018s climax earlier this year, Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) led her crew in a desperate attempt to save the galaxy from a mysterious anomaly created by an extra-galactic race, ensuring peace and stability for the Federation once more\u2026 for now. As her romantic partner Book (David Ajala) pays time for his own role in a campaign to surreptitiously destroy that anomaly, we\u2019re not sure what awaits Burnham and Discovery\u2019s crew just yet, but given this show, we\u2019re sure it\u2019ll be very, very dramatic.\nIn Flux: Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2\nThe animated series aimed at younger Trek fans (and Janeway fans!) and kids at heart can be found on both Nickelodeon and Paramount+. The first season was divided into two parts, with part two wrapping up at the end of 2022; after Paramount+ announced it would not move forward with the show\u2019s already greenlit season two, it was removed from the service. (A home release of the complete first season is still possible; the first 10 episodes are still available for purchase.) Fans are still waiting to hear if Prodigy season two will surface on a different outlet.\nUpcoming: Starfleet Academy\nIt\u2019s really happening! After a long tease, filming on this series will begin in 2024. Here\u2019s the official announcement from co-showrunners and executive producers Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau:\n\u201cAdmission is now open to Starfleet Academy! Explore the galaxy! Captain your destiny! For the first time in over a century, our campus will be re-opened to admit individuals a minimum of 16 Earth years (or species equivalent) who dream of exceeding their physical, mental and spiritual limits, who value friendship, camaraderie, honor and devotion to a cause greater than themselves. The coursework will be rigorous, the instructors among the brightest lights in their respective fields, and those accepted will live and study side-by-side with the most diverse population of students ever admitted. Today we encourage all who share our dreams, goals and values to join a new generation of visionary cadets as they take their first steps toward creating a bright future for us all. Apply today! Ex Astris, Scientia!\u201d\nUpcoming (movie): Star Trek: Section 31\nAnnounced as a TV series back in 2019 as a spinoff for fan-favorite Discovery guest star Michelle Yeoh, this plunge into the seediest side of Starfleet\u2014the shadowy spy organization Section 31 first introduced in Deep Space Nine\u2014is now planned as a Paramount+ film.\nNewly minted Oscar winner Yeoh will return as former emperor of the Mirror Universe\u2019s Terran Empire, Phillipa Georgiou, now turned into a kinder, but still kickass person by her time with Michael Burnham. \u201cI\u2019m beyond thrilled to return to my Star Trek family and to the role I\u2019ve loved for so long,\u201d Yeoh said in a statement. \u201cSection 31 has been near and dear to my heart since I began the journey of playing Philippa all the way back when this new golden age of Star Trek launched. To see her finally get her moment is a dream come true in a year that\u2019s shown me the incredible power of never giving up on your dreams. We can\u2019t wait to share what\u2019s in store for you, and until then: live long and prosper (unless Emperor Georgiou decrees otherwise)!\u201d\nWritten by Craig Sweeny and directed by Olatunde Osunsanmi, Star Trek: Section 31 will start production later this year, and eventually come to Paramount+.\nWhere Can I Stream Classic Star Trek Shows?\nThat\u2019s all the new bits of Star Trek coming.

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "In the wake of the controversially received second season of HBO\u2019s Last of Us TV series, series co-creator and executive producer Neill Druckmann has announced that he is stepping away ahead of production on season three.\nIn a statement posted to Naughty Dog\u2019s social media accounts today, Druckmann said his move comes \u201cbefore any meaningful work\u201d had begun on a third season of The Last of Us, set to continue adapting the remaining events of The Last of Us Part II. Druckmann will return his focus to working on Naughty Dog\u2019s own upcoming gaming projects, including the sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, announced late last year.\n\u2014 Naughty Dog (@Naughty_Dog) July 2, 2025\n\u201cCo-creating the show has been a career highlight,\u201d Druckmann\u2019s statement reads in part. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct, and write on the last two seasons. I\u2019m deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting The Last of Us Part I and the continued adaptation of The Last of Us Part II.\u201d\nSeason one of the HBO series was met with near-universal critical acclaim when it debuted in 2023, but season two faced a rougher road\u2014perhaps almost inevitably considering it dug into adapting the events of Part II, a sequel that had received its own fair share of controversies when it first launched in 2020. Some of the backlashes were mirrored with the release of the HBO show, like the reaction to the shock exit of Pedro Pascal\u2019s Joel, but the season also faced criticism for its approach to adapting the game\u2019s events in the context of the game\u2019s own controversial reception at launch, questioning whether something was lost in exchanging the game\u2019s ambiguity in storytelling for an attempt at a more clear-cut version of the narrative.\nHBO\u2019s Last of Us adaptation was initially anticipated to run three seasons long, splitting its adaptation of The Last of Us Part II across two seasons. But earlier this year, showrunner Craig Mazin suggested that instead \u201cthe most likely outcome\u201d will be that the series continues for a fourth season.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Season two of The Last of Us ended on \u201cthe\u201d moment. The moment when a story you thought was one thing actually becomes another. It\u2019s a moment lifted directly from the video game The Last of Us Part II, but now the game is letting players get rid of it, and we\u2019re very curious about the timing.\nTuesday, Naughty Dog announced that it\u2019s releasing a new update to the remastered edition of The Last of Us Part II. The update will allow fans to play the game chronologically, which drastically shifts the timing and intentions of the original game. \u201cThose who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby\u2019s motivations, realizations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines,\u201d the announcement reads. \u201cWhile this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part II\u2019s themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question.\u201d\nBut did the question need to be answered? And is the fact it\u2019s being answered so soon after the TV show based on the game was met with criticism for following the game a coincidence? It sure doesn\u2019t seem like it. It, in fact, feels like a way to potentially undercut the intentions of the game, which we admit were pointedly unpleasant, but in a very good way.\nFor those who may not know the context here, The Last of Us Part II (and the TV adaptation so far) starts with a woman named Abby killing Joel, one of the main characters in the first game. In the game, you then play primarily as Ellie, Joel\u2019s almost daughter, who goes on to hunt Abby. But, once the two finally meet again, the game flips back in time, and you\u2019re forced to play as Abby. It\u2019s an uncomfortable moment to become the villain, but as the game moves along, that conflict becomes the point. We start to see Abby as less of a villain and more of a hero.\nIt\u2019s what The Last of Us Part II is all about. Making the player question themselves and others. Forcing us to deal with our own empathy. It\u2019s also what the TV show is going for too, albeit in a slightly more drawn-out way since we\u2019ll have to wait two years for new episodes. A chronological version of the story might still have that in there, but it won\u2019t land in such a direct, gut-punch way.\n\u201cThrough the new Chronological mode, we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II\u2019s narrative,\u201d the company says. \u201cPlayers will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby\u2019s crisscrossing journeys. You\u2019ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more.\u201d\nWhich, honestly, as a fan of the game, sounds kind of fun. It\u2019s just a different point of view on the story. Maybe the answer here is to only make this mode available after you beat the game the original way, something that doesn\u2019t seem to be in place but is recommended. \u201cWhile we of course recommend players still new to the game to play through Part II\u2019s story as was originally developed, the team\u2019s hard work has paid off with a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter,\u201d Naughty Dog says.\nDo you think this new mode is in any way an answer to issues with the TV show? Does it bother you it exists? Or are you excited to actually give it a shot and see what new things you can learn? Let us know below.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "At a Glance:\nDoctor Who ended the eras of both Chris Chibnall as series showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor in 2022 with \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d bringing to a close a three-season, three-special run.\nWhittaker\u2019s replacement is returning star David Tennant. He will play the official 14th incarnation of the Doctor under returning showrunner Russell T. Davies, who revived Doctor Who in 2005 and managed the series until 2009.\nTennant will appear in three specials in November 2023 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who on November 23.\nHe\u2019ll be joined by returning characters Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, who were played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins in season four of Doctor Who. Neil Patrick Harris will play a new villain, while Heartstopper\u2019s Yasmin Finney will play a character named Rose.\nTennant will be succeeded by Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Next season of The Last of Us won\u2019t be the last of it. In a new interview, the show\u2019s co-creator Craig Mazin said that the upcoming third season of the show will not finish the story of the second video game, The Last of Us Part II. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to complete this narrative in a third season,\u201d Mazin said. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That\u2019s the most likely outcome.\u201d\nThe quote comes from an extensive interview with Collider where Mazin, ahead of the upcoming season two finale, spoke about working on the third season, which HBO officially greenlit a few weeks back. \u201cIt would take forever,\u201d Mazin said about finishing the events of the second game in the third season. \u201cThere are natural perforations in the narrative where you can go, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s tear it here.\u2019 I think there\u2019s a decent chance that season three will be longer than season two, just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different. The thing about Joel\u2019s death is that it\u2019s so impactful. It\u2019s such a narrative nuclear bomb that it\u2019s hard to wander away from it. We can\u2019t really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story. I\u2019m not sure that will necessarily be true for season three. I think we\u2019ll have a little more room there.\u201d\nAudiences have not yet seen where season two ends, but it certainly seems to be aiming at one of the second game\u2019s biggest \u201cperforations\u201d that Mazin mentions. Assuming the game\u2019s big point of view shift is the end of this season, there is definitely a lot more story to go, but it\u2019s a bit of a surprise to hear Mazin flat out say they don\u2019t want to wrap it up next season.\nThankfully, Mazin confirms that they don\u2019t start writing anything until\u2014not just the upcoming season is planned, but even further in advance. \u201cWe always think ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought ahead to season three and season four, to try to get as much visibility as we can, so that we don\u2019t end up in a situation where we\u2019re sitting down and getting into details for a season and then going, \u2018Oh, man, if only we hadn\u2019t had that person say that one line or be in that spot or wear that jacket, this would be so much cooler.\u2019 So, we really do try to think things through fundamentally. The challenge for our first season was, how do we tell this big story in a way that\u2019s complete and doable within an amount of time and with the budget we have? And with this season, it was, \u2018Okay, this source material goes way beyond one season.'\u201d\nIn fact, it might take three seasons. The season two finale of The Last of Us airs Sunday; we\u2019ll have much more then.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "The wait between seasons one and two of The Last of Us was brutal, but at least that story had ended. We wanted to see what was next for Joel and Ellie, but it wasn\u2019t absolutely necessary. That\u2019s not the case for season two, though, which ends right smack in the middle of the story, with a cliffhanger that\u2019s sure to frustrate many viewers. It\u2019s all but assured that the wait for season three will be worse.\nIn the meantime, you are probably wondering a few things about not just the end of season two, but what\u2019s to come in season three. And, thankfully, showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann were happy to talk about that. Below, we\u2019ll tell you what The Last of Us team had to say about the season two cliffhanger, whether that was always the ending, how things might be changing for season three, and some of the questions you should be asking as you wait.\nSeason two of The Last of Us ends in the middle of a key moment between Ellie and Abby before flashing back a few days to Abby. The implication, much as it is in the video game, is that we are about to see Abby\u2019s story moving ahead, and that\u2019s absolutely the plan.\n\u201cWe often talk about what are we promising the audience going forward?\u201d Druckmann said in a press conference. \u201cSo, for example, it was important for Craig in episode five that we show Joel in that last scene, because then there\u2019s a promise of where we\u2019re going to next. And had we ended the season somewhere else, maybe like a few moments before, I think that we wouldn\u2019t be making the right promise of what this is about. And we\u2019re telling you next season, well, one is that there\u2019s just an epic nature to what\u2019s about to happen. But this other story is going to be really important coming back to Joel and Ellie and everything that you\u2019ve seen so far.\u201d\nIn the game, though, the audience has a natural pain and discomfort when the point of view shifts from Ellie, a character you have been playing as, to then playing as her sworn enemy, Abby. Mazin admits it\u2019s one place a show comes up short compared to the video game but they hope they did as good a job as possible to duplicate it.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t\u2026 reproduce the shock of becoming another person,\u201d he said. \u201cIn games, you are Joel. You are Ellie. You are Abby. And when that shift happens, it is jarring because you have been someone. But here we are watching everybody equally on a screen. We may identify with them from time to time in different ways, and we may be conflicted, but we\u2019re not them. So when we go to a scene where we\u2019re somebody else, there\u2019s the normal thing of, \u2018Whoa, I\u2019m suddenly with Jeffrey Wright in a weird, creepy kitchen. And I\u2019m watching him torture somebody.\u2019 That\u2019s a little jarring, but it\u2019s never going to be what a video game can do when you shift perspective in a massive way like that. So I think what we do, and what we\u2019re doing correctly, is honoring the notion that there is a time period where one person experiences it one way, and another person is experiencing it so wildly different, and yet they converge. It\u2019s a convergent storm\u2026 And that\u2019s what matters. But can we reproduce that gut-punch feeling? No. And I think if we had chased it, we probably would have fallen on our faces.\u201d\nSo if the show couldn\u2019t match that moment in the same way, was there ever a discussion of changing things? Maybe ending it differently? There was, but not for long.\n\u201cHonestly, we were open to a different ending,\u201d Mazin admitted. \u201cWe talked about it a lot. We considered everything. Of course, you want to play around. Like maybe we should just interlace the stories. Maybe we should just go back and forth. Maybe we should try this. Maybe we should try that. And then in the end, I just remember saying, \u2018Isn\u2019t this part of the genetics of how this story functions?\u2019 It\u2019s just part of the genetics. Now, what it means is we have to take risks as a television show and HBO has to back us taking risks. But then again, we did just kill Pedro Pascal. They understand that this show is going to be a different show every season, which is sort of a tricky thing to do when you\u2019re a hit show. You keep asking people like, \u2018I know you love this. We\u2019re taking it away and giving you this now.\u2019 And then hopefully they go, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? We actually really like this.\u2019 \u2018Oh, that\u2019s nice. Now we\u2019re giving you this now\u2019 because that\u2019s how the story works.\u201d\nAnd so, in season three, the point of view will certainly shift to Abby. But, does that mean Bella Ramsey\u2019s Ellie won\u2019t be in season three?\n\u201cI remember when people were asking about season two, they were like, \u2018And what about Joel and when he dies?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean \u2018When?\u2019 \u2018If!'\u201d Mazin says. \u201cThe [third] season will arrive, and it will do what it does. Even if I thought I knew now exactly how it was going to go. I\u2019m experienced enough to know that two weeks from now, we may have a different idea of how it should go. All I can say is we haven\u2019t seen the last of Kaitlyn Dever, we haven\u2019t seen the last of Bella Ramsey, we haven\u2019t seen the last of Isabela Merced, and we haven\u2019t even seen the last of a lot of people who are currently dead in the story.\u201d\nDruckmann added, \u201cWhether you will see them on screen or not, their presence will be there throughout.\u201d\nFinally, season two may have focused on Ellie\u2019s story, and season three might focus on Abby\u2019s, but so much else is happening too. There\u2019s Isaac and the WLF. The Serephites. Their war. And Mazin wants fans to be aware of all of that.\n\u201cI think [all those other stories] bode well for next season,\u201d he said. \u201cI have so many questions and I think and I understand that the audience does too. I sort of want to assure them that those questions are correct and will be answered. \u2018What is going on? How did that war start? How did the Seraphites start? Who is the prophet? What happened to her? What does Isaac want? What\u2019s happening at the end of episode seven? What is this explosion? What is all of it?\u2019 All of it will become clear.\u201d\nWhen specifically? We don\u2019t know. In 2027 perhaps? Either way, the wait has begun. Watch all seven episodes of The Last of Us season two on HBO Max now.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "\u201cStar Wars! Nothing but Star Wars! Give me those Star Wars! Don\u2019t let them end\u2026\u201d Just as Bill Murray said it in 1978, we\u2019re still saying it today. Star Wars is everywhere these days, with multiple movies and TV shows in the works from Disney and Lucasfilm. This article will give you the most up-to-date Star Wars release dates so you know exactly when every new Star Wars movie or Disney+ show will arrive.\nWhat are the next three movies? What TV shows are coming up? Have any TV shows or movies been canceled? What are people saying about what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?
