  "content": "Emma Raducanu paused mid-service to voice her frustration when a youngster's loud wailing disrupted a crucial moment during her intense clash with world number one Aryna Sabalenka. The British tennis star was locked in a gruelling third-round battle at the Cincinnati Open against the Belarusian powerhouse. The most draining period came during a marathon Raducanu service game in the third set that stretched beyond 20 minutes. Trailing 3-4 to her rival, the Brit was forced into an epic struggle that reached deuce on 13 occasions. Despite facing multiple break points, controversy erupted when Raducanu halted her serving motion to highlight the distressed child in the stands. \"It's been, like, 10 minutes,\" she told the umpire after retreating to the baseline.\n\nThe official's response boomed across the court: \"It's a child. Do you want me to kick the child out of the stadium?\" Following this question, numerous spectators could be heard shouting back: \"Yes!\" The encounter resumed after the brief interruption, though it remains unclear whether the family departed. Sabalenka eventually claimed victory in the epic encounter that exceeded three hours, prevailing 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 to advance to the fourth round. Meanwhile, Raducanu will press ahead with her preparations for the year's final Grand Slam at the US Open, the tournament she spectacularly claimed as a teenager in 2021. Following a challenging period plagued by injuries, the 22-year-old has displayed promising signs that she could once again challenge at the major tournaments.\n\nHer performance looked encouraging during the opening rounds at Wimbledon this summer, though she was knocked out in the third round, once more falling to Sabalenka. Her experience at Flushing Meadows in New York will take on a fresh dimension this year, with plans for her to partner Carlos Alcaraz in a revamped mixed doubles competition. In a bid to attract spectators, tournament officials are scheduling the mixed doubles during the week preceding the main draw's commencement. This will also mark her debut Grand Slam under the guidance of new coach Francis Roig. The Spaniard, who collaborated with Rafael Nadal for 17 years, represents the latest coaching appointment for Raducanu following the conclusion of her partnership with Mark Petchey.\n\nShe did receive a reprimand from the umpire after approaching him during a service game in the opening set. \"Emma, you cannot actively approach him, and he cannot leave his position. You know that. You cannot have a conversation,\" the official explained. When questioned about his influence, she remarked: \"It's just, 'the level needs to be better'. In a good way, not in a negative way. It's just calling it how it is. \"And I'm very like that. I'm very factual and I don't necessarily like fluffing something up. I think that's where we get on really well and we understand each other. \"Just in general, everything is like: 'We need to improve. We need to get every shot better.' And that's exciting, because I feel like there's a lot of potential to go and I don't think I'm near it.\"",
