      "feedback": "Add explicit canonical handle “dxy” to every line and separate the driver from the mechanism (e.g., “PCE > 3.0 % (inflation expectations)”). Cite the effect on dxy with the source that gives the 70–100 bp lift (7XH2DKEKV) and the 50–70 bp lift for NFP (7XH2DKEV). Replace the arbitrary 10 % probabilities for PCE and NFP with either a market‑derived estimate (e.g., 25 % based on current expectations) or drop the probability field if unsupported. Correct the tariff escalation line: the source indicates it supports dxy short‑term but is offset by the Fed cut, so change “Down” to “Neutral” or “Up” and provide a probability (≈20 %) citing Z7O1DCHS7. Ensure each time window is tight around the release (e.g., 2025‑08‑30 – 2025‑08‑30 for PCE, 2025‑08‑31 – 2025‑08‑31 for NFP, 2025‑09‑18 – 2025‑09‑22 for Fed cut, 2025‑08‑29 – 2025‑08‑31 for tariff). Add the Fed cut probability citation (97MD1FHW8) and the 89 % figure. Finally, format each line as a single sentence: “Up | 2025‑08‑30 – 2025‑08‑30 | PCE > 3.0 % (inflation expectations) | dxy reaction to August 30 PCE release | 25 %.” This will satisfy the handle‑mapping, catalyst window, causal chain, and probability requirements.",
