  "content": "Should the stablecoin market expand according to some projections, there would be a $325 billion reduction in available bank loans to the economy, a vacuum that could represent a sizable opportunity for alternative lenders.\n\nA hypothetical $1 shift of funds from a bank deposit to a stablecoin issuer is projected to decrease bank lending by around 50 cents.\n\nU.S. banks allocate about 50 cents of every dollar in their assets to direct loans to the economy, highlighting banks\u2019 pivotal role in providing direct credit.\n\nThe ascendant stablecoin market may set the stage for decreased lending from banks, opening an opportunity for alternative lenders, including FinTech platforms, to fill the gap.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nAn economic bulletin released Friday (Aug. 8) by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City delves into the push-pull dynamic that might take shape over the next few years. The framework for stablecoins in the United States, codified in the GENIUS Act signed into law July 18, will increase demand for U.S. Treasurys, the world\u2019s deepest and most liquid market.\n\n\u201cThe effect of U.S. dollar stablecoins on the Treasury market will depend on the stablecoin market\u2019s size and future growth,\u201d the bulletin said.\n\nThe stablecoin market today is \u201ctoo small to have a large effect on Treasury demand,\u201d the bulletin said. However, \u201cthe market is expected to grow substantially over the next several years.\u201d\n\nThis growth could lead to a redistribution of funds within the financial system.\n\nTreasurys would be part of the backing of the stablecoins themselves. At the same time, the demand for stablecoins would be funded by the deposits held by banking customers. In short, the pool of capital available for lending would be diminished \u2014 to the tune of billions of dollars.\n\nIn quantifying the possible impact, the bulletin estimated:\n\u2022 None U.S. banks currently allocate about 50 cents of every dollar in their assets to direct loans to the economy, totaling approximately $13 trillion.\n\u2022 None A hypothetical $1 shift of funds from a bank deposit to a stablecoin issuer for both banks and issuers.\n\u2022 None Should the stablecoin market expand as projected from its current $250 billion to $900 billion \u2014 a growth scenario considered within independent projections \u2014 this $650 billion shift could lead to a 1% decrease in both total bank assets and bank lending, translating into an estimated $325 billion reduction in available bank loans to the economy.\n\nThe net effect on Treasury demand could vary depending on the source of funds for stablecoin purchases. If households sell Treasurys directly to buy stablecoins, for instance, overall Treasury demand might decline. Ultimately, any increased demand for Treasurys driven by stablecoins inherently diverts funding from other prior uses, including loans to the broader economy.\n\nAs a result, the greenfield opportunity looms for platform and alternative lenders \u2014 the Upstarts and SoFis of the world that either have their own banks or use a mix of funding channels, including institutional investors, to capture at least some of that share of demand.\n\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cThe Embedded Lending Opportunity: Global State of Play,\u201d commissioned by Visa, found that embedded lending is gaining adherents and desire from would-be applicants. Around 4 in 10 consumers and small businesses indicated strong interest in switching to merchants and other providers that offer embedded lending options.",

The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's economic bulletin suggests that a hypothetical $1 shift of funds from a bank deposit to a stablecoin issuer could decrease bank lending by around 50 cents. The current allocation of 50 cents of every dollar in U.S. banks is based on their role in providing direct credit, highlighting the importance of banks' role in direct credit.
