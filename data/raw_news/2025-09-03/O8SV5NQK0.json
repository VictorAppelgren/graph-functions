  "title": "Investing in Encompass Health (NYSE:EHC) three years ago would have delivered you a 163% gain",

  "content": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance the Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE:EHC) share price is 156% higher than it was three years ago. Most would be happy with that. And in the last month, the share price has gained 14%.\n\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring three years of share price growth, Encompass Health achieved compound earnings per share growth of 28% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 37% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nWe know that Encompass Health has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Encompass Health, it has a TSR of 163% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nWe're pleased to report that Encompass Health shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 34% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 21% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Encompass Health better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Encompass Health has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.",

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$325.9b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$161.83\n7D\n2.8%\n1Y\n11.9%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$70.7b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.38\n7D\n0.4%\n1Y\n26.0%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$60.0b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.74\n7D\n0.5%\n1Y\n24.0%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$54.6b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$180.15\n7D\n3.8%\n1Y\n3.6%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$53.1b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$240.86\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n31.7%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$48.1b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.62\n7D\n0.3%\n1Y\n-19.1%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.6b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$103.64\n7D\n1.5%\n1Y\n34.3%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.7b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.29\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n12.9%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.5b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$17.68\n7D\n-0.5%\n1Y\n21.4%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$40.86\n7D\n-0.9%\n1Y\n-5.9%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$3.2b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$28.48\n7D\n14.7%\n1Y\n-14.7%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.8b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$35.39\n7D\n9.7%\n1Y\n63.2%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.7b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$31.00\n7D\n20.7%\n1Y\n48.5%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$576.7m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.60\n7D\n0.4%\n1Y\n-9.4%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$407.5m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.31\n7D\n-2.5%\n1Y\n-35.1%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$281.8m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$22.35\n7D\n7.7%\n1Y\n-39.5%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$75.7m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$3.80\n7D\n-9.1%\n1Y\n-3.2%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$35.2m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.80\n7D\n7.3%\n1Y\n-58.5%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$894.4k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0017\n7D\n13.3%\n1Y\n-72.6%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n0%"
