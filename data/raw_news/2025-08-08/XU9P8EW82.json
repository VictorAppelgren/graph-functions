  "description": "Heads up: Instagram doesn't turn on its Map feature by default.",
  "content": "I've had Instagram since I was in the ninth grade, back when filters like Valencia and X-Pro II were all the rage. Even though I've essentially grown up with the app, I've also grown a lot more cautious about what I share online. These days, privacy beats popularity for me and that includes keeping tabs on what data apps like Instagram collect in the background, especially when it comes to location.\n\nWhether you're trying to avoid targeted ads, protect your privacy or just don't want Instagram to know your every move, turning off location sharing is a smart step. With its latest update, Instagram added an interactive Map feature that makes it easier than ever to explore what's trending nearby. Handy? Definitely. Potentially invasive? Also yes. That is unless you know how to take control and limit, or disable, the feature.\n\nThe Maps addition has sparked a wave of worry online, with users taking to X (formally Twitter) and TikTok to vent about their real-time location becoming exposed to strangers and to urge others to check their location sharing settings on the app. Instagram exec Adam Mosseri has responded to the warnings, noting that the Maps location sharing settings are not turned on by default and that you must opt-in for the feature to access your location. Still, Mosseri acknowledged the confusion and backlash, and confirmed that his team is working on \"improvements\" to roll out as early as next week.\n\nHere's what the new Instagram Map does, how to use it (or avoid it) and how to lock down your privacy settings.\n\nRead also: You May See an AI Version of Yourself as an Instagram Post: Here's How to Turn It Off\n\nHow does the Map feature work?\n\nInstagram's Map feature is essentially a social-powered discovery tool. It lets you browse a searchable, interactive map filled with popular tagged locations (restaurants, parks, tourist attractions, stores, coffee shops, bars and more) all pulled from public posts and Stories.\n\nIf you've enabled location sharing with someone, they'll be able to see your location on the Map through tagged posts and within direct messages. Likewise, you can view the real-time locations of anyone who's sharing theirs with you by just swiping up on the Map to see a list.\n\nAnd if you've tagged a location in a Story or post and have a public account, your content might appear on the map for other users to explore. You can tap on a spot, see other photos or videos tagged there and filter by categories like \"cafes\" or \"beauty salons.\"\n\nIt's kind of like Google Maps meets Yelp meets Snap Map, but via Instagram photos.\n\nCan anyone see your real-time location?\n\nYou can customize exactly who sees your location, whether it's friends you follow back, your Close Friends list, selected individuals or no one at all. Location sharing only works with accounts you follow and you can also exclude specific people if you'd rather keep your whereabouts private from certain followers.\n\nAccording to Instagram, your location updates every time you open the app and automatically disappears after 24 hours if you haven't been active.\n\nHow to access the Maps feature\n\nYou can access Instagram's Map in two ways:\n\u2022 From the Explore page: Tap the map icon in the top right corner of the Explore tab to launch the interactive map. It'll show nearby tagged locations or ones that are currently popular.\n\u2022 From a tagged location in a Story or post: Tap the location tag and Instagram will open the Map view for that place, letting you explore more content nearby.\n\nIf you're allowing Instagram to access your location, the app will show trending spots near your current location. It may also use your location to tailor content recommendations and ads, which is something privacy-conscious users should be aware of.\n\nIs Instagram location tracking on by default?\n\nNo, not exactly. Instagram doesn't automatically turn on location services, which means the Maps feature is not turned on by default either. When you installed the Instagram app, you were asked whether you wanted to grant it location permissions. You could choose to deny it, allow it only while using the app or allow it once.\n\nBut if you gave it access once, like to tag your favorite vacation spot, that permission might still be active without you realizing it. That means Instagram could be sharing and collecting your location every time you open the app, unless you change your settings.\n\nYou can limit what you share with the Map, though. Even if you've used location tags in the past, you have some control over what shows up on Instagram's Map.\n\nIf you want to avoid appearing on the Map:\n\u2022 Don't tag a location in your Stories or posts.\n\u2022 Switch to a private account. Map content is primarily pulled from public posts. If your account is private, your tagged content won't show up for strangers.\n\u2022 Turn off location access in your device settings (more on that below).\n\u2022 Limit who can see your location (You can select between Friends, Close Friends, Only these friends or No one).\n\nYou can also remove location tags from past posts by editing the post and deleting the tagged place, though Instagram hasn't made this process super intuitive.\n\nHow to turn off Instagram's location access\n\nIf you want to stop Instagram from accessing your phone's location entirely:\n\u2022 Choose Never or Ask Next Time\n\nYou can also disable Precise Location if you want Instagram to know your general area (like your city) but not your exact GPS coordinates.\n\nInstagram's new Map feature is a powerful way to explore what's happening around you, but it also comes with privacy considerations. Just keep in mind that any time you give an app access to your location, there's a trade-off between convenience and privacy.\n\nRead more: Custom AI Posts in Our Instagram Feeds? No Thanks, Meta",

      "text": "Instagram has launched new features aimed at further connecting users with their online contacts, the company announced Wednesday. One involves sharing public feed posts and reels, another shares locations with others on an Instagram map, and a new Friends tab shows what content your contacts have liked or commented on.\nFor reposts, you'll be able to share public reels and feed posts from other users. The original poster will be credited and those reshares will appear in the sharer's profile in a new tab. Posts and reels will now include a reshare icon when they're available to share.\nInstagram says creators will be able to reach more people since those posts will be recommended to others' followers.\nYou have to enable the new map feature to start sharing your last active location. You can set who can see your location and can also choose not to share your location when you're in specific places, or have your location available to specific users.\nLocation sharing can be disabled at any time, Instagram says. Reels, posts and stories can be viewed through the map.\nAlso, a new Friends tab at the top of Reels shows public content from contacts. This feature has been available previously, but is now being expanded globally.\nYou can opt out of having your content displayed in the tab with options to hide likes, comments and reposts. You can also mute likes, comments and reposts from accounts you follow."

      "text": "I had to read the news about six times before it fully sunk in: Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, is experimenting with integrating custom AI content into our Instagram and Facebook feeds. To put it another way, Meta is exploring the idea of putting more recommended content (from accounts we don't follow) into our feeds, and it would be entirely generated by Meta's AI.\nAs the person who reviews AI image generators for CNET, including Meta AI, let me tell you: This is a terrible idea.\nThese photos, made with its AI assistant Meta AI, will be \"based on your interests\" and could potentially \"feature you, so you can be the star of your own story and share your favorites with friends.\" So an AI version of your face could randomly pop up in your Instagram feed. Meta, respectfully... what? Why?\nMeta dropped a lot of news about its virtual assistant Meta AI this week at its annual AR/VR event Meta Connect, including a new voice featuring a variety of celebrity voices, better video dubbing translations and new visual upgrades that let it \"see\" your photos and edit them. But this news, buried near the end of its press release and omitted entirely from the keynote address, is important, and we need to talk about it. Mainly, we need to beg Meta not to let this experiment result in a real update.\nAs AI content generation services get better, it's getting harder to escape the deluge of AI content (aka slop). It's also getting harder to tell real photos apart from AI ones. I admit, I was pretty impressed with Meta AI's Imagine feature, which acts as an AI image generator embedded in the chatbot. But that doesn't mean I want it to clog up my feed with weird images of me as an astronaut or whatever.\nEarlier this year, Meta started labeling content that was AI-generated, which was a great idea. But it wasn't a perfect tool, and photographers started getting slapped with AI labels for images that were edited, not AI-generated. The new recommended posts would have a similar label that says \"Imagined for you.\" But labels are too easy to overlook, which is why I'm still concerned that rolling out this update would further blur the line between what's real and what's AI. And that's really the last thing we need, when mis- and disinformation is easier to create convincingly than ever before, thanks to AI.\nOn the privacy front, CNET reached out to Meta to confirm whether you can remove AI-generated posts from your feed and if we can expect to see AI posts start to pop up while it's in the testing phase, but we didn't receive a response by the time of publication. We do know that US users cannot opt out of having publicly shared posts used for training its AI models.\nMark Zuckerberg told The Verge that adding AI content to social feeds is the next \"logical jump\" for the social platforms. But I really can't imagine an AI image that's going to be so funny, so relevant or otherwise worth my time that it's going to make up for all the potential problems it could produce. Meta has spent so much time convincing us that if we want to use Meta AI, we can find it everywhere -- even if we didn't want it there, like in Search. Why do we need it in our feeds, too?\nMy Instagram feed is already a mess, mostly clogged up by random accounts I don't follow, recommending content I might enjoy. I have to click through at least three ads to get to one Story from someone I follow. And I've put up with it, mostly because it's still my main online social hub. But the overall user experience of scrolling Instagram and Facebook has gone downhill in the past 10 years. We've long since moved past its original purpose to connect with friends and family, much to some users' disappointment, including me. Adding AI-generated recommended content to the mix feels like it will be the final nail in the coffin of my Instagram feed."

Meta, Instagram's parent company, is experimenting with displaying AI-generated avatars in a series of photos shown in Instagram slideshows that only the user can see on their own feed.\nIn a post on Reddit, a user going by Green_Video_9831, shared what he called a \"personalized ad\" of his AI-generated face and body in a hall of mirrors. He titled the post, \"Used Meta AI to edit a selfie, now instagram is using my face on ads targeted at me.\"\nGreen_Video_9831 said in a subsequent post that he had a similar image taken at a museum of himself in his Instagram history and assumed Meta used that information to make something familiar.\nRead more: Custom AI Posts in Our Instagram Feeds? No Thanks, Meta\nThe post from Meta AI's account says the image is, \"Imagined for you\" and contains the text, \"Imagine yourself reflecting on life in an endless maze of mirrors where you're the main focus.\"\nA preview of this was mentioned in September in a Meta post about its new AI products, when the company said 400 million people were already using Meta AI.\nThe Meta post said, \"And we're testing new Meta AI-generated content in your Facebook and Instagram feeds, so you may see images from Meta AI created just for you (based on your interests or current trends).\"\nA representative for Meta told CNET, \"We test lots of new AI features publicly in limited capacities to see what people find interesting and useful to their experiences across our apps.\"\nAs to the appearance of AI images on feeds, the spokesperson said, \"These images can only be generated for users who have onboarded to Meta's Imagine yourself feature, which includes adding photos to that feature, and (who) have accepted the feature's terms.\"\nRead more: What Is Meta AI? What You Need to Know About the Social Network's AI Tools\nTo opt out, the spokesperson said, you can tap the three dots on the top-right corner of a post and then select \"Hide\" to stop seeing similar posts. Select \"Stop seeing this content\" to turn off suggested AI images.\nMeta has been rolling out its Meta AI tools across all its major platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger. The tools can generate chatbots, help enhance photos and videos, and assist with tasks such as managing schedules or searching for posts. It includes celebrity voices such as John Cena and Kristen Bell for its voice-powered assistant.\nMeta, like other major tech companies such as OpenAI, Google, Apple and Microsoft, is in a race to attract users to its AI offerings with the goal of becoming the most widely used AI assistant in the world.\nBut the changes haven't gone without controversy. The company has touted the ability to generate AI avatars of influencers. But Meta also backtracked on its plan to introduce AI-generated profiles of characters after it had begun posting on Instagram and Facebook."
