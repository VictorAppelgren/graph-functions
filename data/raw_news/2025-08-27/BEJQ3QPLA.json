  "description": "Lack of empathy isn't common, but it can make a relationship suffocating and exhausting when it's there.",
  "content": "There are various green flags that can show up in a courtship. Clear and consistent communication is one, Jessica Small, a marriage counselor and therapist in Colorado, previously told CNBC Make It. Respecting boundaries is another. Conversely, there are red flags it's worth looking out for when you're dating to ensure you're not starting a relationship with someone who could hurt you or make you miserable. In fact, the No. 1 trait that says it's time to end things with a partner is \"somebody who lacks empathy,\" says psychotherapist and author of \"13 Things Mentally Strong Couples Don't Do,\" Amy Morin.\n\n'They might minimize how you feel or dismiss it'\n\nA lack of empathy is often described as callous, cold-hearted, and even narcissistic. A person who exhibits this trait won't be able to understand or envision how you feel, Morin says. And they might not even care. \"They might minimize how you feel or dismiss it,\" she says. They'll say, \"you're just being dramatic or they'll tell you that you shouldn't get so upset about something so minor.\" A partner who lacks empathy will also blame you for how situations unfold. They'll tell you, for example, \"it's your fault that you feel that way,\" says Morin, \"or it's not my fault if you can't do this because you have too much anxiety.\" People who lack empathy are also very self-centered and a relationship with one can be exhausting and suffocating. \"They're only thinking about what they want,\" Morin says. \"they just can't take into consideration how their behavior affects you or affects anyone else around them.\"\n\nA lack of empathy, while uncommon, is a red flag\n\nThere are various conditions that could cause this trait in a person, Morin says. For example, people with narcissistic personality disorder have it, as well as some people with autism. Those who suffer from depression might even exhibit it at times. But a lack of empathy isn't all that common, Morin says. Regardless, it is a huge red flag. Dating or being in a relationship with someone who behaves this way could result in a lot of pain, anger and frustration. If you feel like the person you're with never checks in about your feelings or consistently dismisses your emotions when you raise them, it might be time to leave, Morin says.

      "text": "The path to change for someone with narcissistic personality disorder is more narrow than previously perceived, according to a new report published in Psychological Bulletin.\nResearchers analyzed 51 studies of more than 37,000 participants to see how narcissistic tendencies shifted during a lifespan. They found that over a course of decades, narcissism did decrease, but only a little. At most, researchers saw a moderate decline.\nNarcissistic personality traits include a sense of entitlement, lack of empathy, need for admiration, and a grandiose sense of self-importance.\nDr. Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles who focuses on narcissistic and antagonistic personality types, has treated about 50 narcissist and says these findings reflect her own experiences.\n\"For the longest time it always felt defeatist to take the stance that people with narcissistic personality disorder don't change,\" she says. \"But I know this doesn't change. It's not going to change.\"\nDurvasula has a new show, Reality Check, on the interactive streaming platform Fireside where she discusses different mental health issues.\nOftentimes, she says, people take solace in the idea that anyone could improve at anytime. But, in reality, this is an idealistic and potentially harmful perspective.\n\"We have to get out of our Hallmark movie ways,\" she says. \"It doesn't feel fair, and it's hard, but it's a fundamental truth that they don't change.\"\n'Narcissism is characterized by a lack of self-reflectiveness'\nSomeone with NPD, by definition, doesn't believe anything is wrong with them.\n\"The more maladaptive a personality, the less likely they are to change,\" Durvasula says. \"On top of that, narcissism is characterized by a lack of self-reflectiveness.\"\nMost narcissists come from two types of upbringings: one where their parents were neglectful and possibly abusive and one where they were spoiled.\nIf a person was raised with the former type of childhood, they might be more amenable to change, she says: \"You might be able to get in a little more purchase, get your feet in there with a client who is then starting to recognize why they are so 'me against the world,' why they feel so combative.\"\nWith those who grew up spoiled, Durvasula hasn't seen any success.\n\"With the spoiled child narcissist, forget it,\" she says. \"That is indoctrinated. People telling their kids they are the most special and you deserve everything. No you don't. I've never seen luck with those clients.\"\n'A narcissist can come off like an empathic person'\nNarcissists can present as well-adjusted and thoughtful, which is why many people can unknowingly be in relationships with one for years.\n\"They can keep it together when their needs are well-supplied,\" Durvasula says. \"When they are getting all the praise they want, all the adulation they want, their partner is anticipating their needs, everything is going well like psychological clockwork, a narcissist can come off like an empathic person.\"\nHowever, it's unrealistic to expect that you can meet the needs of someone at all times.\n\"It's almost like somebody on a diet,\" she says. \"If you can structure your life just so and get the right amount of activity and genetically be lucky enough, you can get that weight off and keep it off, but that's not usually how it goes because that's not how life goes.\"\nInstead of expecting a narcissist to change, Durvasula advises those in relationships with them to seek professional help.\n\"We need to help people work through the grief of a relationship that is not unfolding in a way they feel psychologically safe,\" she says.\nWant to be a successful, confident communicator?

      "text": "There is an avalanche of information on dating red flags \u2014 what they are, how to spot them. But it's just as important to notice green flags if you're deciding whether you and a potential partner should get more serious.\n\"A relationship or dating green flag is an indicator that the relationship is worth continuing to explore,\" says Jessica Small, a marriage counselor and therapist at Growing Self Counseling & Coaching in Denver.\nHere are four relationship green flags, according to Small.\n1. Clear and consistent communication\nIt's all about follow-through. Does the person call or text when they say they will?\n\"You do not want to constantly be trying to decode what someone is saying or questioning if they are going to be in touch when they say they will,\" she says.\n2. Appropriate sharing\nThis one is \"tricky,\" Small says, because appropriate sharing can very quickly become oversharing, which is a red flag.\n\"When a person is able to share enough information about themselves that you feel like you're getting to know them and understand them over time, but you're still curious to know more, that is a good sign,\" she says.\nSay, they mention their ex. This in itself is not a bad thing, Small says. But talk about one's ex should not dominate the conversation.\nYou do not want to constantly be trying to decode what someone is saying or questioning if they are going to be in touch when they say they will.Jessica Smallmarriage counselor\nThe same goes for how much you share about your past relationships.\n\"If a potential partner asks what happened in your last relationship on date one, you might say, 'We grew apart,'\" she says. \"On date two if the topic comes back up, you might add a few more pieces of information but still keep it simple.\"\nExtrapolate this to other, deeper topics, she adds.\n\"The beginning of a relationship is about building trust and figuring out if this person deserves to know the ins and outs of your life,\" she says.\n3. Shared values and interests\nIf the dates are fun, it is easy to overlook some of the more crucial aspects that make a long-term relationship work.\n\"Having an overlap in interests or in belief systems is an important part of a successful relationship,\" Small says.\nWhen you both are ready to dig into these topics, be honest and note how much you two do, or don't, align.\n4. Respect for boundaries\n\"A green flag is when a potential partner is considerate and aware of your boundaries, asks for clarification on them when they are unclear, and does not push them,\" she says.\nLet's say you ask to meet at a bar or the park on the first date and have expressed that you're more comfortable meeting in public places. On the second date, what are they suggesting?\nIf it's a restaurant or a museum, that's great. If they keep pushing for you to come over or vice versa, that's a sign they might not respect your boundaries.\nDON'T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work & life?

      "text": "I've been a therapist for over 30 years, and so many of the couples I meet with simply don't see how their words and body language \u2014 even if they are not yelling \u2014 are disrespectful.\nI've seen couples who have a hard time repairing trust that was broken during embroiled and ugly fights. Others lose a sense of trust by the sarcastic digs, eye rolls, interrupting, or belittling.\nIt's vital to examine the kinds of communication that go under the radar as disrespectful. Awareness is the first step in taking accountability for your words. While the types of phrases below can seem innocent on their own, over time they can leave a partner feeling diminished and unloved \u2014 and the whole relationship in troubled waters:\n1. Phrases that humiliate your partner, name-calling, or speaking disparagingly \u2014 directly or to others in public\nExamples:\n- \"Really, second helpings?\"\n- \"Oh, he always does that.\"\n- \"Don't pay attention to him.\"\nDON'T MISS: How to use AI to be more productive and successful at work\n2. Sarcasm and mocking tones intended as insults\nExamples:\n- \"Great job on yelling at the kids.\"\n- \"Is that what you're wearing?\"\n- \"Yeah, like that's worth bragging about.\"\n3. Manipulative language that twists reality\nExamples:\n- \"It didn't happen that way.\"\n- \"I never said that. You understood it wrong.\"\n- \"You're crazy if you really think that.\"\n4. Moralistic statements that insult, correct, criticize, demean, diagnose or label\nExamples:\n- \"You spoil him way too much, because your mother spoiled you.\"\n- \"You're so selfish.\"\n- \"That's a narcissistic thing to say.\"\n5. Blame shifting\nExamples:\n- \"I hate yelling, but you frustrate me so much.\"\n- \"You're making me feel guilty.\"\n- \"Maybe if you tried harder, I wouldn't have to step in.\"\n6. Blocking compassion by advice, interrogation, one-upping or correcting\nExamples:\n- \"How come you didn't talk to me about this sooner?\"\n- \"Why don't you just ignore her?\"\n- \"I've done this a dozen times. It's not that complicated.\"\nHow to be a more mindful communicator\nWhile this won't solve all your problems, one tool I like to give couples after their first session is the almighty pause.\nWhether it's stepping away, going outside to breathe and relax, or developing a silly code word together when things get tense. The idea is to do whatever it takes to shut the reactive system down which typically requires elongating the space between your angry reactive feelings and the urge to spew these feelings out with your words.\nThe pause could mean a minute, five minutes, or five days. This slowing down mechanism benefits us greatly in relationships because it makes us less prone to the judgmental words.\nEssentially, the work before you open your mouth is the most important and influential part of having conversations that heal versus destroy your relationship. Pausing and preparing is about connecting within for energy before you reach for energy from your partner.

      "text": "People with narcissistic traits often have an inflated sense of their own talents, achievements and significance in the world. They're sensitive to criticism and struggle to have any empathy or appreciation for others.\nThis self-centered focus on their own needs is usually at the expense of everyone around them, which makes communicating with them challenging. You may be left feeling dismissed, criticized or invisible.\nAs a Harvard-trained psychologist, I've found that there are seven phrases you'll hear from highly narcissistic people:\n1. 'You're lucky I even care.'\nNarcissists see themselves as special and better than everyone else. They believe that other people should feel grateful to be in their orbit because they are all so flawed in comparison.\nSimilar phrases:\n- \"You don't deserve me.\"\n- \"You should feel relieved that I haven't cut you out of my life.\"\nDON'T MISS: How to change careers and be happier at work\n2. 'You're so pathetic.'\nMany narcissists are chronically disappointed by others. In response, they may put those people down with cutting, hurtful and mean-spirited insults.\nSimilar phrases:\n- \"You're such a loser.\"\n- \"No one else would ever want to be with you.\"\n3. 'You need me.'\nNarcissists often resort to manipulative tactics like threats or intimidation to keep people invested in the relationship because they feel safer maintaining control, rather than sharing power.\nSimilar phrases:\n- \"Be careful or you'll push me away.\"\n- \"I'll ruin you if you cross me, and no one will want to be associated with you.\"\n4. 'You are wrong to feel that way.'\nIt's hard for people with narcissistic traits to empathize with others. As a result, they rarely see the other person in a relationship as an independent individual with their own thoughts, feelings and experiences.\nSimilar phrases:\n- \"My feelings matter more.\"\n- \"I'm usually right.\"\n5. 'Everyone else is an idiot.'\nNarcissists have a strong desire to feel superior to others. One way they do that is by putting people down. They tend to make negative comments about everyone else \u2014 friends, family or even unknown acquaintances \u2014 to build themselves up as part of a separate, special kind of person.\nSimilar phrases:\n- \"Your friend is lame. Why do you hang out with them?\"\n- \"These people have nothing to offer me.\"\n6. 'My feelings are your fault.'\nWhen a narcissist is upset, they'll blame others for their feelings instead of acknowledging their role in the situation. Rather than holding themselves accountable, they'll complain about how unfair other people are.\nSimilar phrases:\n- \"If you just did what I asked you to do, I wouldn't be so upset right now.\"\n- \"I wouldn't be yelling if you didn't make me so angry!\"\n7. 'I don't have time for this.'\nPeople with narcissistic tendencies are good at stonewalling \u2014 cutting off communication to show how upset they are. They will pretend to not be affected, while giving you the silent treatment.\nSimilar phrases:\n- \"I'm fine. What are you even talking about?\"\n- Saying nothing at all.\nThe No. 1 way to respond to a narcissist\nThe best way to respond to a narcissist is not to react at all. Pause in the moment, but don't leave the conversation entirely. Don't yell or become defensive.\nAfter a deep breath, you can say, \"I need to think about this before I respond, so I'm going to need a minute.\" This will give you time to collect your thoughts and notice your emotions. More importantly, you'll be less likely to say something you might regret later.\nThen, set clear boundaries. Here are some examples:\n- \"I hear you, I just don't agree with you.\"\n- \"Thank you for sharing your perspective. When you're open to hearing mine, I can share it.\"\n- \"It sounds like you're having a lot of feelings right now. I am here to listen if you'd like, but if you put me down or intentionally try to hurt me, I am going to walk away because it isn't healthy for me to be called names.\"\n- \"I want you to know that I see you and I hear your perspective. I just have a different one, and that's okay with me.\"\nRemember, while a narcissist may continue to communicate in harmful ways, their words can't have power over you unless you let them.\nTheir most common communication tactics are manipulation and control. That is a reflection of who they are and how they experience their world, not a reflection of you and your values.\nDr. Cortney S.
