  "title": "The Latest: Trump announces Space Command is moving from Colorado to Alabama",
  "description": "President Donald Trump announced that U.S. Space Command will be relocated from Colorado to Alabama, reversing a Biden-era decision to keep it at its temporary home",
  "content": "Trump says mail-in voting a \u2018big factor\u2019 in moving Space Command out of Colorado\n\nIn announcing that Space Command would be headquartered in Alabama, Trump said the \u201cbig problem\u201d he has with Colorado is its use of mail-in voting. Trump has long claimed without clear evidence that mail-in voting increases fraud and he\u2019s seeking to ban it as a practice by states in U.S. elections.\n\n\u201cSo that played a big factor,\u201d Trump said of relocating Space Force\u2019s command center.\n\nThe president said that mail-in voting leads to \u201cautomatically crooked elections.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden, had placed Space Command\u2019s headquarters in Colorado, a choice he reversed on Tuesday.\n\nSpace Command HQ is moving from Colorado to Alabama\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks about the relocation of U.S. Space Command headquarters from Colorado to Alabama in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nTrump has officially announced that Space Force\u2019s headquarters will be moving to Alabama.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Space Command HQ will move to the beautiful locale of a place called Huntsville, Alabama, forever to be known from this point forward as Rocket City,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe said that when he created Space Command in his first term, he planned to make its headquarters in Alabama but that the Biden administration established it instead in Colorado.\n\nTrump said one of his issues with Colorado was that it allowed all-mail in voting -- which he suggested encouraged fraud.\n\nTrump says he will be seeking an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court on tariffs\n\nThe president said in an interview taped Tuesday morning with conservative commentator Scott Jennings that he will be \u201cgoing in as an emergency\u201d to the high court and would \u201cprobably\u201d be seeking it Wednesday.\n\nHe said the judges who issued the appeals court ruling last week were \u201ca very liberal court\u201d and said that \u201cthey don\u2019t care about the country and \u201cthey don\u2019t love the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be a disaster if that is lost for our country,\u201d Trump said of his tariffs.\n\nWhen Trump makes his announcement about Space Command\u2019s new headquarters, it will be the first time he\u2019s spoken publicly for a week.\n\nAlthough he was spotted heading to his golf course over the weekend and he granted some interviews, he was largely out of sight for an unusually long stretch of time.\n\nOn Sunday, the 79-year-old president posted \u201cNEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE\u201d on social media.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how long Trump talks during the announcement. His participation in a Cabinet meeting last Tuesday stretched for three hours, including a monologue, conversations with top officials and questions from reporters.\n\nPentagon authorizes up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges, according to a memo reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nThe military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys \u2014 both military and civilians \u2014 to the Justice Department \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week, according to the memo, dated Aug. 27.\n\nAfter Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst made her retirement official on Tuesday, one House Republican widely speculated to launch a statewide bid teased an \u201cannouncement soon\u201d on the race.\n\nRep. Ashley Hinson, who represents an eastern Iowa district, praised Ernst\u2019s time in military and government service as a \u201cpowerful example of the American dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we look forward, President Trump needs a fighter in the Senate who will always have his back to continue to cut spending, deport illegal aliens, and put working families first,\u201d Hinson said in a post on the social media site X. \u201cI\u2019ve stood shoulder to shoulder with the President to pass this America First agenda in the House and I would be his strongest ally in the Senate.\u201d\n\nHer family will have an \u201cannouncement soon about how we believe we can best serve Iowa,\u201d she says.\n\nVaccine researcher and critic of RFK Jr. will no longer serve on FDA panel\n\nA leading vaccine researcher and critic of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will no longer serve as a government adviser, after U.S. officials declined to extend his term on a federal panel.\n\nDr. Paul Offit told the Associated Press Tuesday that he learned his appointment to a Food and Drug Administration vaccine panel would not be renewed.\n\nOffit, a vaccine inventor and pediatric specialist, has been a prominent critic of Kennedy, repeatedly calling for his resignation over recent changes to vaccine access and information.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory panel meets regularly to make recommendations for seasonal shots and to review the safety and effectiveness of new vaccines.\n\nOffit served two four-year terms on the panel. He says he was asked to extend his time by an additional two years and filed paperwork to serve until 2027.\n\nBut Offit said he was told that Kennedy\u2019s department decided not to renew his appointment.\n\nRubio attends event to honor Cuban dissident in Miami before Mexico trip\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio attended an awards ceremony in his native Miami where Polish officials recognized one of Cuba\u2019s best known dissidents.\n\nRubio appeared alongside his Polish counterpart, Radoslaw Sikorski, and spoke briefly to praise Berta Soler\u2019s refusal to leave Cuba while also thanking Poland for its actions to throw off communist rule and support other countries on the same path.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being critical of anybody, but it is easier to be critical of the regime, like many of us are on social media and in press releases. It\u2019s a lot harder to actually confront it in person with real consequences in your daily life,\u201d Rubio said. Soler did not attend the event and recorded a video from Cuba.\n\nLater on Tuesday, Rubio is set to travel to Mexico in what will be his fourth foreign trip in the Western Hemisphere. He will also visit Ecuador.\n\nA federal judge was wrong to block the Trump administration from freezing billions of dollars and terminating contracts for nonprofits to run a \u201cgreen bank\u201d aimed at financing climate-friendly projects, a divided appeals court ruled Tuesday.\n\nIt said the challenge belongs in a federal claims court as a breach of contract case.\n\nThe ruling is a win for the Trump administration that had blasted the program as a waste of taxpayer money and tried to claw back funding. It\u2019s a loss for Climate United Fund and other nonprofits who wanted the federal court system to ensure it quickly received its funding.\n\nThe groups sued the EPA, its administrator Lee Zeldin and Citibank, which held the grant money, saying they had illegally denied the groups access to funds awarded last year. They wanted access to those funds again, saying the freeze had paralyzed their work and jeopardized their basic operations.\n\nUN says 14,000 US-bound migrants have turned around\n\nAlmost all are Venezuelan, and they\u2019ve reversed course since Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown began, according to a report published by the governments of Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica, with support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nThis \u201creverse flow\u201d migration is largely made up of migrants who fled Venezuela\u2019s long-running economic, social and political crises only to encounter U.S. immigration policy no longer open to asylum-seekers. Migration through the treacherous Darien Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed. That flow slowed somewhat in 2024, but dried up almost completely early this year.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about what\u2019s happening with Venezuelans who were trying to reach the U.S.\n\nJudge Breyer noted in his ruling the Trump administration\u2019s possible plans to call National Guard troops into other U.S. cities.\n\nNewsom posted on X, in an all-caps reflection of the president\u2019s own social media style, \u201cDONALD TRUMP LOSES AGAIN. The courts agree -- his militarization of our streets and use of the military against US citizens is ILLEGAL.\u201d\n\nThe White House and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nTrump deployed roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines in Southern California over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, citing a law that applies when the nation \u201cis invaded,\u201d when \u201cthere is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,\u201d or when the president is otherwise unable \u201cto execute the laws of the United States.\u201d\n\nBreyer accused the Trump administration of \u201cwillfully\u201d violating the law, saying it used troops for functions barred by their training, refused to \u201cmeaningfully coordinate with state and local officials\u201d and \u201ccoached\u201d federal law enforcement agencies as it used armed soldiers and military vehicles to block traffic, engage in crowd control and otherwise act beyond its authority.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about the ruling against National Guard deployments\n\nThe executive order signed by Mayor Brandon Johnson on Saturday pushes back against what he called the \u201cout-of-control\u201d Trump administration\u2019s plan to surge federal officers into the nation\u2019s third-largest city. It prohibits Chicago Police from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge.\n\nBrandon said all city departments must guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents \u201camidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Sept. 5 and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.\n\nThe Trump administration is piling new restrictions on Palestinian visa applicants, making it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport to receive the travel documents needed to visit the U.S. for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes.\n\nPalestinian applicants who hold non-Palestinian Authority passports also may face difficulties, should they need a U.S. visa.\n\nThe State Department has tightened what it says are temporary policies to intensify the vetting of Palestinians seeking to travel to the United States. Now, virtually all applications will either be denied or not accepted for processing.\n\nThe administration is changing how U.S. visas are issued as it cracks down on illegal migration from around the world, but these steps against Palestinians appear more far-reaching that those directed at other nationalities, many of which include exemptions for official travel to the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has sanctioned the Iraqi-Kittitian businessman Waleed al-Samarra\u2019i and firms associated with him, accusing him of smuggling Iranian oil disguised as Iraqi oil through a network of shipping companies and ships.\n\nTreasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control alleges that al-Samarra\u2019i covertly blends Iranian oil with Iraqi oil to avoid sanctions and has made hundreds of millions of dollars from the scheme.\n\n\u201cBy targeting Iran\u2019s oil revenue stream, Treasury will further degrade the regime\u2019s ability to carry out attacks against the United States and its allies,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a news release. \u201cWe remain committed to an oil supply free from Iran and will continue our efforts to disrupt the ongoing attempts by Tehran to evade U.S. sanctions.\u201d\n\nSurvivors of abuse from Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell are meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, putting pressure on Congress to take action to force more disclosure of the evidence in the case.\n\nA group of both Republicans and Democrats on the House Oversight Committee will meet with the survivors on Tuesday afternoon. The committee has been conducting an inquiry into how the Justice Department handled Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges.\n\nSeveral survivors are also expected to join a rally on Wednesday as well as a news conference with lawmakers who are pushing for legislation that would force the Trump administration to release the case files.\n\nTrump to move Space Command from Colorado to Alabama, source says\n\nThe move will reverse a Biden-era decision to keep it at its temporary headquarters in Colorado, according to a person familiar with the announcement.\n\nTrump is expected to speak Tuesday afternoon, and he will give the new location, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to confirm the plans ahead of the official announcement. A Pentagon website set up to livestream the remarks described the event as a \u201cU.S. Space Command HQ Announcement.\u201d\n\nSpace Command\u2019s functions include conducting operations like enabling satellite-based navigation and troop communication and providing warning of missile launches. Alabama and Colorado have long battled to claim Space Command because it has significant implications for the local economies. The Air Force in 2021 identified Army Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville as the preferred location.\n\nDefunded CPB to get one of TV\u2019s biggest prizes\n\nThe Television Academy is honoring the Corporation for Public Broadcasting with its Governors Award as the organization winds down its work of nearly 60 years due to the Trump administration's withdrawal of its funding.\n\nThe organization has helped pay for PBS, NPR, 1,500 local radio and TV stations as well as programs like \u201cSesame Street\u201d and \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d\n\nTrump signed a bill in July canceling about $1.1 billion already approved for the public media system, calling it politically biased and an unnecessary expense. The corporation told employees that most staff positions will end with the fiscal year on Sept. 30. A small transition team will stay until January.\n\nSchumer urges Republicans to work with Democrats to avoid shutdown\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer says Democrats \u201care willing to work in a bipartisan way\u201d to avoid a government shutdown when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.\n\nRepublicans will need votes from both parties to pass a short term funding measure while they finish the full package of spending bills, and Democrats will want some concessions to agree.\n\nSchumer received blowback from his party in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries voted against that short term spending measure, arguing that Republicans had cut Democrats out.\n\nSchumer\u2019s letter to colleagues Tuesday morning said he and Jeffries \u201care aligned,\u201d and that \u201cSenate Republicans must decide: Stand up for the legislative branch or enable Trump\u2019s slide toward authoritarianism.\u201d\n\nSilver is also up as Trump tests faith in the US dollar\n\nThe price of silver was up 1.8% at $41.46 an ounce on Tuesday, surpassing $40 an ounce for the first time since 2011.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not just a price tick; it\u2019s the market\u2019s confession that faith in fiat is wobbling,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. He noted that the price of the precious metal has nearly doubled since early 2023.\n\nFiat currency is money with value rooted in the trust and authority of the issuing government, rather than a fixed value or an asset like gold or silver.\n\nInvestors have been shifting away from U.S. Treasuries for years but that shift has accelerated this year due to worries over U.S. government debt, trade tensions and geopolitical risks, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.\n\nUS stocks tumble, gold hits record as Trump challenges the Fed\n\nThe S&P 500 sank 1.3% early Tuesday, on track for its worst loss in a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 571 points, and the Nasdaq composite sank 1.7%.\n\nNvidia and other companies that have benefited from the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology were some of the heaviest weights on the market. The overall stock market was feeling pressure from rising bond yields, which are climbing around the world. And the spot price of gold, traditionally a haven for investors in times of uncertainty, hit a new record of $3,578.40 per ounce early Tuesday.\n\nTrump\u2019 s challenges to the U.S. Federal Reserve and other institutions have shaken faith in the U.S. dollar, prompting a shift into other investment options such as gold and silver, analysts say.\n\nJudge rules Trump\u2019s use of National Guard in Los Angeles illegal\n\nJudge Charles Breyer ruled that the Trump administration violated federal law by sending troops to accompany federal agents on immigration raids.\n\nCalifornia sued, saying the troops sent to Los Angeles over the summer were violating a law that prohibits military enforcement of domestic laws.\n\nLawyers for the administration have argued the Posse Comitatus Act doesn\u2019t apply because the troops were protecting federal officers, not enforcing laws. They say the troops were mobilized under an authority that allows the president to deploy them.\n\nCORRECTS earlier reference to judge's location; he's in San Francisco, not Washington, D.C.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries fueling Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports.\n\nThe legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won\u2019t move without him.\n\nGraham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,\u201d Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.\n\nSenators are returning to Washington right where they left off in early August \u2014 fighting over Trump\u2019s nominees.\n\nExasperated Republicans fled for the month after making little headway as Senate Democrats forced delays in confirmations, angering Trump as many of his administration\u2019s positions remain unfilled.\n\nRepublican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could \u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d\n\nRepublicans now say they\u2019re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.\n\nGOP needs Democratic votes to keep government open\n\nThe most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. Just how Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on this remains unclear.\n\nCongress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.\n\nComplicating the negotiations, Republicans rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid. \u201cTrump is rooting for a shutdown,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.\n\nTrial nears for man accused of trying to kill Trump in Florida\n\nA man charged with trying to assassinate President Donald Trump last year in South Florida is set to represent himself during a pretrial conference on Tuesday, as final preparations are made for trial.\n\nBarring any delays, jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday in Fort Pierce federal court for the case against Ryan Routh. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon signed off on Routh\u2019s request to represent himself in July but said court-appointed attorneys need to remain as standby counsel.\n\nThe trial will begin nearly a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted Routh\u2019s attempt to shoot Trump as he played golf. Routh, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.\n\nng parents hoping to retrieve their children from custody\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nNeha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a \u201cbuilt-in opportunity\u201d to arrest parents while the children remain in custody \u2014 something she said has already happened.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration\u2019s struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.\n\nImmigrants are disappearing from the U.S. labor force\n\nTrump\u2019s stepped-up immigration policies have resulted in a loss of 1.2 million immigrants from the nation\u2019s labor force from January thru July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes legal residents as well as people in the country illegally.\n\nImmigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce \u2014 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry; about 30% of all construction workers, and 24% of service workers, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer.\n\nThe number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023. Now it's declining. New illegal border crossings have plunged as Trump makes good on his campaign promises.Most people detained by ICE for deportation have no criminal convictions.\n\nRead more about immigrants disappearing from the U.S. labor force",

Children are already feeling the effects of the latest chapter of Venezuela\u2019s protracted crisis. (AP Video by Juan Arraez)\nWHY THIS MATTERS: Venezuela is in a protracted crisis \u2013 the economy has been unraveling amid changes to foreign aid and cuts to state subsidies. That has made many necessities, including food, unaffordable to millions and experts say kids are suffering the most.\nCORO, Venezuela (AP) \u2014 Alnilys Chirino\u2019s tiny fridge and pantry are almost empty \u2014 a handful of peppers and wilting herbs, a kilo of rice, half that of beans, a bit of canned meat, some flour. Chirino used to worry about food spoiling quickly under western Venezuela\u2019s punishing heat. These days, her meager supplies rarely last long enough to go bad.\nStill, the 51-year-old must make those items stretch for days. Her three teenagers are counting on it. They sleep, study, work, pray, and play hungry. So do millions of Venezuelans across the country.\nThe latest unraveling of Venezuela\u2019s economy, changes to foreign aid, sanctions from the United States, and cuts to state subsidies and programs have made many necessities simply unaffordable to the 80% of residents estimated to live in poverty. Housing, medicine, utilities \u2013 but no need is as dire as food.\nIn the western state of Falcon, where state-owned oil refineries offered plenty of well-paying jobs before the country came undone in 2013, more than two dozen residents, including Chirino, described to The Associated Press how their woes center on food and how they dwell on the issue \u2014 how to buy it, how much and where \u2013 every day.\nExperts say that while a famine-level crisis is not imminent in Venezuela, the severe food insecurity is a disaster that will mark the population with lifelong physical and mental health challenges.\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2014 sworn in this year despite credible evidence he lost reelection \u2014 has created economic conditions that largely limited people\u2019s access to food nationwide, with the value of wages plummeting. Soup kitchens that fed thousands, mostly children, have been forced to close as he targets real and perceived opponents through a new law restricting the work of nongovernmental organizations.\nThe government\u2019s press office didn\u2019t respond to a message seeking comment on food insecurity amid the economic crisis.\nParents, educators, doctors, humanitarian workers and religious leaders say food is simply out of reach to many, with children suffering the most. They go to bed early to avoid hunger pangs, skip school and snatch food from each other at aid sites.\nChirino\u2019s family is among those who increasingly fear the return of the malnutrition and starvation that gripped the country from 2016 to 2018. She worries constantly for her teenagers: Juan, Jos\u00e9 and Angerlis Colina.\n\u201cThey ask me, \u2018What are we going to do tomorrow?\u2019\u201d Chirino said. \u201c\u2018What are we going to eat?\u2019\u201d\nFor the Chirinos and millions of Venezuelans, each mealtime of each day is a struggle.\nBread for breakfast, if there are no headaches\nJuan Colina takes three rolls of bread \u2014 the only food he\u2019ll have for breakfast on this summer day \u2014 and dunks them in a sugary, orange-flavored drink. It was something of a treat. Money has lost so much value in the last few months that the family typically drinks only tap water and rarely eats protein.\nThey\u2019ve grown used to it. Juan felt fortunate to wake without a headache. Jos\u00e9 wasn\u2019t so lucky and stayed in bed.\nThey often skip school when feeling this way. The law guarantees all students a daily free lunch, but that hasn\u2019t happened for ages, families and teachers across Venezuela told AP.\nAs the meals stopped and the quality of education fell, students began regularly missing school over the last decade, a trend documented by local and international nongovernmental organizations.\nHealth care experts say animal protein is the first thing families reduce or eliminate from their diet when prices increase, and they tend to substitute cheaper, less nutritious foods. But poor nutrition can lead to stunting, headaches, fatigue and other health issues in children.\nChirino knows that all too well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s their diet,\u201d she said of her kids\u2019 headaches.\nBut the last time she could afford to purchase meat \u2014 enough ground beef for perhaps two servings \u2014 was May.\nLunch for students is increasingly rare\nAt lunchtime, Jos\u00e9 stayed in his room, his head pounding. Angerlis joined her mother and Juan at the table for lunch before heading to school.\nChirino cooked a pot of rice and another of black beans, both of which her mother had gifted her the day before, when the pantry was essentially bare. Chirino, Angerlis and Juan ate a bowl each. Juan chuckled when Angerlis took bites so fast she burned her tongue.\nDays earlier, Angerlis said, a classmate who hadn\u2019t eaten fainted at school. But even knowing there would be no food on campus, she grabbed her bag and headed off.\nTeachers and administrators across the country are renewing pleas for parents to keep children home if they\u2019ve not had at least one meal and if they have no food to bring to eat during breaks. But not all abide by the request, and students cannot always hide their hunger from classmates and others.\nMaduro\u2019s government typically supplies schools with frozen whole chickens and some combination of arepa flour, rice, pasta, beans, sardines, canned lunch meat, milk powder, lentils, salt and cooking oil. But teachers, cooks and administrators say what they receive is inconsistent and insufficient.\nAnd with little to eat at home, on the occasions when the scent of food wafts through school buildings, more students are asking for seconds.\n\u201cThere are some who, my goodness, they repeat two or three times. There are kids who eat a lot,\u201d Deyanira Santos, a cook at a 170-student school that hadn\u2019t received supplies in three weeks. \u201cThey have needs at home. ... \u2018I have already eaten. Can you give me one to go?\u2019 We put it in a container.\u201d\nHungry stretches and low-quality food\nAt home, Chirino sorted through the clothing, accessories and linens she sells to neighbors and acquaintances. Her only income sources are the $70 a month she earns from her sales and a monthly government stipend of about $4. She spends it all on food.\nThe weakening of the bolivar is the driver of Venezuela\u2019s currency crisis. When a currency quickly loses significant value, people\u2019s money buys less because prices \u2014 particularly of imported goods, like roughly half of Venezuela\u2019s food \u2013 constantly rise to match the exchange rate. It also has meant high inflation and stagnant wages.\nVenezuela\u2019s monthly minimum wage of 130 bolivars, or $0.90, has not increased since 2022, putting it well below the United Nations\u2019 measure of extreme poverty of $2.15 a day. Even with government stipends, many public sector workers survive on roughly $160 per month, while the average private sector employee earns about $237, according to the independent Venezuelan Observatory of Finances.\nThe price of a basic basket of food has topped $500, according to the Observatory, an organization of economists \u2014 some of whom were detained this summer after high inflation data was published, as the government cracks down on dissent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more difficult every day for people to access food of a certain quality,\u201d said the Rev. Gilberto Garc\u00eda, whose Catholic church runs a soup kitchen. \u201cPeople eat, but they usually eat carbohydrates. And that\u2019s how people survive.\u201d\nA simple dinner is better than no dinner at all\nChirino warmed canned meat and served it with rice for dinner. Her adult daughter and toddler grandson joined them \u2014 more mouths to feed, but they were grateful to have even a small meal on the table.\nAbout a block away, people lined up outside the neighborhood convenience store.\nChirino is among the many Venezuelans who say they\u2019re buying food almost exclusively at corner stores, where they can run up an account and walk over one, two, even three times a day. City residents also buy from public markets, but grocery store trips are rare.\n\u201cWe give credit to the neighbors who do pay back when they receive their paycheck or stipend,\u201d Diego Reverol, whose family owns a corner store, said, referring to a stipend state employees receive on the 15th of the month.\nOther government stipends are available to those who sign up for the ruling party-run subsidy program, but they\u2019re significantly smaller than those of state employees. The program also offers families the option to purchase a combination of food \u2013 the same as what\u2019s distributed to schools \u2013 monthly. However, most of the two dozen people in Falcon who spoke to AP said they\u2019d not received the food since the spring.\nYamelis Ruiz said her family\u2019s challenges are compounded by the loss of critical help from the World Food Program, which distributed food, refurbished school cafeterias and served meals after reaching an agreement with Maduro\u2019s government in 2021 to support the most vulnerable. WFP prioritized Falcon, with its massive sand dunes and mountain ranges that reach the Caribbean Sea, due to the population\u2019s particular problems with food insecurity.\nBut citing funding challenges, the WFP this year has deeply cut its aid in Venezuela \u2014 Falcon included \u2014 and beyond. Ruiz said she had already stopped receiving monthly shelf-stable food rations from WFP when the organization further reduced the number of days it would feed kids and families at schools, to eight from 20.\n\u201cFood or medicines. Either I buy one thing or the other,\u201d said Ruiz, whose daughter has a congenital brain condition that requires costly treatment.\nOn weekends, there\u2019s lunch at the church soup kitchen \u2014 for now\nEven as local and international nonprofits have been forced to shut down assistance efforts in Venezuela, Chirino\u2019s church still offers a weekly lunch at its soup kitchen.\nChirino, a devout Catholic, feels blessed. She often attends Mass with her family before the meal, but on this day Juan felt too fatigued to make the service.\nThe extent of hunger across the country is somewhat unknown. Dr. Huniades Urbina, a pediatrician and former director of Venezuela\u2019s largest public children\u2019s hospital, said that\u2019s in part because government-run hospitals have banned personnel from including malnutrition in patients\u2019 medical histories.\nChirino sees that hunger every week in the faces of those lining up for food. Juan managed to get out of bed and to church just in time for this meal: an arepa stuffed with ground beef and plantains.\nMore than 70 children sat, their chatty voices dwindling as they ate. Finishing in record time, dozens swarmed the counter where the volunteer cooks were ready to hand out leftovers. Some pushed; others raised their arms or stood on their tiptoes.\n\u201cMe, me, me,\u201d some yelled, angling for a second arepa.\nOne boy hadn\u2019t bitten his yet when he noticed an empty-handed friend. Without hesitation, he split it in half. The boys shared, each done eating in less than a minute, and left.\nChirino had refused to take an arepa. She didn\u2019t want to keep one from a hungry kid. But when most of the children were gone, a cook handed her one. She began eating alone, and soon Jos\u00e9 joined her. He reached for her plate, grabbing half the arepa and taking a few bites.\nHer son, too, was still hungry.\n-"

      "text": "Chicago is in the Trump administration\u2019s sights for its next immigration crackdown\nChicago is in the Trump administration\u2019s sights for its next immigration crackdown\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s administration plans to surge officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown in its latest move to expand the federal law enforcement presence in major Democratic-run cities, according to two U.S. officials.\nThe operation in the country\u2019s third-largest city is expected to last about 30 days and could start as early as Sept. 5, a Department of Homeland Security official told The Associated Press on Friday. Another U.S. official said the timing for what could be a sustained immigration enforcement effort resembling this summer\u2019s operations in Los Angeles is awaiting final approval.\nBoth officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.\nChicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country\u2019s strongest rules against cooperating with federal government immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and the state at odds with Trump\u2019s administration as it tries to carry out his mass deportation agenda.\nThe Trump administration asked the military this week for use of the Naval Station Great Lakes, north of Chicago, to support immigration enforcement.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and other federal agencies would take part in the planned Chicago operation, according to the federal officials who spoke to The Associated Press. Unlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, it is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration instead of being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime.\nThe Republican administration is likely to face resistance to any operation from the region\u2019s top Democratic officials, as it has in California from Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, like Newsom, has been trading barbs with Trump and his allies.\nPritzker said this week that Chicago doesn\u2019t want military intervention to fight crime. On Friday, the Democrat noted that ICE is a civilian law enforcement agency and can legally operate in the city, \u201cbut we don\u2019t appreciate when they mistreat our residents, many of whom have been here for decades.\u201d\n\u201cWe now have a president and a federal government that\u2019s going after them, hunting people down and disappearing them off the streets,\u201d Pritzker said after a school visit in the city\u2019s south suburbs. \u201cMen with masks are grabbing people off the streets and taking them away. That\u2019s just shameful.\u201d\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson called the development \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d The city has developed and is distributing a \u201cFamily Preparedness Campaign\u201d to help families \u201cplan for potential separation\u201d with guidance for talking to family members, gathering critical documents, attending planned workshops and seeking help from Congress, consulates and immigrant advocacy groups.\n\u201cWe reject any attempts to put Chicagoans in danger as a means of furthering the president\u2019s political ends...,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cSending in militarized immigration enforcement will only cause chaos and fear in our communities.\u201d\nIf ICE comes, all city departments will be prepared to \u201censure that Chicagoans know their rights,\u201d Johnson said.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said this week that it has made 5,000 immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area since launching a sustained crackdown in the nation\u2019s second-largest metropolitan area on June 6. Authorities are undeterred by a temporary court order prohibiting racial profiling in Los Angeles, which the administration has challenged before the Supreme Court.\n\u201cMake no mistake: If you are here illegally, we will find you, arrest you and send you back. This is just the beginning,\u201d Secretary Kristi Noem said when announcing the arrest milestone in Los Angeles.\nThe Los Angeles operation has been marked by large, lightning-quick shows of force by heavily armed, masked agents in unmarked cars and civilian dress, often at Home Depots and car washes. The Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles said this week that 15% of Mexican citizens arrested so far work in construction, followed by car washes at 13%, based on hundreds of interviews it has conducted.\n___\nSpagat reported from San Diego.

Some Republicans are worried\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 \u201cMass Deportation Now!\u201d declared the signs at the Republican National Convention, giving a full embrace to Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to expel millions of migrants in the largest deportation program in American history.\nSome Republicans aren\u2019t quite ready for that.\nLauren B. Pe\u00f1a, a Republican activist from Texas, said that hearing Trump\u2019s calls for mass deportations, as well as terms like \u201cillegals\u201d and \u201cinvasion\u201d thrown around at the convention, made her feel uncomfortable. Like some Republicans in Congress who have advanced balanced approaches to immigration, she hopes Trump is just blustering.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not meaning to go and deport every family that crosses the border, he means deport the criminals and the sex offenders,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said.\nBut Trump and his advisers have other plans. He is putting immigration at the heart of his campaign to retake the White House and pushing the Republican Party towards a bellicose strategy that hearkens back to the 1950s when former President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched a deportation policy known by a racial slur \u2014 \u201cOperation Wetback.\u201d\nTrump, when pressed for specifics on his plan in an interview with Time Magazine this year, suggested he would use the National Guard, and possibly even the military, to target between 15 million and 20 million people \u2014 though the government estimated in 2022 there were 11 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal permission.\nHis plans have raised the stakes of this year\u2019s election beyond fortifying the southern border, a longtime conservative priority, to the question of whether America should make a fundamental change in its approach to immigration.\nAfter the southern border saw a historic number of crossings during the Biden administration, Democrats have also moved rightward on the issue, often leading with promises of border security before talking about relief for the immigrants who are already in the country.\nAnd as the November election approaches, both parties are trying to reach voters like Pe\u00f1a, 33. Latino voters could be pivotal in many swing states.\nTrump won 35% of Hispanic voters in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, and support for stronger border enforcement measures has grown among Hispanic voters. But an AP analysis of two consecutive polls conducted in June by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that about half of Hispanic Americans have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Trump.\nStill, Pe\u00f1a, who described herself as a multiracial Hispanic person, has become a new and enthusiastic recruit for the GOP. She was drawn to Trump after seeing people debilitated by drugs in the public housing complex where she lives in Austin. She feels that government programs have failed low-income people and that the recent migration surge has put a pinch on public assistance like food stamps.\nBut Pe\u00f1a said she also feels concern when her fellow Republicans discuss ideas like barring children who don\u2019t have permanent legal status from public schooling.\n\u201cBeing Hispanic, it\u2019s a difficult topic,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like we need to give these people a chance.\u201d\nWhat to know about the 2024 election:\n- Turning promises into policy: Americans frustrated over high prices await the change Trump has promised. Proponents of school choice will have an ally in the White House once again, but private schooling suffered high-profile defeats in several states.\n- Balance of power: Republicans won control of the U.S. Senate, giving the GOP a major power center in Washington. Control over the House of Representatives is still up for grabs.\n- AP VoteCast: Democracy was a motivating factor for both Harris and Trump voters, but for very different reasons.\n- Voto a voto: Sigue la cobertura de AP en espa\u00f1ol de las elecciones en EEUU.\nNews outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results. Since 1848, the AP has been calling races up and down the ballot. Support us. Donate to the AP.\nStill, GOP lawmakers have largely embraced Trump\u2019s plans. \u201cIt\u2019s needed,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at a July interview at the conservative Hudson Institute.\nSome, however, have shown tacit skepticism by suggesting more modest goals.\nSen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, pointed to over 1 million people who have already received a final order of removal from an immigration judge and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between those that are in the process right now and those that are finished with the process.\u201d\nLankford, who negotiated a bipartisan border package that Trump helped defeat earlier this year, added that it would be a \u201chuge\u201d task both logistically and financially just to target that group.\nOther Republicans, including Floridians Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Diaz Balart, suggested Trump in the White House would prioritize migrants with criminal backgrounds.\nIndeed, Trump entered office in 2016 with similar promises of mass deportation but only succeeded in deporting about 1.5 million people.\nThis time, though, there\u2019s a plan.\nTrump has worked closely with Stephen Miller, a former top aide who is expected to take a senior role in the White House if Trump wins. Miller describes a Trump administration that will work with \u201cutter determination\u201d to accomplish two goals: \u201cSeal the border. Deport all the illegals.\u201d\nTo accomplish that, Trump would revive travel bans from countries deemed undesirable, such as majority-Muslim countries. He would launch a sweeping operation by deputizing the National Guard to round up immigrants, hold them in massive camps and put them on deportation flights before they could make legal appeals.\nBeyond that, Trump has also pledged to end birthright citizenship \u2014 a 125-year-old right in the U.S. And several of his top advisers have laid out a sweeping policy vision through the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 that would choke off other forms of legal migration.\nThe Trump administration, under those plans, could also grind to a halt temporary programs for over 1 million migrants, including recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Ukrainians and Afghans who fled recent conflicts as well as others who receive temporary protection due to unrest in their home country.\nThe policies would have far-reaching disruptions in major industries like housing and agriculture, including in key battleground states.\n\u201cIf the 75,000-plus immigrants who perform the hardest of work in Wisconsin\u2019s dairy and agriculture were gone tomorrow, the state economy would tank,\u201d said Jorge Franco, the CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Wisconsin.\nRep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Florida Republican who has pushed legislation that would allow a path to citizenship for longtime residents, argued that large-scale deportations were now necessary because of recent surges in border crossings under President Joe Biden. But she also hoped that Trump could see the difference between recent arrivals and longtime residents.\n\u201cThere is a group of congresspeople that will make sure that the new administration understands it because there\u2019s another aspect: the business community,\u201d she said. \u201cThe developers in construction \u2026 and the farmers, what are they going to say? They need hands.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Democrats feel that Trump\u2019s threats are now motivating Latino voters.\n\u201cThe mass deportation put a lot of people on high alert,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Teresa Kumar, the CEO of Voto Latino, a leading voter registration organization that is backing Democrat Kamala Harris.\nLike many other groups aligned with Harris, Voto Latino has seen an outpouring of interest since she rose to the top of the Democratic ticket. Kumar said the organization has registered nearly 36,000 voters in the weeks since Biden left the race \u2014 almost matching its tally from the first six months of the year.\nIn a heavily Latino House district on the southern tip of Texas, Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez said voters want to see better management of the border, but at the same time, many also have friends or family members who don\u2019t have their immigration documentation in order.\n\u201cMuch more could be done, in terms of good policy, that would help control surges at the border,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cBut mass deportation, it just gives people heartburn.\u201d"

      "text": "Costco is seeing a gold rush. What\u2019s behind the demand for its 1-ounce gold bars?\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Looking for something to add to your Costco cart along with the 30 rolls of toilet paper? How about a bar of gold?\nWhile not a typical outlet for the sale of precious metals, the members-only warehouse chain has seen its 1-ounce gold bars sell out faster than discounted 170-ounce jugs of laundry detergent.\nIn a company earnings call last week, CFO Richard Galanti said the gold bars, sold exclusively online, are \u201ctypically gone within a few hours\u201d of appearing on Costco\u2019s website \u2014 adding that there\u2019s a two-bar limit per member. As of Wednesday, they remained sold out.\nUnlike some other discount finds at the retail giant, gold bars come with hefty price tag. No prices were listed Wednesday because of the bars\u2019 unavailability, but multiple media outlets reported last week that the 1-ounce gold pieces \u2014 offered in two designs \u2014 were selling for just below $2,000 each.\nThat\u2019s slightly higher than the current market price of gold, which stood at about $1,835 per ounce Wednesday afternoon.\nCostco did not specify how many gold bars have been sold recently, or how often it restocks them. The chain based in Issaquah, Washington, did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment Wednesday.\nChances are, interest around Costco\u2019s gold bars isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. Although one or two ounces of gold won\u2019t have a huge impact on diversifying one\u2019s investment portfolio, experts note that there\u2019s been increasing investor demand for precious metals in recent years, and that\u2019s likely to continue.\nStill, it\u2019s important to pause and evaluate investment prospects. Here\u2019s what some experts say.\nWhat\u2019s behind the demand for gold?\nInterest in buying gold often stems from feelings of uncertainty, experts say.\nJonathan Rose, CEO of precious metal broker Genesis Gold Group, says that recent bank failures, inflation and individuals\u2019 concerns about the U.S. dollar, for example, can cause some to start looking for alternative places to park their money.\n\u201cIf someone\u2019s going out to buy gold, that means they think that there\u2019s some type of instability at the structural level of the market and/or the government itself,\u201d added David Wagner III, head of markets and equities at Aptus Capital Advisors.\nIs gold worth the investment?\nRose and others say gold can diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate potential risks down the road.\n\u201cPeople are looking for a safe haven ... to protect their wealth. And gold kind of ticks all those boxes,\u201d Rose said. He added that people may see value in having something tangible \u2014 and put precious metals \u201cin a safety deposit box or into a retirement plan, even like an IRA or 401k ... to safeguard what they have whilst they see what\u2019s happening in the market.\u201d\nBut not everyone agrees. Wagner says gold is \u201cone of the worst things that you can ever own.\u201d Among the downsides, he argues, is that gold isn\u2019t the inflationary hedge many say it is, with inflation at times outpacing gold in recent decades, and that \u201cthere are more efficient ways to protect against the loss of capital,\u201d such as through derivative-based investments.\nThe Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \u201cwhen economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.\u201d\nIf you do choose to invest in gold, the commission and others add, it\u2019s important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.\nGold for December delivery fell $6.70 to $1,834.80 an ounce by market close Wednesday. For other precious metals, silver for December delivery fell 23 cents to $21.15 an ounce and December copper fell 3 cents to $3.59 a pound."

      "text": "Sen. Lindsey Graham says Trump ready to \u2018crush\u2019 Russian economy if Putin avoids talks with Zelenskyy\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that he believes President Donald Trump is prepared to \u201ccrush\u201d Russia\u2019s economy with a new wave of sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin refuses to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the coming weeks.\nGraham, who spoke with Trump on Tuesday morning, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it. Republican leaders have said they won\u2019t move without him.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,\u201d Graham said in a phone interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday. The Senate, now away from Washington for the August recess, is scheduled to return in September.\nGraham\u2019s call with Trump came less than 24 hours after high-stakes meetings at the White House with Zelenskyy and several European leaders. Trump and the leaders emerged from those talks sounding optimistic, with the expectation being that a Putin and Zelenskyy sit-down will happen soon.\nStill, Trump\u2019s comments to Graham, one of his top congressional allies, mark the latest sign that pressure is building \u2014 not just on Putin, but on Trump as well.\n\u201cTrump believes that if Putin doesn\u2019t do his part, that he\u2019s going to have to crush his economy. Because you\u2019ve got to mean what you say,\u201d Graham told reporters in South Carolina on Tuesday.\nAs Congress prepares to return to session in early September, the next few weeks could become a defining test of whether lawmakers and international allies are prepared to act on their own if Trump doesn\u2019t follow through.\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the lead Democrat pushing the bill with Graham, says there is a \u201clot of reason for skepticism and doubt\u201d after the meetings with Trump, especially because Putin has not made any direct promises. He said the Russian leader has an incentive to play \u201crope-a-dope\u201d with Trump.\n\u201cThe only way to bring Putin to the table is to show strength,\u201d Blumenthal told the AP this week. \u201cWhat Putin understands is force and pressure.\u201d\nStill, Republicans have shown little willingness to override Trump in his second term. They abruptly halted work on the sanctions bill before the August recess after Trump said the legislation may not be needed.\nAsked Tuesday in a phone interview whether the sanctions bill should be brought up even without Trump\u2019s support, Graham said, \u201cthe best way to do it is with him.\u201d\n\u201cThere will come a point where if it\u2019s clear that Putin is not going to entertain peace, that President Trump will have to back up what he said he would do,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd the best way to do it is have congressional blessing.\u201d\nThe legislation would impose tariffs of up to 500% on countries such as China and India, which together account for roughly 70% of Russia\u2019s energy trade. The framework has the support of many European leaders.\nMany of those same European leaders left the White House on Monday with a more hopeful tone. Zelenskyy called the meeting with Trump \u201can important step toward ending this war.\u201d German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that his expectations \u201cwere not just met, they were exceeded.\u201d\nStill, little concrete progress was visible on the main obstacles to peace. That deadlock likely favors Putin, whose forces continue to make steady, if slow, progress on the ground in Ukraine.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told reporters after talks at the White House that Trump believes a deal with Putin is possible. But he said sanctions remain on the table if the process fails.\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Meg Kinnard contributed to this report from Florence, South Carolina."

      "text": "After more than 50 years of rapid growth, the nation\u2019s immigrant population is now in decline.\nIn January 2025, 53.3 million immigrants lived in the United States \u2013 the largest number ever recorded. In the ensuing months, however, more immigrants left the country or were deported than arrived. By June, the country\u2019s foreign-born population had shrunk by more than a million people, marking its first decline since the 1960s.\nA new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data finds that, as of June 2025:\n- 51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S.\n- 15.4% of all U.S. residents were immigrants, down from a recent historic high of 15.8%.\n- 19% of the U.S. labor force were immigrants, down from 20% and by over 750,000 workers since January.\nStarting in mid-2024, several policy changes have affected the U.S. immigrant population:\n- In June 2024, President Joe Biden announced new restrictions on asylum applications, leading to a sharp decline in border encounters with immigrants seeking asylum protections.\n- In his first 100 days since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump took 181 executive actions on immigration to curtail the arrival of new immigrants and deport noncitizen immigrants. The full effects of these policies remain to be seen, but already they are contributing to a declining immigrant population \u2013 especially the unauthorized immigrant population.\nPew Research Center regularly publishes research on the U.S. immigrant population and international migration trends. Here are answers to some key questions about U.S. immigrants, based on the most recent detailed data available. (In some cases, this data is from mid-2023.)\n- How many people in the U.S. are immigrants?\n- Where are U.S. immigrants from?\n- How have immigrants\u2019 origins changed in recent years?\n- How have immigration flows changed over the longer term?\n- What is the legal status of immigrants in the U.S.?\n- Who are unauthorized immigrants?\n- Do all lawful immigrants choose to become U.S. citizens?\n- How many immigrants are working in the U.S.?\n- Where do most U.S. immigrants live?\n- How educated are immigrants?\n- How well do immigrants speak English?\nHow many people in the U.S. are immigrants?\nAs of June 2025, 51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S., making up 15.4% of the nation\u2019s population. This was down from January, when there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the U.S., accounting for 15.8% of the country\u2019s population \u2013 the highest percentage on record.\nEven as the nation\u2019s immigrant population has declined in recent months \u2013 a change that may be partly artificial due to a declining survey response rate among immigrants \u2013 the U.S. is home to more immigrants than any other country.\nAs of 2024, the second-largest immigrant population is in Germany, numbering around 17 million, according to the latest estimates from the United Nations.\nWhile the U.S. is home to the largest number of immigrants, dozens of countries (including Germany) have a higher proportion of immigrants in their populations than the U.S. does. In neighboring Canada, for example, immigrants account for 22% of the population. And in the United Arab Emirates, about three-quarters of all residents were born elsewhere.\nWhere are U.S. immigrants from?\nAs of mid-2023 \u2013 the latest year for which detailed data is available \u2013 more than 11 million U.S. residents were born in Mexico, representing 22% of all immigrants nationally. The second-largest immigrant group was from India (3.2 million, or 6%), followed by China (3 million, or 6%), the Philippines (2.1 million, or 4%) and Cuba (1.7 million, or 3%).\nAbout half of all U.S. immigrants (52%, or 26.7 million people) were born in Latin America. In addition to the millions of migrants from Mexico and Cuba, more than a million hail from El Salvador (1.6 million), Guatemala (1.4 million), the Dominican Republic (1.4 million), Colombia (1.2 million), Honduras (1.1 million) and Venezuela (1.1 million).\nAfter Latin America, Asia is the second-largest region of birth for U.S. immigrants. In 2023, around a quarter of all immigrants (27%, or nearly 14 million people) were born in Asia.\nAs of 2023, there were about 11 million immigrants from every other world region combined, accounting for 22% of the U.S. foreign-born population: 10% were born in Europe, 5% in sub-Saharan Africa, 4% in the Middle East-North Africa region, and 2% in Canada or another North American country (a category that includes Bermuda and some smaller countries).\nHow have immigrants\u2019 origins changed in recent years?\nAn unprecedented number of immigrants \u2013 more than 11 million \u2013 arrived in the U.S. between 2020 and 2025. That included more than 3 million in 2023 alone, the largest annual total ever recorded, according to a Center analysis of government data sources.\nAlongside this increase, immigrants\u2019 origin regions have also shifted, with a growing share coming from South America and Europe and a declining share coming from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\nBetween 2021 and 2023, 20% of newly arrived immigrants were from South America, up from 13% in the period between 2015 and 2019. Another 12% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from Europe or Canada, up from 9% in the earlier period.\nAt the same time, 24% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from South and East Asia, down from 29% in 2015-19. And 5% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 involved people from sub-Saharan Africa, down from 8% in 2015-19.\nMexico was the largest origin country for immigrants who arrived between 2021 and 2023. About 11% of immigrants who came to the U.S. during this period were born in Mexico. Rounding out the top five countries of origin for immigrants who arrived during this period were India (8%), Venezuela (7%), Cuba (6%) and Colombia (5%).\nThroughout this period, unauthorized immigrants accounted for most new immigrant arrivals, with many coming from Central and South America.\nHow have immigration flows changed over the longer term?\nSince 1965, more than 76 million immigrants have come to the U.S.\nBefore then, U.S. immigration law favored immigrants from Northern and Western Europe and mostly barred immigration from Asia. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration from Asia and Latin America. The Immigration Act of 1990 further increased legal immigration and allowed immigrants from more countries to enter the U.S. legally.\nImmigration flows after 1965 have been larger and come from different and more countries than earlier flows:\n- From 1840 to 1889, about 90% of U.S. immigrants came from Europe, including about 70% from Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n- Almost 90% of the immigrants who arrived from 1890 to 1919 also came from Europe. But their origins were largely different as nearly 60% came from Italy, Austria-Hungary and Russia-Poland.\n- Since 1965, about half of U.S. immigrants have come from Latin America, with about a quarter from Mexico alone. About another quarter have come from Asia. Large numbers have come from China, India and the Philippines.\nToday, Mexico remains the largest origin country among U.S. immigrants. However, immigration from Mexico has slowed since 2007, and the Mexican-born population in the U.S. has since dropped. The Mexican share of the U.S. immigrant population declined from 29% in 2010 to 22% in 2023.\nWhat is the legal status of immigrants in the U.S.?\nAs of 2023, 46% of immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens. Nearly a quarter (23%) were lawful permanent residents, often referred to as \u201cgreen card holders,\u201d and another 4% were lawful temporary residents who were permitted to stay in the U.S. for a limited period of time, usually for work or study. The remaining immigrants in the U.S. fell into the \u201cunauthorized\u201d category and constituted 27% of all U.S. immigrants.\nRelated: U.S. Unauthorized Immigrant Population Reached a Record\n14 Million in 2023\nWho are unauthorized immigrants?\nUnauthorized immigrants are those without full legal status. As of 2023, this population hit a new record high of 14 million. Within this group, about 6 million (or a little more than 40%) had some form of temporary protection from deportation, with some also having a permit to work in the U.S.\nAmong the unauthorized immigrants with some deportation protections were 2.6 million asylum applicants; 700,000 people who entered the U.S. legally after receiving parole; 700,000 victims of crime and violence; 650,000 people with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a program available to immigrants from countries facing war, natural disasters and other crises; and 600,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\nAnother 1 million migrants encountered U.S. Border Patrol before being released into the U.S., typically with an order to appear in immigration court. These immigrants have had more limited protections from deportation while their cases are being resolved.\nImmigrants in these groups are included as part of the \u201cunauthorized\u201d population because their deportation protections are temporary and can quickly change. For example, the Trump administration has rescinded deportation protections and work permits for about 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who entered the U.S. legally.\nThe remaining unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. as of 2023 (about 8 million) had neither legal status nor temporary protection from deportation.\nThis year, policy and enforcement changes likely contributed to a decline in the unauthorized immigrant population between January and June. Border crossings have fallen further, reaching lows not seen since the 1960s. Immigration arrests and deportations have increased. And a growing number of immigrants have lost deportation protections, with some likely leaving the country voluntarily.\nDo all lawful immigrants choose to become U.S. citizens?\nImmigrants who are lawful permanent residents and meet other requirements can apply to become U.S. citizens through the naturalization process. During the 2024 fiscal year, 818,500 immigrants became U.S. citizens through naturalization.\nMillions of lawful permanent residents are currently eligible to become U.S. citizens but have not applied for naturalization.\nHow many immigrants are working in the U.S.?\nBetween January and June 2025, the number of immigrants living and working in the U.S. declined. But recent figures by legal status are not yet available.\nIn 2023, the most recent year with complete data, 33 million immigrants were in the U.S. workforce, including about 23 million lawful immigrants and 10 million unauthorized immigrants.\nNearly one-in-five workers (19%) were immigrants in 2023, up from 15% two decades earlier. This share increased steadily since at least 1995, when they made up 12% of the labor force.\nAbout 2% of adult immigrants, including noncitizens, are currently serving in the military or served in the past.\nWhere do most U.S. immigrants live?\nIn 2023, most of the nation\u2019s 51.8 million immigrants lived in just four states. California was home to 11.3 million immigrants, or 28.4% of the national total. Texas had the second-largest immigrant population with over 6 million foreign-born residents, followed by Florida (5.4 million) and New York (5.0 million).\nA majority of immigrants lived in only 12 metropolitan areas. The New York City metropolitan area was home to the largest population, accounting for 13% of all immigrants. The Los Angeles and Miami metro areas also had particularly large immigrant populations, with 9% and 6% of all U.S. immigrants, respectively.\nHow educated are immigrants?\nOverall, immigrants in the U.S. had lower levels of educational attainment than their U.S.-born counterparts in 2023.\n- 24% of immigrant adults ages 25 and older had not completed high school, compared with 7% of the U.S.-born population.\n- However, immigrants were as likely as the U.S. born to have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher (36% each).\nEducational attainment among immigrants varies widely based on their region of origin:\n- Only 11% of Central American immigrants hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. By comparison, 36% of U.S.-born adults have this level of education.\n- Immigrants from Asia, Europe, the Middle East-North Africa region, sub-Saharan Africa and other North American countries are more likely than the U.S. born to have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nHow well do immigrants speak English?\nAbout half of immigrants ages 5 and older (52%) are proficient English speakers, meaning they either speak English very well or speak only English at home.\nAgain, there is a wide range of English proficiency depending on where immigrants were born:\n- The overwhelming majority of immigrants from elsewhere in North America (97%) or from Oceania (83%) \u2013 primarily Australia and New Zealand \u2013 are proficient English speakers.\n- Large shares of immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa (75%), South Asia (72%) and Europe (72%) also are English proficient.\n- On the opposite end of the spectrum, only about one-in-three immigrants who were born in Central America (31%) are proficient in English.\nEnglish proficiency is more common among immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before 2000 than among those who entered the country later. Some 57% of immigrants who came to the U.S. before 2000 are proficient English speakers, compared with 47% who arrived in 2010 or later.\nNote: This is an update of an analysis originally published May 3, 2017."

Colorado Springs, which is housing Space Command\u2019s temporary headquarters, was the Air Force\u2019s preferred location, but Donald Trump, in the final days of his presidency, selected Alabama instead.\nWhile the Pentagon and White House have said the decisions are not directly linked, Alabama has strict anti-abortion laws, and its Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville earlier this year announced he would hold up all military nominations until the Department of Defense rescinds a new policy that would allow female service members to be reimbursed for travel costs if they have to go out of state for reproductive care.\nTuberville\u2019s office was not immediately available for comment Wednesday evening.\nThe Space Force announcement came as President Joe Biden left for Colorado Springs to speak during Thursday\u2019s commencement ceremony at the nearby U.S. Air Force Academy.\nColorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet said he\u2019ll be using the president\u2019s visit as another opportunity to press for the command.\n\u201cAs President Biden and his administration near a final basing decision for Space Command, we urge them to restore the integrity of this process and make a decision in the interest of our national security \u2014 to keep Space Command in Colorado Springs,\u201d his office said in a statement.\nMeanwhile, the Air Force has been moving forward with getting fully dug in at Colorado Springs, where more than 20 of the military\u2019s space missions are now based. The Air Force Academy now has a space curriculum and graduates Space Force Guardians alongside its Air Force cadets.\n\u201cColorado Springs continues to prove itself as the premier location for our nation\u2019s space defense operations,\u201d Colorado Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn said in a statement announcing the selection.\nThe Space Force, founded in December 2019, is the smallest of the military branches, with just under 8,400 personnel. But it has seen its budget rapidly rise as the U.S. has scrambled to defend against a rapid militarization of space, such as North Korea\u2019s failed Wednesday launch of a ballistic missile believed to be carrying a spy satellite.\nThe four new missions in Colorado Springs include Delta 15, a headquarters unit for the service\u2019s space operations command; Space Delta 12, a test and evaluation unit; and two surveillance squadrons.\nOther locations announced Wednesday as new permanent homes for Space Force missions are in Florida and New Mexico."

      "text": "US Space Command site to be located in Huntsville, Alabama\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Air Force announced Wednesday that the new U.S. Space Command headquarters will be in Huntsville, Alabama, after the state was selected over five others competing for the project, including Colorado, where Space Command is provisionally located.\nThe role of Space Command is to conduct operations such as enabling satellite-based navigation and troop communication and providing warning of missile launches. That is different from the Space Force, which is a distinct military service like the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more pleased to learn that Alabama will be the new home to the United States Space Command,\u201d Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement.\n\u201cOur state has long provided exceptional support for our military and their families as well as a rich and storied history when it comes to space exploration,\u201d she said.\nHuntsville\u2019s nickname, Rocket City, is thanks largely to Wernher von Braun and his team of fellow German-born rocketeers who settled there in the 1950s. The city has long been home to the Army\u2019s Redstone Arsenal and NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center.\nAir Force Secretary Barbara Barrett, an appointee of President Donald Trump, announced the decision days before leaving office.\nColorado officials lambasted the move, saying military officials had recommended to Trump that Space Command remain at the Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, but they were \u201coverruled for politically motivated reasons.\u201d They did not say what those alleged political reasons were. Trump won Alabama in the November election and President-elect Joe Biden won Colorado.\n\u201cThis move threatens jobs, could cause serious economic damage, and upend the lives of hundreds of military and civilian families that were counting on U.S Space Command staying at home in Colorado Springs as well as harm military readiness,\u201d Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Lt. Gov. Dianne Primavera said in a statement.\nIn a letter, U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn of Colorado urged Biden to reverse the decision upon taking office, saying moving Space Command from Colorado would \u201cdamage America\u2019s national security\u201d at a time when Russia and China are actively competing with the U.S.'s space capabilities.\nU.S. Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama said Barrett told him the decision was based \u201csolely on merit and the interests of national security.\u201d Brooks suggested politics will be at play if the site gets moved back to Colorado under the new administration.\n\u201cPartisan politics should not play a role in national security. Time will tell what happens in a red state when the federal government is totally dominated by Democrats,\u201d the Republican congressman said.\nThe Secretary of the Air Force said Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville had been selected for the new headquarters. The city was chosen after site visits to six states that compared factors such as infrastructure capacity, community support and costs to the Department of Defense. Redstone Arsenal offered a facility to support the headquarters, at no cost, while the permanent facility is being constructed.\nThe Department of the Air Force said the decision to move to Huntsville will become final pending the results from the required environmental impact analysis. That is expected in the spring of 2023. The headquarters will remain in Colorado until then.\nOther finalists for the site were Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, Port San Antonio in Texas and Patrick Air Force Base in Brevard County, Florida. Those site will remain alternative locations until the final announcement.\nTrump in 2019 authorized the creation of the U.S. Space Command to preserve American dominance on what he called \u201cthe ultimate high ground.\u201d\nHuntsville Mayor Tommy Battle said the city is honored to have been selected.\nIvey in a tweet thanked U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby, former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones and local officials for advocating for the site to be in Alabama."

Follow the latest here.\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump was the target of what the FBI said \u201cappears to be an attempted assassination\u201d at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday, just nine weeks after the Republican presidential nominee survived another attempt on his life. The former president said he was safe and well, and authorities held a man in custody.\nU.S. Secret Service agents stationed a few holes up from where Trump was playing noticed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle sticking through the shrubbery that lines the course, roughly 400 yards away.\nAn agent fired and the gunman dropped the rifle and fled in an SUV, leaving the firearm behind along with two backpacks, a scope used for aiming and a GoPro camera, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said. The man was later stopped by law enforcement in a neighboring county.\nAP AUDIO: AP Correspondent Julie Walker reports Trump was the subject of an apparent assassination attempt at his Florida golf club, the FBI says.\nIt was the latest jarring moment in a campaign year marked by unprecedented upheaval. On July 13, Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and a bullet grazed his ear. Eight days later, Democratic President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, giving way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the party\u2019s nominee.\nAnd it spawned new questions about Secret Service protective operations after the agency\u2019s admitted failures in preventing the assassination attempt this summer.\nThe man who was detained had a calm, flat demeanor and showed little emotion when he was stopped, according Martin County Sheriff William Snyder.\n\u201cHe never asked, \u2018What is this about?\u2019 Obviously, law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, a lot going on. He never questioned it,\u201d Snyder said.\nIn an email to supporters, Trump said: \u201cThere were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!\u201d He wrote: \u201cNothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!\u201d\nHe returned to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach where he lives, according to a person familiar with Trump\u2019s movements who was not authorized to discuss them publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIt was not immediately clear how the development would affect his schedule or campaign dynamics. Trump was set to speak from Florida about cryptocurrency live on Monday night on the social media site X and had stops planned Tuesday and Wednesday in Michigan and on New York\u2019s Long Island.\nAn email to Trump campaign staffers obtained by AP said, \u201cWe ask that you remain vigilant in your daily comings and goings.\u201d\n\u201cAs we enter the last 50 days of President Trump\u2019s campaign, we must remember that we will only be able save America from those who seek to destroy it by working together as one team.\u201d\nBiden and Harris were briefed on the matter and each issued a statement condemning political violence. Harris\u2019 added that she was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the day\u2019s events and that \u201cwe all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence.\u201d\nBiden said he had directed his team to ensure the Secret Service \u201chas every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President\u2019s continued safety.\u201d\nIn the aftermath, Trump checked in with allies, including running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and several Fox News hosts. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he spent several hours with Trump and called him \u201cunstoppable.\u201d\nFox News host Sean Hannity recounted on air his conversation with the former president\u2019s golf partner, Steve Witkoff.\nThey had been on the fifth hole and about to go up to putt when they heard a \u201cpop pop, pop pop.\u201d Within seconds, he said Witkoff recounted, Secret Service agents \u201cpounced\u201d on Trump and \u201ccovered him\u201d to protect him.\nTrump had returned to Florida this weekend from a West Coast swing that included a Friday night rally in Las Vegas and a Utah fundraiser. His campaign had not announced any public plans for Trump on Sunday. He often spends the morning playing golf.\nTrump has had a stepped-up security footprint since the assassination attempt in July. When he is at Trump Tower in New York, parked dump trucks have formed a wall outside the building. At outdoor rallies, he now speaks from behind bulletproof glass.\nThe Florida golf course was partially shut down for Trump as he played, but there are several areas around the perimeter of the property where golfers are visible from the fence line. Secret Service agents and officers in golf carts and on ATVs generally secure the area several holes ahead and behind Trump. Agents also usually bring an armored vehicle onto the course to shelter Trump quickly should a threat arise.\nThe Palm Beach County sheriff said the entire golf course would have been lined with law enforcement if Trump were the president, but because he is not, \u201csecurity is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.\u201d\n\u201cI would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there will probably be a little more people around the perimeter,\u201d Bradshaw said. \u201cBut the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done.\u201d\nLate Sunday, Trump posted a message on social media thanking the Secret Service and law enforcement for keeping him safe, calling them \u201cbrave and dedicated Patriots,\u201d adding that it was \u201ccertainly an interesting day!\u201d\nHe was to be briefed in person Monday by acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe about the investigation into the assassination attempt, according to a person familiar with the plan for the briefing who was not authorized to speak publicly.\nFormer presidents and their spouses have Secret Service protection for life, but the security around former presidents varies according to threat levels and exposure, with the toughest measures typically being taken in the immediate aftermath of their leaving office.\nTrump\u2019s protective detail has been higher than some other former presidents because of his high visibility and his campaign to seek the White House again.\nThe man in custody was Ryan Routh, three law enforcement officials told the AP. The officials who identified the suspect spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation.\nRecords show Routh, 58, lived in North Carolina for most of his life before moving to Hawaii in 2018. In 2020, he made a social media post backing Trump\u2019s reelection, but in more recent years his posts have expressed support for Biden and Harris.\nRouth tried to recruit Afghan soldiers fleeing the Taliban to fight in Ukraine, and spent several months in the country, according to an interview with The New York Times last year.\nThe FBI was leading the investigation and working to determine any motive. Attorney General Merrick Garland was receiving regular updates. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were helping investigate.\n\u201cThe FBI has responded to West Palm Beach Florida and is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump,\u201d the bureau said.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, said the state would do its own investigation, posting on X that, \u201cThe people deserve the truth about the would be assassin and how he was able to get within 500 yards of the former president and current GOP nominee.\u201d\nNews reporters were not with Trump on Sunday. Bucking tradition, Trump\u2019s campaign has not arranged to have a protective pool of reporters travel with him, as is standard for major party nominees and for the president. Harris does not have a protective pool at all times, but does allow reporters to travel with her for public events.\nSnyder, the Martin County sheriff, said the suspect was apprehended within minutes of the FBI, Secret Service and Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office putting out a \u201cvery urgent BOLO\u201d \u2014 or \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d alert.\nSnyder said his deputies \u201cimmediately flooded\u201d northbound I-95 and \u201cwe pinched in on the car, got it safely stopped and got the driver in custody.\u201d\n___\nRicher, Long, Tucker and Miller reported from Washington.

      "text": "Trump says he wants to deport \u2018the worst of the worst.\u2019 Government data tells another story\nPresident Donald Trump has pledged to deport \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d He frequently speaks at public appearances about the countless \u201cdangerous criminals\u201d \u2014 among them murderers, rapists and child predators \u2014 from around the world he says entered the U.S. illegally under the Biden administration. He promises to expel millions of migrants in the largest deportation program in American history to protect law-abiding citizens from the violent threats he says they pose.\nBut government data around ongoing detentions tells a different story.\nThere has been an increase of arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Trump began his second term, with reports of raids across the country. Yet the majority of people currently detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. Of those who do, relatively few have been convicted of high-level crimes \u2014 a stark contrast to the chilling nightmare Trump describes to support his border security agenda.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deep disconnect between the rhetoric and the reality,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School\u2019s Center for Immigration Law and Policy. \u201cThis administration, and also in the prior Trump administration, they consistently claim to be going after the worst of the worst and just talk about immigration enforcement as though it is all about going after violent, dangerous people with extensive criminal histories. And yet overwhelmingly, it\u2019s people they\u2019re targeting for arrest who have no criminal history of any kind.\u201d\nA look at the numbers\nThe latest ICE statistics show that as of June 29, there were 57,861 people detained by ICE, 41,495 \u2014 71.7% \u2014 of whom had no criminal convictions. That includes 14,318 people with pending criminal charges and 27,177 who are subject to immigration enforcement, but have no known criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.\nEach detainee is assigned a threat level by ICE on a scale of 1 to 3, with one being the highest. Those without a criminal record are classified as having \u201cno ICE threat level.\u201d As of June 23, the latest data available, 84% of people detained at 201 facilities nationwide were not given a threat level. Another 7% had been graded as a level 1 threat, 4% were level 2 and 5% were level 3.\n\u201cPresident Trump has justified this immigration agenda in part by making false claims that migrants are driving violent crime in the United States, and that\u2019s just simply not true,\u201d said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThere\u2019s no research and evidence that supports his claims.\u201d\nTricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, called the assessment that ICE isn\u2019t targeting immigrants with a criminal record \u201cfalse\u201d and said that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has directed ICE \u201cto target the worst of the worst\u2014including gang members, murderers, and rapists.\u201d She counted detainees with convictions, as well as those with pending charges, as \u201ccriminal illegal aliens.\u201d\nNonpublic data obtained by the Cato Institute shows that as of June 14, 65% of the more than 204,000 people processed into the system by ICE since the start of fiscal year 2025, which began Oct. 1, 2024, had no criminal convictions. Of those with convictions, only 6.9% had committed a violent crime, while 53% had committed nonviolent crimes that fell into three main categories \u2014 immigration, traffic, or vice crimes.\nTotal ICE arrests shot up at the end of May after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller gave the agency a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term. ICE arrested nearly 30% more people in May than in April, according to the Transactional Records Clearinghouse, or TRAC. That number rose again in June, by another 28%.\nThe Cato Institute found that between Feb. 8 and May 17, the daily average of \u201cnoncriminals\u201d processed into the system ranged from 421 to 454. In the following two weeks at the end of May, that number rose to 678 and then rose to 927 in the period from June 1 through 14.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this huge increase in funding to detain people, remove people, enforce immigration laws,\u201d Eisen said. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re seeing is that a lot of these people back to sort of the original question you asked, these are not people who are dangerous.\u201d\nAdministration says focus is on dangerous criminals\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said the administration is intensely focused on rooting out unvetted criminals who are in the country illegally.\n\u201cJust this week, the Administration conducted a successful operation rescuing children from labor exploitation at a marijuana facility in California, and continued arresting the worst of the worst \u2013 including murderers, pedophiles, gang members, and rapists,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cAny suggestion that the Administration is not laser focused on these dangerous criminals is flat out wrong.\u201d\nWhile most ICE detainees are not convicted criminals, there are detainees who have committed serious crimes. On Friday, the administration released information on five high-level offenders who had been arrested.\nDuring his campaign, Trump highlighted several cases where immigrants in the country illegally were arrested for horrific crimes. Among them: The killing of 22-year-old Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student who was slain last year by a Venezuelan man in the U.S. illegally. Jose Ibarra was found guilty of murder and other crimes in Riley\u2019s February 2024 killing and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Ibarra is seeking a new trial.\nTrump in January signed into law the Laken Riley Act, which requires the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes.\nImmigrants are not driving violent crime in US, studies find\nResearch has consistently found, however, that immigrants are not driving violent crime in the U.S. and that they actually commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. A 2023 working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, reported that immigrants for 150 years have had lower incarceration rates than those born in the U.S. In fact, the rates have declined since 1960 \u2014 according to the paper, immigrants were 60% less likely to be incarcerated.\nExperts say the false rhetoric coming out of the Trump administration creates real harm.\n\u201cIt makes people in immigrant communities feel targeted and marginalized,\u201d Arulanantham said. \u201cIt creates more political and social space for hate in all its forms, including hate crime against immigrant communities.\u201d\nEisen noted that the impact extends to other communities as well.\n\u201cAll Americans should want safe and thriving communities and this idea that the president of the United States is making misleading statements about the truth and distorting reality is not the way to deliver public safety,\u201d she said.\n___\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck."

      "text": "Senate approves funding bill hours before shutdown deadline, sending to Trump for signature\nSenate approves funding bill hours before shutdown deadline, sending to Trump for signature\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Senate passed a Republican-led spending bill Friday hours before a government shutdown, overcoming sharp Democratic opposition to the measure and sending it to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.\nThe essentially party-line vote, 54-46, didn\u2019t give the full picture of gnawing Democratic angst over how to confront the Trump administration as its Department of Government Efficiency fires federal workers and dismantles operations. Democrats argued over whether to fight even risking a shutdown and fumed that Republicans drafted a measure that included little of their input, shortchanging health care, housing and other priorities.\nBut in the end, enough of the Democratic senators decided a government shutdown would be even worse, and backed Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s strategy to allow the bill to come forward.\n\u201cA shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cDonald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.\u201d\nDemocrats were confronted with two painful options: allowing passage of a bill they believe gives President Donald Trump vast discretion on spending decisions or voting no and letting funding lapse. All told, 10 Democrats voted to break the party\u2019s filibuster to advance the bill to a final vote. On final passage, two Democrats supported the bill, and one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, opposed it. It funds the government for another six months.\nSchumer gave members of his caucus days to vent their frustration about the options before them, but abruptly switched course and made clear on the eve of voting that he would not allow a government shutdown. His move outraged many in the party who want to fight the Trump agenda, but gave senators room to side with Republicans and allow the continuing resolution, often described as a CR, to advance.\nDemocrats from all corners looked to pressure senators to kill the bill. House members wrote letters, posted on social media and held press conferences in the hours before the vote.\nAP correspondent Ben Thomas reports the Senate Democratic leader will let a Republican funding bill move forward to avoid a government shutdown.\n\u201cThe American people sent Democrats to Congress to fight against Republican dysfunction and chaos,\u201d said a letter from 66 House Democrats to Schumer.\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and his team dashed back to the Capitol urging senators to block the bill and negotiate a true compromise with Republicans. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi called the bill \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nSome Democrats also argued that Republicans would take the blame for a shutdown, given they controlled all the levers of power in Congress and the White House.\n\u201cIf you refuse to put forward an offer that includes any Democratic input and you don\u2019t get Democratic votes, that\u2019s on Republicans,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\nIn contrast, Schumer picked up one unexpected nod of support \u2014 from Trump himself, who just a day earlier was gearing up to blame Democrats for any shutdown.\n\u201cCongratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing \u2014 Took \u2018guts\u2019 and courage!\u201d the president posted on his social media account.\nCongress has been unable to pass the annual appropriations bills designed to fund the government, so they\u2019ve resorted to passing short-term extensions instead. The legislation before the Senate is the third such continuing resolution for the current fiscal year, now nearly half over.\nThe legislation would fund the federal government through the end of September. It would trim non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increase defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.\nThe Republican-led House passed the spending bill Tuesday and then adjourned. The move left senators with a decision to either take it or leave it. And while Democrats pushed for a vote on a fourth short-term extension, GOP leadership made clear that option was a non-starter.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and others made the case that any blame for a shutdown would fall squarely on Democrats. And House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Republicans stood together to get the job done.\nMeanwhile, some House Democrats lashed out at their colleagues across the Capitol after the vote.\n\u201cThe constituents I represent need Democrats to stand up to this rogue administration,\u201d said Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev. \u201cWhat they got from Senate Democrats today was capitulation instead.\u201d\nBut Schumer said Trump would seize more power during a shutdown, because it would give the administration the ability to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel non-essential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired.\nDemocrats were critical of the funding levels in the bill. But they are more worried about the discretion the bill gives the Trump administration on spending decisions. Many Democrats are referring to the measure as a \u201cblank check\u201d for Trump.\nSpending bills typically come with specific funding directives for key programs, but hundreds of those directives fall away under the continuing resolution passed by the House. So the administration will have more leeway to decide where the money goes.\nFor example, a Democratic memo said the bill would allow the administration to steer money away from combating fentanyl and instead use it on mass deportation initiatives.\nSeveral amendments to the bill failed, but one to eliminate funding for DOGE drew support from a Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.\nThe spending bill before the Senate is separate from the GOP effort to extend tax cuts for individuals passed in Trump\u2019s first term and to partially pay for them with spending cuts elsewhere in government.\nThat second package will be developed in the months ahead, but it was clearly part of the political calculus.\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at a one-two punch, a very bad CR, then a reconciliation bill coming down, which will be the final kick in the teeth for the American people,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said the Democratic arguments for voting against the bill were hypocritical because they were essentially calling for shutting down the government to protect the government.\n\u201cDemocrats are fighting to withhold the paychecks of air traffic controllers, our troops, federal custodial staff,\u201d Cotton said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\nSenators also unanimously approved a separate bill to fix an unexpected provision in the package that would require the District of Columbia to revert to 2024 budget levels, a cut of some $1.1 billion, even though the district raises most of its own money. That bill, which now goes to House, would allow spending at 2025 levels.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Leah Askarinam and Matt Brown contributed to this story from Leesburg, Va."

Gen. Jeffrey Kruse will no longer serve as head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, according to the people, who spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\nHegseth also fired Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, who is chief of the Navy Reserve, as well as Rear Adm. Milton Sands, a Navy SEAL officer who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, another U.S. official said.\nNo reasons were given for their firings, the latest in a series of steps targeting military leaders, intelligence officials and other perceived critics of Trump, who has demanded loyalty across the government. The administration also stripped security clearances this week from additional current and former national security officials.\nTaken together, the moves could chill dissent and send a signal against reaching conclusions at odds with Trump\u2019s interests.\nTrump decried agency\u2019s initial findings on US strikes on Iran\nKruse\u2019s firing comes two months after details of a preliminary assessment of U.S. airstrikes against Iran leaked to the media. It found that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the military effort, contradicting assertions from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThe Republican president, who had pronounced the Iranian program \u201ccompletely and fully obliterated,\u201d rejected the report. His oft-repeated criticism of the DIA analysis built on his long-running distrust of intelligence assessments, including one published in 2017 that said Russia interfered on his behalf in the 2016 election.\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence \u2014 which is responsible for coordinating the work of 18 intelligence agencies, including the DIA \u2014 has been declassifying years-old documents meant to cast doubt on those previous findings.\nFollowing the June strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, Hegseth lambasted the press for focusing on the preliminary assessment but did not offer any direct evidence of the destruction of the facilities.\n\u201cYou want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated \u2014 choose your word. This was a historically successful attack,\u201d Hegseth said at a news conference at the time.\nDemocrats raise concerns about implications of key firing\nWhile the Pentagon has offered no details on the firings, Democrats in Congress have raised alarm over the precedent that Kruse\u2019s ouster sets for the intelligence community.\n\u201cThe firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration\u2019s dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nRep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called on the administration to show why Kruse was fired or \u201cotherwise, we can only assume that this is another politically motivated decision intended to create an atmosphere of fear\u201d within the intelligence community.\nTrump has a history of removing government officials whose data and analysis he disagrees with. Earlier this month, after a lousy jobs report, he fired the official in charge of the data. His administration also has stopped posting reports on climate change, canceled studies on vaccine access and removed data on gender identity from government sites.\nTrump administration makes series of military and intelligence changes\nThe new firings culminate a week of broad Trump administration changes to the intelligence community and new shake-ups to military leadership.\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence announced this week that it would slash its staff and budget and revoked more security clearances, a tactic the administration uses against those it sees as foes. The Pentagon also said the Air Force\u2019s top uniformed officer, Gen. David Allvin, planned to retire two years early.\nHegseth and Trump have been aggressive in dismissing top military officials, often without formal explanation.\nThe administration has fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the Navy\u2019s top officer, the Air Force\u2019s second highest-ranking officer, and the top lawyers for three military service branches.\nIn April, Hegseth dismissed Gen. Tim Haugh as head of the National Security Agency and Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, who was a senior official at NATO.\nNo public explanations have been offered by the Pentagon for any of the firings, though some of the officers were believed by the administration to endorse diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Trump has demanded government agencies purge DEI efforts.\nThe ousters of Kruse, Lacore and Sands were reported earlier by The Washington Post."

Seven months later, after berating Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and stanching the flow of some U.S. military assistance to Kyiv, Trump could not bring Putin even to pause the fighting, as his forces make gains on the battlefield.\nThe U.S. president had offered Putin both a carrot and a stick, issuing threats of punishing economic sanctions on Russia while also extending a warm welcome at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, but he appeared to walk away without any concrete progress on ending the war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year.\nInstead, he handed Putin long-sought recognition on the international stage, after years of Western efforts to make him a pariah over the war and his crackdown on dissent, and forestalled the threat of additional U.S. sanctions.\nIn a sign that the conversations did not yield Trump\u2019s preferred result, the two leaders ended what was supposed to be a joint news conference without taking questions from reporters.\nDuring a subsequent interview with Fox News Channel before leaving Alaska, Trump insisted that the onus going forward might be somehow on Zelenskyy \u201cto get it done,\u201d but said there would also be some involvement from European nations. That was notable since Zelenskyy was excluded from Trump and Putin\u2019s meeting.\nThe U.S. president had wanted to show off his deal-making skills, while Putin wanted to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia\u2019s gains, block Kyiv\u2019s bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow\u2019s orbit.\n\u201cWe had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,\u201d Trump said while standing next to Putin. \u201cAnd there are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get there.\u201d\nPutin says Trump \u2018shows understanding\u2019 that Russia has its own interests\nFor Putin, just being on U.S. soil for the first time in more than a decade was validation after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine.\nHis meeting with Trump may stall the economic sanctions that the U.S. president had promised unless Moscow worked harder to bring the fighting to a close. It also may simply lead to more meetings, giving his forces more time to make progress on the battlefield.\nPutin said Russia and the United States should \u201cturn the page and go back to cooperation.\u201d\nHe praised Trump as someone who \u201chas a clear idea of what he wants to achieve and sincerely cares about the prosperity of his country, and at the same time shows understanding that Russia has its own national interests.\u201d\n\u201cI expect that today\u2019s agreements will become a reference point not only for solving the Ukrainian problem, but will also mark the beginning of the restoration of businesslike, pragmatic relations between Russia and the U.S.,\u201d Putin said.\nDespite not reaching any major breakthrough, Trump ended his remarks by thanking Putin and saying, \u201cwe\u2019ll speak to you very soon and probably see you again very soon.\u201d\nWhen Putin smiled and offered, \u201cnext time in Moscow,\u201d Trump said \u201cthat\u2019s an interesting one\u201d and said he might face criticism but \u201cI could see it possibly happening.\u201d\nDuring the interview with Fox News, Trump bragged that Putin echoed many of the U.S. president\u2019s long-standing grievances, including about the 2020 election. This suggests that Putin, a former KGB officer, may have left Trump with the impression that he\u2019d notched a big win even as he left empty handed.\nWhen Trump and Putin arrived in Alaska, they had greeted each other with a warm handshake, chatting almost like old friends, and gripped hands for an extended period on a red carpet rolled out at the military base. As they chatted, Putin grinned and pointed skyward, where B-2s and F-22s \u2014 military aircraft designed to oppose Russia during the Cold War \u2014 flew overhead. The two then shared the U.S. presidential limo for a short ride to their meeting site, with Putin offering a broad smile as they rolled past the cameras.\nIt was the kind of reception typically reserved for close U.S. allies and belied the bloodshed and suffering in the war Putin started in Ukraine. Although not altogether surprising considering their longtime friendly relationship, such outward friendliness likely raised concerns from Zelenskyy and European leaders, who fear that Trump is primarily focusing on furthering U.S. interests and not pressing hard enough for Ukraine\u2019s.\nNot a one-on-one meeting\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said shortly before Air Force One touched down that the previously planned one-on-one meeting between Trump and Putin would be a three-on-three discussion including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff. Putin was joined by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov.\nThe change seemed to indicate that the White House was taking a more guarded approach than it did during a 2018 meeting in Helsinki, where Trump and Putin met privately with their interpreters and Trump then shocked the world by siding with the Russian leader over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia meddled in the 2016 campaign.\nZelenskyy\u2019s exclusion was also a heavy blow to the West\u2019s policy of \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\u201d\nWar still raging\nRussia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine\u2019s mobilization efforts, which are conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.\nThe meeting comes as the war has caused heavy losses on both sides and drained resources. Ukraine has held on far longer than some initially expected since the February 2022 invasion, but it is straining to hold off Russia\u2019s much larger army, grappling with bombardments of its cities and fighting for every inch on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line.\nAlaska is separated from Russia at its closest point by just 3 miles (less than 5 kilometers) and the international date line.\nJoint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It continues to play a role today, as planes from the base still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into U.S. airspace.\n___\nWeissert reported from Washington.

Joni Ernst confirms she won\u2019t run\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said Tuesday that she will not seek reelection next year, confirming in a video post on social media that she will retire after months of speculation about her plans.\nThe Republican senator\u2019s announcement opens up a Senate seat in the state known for its long-serving incumbents. Rep. Ashley Hinson, representing Iowa\u2019s northeastern congressional district, announced Tuesday that she would seek the GOP nomination.\nAs President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans look to maintain their narrow majorities in both chambers, the loss of two incumbents in those races could come with challenges in the once-competitive state where Democrats are looking for pickup opportunities. Two of Iowa\u2019s four congressional districts have been among the country\u2019s most competitive in recent elections, and Democrats have already identified Hinson\u2019s as an additional third target.\nErnst\u2019s announcement Tuesday followed reports last week that she was expected to bow out of the reelection bid this month. In a video, Ernst cited her aging and growing family as a reason for not running again.\n\u201cThis was no easy decision,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cI never imagined this farm girl would have the opportunity to serve as a lieutenant colonel and then a United States senator.\u201d\nAn open Senate seat is rare in Iowa\nErnst was first elected in 2014 to the open seat previously held by Tom Harkin, a Democrat who served for 30 years. Republican Chuck Grassley, Iowa\u2019s senior U.S. senator, was first elected to the Senate in 1980. It is another unexpected retirement for Senate Republicans as they work to maintain their majority in the chamber, with Ernst joining Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who turned down a reelection bid after clashing with Trump.\nTwo Republicans \u2014 former state Sen. Jim Carlin and veteran Joshua Smith \u2014 had already entered the Senate primary intending to challenge Ernst.\nImmediately after Ernst\u2019s announcement, Hinson thanked the senator for her service and previewed her entry into the race, saying Trump needs a \u201cfighter in the Senate who will always have his back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve stood shoulder to shoulder with the President to pass this America First agenda in the House and I would be his strongest ally in the Senate,\u201d Hinson said in a post on X.\nSeveral Democrats are seeking the party\u2019s nomination for the Senate seat, including state Sen. Zach Wahls; state Rep. Josh Turek; Jackie Norris, chair of the Des Moines School Board; and Nathan Sage, a former chamber of commerce president.\nErnst, Iowa\u2019s first woman elected to Congress, is an Iraq War combat veteran and retired from the Army National Guard as a lieutenant colonel. She served for several years in Senate GOP leadership and was considered a vice presidential contender for Trump\u2019s first White House run.\nBut Ernst has faced pressure from all sides in the last year. She took heat after signaling her hesitance to support one of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. She\u2019s also been one of the faces of Democrats\u2019 campaign against the sprawling tax and spending package after she made a retort about Medicaid cuts at a town hall.\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, touted Ernst\u2019s service helping Iowa families and making Washington \u201csqueal,\u201d a reference to her original campaign message that spoke of her experience castrating hogs.\n\u201cTraveling across the Hawkeye State with Joni, I know she loves Iowa, and Iowa loves her,\u201d he wrote in a post on X.\nImplications for a congressional district\nHinson, a former news anchor for KCRG-TV, won her most recent election with the support of 57% of voters in Iowa\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.\nHinson was first elected to represent Iowa\u2019s northeastern corner when she beat out one-term Rep. Abby Finkenauer in 2020. Finkenauer, a Democrat, had ousted a GOP incumbent in the midterm election just two years earlier, helping Democrats retake control of the U.S. House during Trump\u2019s first term in office.\nHinson has since put up strong fundraising numbers to buoy her decisive wins.\nThe district, including the cities of Cedar Rapids, Dubuque and Waterloo, has just shy of 29,000 more active voters registered as Republicans than as Democrats. But in April, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee included it in its list of potential pickups. Lindsay James, a state representative and pastor; and Clint Twedt-Ball, a pastor who founded a nonprofit, are among the Democratic candidates running for the seat."

Trump has been pressuring senators to move quickly as Democrats blocked more nominees than usual this year, denying any fast unanimous consent votes and forcing roll calls on each one, a lengthy process that can take several days per nominee.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re desperately in need of change,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune said of Senate rules Saturday after negotiations with Schumer and Trump broke down. \u201cI think that the last six months have demonstrated that this process, nominations is broken. And so I expect there will be some good robust conversations about that.\u201d\nSchumer said a rules change would be a \u201chuge mistake,\u201d especially as Senate Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass spending bills and other legislation moving forward.\n\u201cDonald Trump tried to bully us, go around us, threaten us, call us names, but he got nothing,\u201d Schumer said.\nThe latest standoff comes as Democrats and Republicans have gradually escalated their obstruction of the other party\u2019s executive branch and judicial nominees over the last two decades, and as Senate leaders have incrementally changed Senate rules to speed up confirmations \u2014 and make them less bipartisan.\nIn 2013, Democrats changed Senate rules for lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations as Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial picks. In 2017, Republicans did the same for Supreme Court nominees as Democrats tried to block Trump\u2019s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.\nTrump has been pressuring Senate Republicans for weeks to cancel the August recess and grind through dozens of his nominations as Democrats have slowed the process. But Republicans hoped to make a deal with Democrats instead, and came close several times over the last few days as the two parties and the White House negotiated over moving a large tranche of nominees in exchange for reversing some of the Trump administration\u2019s spending cuts on foreign aid, among other issues.\nThe Senate held a rare weekend session on Saturday as Republicans held votes on nominee after nominee and as the two parties tried to work out the final details of a deal. But it was clear that there would be no agreement when Trump attacked Schumer on social media Saturday evening and told Republicans to pack it up and go home.\n\u201cTell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cDo not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country.\u201d\nThune said afterward that there were \u201cseveral different times\u201d when the two sides thought they had a deal, but in the end \u201cwe didn\u2019t close it out.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first time in recent history that the minority party hasn\u2019t allowed at least some quick confirmations. Thune has already kept the Senate in session for more days, and with longer hours, this year to try and confirm as many of Trump\u2019s nominees as possible.\nBut Democrats had little desire to give in without the spending cut reversals or some other incentive, even though they too were eager to skip town after several long months of work and bitter partisan fights over legislation.\n\u201cWe have never seen nominees as flawed, as compromised, as unqualified as we have right now,\u201d Schumer said."

This is the first major combined attack on Kyiv since US President Donald Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month to discuss ending the three-year war in Ukraine.\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russia launched a major air attack on Kyiv early on Thursday that included a rare strike on the center of Ukraine\u2019s capital, killing at least 21 people, wounding 48 and damaging European Union diplomatic offices, authorities said.\nThe bombardment of drones and missiles was the first major Russian attack on Kyiv in weeks as U.S.-led peace efforts to end the three-year war struggled to gain traction. Britain said the attack sabotaged peace efforts, while top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas summoned Russia\u2019s EU envoy to Brussels over the strikes that damaged EU offices.\nThe U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on airstrikes against Ukraine on Friday afternoon at the request of Ukraine and the five European council members \u2014 Britain, France, Slovenia, Denmark and Greece. Two of Ukraine\u2019s top envoys were set to meet Friday with the Trump administration regarding mediation.\nThe Kremlin said Russia remained interested in continuing peace talks despite Thursday\u2019s air attack, which was one of the war\u2019s biggest since it began in 2022.\nAmong the dead were four children between 2 and 17, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv\u2019s city administration. He said more people could still be under the rubble, and search and rescue efforts continued on Thursday evening.\nAlso Thursday, the Trump administration approved a $825 million arms sale to Ukraine that will include extended-range missiles and related equipment to boost its defensive capabilities as U.S. efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia appear to have stalled. The State Department said Ukraine would use funding from NATO allies Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway in addition to U.S. foreign military financing to pay for the equipment.\nRare attack on center of Kyiv\nAP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on Russian drone and missile attack on Kyiv.\nThe attack was one of the few times Russian drones and missiles have penetrated the heart of Kyiv since the start of the full-scale invasion.\nUkraine\u2019s Air Force said Russia launched 598 strike drones and decoys and 31 missiles of different types across the country early Thursday, most of them striking targets in Kyiv.\nAt least 33 locations across all 10 of the city\u2019s districts were directly hit or damaged by debris, Tkachenko said. Thousands of windows shattered as nearly 100 buildings were damaged, including a shopping mall in the city center.\nOleksandr Khilko arrived at the scene after a missile hit the residential building where his sister lives in the capital\u2019s Darnytsia district. He heard screams from people who were trapped under the rubble and pulled out three survivors, including a boy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s inhuman, striking civilians,\u201d Khilko said, his clothes covered in dust and the tips of his fingers black with soot. \u201cWith every cell of my body I want this war to end as soon as possible. I wait, but every time the air raid alarm sounds, I am afraid.\u201d\nSophia Akylina said her home in Kyiv\u2019s Holosiivskyi district was damaged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never happened before that they attacked so close,\u201d the 21-year old said. \u201cNegotiations haven\u2019t yielded anything yet, unfortunately people are suffering.\u201d\nEU and UK summon Russian envoys after strikes hit their buildings\nEuropean Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said two strikes landed 20 seconds apart about 50 meters (165 feet) from the EU Mission to Ukraine building in Kyiv. She said no staff were injured in the strike.\n\u201cNo diplomatic mission should ever be a target. In response, we are summoning the Russian envoy in Brussels,\u201d Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, said Thursday in a post on X.\nThe British Council, which promotes cultural relations and educational opportunities, also said its Kyiv office had been \u201cseverely damaged\u201d in the attack and was closed to visitors until further notice.\nThe organization posted a photo showing the building with its windows and entrance smashed open and surrounded by glass and debris. A guard was injured and is \u201cshaken but stable,\u201d council chief executive Scott McDonald posted on X.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201csabotaging\u201d hopes of peace following the \u201csenseless\u201d strikes. The Russian ambassador to London was summoned to the foreign office.\nDiplomatic efforts to reach peace have stalled\nThursday\u2019s attack is the first major combined Russian mass drone and missile attack to strike Kyiv since U.S. President Donald Trump met with Putin in Alaska earlier this month to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.\n\u201cRussia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X following the attack. \u201cWe expect a response from everyone in the world who has called for peace but now more often stays silent rather than taking principled positions.\u201d\nWhile a diplomatic push to end the war appeared to gain momentum shortly after that meeting, few details have emerged about the next steps.\nWestern leaders have accused Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts and avoiding serious negotiations while Russian troops move deeper into Ukraine. This week, Ukrainian military leaders conceded Russian forces have broken into an eighth region of Ukraine seeking to capture more ground.\nZelenskyy hopes for harsher U.S. sanctions to cripple the Russian economy if Putin does not demonstrate seriousness about ending the war. He reiterated those demands following Thursday\u2019s attack.\nTrump bristled this week at Putin\u2019s stalling on an American proposal for direct peace talks with Zelenskyy. Trump said Friday he expects to decide on next steps in two weeks if direct talks aren\u2019t scheduled.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday said it was \u201cclear that a meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Putin will not take place.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized both Putin and Zelenskyy after the Thursday attack on Kyiv.\nShe said that Trump \u201cwas not happy about this news, but he was also not surprised\u201d by Russia\u2019s Thursday air assault on the Ukrainian capital.\nLeavitt noted that Ukraine has also launched effective assaults on Russia\u2019s oil industry in recent weeks.\n\u201cPerhaps both sides of this war are not ready to end it themselves,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cThe president wants it to end, but the leaders of these two countries \u2026 must want it to end as well.\u201d\nRussia says it targeted \u2018military-industrial complex\u2019\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it carried out a strike against military air bases and companies \u201cwithin Ukraine\u2019s military-industrial complex\u201d using long-range weapons, including Kinzhal missiles.\n\u201cAll designated objects were hit,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\nUkraine has ramped up domestic arms production to fight Russia\u2019s invasion. Many weapons factories operate covertly, with some embedded in civilian areas with superior air defenses. Indiscriminate Russian attacks claiming to target Ukraine\u2019s defense industry have killed many civilians.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry also said it shot down 102 Ukrainian drones overnight, mostly in the country\u2019s southwest. A drone attack sparked a blaze at the Afipsky oil refinery in the Krasnodar region, local officials said, while a second fire was reported at the Novokuibyshevsk refinery in the Samara region.\nUkrainian drones have repeatedly struck refineries and other oil infrastructure in recent weeks in an attempt to weaken Russia\u2019s war economy, causing gas stations in some Russian regions to run dry and prices to spike.\nUkraine\u2019s national railway operator, Ukrzaliznytsia, reported damage to its infrastructure in the Vinnytsia and Kyiv regions, causing delays and requiring trains to use alternative routes.\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Yehor Konovalov, Vasilisa Stepanenko and Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine; Sam McNeil in Brussels; Katie Marie Davies in Manchester, England; Daniel Niemann in Cologne, Germany. and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report."

      "text": "Man who staked out Trump at Florida golf course charged with attempting an assassination\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A man who authorities say staked out Donald Trump for 12 hours on his golf course in Florida and wrote of his desire to kill him was indicted Tuesday on an attempted assassination charge.\nRyan Wesley Routh had been initially charged with two federal firearms offenses. The upgraded charges contained in a five-count indictment reflect the Justice Department\u2019s assessment that he methodically plotted to kill the Republican nominee, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump\u2019s West Palm Beach golf course on an afternoon Trump was playing on it. Routh left behind a note in which he described his intention, prosecutors said.\nCourt records show the case has been assigned to Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed federal judge who generated intense scrutiny for her handling of a criminal case charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She dismissed that case in July, a decision now being appealed by special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team.\nThe attempted assassination indictment had been foreshadowed during a court hearing Monday in which prosecutors successfully argued for the 58-year-old Routh to remain behind bars as a flight risk and a threat to public safety.\nThey alleged that he had written of his plans to kill Trump in a handwritten note months before his Sept. 15 arrest in which he referred to his actions as a failed \u201cassassination attempt on Donald Trump\u201d and offered $150,000 for anyone who could \u201cfinish the job.\u201d That note was in a box that Routh had apparently dropped off at the home of an unidentified witness months before his arrest.\nAfter the attempted assassination, the person opened the box, took a photograph of the front page of the letter \u2014 addressed \u201cDear World\u201d \u2014 and contacted law enforcement.\nProsecutors also said Routh kept in his car a handwritten list of venues at which Trump had appeared or was expected to be present in August, September and October.\nThe charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction. Other charges in the indictment include assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and the two original firearms charges he faced last week.\nThe potential shooting was thwarted when a member of Trump\u2019s Secret Service protective detail spotted a partially obscured man\u2019s face and a rifle barrel protruding through the golf course fence line, ahead of where Trump was playing. The agent fired in the direction of Routh, who sped away and was stopped by law enforcement in a neighboring county.\nRouth did not fire any rounds and did not have Trump in his line of sight, officials have said. He left behind a digital camera, a backpack, a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope and a plastic bag containing food.\nThe arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said that security worked as it should have to thwart a potential attack in Florida.\nThe initial charges Routh faced in a criminal complaint accused him of illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. It is common for prosecutors to bring preliminary and easily provable charges upon an arrest and then add more serious offenses later as the investigation develops.\nThe FBI had said at the outset that it was investigating the episode as an apparent assassination attempt, but the absence of an immediate charge to that effect opened the door for Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to announce his own state-level investigation that he said could produce more serious charges.\nTrump, seeking to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the investigation and the Justice Department more broadly, complained Monday \u2014 before the attempted assassination charge was brought \u2014 that federal prosecutors were \u201cmishandling and downplaying\u201d the case by bringing charges that were a \u201cslap on the wrist.\u201d\nAsked Tuesday at an unrelated press conference about Trump\u2019s criticism, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department \u201cwould spare no resources to ensure accountability\u201d in the case.\n\u201cAll of our top priority should be ensuring that accountability occurs in this case and that those who run for office and their families are safe and protected,\u201d Garland said.\nThe Justice Department also said Monday that authorities who searched Routh\u2019s car found six cellphones, including one that showed a Google search of how to travel from Palm Beach County to Mexico.\nA notebook found in his car was filled with criticism of the Russian and Chinese governments and notes about how to join the war on behalf of Ukraine.\nIn addition, prosecutors have cited a book authored by Routh last year in which he lambasted Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy, including in Ukraine. In the book, he wrote that Iran was \u201cfree to assassinate Trump\u201d for having left the nuclear deal.\n____\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer and Curt Anderson contributed to this report."

      "text": "14,000 US-bound migrants have returned south since Trump border changes, UN says\n14,000 US-bound migrants have returned south since Trump border changes, UN says\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 More than 14,000 mainly Venezuelan migrants who hoped to reach the United States have reversed course and turned south since U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown began, according to a report published Friday by the governments of Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica.\nThe phenomenon, known as \u201creverse flow\u201d migration, is largely made up of Venezuelan migrants who fled their country\u2019s long-running economic, social and political crises only to encounter U.S. immigration policy no longer open to asylum-seekers.\nMigration through the treacherous Darien Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed. That flow slowed somewhat in 2024, but dried up almost completely early this year.\nFriday\u2019s report, published with support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had dropped 97% this year.\nMigrants traveling south interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia by those countries\u2019 ombudsmen offices were almost all Venezuelans (97%) and about half of them said they planned to return to Venezuela, according to the report. Nearly all said they were returning because they could no longer legally reach the U.S.\nSince 2017, around 8 million people have fled the crisis in Venezuela. For years, those migrants flocked to other South American nations, including Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile and more.\nThat changed in 2021, when hundreds of thousands of people set out for the U.S., braving the Darien Gap along the way.\nA U.S. government smartphone app became the main way for asylum-seekers to enter the U.S. under the Biden administration. Then thousands of migrants became stranded in Mexico when Trump ended the use of the app on his first day in office.\nNow, those migrants who were still trying to reach the U.S. when Trump entered and changed border policies have reversed course, traveling back to South America. Around a quarter of those interviewed planned to go to neighboring Colombia, previously the epicenter of the mass migration from Venezuela. Others said they didn\u2019t know where they were going.\nColombia and other South American nations spent years pleading for aid from the international community to cope with the brunt of Venezuela\u2019s migratory crisis, before many of those same migrants began moving toward the United States. Today, Venezuela\u2019s political and economic turmoil rages on.\nMigrants, most of whom trekked days across the Darien Gap on their way north, are even more vulnerable as they make their way back. They have fewer funds to finance their journey and few prospects for work when they get back. Migrants are dropped into regions with a heavy presence of criminal groups that increasingly prey upon them, the report said.\n\u201cMost of these people are already victims of human rights abuses,\u201d Scott Campbell, a U.N. human rights representative in Colombia, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge authorities to aid people in this reverse migration to prevent them from being exploited or falling into trafficking networks run by illegal armed groups.\u201d\nThe shift marks a radical reversal in one of the biggest mass migrations in the world.\nMigrants bus south through Mexico and other Central American nations until they arrive in the center of Panama. From there, migrants pay between $260 and $280 to ride on precarious boats packed with people back to Colombia.\nThey take two different routes. Most island hop north of Panama through the Caribbean Sea, landing in the small town of Necocli, Colombia, where many started their journeys through the Darien.\nOthers travel south by sea along a jungled swath of Panama and Colombia through the Pacific Ocean, where they are dropped off in remote towns or the Colombian city of Buenaventura. Colombia\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s Office estimates around 450 people have taken the perilous route, and the U.N. documented migrants getting scammed and stranded, facing boat accidents and arriving beaten down and vulnerable from their journey.\nThe region is one of the most violent in Colombia, and lack of state presence is filled by warring armed groups."

About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.\nThe loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear how much of the decline we\u2019ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn\u2019t real.\u201d\nTrump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on \u201cdangerous criminals,\u201d but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.\nPia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.\n\u201cThe influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that\u2019s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.\u201d\n\u2018Crops did go to waste\u2019\nJust across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won\u2019t be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.\nImmigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.\n\u201cIn May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,\u201d she said.\nIn Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).\nMost of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.\nDozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.\n\u201cPeople were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,\u201d Tate said.\nLidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to bring my kids,\u201d said Lidia. \u201cI\u2019m also very concerned I\u2019d have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.\u201d\nFrom construction to health care\nConstruction sites in and around McAllen also \u201care completely dead,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\u201cWe have a large labor force that is undocumented,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.\u201d\nThe number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.\n\u201cConstruction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,\u201d said Ken Simonson, the association\u2019s chief economist. \u201cBut contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn\u2019t disrupting labor supplies.\u201d\nKramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.\nThe Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local\u2019s president.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?\u201d De La Cruz said. \u201cWhat happens when immigrants aren\u2019t in the field to pick our crops? Who\u2019s going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?\u201d ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The name is not Immigration Control and Enforcement."

Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal calls for a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that continue to buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports \u2014 targeting nations like China and India, which account for roughly 70% of Russia\u2019s energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort.\nGraham and Blumenthal told The Associated Press in Rome that they hope to bring the legislation to a vote in the Senate before the August recess. They said Thursday they are convinced that it would give President Donald Trump the tools and flexibility he needs to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna play whack-a-mole anymore with Russia and sanctions,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe\u2019re going after his (Putin\u2019s) customer base. And that\u2019s what the Europeans, I think, are most pleased with.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not just kind of a continuation of our current strategy. This is a real turning point,\u201d Blumenthal added. \u201cIt\u2019s a real game-changer because it says to Putin, \u2018We\u2019re going to hit you right where it hurts.\u2019\u201d\nA coalition of the willing\nGraham and Blumenthal briefed a meeting in Rome of the coalition of the willing, the 30-plus countries that are prepared to send troops to keep the peace in Ukraine after hostilities cease. The meeting, which the United States attended for the first time, was held on the sidelines of a Ukraine recovery conference.\nJoining them was retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. The senators stressed that no U.S. troops would be in Ukraine, but that they participated in the gathering at the invitation of host Italy to bolster the U.S. presence at the Rome meeting and show congressional commitment to Ukraine.\n\u201cI think we gave Ukraine, the Europeans encouragement that America, the Congress was involved in a bipartisan fashion,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe want to empower the president to get Putin to the table and with tools he doesn\u2019t have today.\u201d\n\u201cHopefully we can get this legislation to the president by the end of the month, is the goal,\u201d he said.\nA deadline before summer break\nCongress is prepared to act on the legislation, which has overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, but has been waiting for Trump to give the green light before lawmakers recess for the summer break.\nSo far, the White House has expressed some reservations. Trump wants full authority over the waiver process to lift the sanctions, tariffs or other penalties, without having to cede control to Congress.\nUnder the initial bill, the president \u201cmay terminate\u201d the penalties under certain circumstances, but immediately reimpose them if the violations resume. Graham said the president would be allowed to waive the sanctions, for 180 days, and could also renew a waiver.\nBut the president\u2019s decision would eventually be subject to congressional review. To overturn the president\u2019s waiver would require a vote in Congress. It would need to clear the Senate\u2019s high-bar of a 60-vote threshold, Graham said. That is often difficult to reach in the narrowly divided chamber.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, unless some crazy thing happens,\u201d he said.\nThe senators explained that the waiver authority in their bill is standard, similar to what has been included in past legislation. But with the president\u2019s insistence on fully waiver authority, and also Congress wanting its own backstop, the legislation continues to evolve.\nA work in progress\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune said this week he hopes to bring the measure forward before Congress goes on recess in August. House Speaker Mike Johnson has also signaled a readiness to act in his chamber.\nWhile Thune said the sanctions bill has \u201ctremendous\u201d bipartisan support, the GOP leader acknowledged it\u2019s still a work in progress as the White House engages with the process.\n\u201cWe are working with the administration, with the House to try and get it in a form where it\u2019s ready,\u201d he said. Whether that happens in the next few weeks is still \u201ca bit of an open question,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m hopeful we can.\u201d\nGraham and Blumenthal said the legislation would also have a deterrent effect on China and curb its ambitions in Taiwan, with Graham saying the threat of such a massive economic hit for its support of Russia was a \u201ctrial run for Taiwan.\u201d\n\u201cThe other important lesson for China here is that a small country, out-manned and out-gunned, can win,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n___\nMascaro and Jalonick reported from Washington."

Ryan Routh says he was there recruiting foreign soldiers to fight the Russians. But Walsh never saw him make much progress and instead watched him grow increasingly angry and unhinged, kicking a panhandler, threatening to burn down a music studio that slighted him and speaking of his own children with seething hatred.\nJust as troubling, she said, was Routh\u2019s obsessive, oddly specific plotting to assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin, describing the various explosives, poisons and cross-border maneuvers that Routh would employ \u201cto kill him in his sleep.\u201d\n\u201cRyan Routh is a ticking time bomb,\u201d she recalled telling U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in an hourlong interview upon returning to the United States at Dulles International Airport near Washington in June 2022. She says she later repeated her concerns in separate tips to both the FBI and Interpol, the international policing group.\n\u201cThere is one person you need to watch,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is Ryan Routh.\u201d\nWalsh says she never heard back about her tips and she did not think much more about Routh until she saw him in the news last Sunday as the 58-year-old accused of stalking Donald Trump at the former president\u2019s golf course in West Palm Beach, Florida, in an apparent assassination attempt.\nWalsh\u2019s account was one of at least four reports to the U.S. government that, while not direct threats to Trump, raised suspicions about Routh in the years leading up to his arrest. Others included a tip to the FBI in 2019 about Routh being in possession of a firearm after a felony conviction, an online report by an aid worker to the State Department last year questioning Routh\u2019s military recruiting tactics, and Routh\u2019s own interview with Customs and Border Protection about those efforts, prompting a referral for a possible inquiry by Homeland Security Investigations.\nWhat was done in response that could have stopped Routh or at least put him under greater scrutiny is not entirely clear. The agencies involved either did not respond to queries from The Associated Press, have no record of such a report or had questions about whether the report warranted further investigation.\nBut some people are asking whether federal agencies are vigilant enough or even equipped enough to deal with a growing number of potential threats that are brought to their attention every day.\n\u201cFederal agencies ought to be on the highest alert to detect and combat these threats,\u201d said Republican Sen Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cCongress and the American people need assurance that the federal government is doing all it can.\u201d\nWalsh, who lives just a few miles from Trump\u2019s golf course, said she cannot help but think all of this could have been avoided.\n\u201cThe authorities have definitely dropped the ball on this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were warned.\u201d\nSarah Adams, an ex-CIA officer who was behind the State Department tip, said she decided to act after learning Routh was trying to recruit former Afghan fighters with false promises of spots in the Ukrainian military.\nShe said she drafted a bulletin urging the 50 humanitarian aid groups she was helping in Ukraine to keep Routh at arm\u2019s length, and she had her company send a similar online report to the State Department.\n\u201cThere was plenty to look into,\u201d said Adams, who lives in Tampa, Florida. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they even assigned someone to work it.\u201d\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said there is no record of any complaints about Routh. He said he could not rule out that \u201csomeone didn\u2019t have a communication with somebody somewhere.\u201d\nSimilarly, Customs and Border Protection said it could not confirm Walsh had a meeting with one of its agents because it does not comment on individual cases. The FBI also declined to confirm Walsh\u2019s warning, citing a policy of not commenting on ongoing investigations. Interpol did not respond to a request for comment.\nWalsh showed the AP notes that she took while talking to Customs and Border Protection, and a text she sent to a friend about her messages to the FBI and Interpol with a time stamp soon after she sent them.\nRouth, a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years moved to Hawaii, was being held on weapons charges related to the Trump case. His federal public defender, Kristy Militello, did not respond to messages seeking comment.\nA self-styled mercenary leader, Routh was never shy about speaking out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world.\nHe was interviewed by The New York Times, photographed by the AP and other news organizations and appeared in videos from Kyiv making his pitch for foreign fighters. He put out a self-published book last year on Amazon, \u201cUkraine\u2019s Unwinnable War,\u201d in which he writes of the wisdom of a well-timed killing of a world leader to change history.\n\u201cYou are free to assassinate Trump,\u201d Routh wrote, referring to Iran in retaliation for the former president\u2019s decision to abandon the U.S. nuclear deal with that country. Routh went on to describe Trump, whom he had voted for in 2016, as a \u201cfool\u201d and \u201cbuffoon\u201d for the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and for pushing a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine.\nWalsh said she initially found the wiry, floppy-haired Routh to be just bizarre. But as time went on, she got a darker vibe from the way Routh lurked in the streets, seemed to be everywhere and kept tabs on everyone.\nShe watched as Routh kicked a homeless man begging for money and then snarled, \u201cThe Ukrainians should be paying me for what I am doing here!\u201d She said he talked of his grown children with such hatred \u2014 \u201cI wish I never had them\u201d \u2014 that it frightened her. She remembers how he threatened to burn down a music studio because people there laughed at him over a song he wrote.\n\u201cRyan was the kind of guy who would blow up a building on Tuesday, just because he felt like it,\u201d Walsh said.\nRouth\u2019s musings about killing Putin were echoed in his book published last year that describes an even more far-fetched plan for someone with no military experience: launching thousands of weaponized drones to flatten Putin\u2019s many residences.\nBut in the end, he wrote, the Ukrainians and disaffected Russians he hoped to recruit as accomplices lost their \u201ccourage and will\u201d to pull it off.\nIn 2019, three years before Routh flew to Kyiv to build a foreign legion, the FBI followed up on a tip that he was in possession of a firearm despite felony convictions from years earlier.\nBut when questioned, the alleged tipster backed off and did not verify providing the initial information. The FBI then referred the matter to Hawaiian law enforcement for further investigation. Honolulu police confirmed this week they were looking into it.\nIn June 2023, Routh was pulled aside by Customs and Border Protection agents at the Honolulu airport when returning from Ukraine, Poland and Turkey, and asked about his activities overseas.\nAs first reported by the website Just the News and confirmed in congressional testimony this past week, documents show Routh told them he had been recruiting as many as 100 fighters from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan, and that his wife was paying for his efforts.\nRouth also gave agents a business card that claimed he was the director of a group called the International Volunteer Center.\nThe documents state that the agents referred Routh\u2019s case to Homeland Security Investigations for further scrutiny but it declined to pursue the matter.\nIn congressional testimony Wednesday, Katrina Berger, executive associate director of the agency, noted that it gets hundreds of such requests a day and that Routh\u2019s comments did not rise to the level to take him into \u201cimmediate custody.\u201d\nAsked specifically to confirm whether a further investigation was declined, she said she was not sure and would look into it.\nRouth\u2019s criminal history in his native Greensboro, North Carolina, includes a 2002 arrest for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a \u201cweapon of mass destruction,\u201d which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch-long fuse.\nIn 2010, police searched a warehouse Routh owned and found more than 100 stolen items, from power tools and building supplies to kayaks and spa tubs. Police alleged in an affidavit that he was selling the items to purchase crack cocaine.\nIn both felony cases, court records show judges gave Routh either probation or a suspended sentence, allowing him to escape prison time.\nTracy Fulk, a now-retired Greensboro police officer who arrested Routh in the long-ago armed standoff, said she was not surprised by last week\u2019s news about Routh.\n\u201cRemembering all the alerts and run-ins and stuff,\u201d she said, \u201che was kind of \u2018out there.\u2019\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writers Michael Biesecker, Eric Tucker, Matthew Lee and Rebecca Santana in Washington; Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu; Makiya Seminera in Greensboro, North Carolina; Gary D.

Trump has already deployed the guard as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover targeting crime, immigration and homelessness in Washington, where he has direct legal control over the District of Columbia National Guard.\nJudge says administration is violating the law\nBreyer said in his ruling that the Trump administration used troops for functions that were barred by their own training materials, refused to \u201cmeaningfully coordinate with state and local officials\u201d and \u201c\u2018coached\u2019\u201d federal law enforcement agencies on the language to use when requesting the Guard\u2019s assistance.\nHe said the government knew \u201cthey were ordering troops to execute domestic law beyond their usual authority\u201d in using \u201carmed soldiers ( whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles.\u201d\nBreyer barred troops from such actions, including making arrests, searches, acting as informants and collecting evidence.\nRuling follows California lawsuit\nCalifornia sued over the deployment of troops, saying it violates the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits military enforcement of domestic laws. Lawyers for the Trump administration argued the Posse Comitatus Act doesn\u2019t apply because the troops were protecting federal officers, not enforcing laws, and that the president had the authority to call on the troops. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under section 12406 of Title 10, which allows the president to call the guard into federal service when the country \u201cis invaded,\u201d when \u201cthere is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,\u201d or when the president is otherwise unable \u201cto execute the laws of the United States.\u201d\nThe deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state\u2019s national guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts.\nThousands of protesters took to the streets in response, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd.\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement the court sided with democracy. \u201cNo president is a king \u2014 not even Trump \u2014 and no president can trample a state\u2019s power to protect its people,\u201d he said.\nTrump administration has talked of more deployments\nTrump has pushed the bounds of typical military activity on domestic soil, including through the creation of militarized zones along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nAsked by reporters Tuesday in the Oval Office about sending National Guard troops to Chicago, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going in,\u201d but added, \u201cI didn\u2019t say when.\u201d\n\u201cI have an obligation,\u201d the president added. \u201dThis isn\u2019t a political thing.\u201d\nDemocratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have pushed back, saying crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.\nRet. Army Lt. Col. Daniel Maurer, an associate professor at Ohio Northern University College of Law, said presidents have federalized the National Guard to address widespread unrest and to desegregate schools but the Trump administration\u2019s example is \u201ccertainly the most aggressive use of the military domestically when the facts to support them are extremely weak.\u201d\nHe said the ruling could give a roadmap to other states.\nTroops joined federal law enforcement in Southern California\nRoughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines were deployed to Los Angeles before all but 300 soldiers were withdrawn.\nThe soldiers marched at MacArthur Park in downtown Los Angeles, which was intended as a show of force. They also accompanied federal immigration officers on raids at two state-licensed marijuana nurseries in Ventura County, Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman testified.\nSherman, who initially commanded the troops, testified during the second day of the trial that he raised concerns the deployment could violate the Posse Comitatus Act.\nHe said soldiers were given materials that included a list of activities prohibited by the act.\nSherman said he was told by his superiors that there was a \u201cconstitutional exception\u201d that permitted such activities when the troops are protecting federal property or personnel.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the judge\u2019s order goes into effect Sept. 12 and that he is in San Francisco, not Washington.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Lindsay Whitehurst in Washington, Sudhin Thanawala in Atlanta and Mike Catalini in Trenton, N.J., contributed to this story."

It\u2019s the first time in nearly 50 years a president has used one. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.\nThe letter was posted Friday morning on the X account of the White House Office of Management and Budget. It said the funding would be cut from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, an early target of Trump\u2019s efforts to cut foreign aid.\nIf the White House standardizes this move, the president could effectively bypass Congress on key spending choices and potentially throw into disarray efforts in the House and the Senate to keep the government funded when the next fiscal year starts in October.\nThe use of a pocket rescission fits part a broader pattern by the Trump administration to exact greater control over the U.S. government, eroding the power of Congress and agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others. The administration has already fired federal workers and imposed a historic increase in tariffs without going through Congress, putting the burden on the judicial branch to determine the limits of presidential power.\nA White House official, who insisted on anonymity on a call with reporters to discuss the move, declined to say how the administration might use pocket rescissions in the coming years or what the upper limits of it might be as a tool. The official expressed confidence the administration would prevail in any legal challenges and said a goal of the proposed spending cuts was to make the cleanest case possible for these types of clawbacks.\nWinding down USAID\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X that USAID is essentially being shuttered and congratulated White House budget director Russ Vought for managing the process.\n\u201cUSAID is officially in close out mode,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cRuss is now at the helm to oversee the closeout of an agency that long ago went off the rails.\u201d\nThe 1974 Impoundment Control Act gives the president the authority to propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Congress can within 45 days vote on pulling back the funds or sustaining them, but by proposing the rescission so close to Sept. 30 the White House argues that the money won\u2019t be spent and the funding lapses.\nWhat was essentially the last pocket rescission occurred in 1977 by Democratic then-President Jimmy Carter, and the Trump administration argues it\u2019s a legally permissible tool despite some murkiness as Carter had initially proposed the clawback well ahead of the 45-day deadline.\nPushback against pocket rescissions\nThe move by the Trump administration drew immediate backlash in parts of the Senate over its legality.\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement that the Constitution \u201cmakes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse\u201d and any effort to claw back funds \u201cwithout congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.\u201d\n\u201cInstead of this attempt to undermine the law, the appropriate way is to identify ways to reduce excessive spending through the bipartisan, annual appropriations process,\u201d Collins said. Congress approves rescissions regularly as part of this process.\u201d\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York warned that Trump\u2019s use of the pocket veto could undermine the normal funding process and risk \u201ca painful and entirely unnecessary shutdown.\u201d After all, any budget agreements reached in the Senate could lack authority if the Trump White House has the power to withhold spending as it sees fit.\nSchumer said in a statement that Republican leaders have yet to meet with Democrats on a path to fund the government after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 just as Trump tries an \u201cunlawful gambit to circumvent the Congress all together.\u201d\n\u201cBut if Republicans are insistent on going it alone, Democrats won\u2019t be party to their destruction,\u201d Schumer said.\n\u2018No exceptions\u2019\nEloise Pasachoff, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on federal spending issues, has written that the Impoundment Control Act allows rescissions only if Congress acts within 45 days, meaning the the White House alone cannot decide to not spend the funds.\n\u201cThis mandatory language admits no exceptions, indicating that Congress expects the funds to be used as intended before the end of the fiscal year if it does not approve the proposed rescission,\u201d Pasachoff wrote in an academic paper last year.\nWhat\u2019s in the funding?\nThe funds in the pocket rescission package include $3.2 billion in development assistance grants, $520 million for the United Nations, $838 million for international peacekeeping operations and $322 million to encourage democratic values in other countries.\nTrump had previously sought to get congressional backing for rescissions and succeeded in doing so in July when the House and the Senate approved $9 billion worth of cuts. Those rescissions clawed back funding for public broadcasting and foreign aid.\nThe Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America\u2019s reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs.\nIn February, the administration said it would eliminate almost all of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance abroad. USAID has since been dismantled, and its few remaining programs have been placed under State Department control.\nThe Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court on Wednesday to stop lower court decisions that had preserved foreign aid, including for global health and HIV and AIDS programs, that Trump has tried to freeze. But on Friday, the administration withdrew its appeal to the Supreme Court, after a favorable appeals court ruling late Thursday.\nThe New York Post first reported the pocket rescission.\n___\nAP writers Mark Sherman, Lindsay Whitehurst and Stephen Groves contributed to this report."

      "text": "The price of gold is at a record high. Here\u2019s why\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A gold rush is here. The precious metal hit an all time high this week.\nThe spot price for gold closed Tuesday above $2,514, according to data from FactSet. That\u2019s the highest closing price recorded for the commodity to date. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nWhat is the price of gold today?\nThe spot price of gold closed Tuesday at just over $2,514 per Troy ounce \u2014 the standard for measuring precious metals, which is equivalent to 31 grams. That would make a gold bar or brick weighing 400 Troy ounces worth more than $1 million today.\nThis week\u2019s record high means that the price of gold has climbed hundreds of dollars per Troy ounce over the last year. Tuesday\u2019s price is up nearly $620 from this time in 2023.\nWhy is the price of gold going up?\nThere are a few factors behind the recent gains.\nInterest in buying gold often comes at times of uncertainty \u2014 with potential concerns around inflation and the strength of the U.S. dollar, for example, causing some to look for alternative places to park their money. Gold also saw a surge in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGiovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the main drivers of recent gold gains have been the weaker U.S. dollar and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate next month. With particular concern focused on the health of the job market, all eyes will be on a Friday speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\nAnother factor is strong demand from central banks \u2014 which is currently well-above the five year average, notes Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council. Cavatoni says this \u201creflects heightened concern with inflation and economic stability.\u201d He also pointed to ongoing geopolitical tensions, among other factors, that have caused some to buy more gold recently.\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza have notably fueled uncertainty around the world. And numerous countries, including the United States, are also in the midst of a tumultuous election year \u2014 which could prove crucial to future economic policy.\nIs gold worth the investment?\nAdvocates of investing in gold call it a \u201csafe haven,\u201d arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.\nStaunovo\u2019s team at UBS forecasts the price of gold will reach $2,600 by this year\u2019s end \u2014 and $2,700 by mid-2025. UBS sees lower U.S. interest rates and the weaker dollar supporting inflows into gold ETFs, or exchange traded funds, consequently boosting investment demand.\nStill, future gains are never promised and not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isn\u2019t always the inflation hedge many say it is \u2014 and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as through derivative-based investments.\nThe Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \u201cwhen economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.\u201d\nIf you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, it\u2019s important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market."

But the analysis concluded that the department failed to prove it ran basic safety checks \u2014 like address or criminal background checks \u2014 on some adults who took in children. In about a third of the cases reviewed by the federal watchdog, the agency did not have legible documentation for the adults on file.\n\u201cWe found that children\u2019s case files and sponsor records were not always updated with important documentation and information,\u201d said Haley Lubeck, an analyst for the HHS Office of Inspector General, which conducted the review.\nThe federal health agency responded to the report by saying it has improved the process and the report only shows a limited window into how the agency handled cases \u201cduring an unprecedented influx.\u201d HHS said it has also added new training for its employees handling migrant children.\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of findings and recommendations address records management and documentation issues that (the agency) has already improved through training, monitoring, technology, and evaluation,\u201d said HHS spokesman Jeff Nesbit.\nThe report comes as President Joe Biden is facing intense pressure around his immigration policies. Since he took office, the administration has grappled with millions of migrants traveling to the border and faced scrutiny over how it handles children who arrive in the U.S. without parents. HHS, in particular, has been criticized for releasing those kids too quickly from government shelters, discharging them to adults who have allowed them to be exploited by major companies for cheap, dangerous, and illegal labor.\nThe federal watchdog analyzed the case files of more than 300 migrant children from early 2021, months after thousands of children had trekked to the U.S. border seeking asylum. In March and April of that year, HHS placed more than 16,000 children with adults.\nHHS is supposed to obtain IDs for the adults \u2013 called sponsors \u2013 who take in migrant children.\nBut the federal watchdog found that illegible IDs were submitted to HHS in more than a third of the cases analyzed during that time. Some IDs had missing holograms or blurry images, raising questions about whether they were forged documents.\nThe agency also failed to provide proof it had conducted basic safety checks \u2013 like background checks or address checks \u2013 in 16% of the cases, the watchdog found.\nAnd, for every five cases, HHS didn\u2019t follow up to check on the children it had placed, often for months.\nHHS is supposed to have a follow-up call with every child and their sponsor between 30 to 37 days after placement. But in cases where the agency failed to follow up with the children, it took on average about 122 days for a caseworker to reach out, the OIG\u2019s analysis found.\nThe OIG\u2019s investigations have previously found that the administration rushed to respond to the migrant surge in 2021, failing to adequately train staff dealing with the cases of children.\nAdvocates called on both the White House and Congress to do more to protect children in the future.\n\u201cProtecting children must remain paramount,\u201d said Jennie Murray, President and CEO of the National Immigration Forum in a statement. \u201cHHS and the Biden administration more broadly must take these findings seriously and do everything in their power to ensure that children are safe.\u201d\nMurray said Congress, in addition to providing oversight, should provide resources to make sure agencies can properly screen sponsors and protect the children in their care.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to fix the percentage of cases that did not have basic safety checks from 15% to 16%."

      "text": "A chaotic raid, 360 arrests, and a tragic death: What happened at California\u2019s Glass House Farms\nA chaotic raid, 360 arrests, and a tragic death: What happened at California\u2019s Glass House Farms\nFederal authorities now say they arrested more than 360 people at two Southern California marijuana farms last week, characterizing the raids as one of the largest operations since President Donald Trump took office in January.\nOne farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse roof during the chaotic raids on Thursday after the Department of Homeland Security executed criminal search warrants at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria, northwest of Los Angeles.\nThe raids came more than a month into an extended crackdown across Southern California that was originally centered on Los Angeles, where local officials say the federal actions are spreading fear in immigrant communities.\nA federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles. On Monday, the Justice Department appealed, calling the order \u201cindefensible on every level.\u201d\n\u201cOf course reasonable suspicion is required for a stop, but an injunction repeating that constitutional standard is an impermissibly vague follow-the-law injunction,\u201d the Justice Department said in a filing to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. \u201cThe Fourth Amendment imposes a totality-of-the-circumstances test, and it is entirely possible that one\u2019s language, location, or type of work could be relevant in a particular factual context. Trying to develop bright-line rules in this context is a fool\u2019s errand.\u201d\nWhat happened on the farms\nDuring the raid on the Camarillo site, crowds gathered seeking information about their relatives and to protest immigration enforcement. Authorities clad in military-style helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators, and people ultimately retreated amid acrid green-and-white billowing smoke.\nGlass House Brands is a major cannabis company in California that started a decade ago with a greenhouse in the Santa Barbara County community of Carpinteria.\nThe company said it later expanded, buying another facility in the Ventura County community of Camarillo that included six tomato and cucumber-growing greenhouses. Glass House converted two of them to grow cannabis, according to the company\u2019s website.\nRelatives of workers at the Camarillo site said tomatoes are still grown at the location in addition to cannabis.\nArrest numbers keep rising\nThe federal government initially reported that some 200 people suspected of being in the country illegally were arrested.\nThen on Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said 319 people were arrested and said on X it was \u201cquickly becoming one of the largest operations since President Trump took office.\u201d\nA day later, the arrest numbers, according to the Department of Homeland Security, were up to 361 from the two locations.\nThe government said four of the 361 arrested had prior criminal records, including convictions for rape and kidnapping.\nOne death reported from the raids\nA farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during the raid at the farm in Camarillo died Saturday of his injuries.\nJaime Alanis, 57, is the first known fatality during one of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing immigration enforcement operations. Yesenia Duran, Alanis\u2019 niece, confirmed his death to The Associated Press.\nShe posted on the fundraising site GoFundMe that her uncle was his family\u2019s only provider and he had been sending his earnings back to a wife and daughter in Mexico. Alanis worked at the farm for 10 years, his family said.\nHe called his wife in Mexico and told her he was hiding from federal agents during the raid Thursday. A doctor told his relatives that the ambulance crew who took him to a hospital said he fell about 30 feet (9 meters), Duran said.\nWhy was the business raided\nThe government says it is investigating potential child labor, human trafficking and other abuse. Initially, DHS said 10 immigrant children were on the property. They later increased that number to 14.\nAuthorities declined to share the warrant for the operation. The administration has released no additional information about the children, including their ages and what they were doing on the property when authorities arrived. DHS has not provided details to back up its claim of possible trafficking or other abuse, and the company has not been charged with anything.\nIt was unclear if any of the minors were the children of farm workers at the sites or if they came to the U.S. without an adult.\nFederal and state laws allow children as young as 12 to work in agriculture under certain conditions, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In California, children as young as 12 can work on farms outside of school hours, while those as young as 16 can work during school hours if they are not required to attend school, the agency said on its website.\nNo one under the age of 21 is allowed to work in the cannabis industry.\nThe California Department of Cannabis Control conducted a site visit in May 2025 and observed no minors on the premises, a spokesperson said. After receiving a subsequent complaint, the state opened an investigation to ensure full compliance with state law.\nU.S. citizens were among those arrested\nFour U.S. citizens were arrested during the raids for allegedly \u201cassaulting or resisting officers,\u201d according to DHS, and authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of a person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents.\nAmong those arrested was California State University Channel Islands professor Jonathan Caravello, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli posted on X.\nEssayli said Caravello was arrested for throwing a tear gas canister at law enforcement and was to appear in court Tuesday.\nThe California Faculty Association said Caravello was taken away by agents who did not identify themselves nor inform him of why he was being arrested. The association said he was then held without being able to contact his family.\nCaravello was attempting to dislodge a tear gas canister that was stuck underneath someone\u2019s wheelchair, witnesses told KABC-TV, the ABC affiliate in Los Angeles.\nA federal judge on Monday ordered Caravello to be released on $15,000 bond. He\u2019s scheduled to be arraigned August 1.\nSeparately, the federal Bureau of Prisons said George Retes, 25, was in their custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles from Thursday to Sunday.\nRetes\u2019 family told KABC-TV on Sunday that he is a U.S. citizen, works as a security guard at the farm in Camarillo and is a disabled U.S. Army veteran. They said Retes was trying to drive away during the clashes between protesters and agents when an officer stopped him, broke his car window and shot pepper spray before dragging him out of his car and arresting him.\nRetes\u2019 sister, Destinee Maga\u00f1a, told the television station on Sunday that the family had been trying to get in touch with her brother.\nFederal agents \u201cthought he was probably part of the protest, but he wasn\u2019t, he was trying to reverse his car,\u201d Maga\u00f1a said.\nNeither Retes nor Maga\u00f1a responded to emails Monday from the AP seeking comment.\nThe region prepares for more raids\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is now proposing to provide cash assistance to residents too scared to leave their homes to go to work.\nThe plan comes as part of a sweeping executive order the mayor signed the day after the Camarillo raid that instructs Los Angeles officials \u201cto bolster their protocols and training to prepare for federal immigration activity occurring on city property.\u201d\nThe order also establishes a police department working group for immigrants and expands access to resources for impacted families. In addition, it seeks records from the federal government on what the city deems unlawful raids from federal agencies.\nThe monetary relief will not come from city funds but from philanthropic partners, officials said. Immigrant rights groups will distribute cash cards similar to those used to provide financial assistance to Angelenos struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how people will qualify to receive the cards.\nThe goal is to help people who have been deterred \u201cfrom attending school and church, seeking city services, accessing health care, and going to work,\u201d the order states.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report."

      "text": "Gold soars to a new high as economic uncertainty deepens. Here\u2019s what to know\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 As economic uncertainty deepens worldwide, gold prices have notched more and more record highs.\nThat\u2019s because gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek \u201csafe havens\u201d for parking their money. Gold\u2019s current rally arrives as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to announce new tariffs on economic allies and foes alike, roiling financial markets into volatility and threatening to reignite inflation for families and businesses alike.\nOn Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said that outlooks for economies worldwide, including the U.S., have significantly worsened in the wake of Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs and the uncertainty they have created. And Trump\u2019s recent threats suggesting he can remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have only put investors more on edge.\nIf trends continue, analysts say the price of gold could continue to climb into unprecedented territory.\nHere\u2019s what to know.\nWhat\u2019s the price of gold today?\nThe going price for New York spot gold hit a record $3,424.24 per troy ounce \u2014 the standard for measuring precious metals \u2014 as of close Monday. That\u2019s about $1,097 higher than a year ago.\nThe price of spot gold is up more than 30% since the start of 2025, per the data firm FactSet. By contrast, the stock market has tumbled. The benchmark S&P 500 is down over 12% this year.\nGold futures also reached a record early Tuesday, briefly surpassing the $3,500 mark for the first time before falling back below $3,400 by late afternoon.\nWhy is the price of gold going up?\nA lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying gold typically spikes when investors become anxious \u2014 and there\u2019s been a lot of economic turmoil in recent months.\nThe heaviest uncertainty lies with Trump\u2019s escalating trade wars. The president\u2019s on-again, off-again new levy announcements and retaliatory tariffs from some of the nation\u2019s closest traditional allies have created a sense of whiplash for both businesses and consumers \u2014 who economists say will foot the bill through higher prices.\nConsumer confidence and global economic outlooks have deteriorated as a result. On Tuesday, the IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%. And for the U.S. specifically, the fund expects growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7%. China, which currently faces the heaviest levies from the U.S., is also expected to see weakened growth.\nLast week, Trump also renewed threats suggesting he could remove Powell \u2014 and has since stepped up his public criticism of the Fed chair for not cutting interest rates. Any attempt to unseat Powell would likely set off a crisis in global financial markets over fears that a less independent Fed could struggle to keep inflation under control \u2014 making investors all the more anxious.\nOver the last year, analysts have also pointed to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid other ongoing geopolitical tensions, including the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\nIs gold worth the investment?\nAdvocates of investing in gold call it a \u201csafe haven\u201d \u2014 arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.\nStill, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isn\u2019t always the inflation hedge many say it is \u2014 and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.\nThe Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \u201cwhen economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.\u201d\nAnd even gold\u2019s current rally has seen some volatility. The price of spot gold fell for several days following Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement on April 2, for example.\nIf you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, it\u2019s important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market."

      "text": "Review of decision not to award Space Command to Alabama inconclusive, with Trump reversal expected\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With the Trump administration expected to reverse a controversial 2023 decision on the permanent location of U.S. Space Command, a review by the Defense Department inspector general could not determine why Colorado was chosen over Alabama.\nThe inspector general\u2019s report, issued Friday, said this was in part due to a lack of access to senior defense officials during the Biden administration, when the review began.\nThe location of U.S. Space Command has significant implications for the local economy, given the fast growth in national defense spending in space-based communications and defenses.\nIn 2021, the Air Force identified Army Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, as the preferred location for the new U.S. Space Command due to cost and other factors. But a temporary headquarters had already been established in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and after multiple delays President Joe Biden announced it as the permanent headquarters.\nAlabama\u2019s Republican congressional delegation accused the Biden administration of politicizing the decision. But Colorado, which has Republican and Democratic lawmakers, is home to many other Air Force and U.S. Space Force facilities.\nAs recently as last week, Rep. Mike Rogers House, an Alabama Republican who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, told a panel at Auburn University he expects the decision to be reversed by the White House before the end of April.\nThe location of Space Command would be one of many decisions that have swung back and forth between Biden and President Donald Trump. For instance, Biden stopped the construction of the border wall that began during Trump\u2019s first term, only to have Trump now vow to complete it. And Trump is again seeking to ban transgender troops from serving in the military, after Biden removed Trump\u2019s first-term limitations.\nThe controversy over the basing decision began seven days before Trump\u2019s first term expired, when his Air Force secretary announced Alabama would be home to Space Command, pending an environmental review.\nThat review was completed about six months into Biden\u2019s term and found no significant impact with hosting the command in Alabama. But the new administration did not act on the decision.\nInstead, a year later, the Biden White House said it was keeping the headquarters in Colorado Springs, citing the time that would be lost relocating staff and the headquarters to Huntsville.\nThe report said interviews has been requested with Biden\u2019s Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to understand why Huntsville was not named, but the Biden White House would only allow the interviews if administration lawyers were present. The inspector general rejected that condition, saying it could affect its unfettered access to information."

About $1.1 billion was destined for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which finances NPR and PBS, though most of that money is distributed to more than 1,500 local public radio and television stations around the country.\nThe White House had billed the legislation as a test case for Congress and said more such rescission packages would be on the way.\nSome Republicans were uncomfortable with the cuts, yet supported them anyway, wary of crossing Trump or upsetting his agenda. Democrats unanimously rejected the cuts but were powerless to stop them.\nThe White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. Conservatives particularly directed their ire at NPR and PBS. Lawmakers with large rural constituencies voiced grave concern about what the cuts to public broadcasting could mean for some local public stations in their state. Some stations will have to close, they warned.\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the stations are \u201cnot just your news \u2014 it is your tsunami alert, it is your landslide alert, it is your volcano alert.\u201d\nOn the foreign aid cuts, the White House argued that they would incentivize other nations to step up and do more to respond to humanitarian crises and that the rescissions best served the American taxpayer.\nDemocrats argued that the Republican administration\u2019s animus toward foreign aid programs would hurt America\u2019s standing in the world and create a vacuum for China to fill. They also expressed concerns that the cuts would have deadly consequences for many of the world\u2019s most impoverished people.\n\u201cWith these cuts, we will cause death, spread disease and deepen starvation across the planet,\u201d said Sen.
