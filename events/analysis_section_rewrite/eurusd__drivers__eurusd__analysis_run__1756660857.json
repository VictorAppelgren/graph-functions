      "feedback": "**Actionable edit plan (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Consolidate the narrative**: Merge the two “base case” paragraphs into a single, linear causal chain: fed_policy → ust10y → term‑premium → dxy. 2. **Add explicit canonical mappings**: label each driver with its handle (e.g., fed_policy, us_inflation, ust10y, dxy) and state the sign/magnitude in parentheses: dxy ↓ 200 bp (to 95.8) or dxy ↑ 50–100 bp (to ≈ 99.8). 3. **Insert precise CPI expectation**: state “CPI > 3.0 % (vs. 2.9 % forecast)” and cite (XTQIQRP5K)(Z7O1DCHS7). 4. **Quantify risk factors**: list each risk with a numeric impact on dxy or ust10y (e.g., Fed hike + 0.25 % → dxy ↑ ≈ 30 bp; CPI < 3.0 % → dxy ↓ ≈ 30 bp; tariff easing – 50 % → dxy ↓ ≈ 20 bp; war‑risk sentiment drop → dxy ↓ ≈ 15 bp). 5. **Add a concise watch‑list** (bullet‑point, 4–5 items):  \n   - 2025‑08‑15 CPI (≥ 3.0 %)  \n   - 2025‑08‑30 PCE (≥ 3.0 %)  \n   - 2025‑08‑31 NFP (≥ expected)  \n   - 2025‑09‑17 Fed policy meeting (cut vs. hold)  \n   - 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (≥ 57 bp steepening vs. < 30 bp flattening).  \n   Each bullet should include the expected dxy move and citation. 6. **Remove drift**: delete any sentence that references assets outside the focus (e.g., “US inflation expectations influence ust10y” is fine only if framed as a driver; otherwise re‑phrase to keep the focus on dxy). 7. **Standardize naming**: use lowercase snake_case for drivers (fed_policy, us_inflation) and asset handles (dxy, ust10y). 8. **Ensure every claim has a citation**: double‑check that the added risk percentages and watch‑list items are backed by the provided IDs (e.g., (Z7O1DCHS7), (7XH2DKEKV), (LF0UUL917)). 9. **Trim redundancies**: remove repeated statements about “short‑term upside hinges on PCE/NFP” and “Fed policy decisions directly set short‑term rate environment” once, then refer to them in the watch‑list. 10. **Finalize**: proofread for clarity, keep the paragraph under 200 words, and verify that the view remains “moderate‑high confidence” with the stated fragilities.",
