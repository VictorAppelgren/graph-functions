      "feedback": "Concrete, world‑class edit brief (compact, single‑paragraph form): overhaul the piece into a true multi‑year regime framework by anchoring to invariant first‑principles (e.g., a core inflation anchor near 0.30–0.40% MoM as JPMorgan treats the near‑term CPI path; consider long‑horizon real rate differentials and policy reaction functions as the engine of regime shifts), then map a three‑regime/transitions scenario with explicit triggers and transition conditions; tighten the causal chain from tariff pass‑through into consumer prices and corporate margins, through Fed/-rate pricing, to equity pricing and sectoral dynamics (cite GB4W1L6J1 for CPI path and tariff impulse; 22PL3Q360 for Ford’s cyclical/EV caveats); build a base case and at least two clear alternative paths with thresholds (e.g., if core CPI prints 0.25–0.30% MoM or 0.40%+ MoM, or tariff pass‑through worsens, then rates/risk premia reprice); quantify what “range‑bound S&P” means in probability terms and price ranges (reference JPMorgan’s CPI scenarios in GB4W1L6J1 and Ford’s cyclicality/margin data in 22PL3Q360); reconcile conflicts (Ford’s cyclical risk vs. EV profitability risk vs. macro inflation signals) by showing how each source informs a hedge‑and‑growth stance; strengthen the household/firm transmission channel with the O’Leary rules as a micro anchor for resilience in inflationary, slow‑growth regimes (cite 2QRLB974F, 1GVYF2V8O) and couple that with the long‑horizon retiree cost pressures (cite YVQU6QCY4); sharpen “what to watch” to CPI prints, Jackson Hole communications, tariff developments, and EV/margin trajectories; separate macro from micro angles to avoid mixing GoBankingRates consumer tips with macro regime analysis; ensure every substantive claim carries a source tag (GB4W1L6J1, 22PL3Q360, 2QRLB974F, 1GVYF2V8O, YVQU6QCY4, etc.) and add explicit footnote links in revised draft; finally, replace vague prose with precise language, add a concise base‑case paragraph under the inferred regime map, and include a short “invalidations” line outlining three concrete shocks that would derail the base‑case path.",
