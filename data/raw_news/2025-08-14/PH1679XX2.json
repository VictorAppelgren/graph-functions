  "title": "From nightmare to no problem: How workers in two cities handled Phillies' travel debacle",
  "description": "The Philadelphia Phillies got stuck in Cincinnati area because of plane trouble. But workers in two cities got them ready for game in Washington.",
  "content": "\u2022 The Philadelphia Phillies had to stay overnight in the Cincinnati area because of plane trouble.\n\u2022 The Phillies staff scrambled to find a hotel where the team could spend the night.\n\u2022 The Phillies arrived in the D.C. area Thursday afternoon, and the Nationals clubhouse crew rushed to get their uniforms ready for gametime.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 It was already a long and grim day in Cincinnati for the Philadelphia Phillies: Their series finale against the Reds was delayed an hour by rain, they got steamrolled 8-0 and faced a quick turnaround to get to the nation\u2019s capital for a four-game series.\n\nSo as manager Rob Thomson settled into his seat on the Phillies\u2019 charter flight to Dulles International Airport, he nodded off easily. Twice. And both times he woke up, he thought they had landed in the D.C. area.\n\nTurns out they hadn\u2019t budged an inch - and the team\u2019s travel nightmare was just beginning.\n\nThe Phillies sat on the tarmac in northern Kentucky for more than five hours as maintenance and repairs were performed on their plane. But as Wednesday turned to Thursday and the issues remained, the Phillies got the order that so many commercial travelers dread after time spent idling:\n\nDeplane. Find a place to sleep. Those are the breaks.\n\nAnd thus began a significant disruption to the delicate rhythm that gets ballplayers, staff and a truckload of equipment from City A to City B overnight and ready to roll the next evening.\n\nInstead, it set off a wild scramble in both Cincinnati and Washington.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s baseball. These things happen sometimes,\u201d says Thomson, a proverbial baseball lifer. \u201cYou can\u2019t control it so you just keep moving forward.\n\n\u201cReally, the MVPs last night were Jameson Hall and Sean Bowers and Michael Roche. They did a heck of a job taking care of us.\u201d\n\nThat would be the Phillies\u2019 traveling secretary, clubhouse assistant and manager of team travel, respectively. With the team already checked out of its Cincinnati-area hotel, the travel gurus managed to finagle more than 50 rooms at a Marriott overlooking the Ohio River.\n\nEver peer out your hotel window, ponder the nice view yet realize you\u2019ll only be there a hot second? That was the Phillies.\n\n\u201cIt was actually pretty nice. On the water, nice view,\u201d says Phillies closer Jordan Romano. \u201cThat was kind of cool. They were accommodating, getting 50, 60 people in there.\u201d\n\nYet that was just half the equation.\n\nIn an ideal world, the Phillies would be hitting their pillows in D.C. around 1:30 a.m., just about the same time a truckload of dirty laundry, baseball gear and supplies rolled up to Nationals Park for the visiting clubhouse crew to attack.\n\nInstead, the clubbies at Nationals Park waited in vain, well past the estimated arrival time before calling it a night. And that created a fire drill of logistics for Thursday.\n\nThe Phillies snagged a few hours of sleep in their very temporary digs, got the word around 11 a.m. that their replacement plane was secured and were on a bus back to the airport by noon.\n\nTwo hours later, they landed at Dulles and actually beat their equipment to the ballpark.\n\nAround 3:30, the truck arrived and clubhouse workers furiously laundered and dried and distributed their gear, piecemeal. Perhaps a preferred warm-up shirt was ready, but sliding pants were in another load of laundry. That kind of thing.\n\nMeanwhile, room keys for their D.C. hotel were dropped on chairs at locker stalls. Checking in would come much later, after their 6:45 p.m. tilt with the Nationals.\n\nSure, big leaguers travel in the lap of luxury and avoid 95% of the hassles the hoi polloi endure for business or pleasure. Yet when things go awry, they\u2019re at the mercy of the power of teamwork.\n\nFinally, just a couple hours before first pitch, the Phillies and their gear were whole, everything in its place, thanks to an all-hands effort from Nationals staff.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re grinders already, working hard,\u201d Romano says as an attendant hung items in his locker. \u201cAnd they\u2019re grinding hard today.\u201d",
