      "text": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce reportedly spotted house-hunting in Ohio \u2014 here are the ritziest areas even an A-lister could love\nLovebirds Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have reportedly toured at least two homes in Cleveland\u2019s Eastside suburbs in June.\nThe pop icon and football star were seen having lunch at a cute French bistro in Chagrin Falls, an idyllic village near Kelce\u2019s hometown in Cleveland Heights.\nSources told The Post that local consensus puts the pair in Hunting Valley, Ohio for their house hunt. The village in the Chagrin River Valley is known for its palatial properties and a 5 acre minimum.\nWhile the median sale price in Cleveland is just $131,675, prices skyrocket in these outer suburbs. Trust funds and lacrosse scholarships abound in areas like historic Shaker Heights, bucolic Waite Hill, ritzy Hunting Valley and affluent Bratenahl \u2014 all of which potentially boast the perfect home for a post-NFL retirement and another feather in Swift\u2019s $80 million real estate cap.\nDavid Ayers of The Agency compared the idyllic Eastside villages under the couple\u2019s potential consideration to the Hudson Valley in New York, for one sixteenth of the price.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very stealth wealth, old money, and it\u2019s really an amazingly kept secret that no one knows about,\u201d Ayers told The Post.\nHoward Hanna broker Adam Kaufman sells some of the area\u2019s most expensive properties. Kaufman was skeptical of the pair\u2019s prospective purchase, despite their dining adventure in Chagrin Falls.\n\u201cI think that rumor got going, and it really just escalated,\u201d Kaufman said.\nBut Cleveland and its suburbs would, hypothetically, have a lot to offer the jet-setting couple, he added. The city offers a thriving arts scene, with enviable theatrical and orchestral offerings.\n\u201cIt is an amazing place, and it\u2019s really starting to get the recognition it deserves,\u201d he said, pointing to a strong seller\u2019s market in the area.\nBut should the pair consider an Ohio home, there are more than a few solid contenders.\nA stately manor in Hunting Valley\nThis sprawling estate in Hunting Valley comes with a private tennis court, a swimming pool and more than 7.5 acres of lush green land. Originally built in 1924, the $3.45 million property evokes \u201cgrandeur of a bygone era,\u201d according to The Agency listing.\nA Hamptons-style estate in Chagrin Falls\nThe village of Chagrin Falls, the site of Swift and Kelce\u2019s buzzy lunch date, hosts this custom-built \u201cHamptons style\u201d home on 2 riverside acres. The $6.5 million Howard Hanna listing features tasteful interiors across a roomy 13,600 square feet, including a two-island kitchen, four bedroom suites, a wine cellar and a guest house.\nA modern mansion in Moreland Hills\nThis contemporary home located half an hour from Cleveland comes with 2.44 acres of land and more than 16,000 square feet of living space. The $6.25 million listing, held by The Agency, dubs the property a \u201ccontemporary masterpiece,\u201d with open-concept living spaces, soaring ceilings and an impressive pool.\nA classic English tudor\nAnother possibility in Chagrin Falls comes with old English charm. The circa-1917 manor, listed by Howard Hanna for $3.39 million, comes with 24 acres of river frontage and a striking Tudor facade. The roughly 8,000-square-foot home features beamed vaulted ceilings, stately fireplaces and a billiards room.\nA Lake Eerie oasis\nThis Gilded Age \u201cgrande dame\u201d for $5.99 million is filled with modern upgrades and old world craftsmanship. The 3.5-acre, eight-bedroom property on the coast of Lake Erie boasts intricately carved millwork, cut glass leaded windows and marble flooring throughout its grand public rooms. The luxe Bratenahl property, listed by The Agency, also comes with a restored guest cottage and a massive pool patio."

No puns. Just straight information.\nRemember when Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were spotted at Jojo's in Chagrin Falls? Other outlets were content with that celebrity sighting. News that these two humans actually do exist. Or the breaking news that they eat food -- subsisting on calories, like the rest of us sacks of \"muscle\" and fat, to fuel metabolism and get through their day. Or that they would choose to consume those calories in Chagrin Falls.\nNot us. Not here at Scene. We dug deeper. Because the two not only eat, but they also live places. With roofs. Pools. Beds. High-end appliances. Lead-free pipes. And Cleveland has at least three places that qualify in that regard.\nSo, we channeled our inner Ed Gallek and we learned more: Multiple sources have confirmed to Scene that Swift and Kelce visited at least two opulent homes currently for sale in Northeast Ohio's tony eastside suburbs on that visit. The kind of places where wealth is abundant and babies are born with fully funded 529 accounts just in case they don't get a lacrosse scholarship or decide to forego higher education altogether to pursue dressage full time.\nWould the romantic pair be prepared to plunk down a sliver of their combined wealth on a house in Cleveland? (In case you hadn't heard, Travis Kelce is from Cleveland Heights?)\nOr, is mansion shopping for the uber wealthly something akin to scrolling Instagram for the rest of us?\nSwift owns multiple properties. What's one more?\nAnd why not Brook Park? They could buy close to the proposed Browns dome and enjoy seasonal patio cocktails at a Haslam-owned sports bar beneath a landing 737, the noise of which would preclude paparazzi from eavesdropping on their conversations. (But which wouldn't prevent lip readers from clueing in on their chats and figuring out that Travis is self conscious about his haircuts.)\nSwift, having finished her Eras Tour, doesn't have to work for the forseeable future. (We're guessing at least six or seven months.) And Kelce is a season away from retirement and a quiet exit into private life, if you ignore the podcast, endless commercials and probable future in sports commentary.\nCould a Northeast Ohio sabbatical be in the offing?\nLet the rampant speculation begin. Because this isn't Bill Cowher in Strongsville. These are cold, hard facts from your friends at Scene.\nSubscribe to Cleveland Scene newsletters.\nFollow us: Apple News | Google News | NewsBreak | Reddit | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter | Or sign up for our RSS Feed"
