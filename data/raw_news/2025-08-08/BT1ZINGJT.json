  "title": "Levi Colwill is fundamental to Chelsea on many levels \u2013 replacing him will be tough",
  "description": "Levi Colwill will miss a lot of the 2025-26 season after tearing his ACL",
  "content": "If anyone needs a reminder of just how dizzyingly \u2014 and, at times, brutally \u2014 fast football moves, consider that less than two weeks ago, Levi Colwill was talking about competing for the Premier League title with Chelsea this season, and how he felt about an impending Champions League debut at his boyhood club.\n\n\u201cWhen that anthem comes on, it is going to be a dream,\u201d he told The Athletic at a pre-season friendly between Sholing FC and Chelsea Under-18s. \u201cI could get a bit emotional, to be honest.\u201d\n\nThat particular dream is going to have to wait, and Colwill would only be human if he had got more than a bit emotional in the days since he felt his knee give way towards the end of Chelsea\u2019s first pre-season training session at their Cobham HQ on Monday.\n\nA scan confirmed he had torn his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), but footballers tend to know immediately when something is badly wrong. Enzo Maresca\u2019s ominous words in his press conference at Cobham on Thursday left little room to avoid the conclusion that Colwill had suffered a significant injury.\n\n\u201cWe know each other from last year, and we know how important he has been,\u201d Maresca said. \u201cI spoke with Levi yesterday (Wednesday) and I told him that if we achieved what we achieved last year, it\u2019s also because of him.\u201d\n\nColwill\u2019s absence from Chelsea\u2019s trophy celebration in front of several thousand supporters at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday provided the first public indication that something was amiss. A club statement issued on Thursday evening attempted to soften the blow while confirming the reality: \u201cLevi Colwill has today undergone successful surgery to an anterior cruciate ligament injury.\u201d\n\nThere are many sentiments deployed at moments like this, most of them empty. The timing is awful for Colwill before a Chelsea season rich with promise, leading into a World Cup where he could credibly start for England. But then, there is never a good time for a footballer to tear their ACL, given the long and gruelling nature of the rehabilitation process.\n\nFor some, it will feel worse because Colwill gives every impression of being one of football\u2019s genuine good guys, devoting his time and his money to Sholing and the new academy that bears his name, as well as organising a training session for children while on holiday in Trinidad. But good, bad or anything in between, it is always a sporting tragedy when football is deprived of an elite talent in this manner.\n\nMany will express the belief that Colwill can emerge stronger from this, but that is a reach for reassurance rather than a reliable predictor. Even in 2025, injuries as severe as a torn ACL or ruptured Achilles can disrupt and even derail athletes\u2019 careers. As a Chelsea player, Colwill will have every available resource to achieve a full recovery to elite competition, but there is no escaping the physical and mental challenges that lie ahead.\n\nPerhaps the most effective source of comfort to Colwill in the coming weeks and months will be the difficulty Chelsea have replacing him.\n\nLast season, he emerged as the foundation of Maresca\u2019s defence, playing more than twice as many Premier League minutes as any of the other centre-backs in the squad. His recognition of defensive danger sharpened with greater experience, and he warmed to the physical demands of battling opposing strikers. He formed effective partnerships with Wesley Fofana, Tosin Adarabioyo and fellow Cobham graduate Trevoh Chalobah, adjusting subtly to fit with each.\n\nOn the ball, his ability to punch progressive passes through opposition lines gave Maresca\u2019s patient build-up style a more direct option it desperately needed against low blocks. Colwill\u2019s unflappable assurance was critical to the team\u2019s success in playing out from the back through intense pressure.\n\nPut together, it is a rare, coveted skill set for a centre-back, which is why Liverpool and Brighton tried hard to prise Colwill away from Stamford Bridge in the weeks before he signed a new long-term contract in the summer of 2023. It is also why Chelsea rebuffed all advances and always insisted they considered him untouchable, as he has been ever since.\n\nThen there is Colwill\u2019s strength of personality, which always stood out in one of the youngest squads ever assembled. No other regular Chelsea starter could be relied upon so consistently to field questions from the media after a match, win, lose or draw, and few others were as loud or outwardly forceful on the pitch.\n\nWithin the squad, there are no easy solutions. Tosin and Chalobah have both grown in stature and performance in this Chelsea squad in recent months, but are untested as a partnership in the Premier League. Benoit Badiashile has not proven as reliable as Colwill despite being regarded as a close to equivalent talent when he arrived from Monaco in January 2023.\n\nFofana is arguably Chelsea\u2019s most gifted defender, but the 24-year-old has also spent much of his time at Stamford Bridge on the sidelines. Summer signing Jorrel Hato has some similarities to Colwill in profile \u2014 left-footed, elegant on the ball, shorter but faster \u2014 but elevating the 19-year-old to the status of Premier League starting centre-back so soon would be a big call. The same could be said of another 19-year-old, Josh Acheampong, who Maresca has generally preferred to pick at right-back.\n\nThe transfer market will always be a consideration for Chelsea at a time like this, but any exploration must be tinged with wariness of radically altering the dynamic at the heart of Maresca\u2019s defence for the long term. Until he went down this week, Colwill was a fundamental component of the core that is powering the team\u2019s sharp upward trajectory.\n\nAny defensive plan that Chelsea decide upon in what remains of August must allow for the desired scenario that Colwill is fundamental again as soon as he returns.",

      "text": "Levi Colwill was enjoying a much-earned holiday in Trinidad before cutting it short to attend a pre-season friendly between non-league Sholing FC and Chelsea Under-18s last Saturday.\n\u201cI had a manic journey to get here,\u201d he tells The Athletic. \u201cI missed a connecting flight in Miami due to the airline. I had to find another plane to get me to Paris and then from there to London. I was travelling for over 24 hours, but I wanted to get back for this.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThose unaware of Colwill\u2019s affinity to Sholing FC, who play in the Southern League Premier Division South (the seventh tier of English football), may be wondering why the centre-half would be prepared to do such a thing. Colwill\u2019s summer break began less than two weeks earlier due to being part of the Chelsea side that beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 to win the Club World Cup on July 13.\nBut Colwill is driven by a desire to help children. The Athletic was last at Sholing FC in December when an open trial was held to find recruits for the new Levi Colwill Academy (LSC Academy), which officially gets under way in September. As revealed back then, the 22-year-old has also funded the cost of a new 3G pitch for the club, and Saturday\u2019s fixture against Chelsea was the grand opening for the new playing surface.\nA club record 1,888 were in attendance. At half-time, a proud Colwill walked round the pitch with some of the youngsters who will make up the first class at the LSC Academy.\n\u201cBeing here was a priority for me,\u201d Colwill says. \u201cA lot of hard work has been put in, not just from me, but from my family. We know how much this is going to help the LSC Academy, too. I am so excited to launch it \u2014 everything around it is so positive. I couldn\u2019t not be here. This is one of the best days of my life; the turnout has been amazing.\n\u201cWhen I was walking round with the academy boys on the pitch at half-time, it just felt so good. You could see all the people having a good time, greeting us as we went round. It just felt all part of the plan to give something back, but it is just the start.\u201d\nColwill\u2019s connection to Sholing FC, which is on the outskirts of Southampton, is an understandable one. He grew up nearby, and his uncles have played for the club. One of them, Daniel Mason, scored a superb free kick to help his side beat Chelsea\u2019s youngsters 2-0 on the day, a goal which brought a huge smile to Colwill\u2019s face.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Sholing FC,\u201d Colwill insists. \u201cI want to help as many underprivileged kids as possible. I thought to myself, \u2018How am I going to do that?\u2019. Football is all I know. I grew up as an underprivileged kid. I came to Sholing FC games and enjoyed them. It made me happy and made me want to become a footballer.\n\u201cIf I can help bring a load of kids to come down to an event like this, to enjoy being here, to fall in love with the game, that can change their lives. They can perhaps do something else rather than being on the streets. That\u2019s the main reason.\n\u201cI went into the dressing room after the game and thanked the players because there are so many kids out there who have not been as lucky as me. Life could have been different for me, so if I can help as many as possible, give them a new ambition to aim for, that\u2019s what I want to do in life.\n\u201cI also did something when I was on holiday in Trinidad. I organised a training session out there with some kids who were all from my grandma\u2019s local area. My nan flew out with me. A few hundred people turned up. We bought the goals and so on out of my back pocket, just to give them something else to enjoy. Doing this drives me. I want to leave a legacy and have people be proud of me.\u201d\nNo one should be concerned about the off-the-pitch endeavours being a negative distraction for Colwill. For example, several people are working at the LSC Academy, which is run by his uncle Daniel with the support of first-team coach Ross White.\nColwill adds: \u201cWe have a group chat on WhatsApp with me, my uncles and the staff. They are the ones doing things on a day-to-day basis. I want to know what\u2019s going on and will say something if I need to, but I have full trust in them because they are really good people.\n\u201cIf one of the players goes on from the academy to have a pro career at any level, it would mean as much as things I have done myself. If I have influenced them to do that, hopefully they will do something similar when they get older and help the kids in their community, too. That\u2019s all I want, to build a chain of giving back and helping.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nColwill is used to being asked for autographs and selfies when he attends Sholing FC matches, but this seems like another level. He is inundated with requests throughout the afternoon and does hundreds with a grin on his face. Perhaps it is not that surprising that hundreds approach him, with Chelsea supporters also in attendance. But you suspect being a world champion has boosted his profile even further.\nHe will return, like the rest of Chelsea\u2019s senior squad, to pre-season training next week, but the success enjoyed in America this month has already been consigned to the past.\nWhen asked how he feels to be called a world champion, he replies: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel real. It\u2019s not like I sit there and think, \u2018Ah, we won this and that\u2019. I have realised that when you win things, life doesn\u2019t change. My goal is to win as many things as possible, so I am not going to be hung up on this. I need to move on and plan for the next.\n\u201cThis is a feeling shared in the dressing room. We have an elite mindset in our team, and this is what we need to do. The Premier League restarts in less than a month, and we need to start preparing for that.\u201d\nFew gave Chelsea a chance of beating Champions League holders PSG in the final. In many ways, you could understand why. The Ligue 1 side had put six goals (combined) past Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in the previous two rounds without conceding a goal.\nBeing written off proved great motivation. Chelsea swept PSG aside with a style of football that should ensure they will be taken a lot more seriously in future.\nFinishing the season with 14 wins from 16 games also showed a sustained level of consistency for the first time since the Todd Boehly-Clearlake consortium took over in 2022. It also helped them secure a top-four finish in the Premier League and the Conference League trophy.\nAdvertisement\nColwill believes it is a good sign that a corner has been turned, but suggests a lack of credit from outside of Stamford Bridge will also continue to drive the players on as they try to compete for a first league title since 2017.\nHe continues: \u201cWe had ups and downs like a lot of teams last season. We still stayed around the top four and were never miles behind. With the fans, we really went all together and just pushed. When that happens, I feel something just lights up and you just win, win, win. That\u2019s what we were doing in the Premier League, then we won the Conference League and headed into the Club World Cup with that mindset.\n\u201cBut it felt like no one thought we had half a chance, even in the final, and I thought that was very disrespectful. All the questions before the game were based on, \u2018You\u2019re not stopping PSG\u2019. I am not complaining. It gave us that fire in the belly, and we proved everyone wrong.\n\u201cIt does feel like there are not many people who respect us out there. We have been using it and will continue to do so. It might change now that we are world champions, we don\u2019t know. But we are going into games feeling like we have a point to prove. It gives us that extra one per cent, which can make a huge difference.\n\u201cDo I think teams will target a win over Chelsea even more so that they can say they have beaten the world champions? Definitely, but that is not a bad thing. They will give us respect. But we have to always be on it; our mindset has to be that we have to win every game.\n\u201cWe feel like we can definitely compete for the Premier League. The players we have in our squad are among the best, and we are really excited for this season, to once again prove people wrong.\u201d\nThe prospect of playing in the Champions League for the first time in his career is something he is particularly looking forward to. \u201cWhen that anthem comes on, it is going to be a dream. I could get a bit emotional, to be honest,\u201d he admits.\n\u201cI went to watch many Champions League games at Stamford Bridge when I was younger. I have walked out with the flags waving against Barcelona. Many kids dream of playing in the Champions League, so it doesn\u2019t feel real that I am about to. It\u2019s going to be amazing.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhen you hear that song, it just makes your hair stand up on your neck. No matter where you are, if you hear that tune, you know it\u2019s the Champions League. It\u2019s so special.\u201d\nAnd with that, Colwill left to enjoy the last few days of his holiday before the hard work begins all over again. He has certainly earned it.\n(Top photo: Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images)"
