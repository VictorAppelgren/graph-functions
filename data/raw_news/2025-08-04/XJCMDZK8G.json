  "content": "\u2022 Significantly high institutional ownership implies Adecco Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n\u2022 The top 18 shareholders own 50% of the company\n\u2022 Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock Trump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit. To get a sense of who is truly in control of Adecco Group AG (VTX:ADEN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 54% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by CHF137m. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 3.0% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or \"liquidity providers\" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Adecco Group, which might have negative implications on individual investors. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Adecco Group, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Adecco Group What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Adecco Group? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. Adecco Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Adecco Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Adecco Group. Silchester International Investors LLP is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. UBS Asset Management AG is the second largest shareholder owning 6.5% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock.\n\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 18 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. We can see that insiders own shares in Adecco Group AG. This is a big company, so it is good to see this level of alignment. Insiders own CHF172m worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 42% stake in Adecco Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Adecco Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with Adecco Group , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$310.0b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$151.40\n7D\n-3.1%\n1Y\n4.7%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$73.6b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$60.27\n7D\n4.8%\n1Y\n46.1%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$62.4b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$28.10\n7D\n3.3%\n1Y\n39.9%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$52.9b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$238.31\n7D\n4.3%\n1Y\n38.4%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$50.9b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$165.53\n7D\n-5.3%\n1Y\n2.1%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$49.7b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$78.99\n7D\n-3.4%\n1Y\n0.5%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.7b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$105.61\n7D\n6.3%\n1Y\n49.1%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.9b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$42.52\n7D\n5.4%\n1Y\n20.4%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.9b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$18.53\n7D\n9.8%\n1Y\n38.4%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$42.80\n7D\n1.5%\n1Y\n10.9%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.5b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$21.68\n7D\n-13.6%\n1Y\n-38.8%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.5b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$29.98\n7D\n-6.5%\n1Y\n27.2%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.3b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$20.77\n7D\n-11.0%\n1Y\n-4.4%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$435.3m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$1.97\n7D\n-8.8%\n1Y\n-22.1%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$297.7m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$24.32\n7D\n-4.8%\n1Y\n-32.6%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$82.9m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.46\n7D\n-6.9%\n1Y\n14.4%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$65.5m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.26\n7D\n-9.6%\n1Y\n-41.3%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$52.5m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry; and offers related environmental solutions in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$1.11\n7D\n19.9%\n1Y\n-45.9%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$631.4k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0012\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n-88.0%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"
