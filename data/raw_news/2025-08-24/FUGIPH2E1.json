  "description": "Raising money for 15-year-old Ralph Pearce's school is what he would have wanted, his mother says.",
  "content": "The family of a 15-year-old boy who died in his sleep have raised almost \u00a312,000 towards buying his school a new bus. Ralph Pearce went to bed at his home in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, on 26 July, but did not wake up the following morning. The Ed Sheeran fan, who was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy, received specialist education at Shorefields School in the town. His mother, Laura Cooper, said his death had \"turned our life upside down\" but insisted she wanted to \"make something good come from it\".\n\nMs Cooper, 42, said despite his health complications, Ralph had been \"absolutely fine\" and not unwell before he died. Her partner and Ralph's father, Bradley Pearce, 40, said: \"It's like someone's ripped part of your heart out.\"\n\nThey were aware of Shorefields raising money for a new minibus, which it needed to transport pupils to and from school, and so agreed to support the cause. \"Ralph loved school and we decided instead of the funeral having flowers, we just wanted to keep his legacy on,\" Ms Cooper said. The parents have opened a tribute page to Ralph online and invited any donations to be made there. They hoped any new minibus would have \"in loving memory of Ralph Pearce\" printed on it. Gemma Fowler, the head teacher of Shorefields, said it would be \"such a fitting tribute as Ralph loved going out on the bus with his classmates\". She added: \"He was such a happy boy who brought joy to everyone who met him.\"\n\nMr Pearce and Ms Cooper remembered their son, who they nicknamed Wreck-it Ralph, as being popular with everyone he met. \"You'd walk down the street with him and he'd want to shake everyone's hand or ask where their outfits were from,\" Ms Cooper recalled. \"He was very chatty, such a happy, happy boy \u2013 always smiling.\" Mr Pearce added: \"He had a real cheeky chappy side to him.\"",

      "text": "Deaf school gets new minibus in memory of ex-pupil\n- Published\nDeaf children at a school in Derby will now be able to enjoy day trips and excursions thanks to a new minibus funded in memory of a former pupil.\nElizabeth Corbett pledged to raise \u00a360,000 to buy the bus for the Royal School for the Deaf Derby after her husband David died suddenly at the age of 51 in 2023.\nShe said she was informed of Mr Corbett's death over FaceTime because the paramedics could not use British Sign Language (BSL). At the time East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said it was \"deeply sorry\".\nThe first outing for the new bus was to collect Mrs Corbett and her children to bring them to the school, where they received a warm welcome from pupils.\nMrs Corbett said she was inspired to fundraise after she heard the school's previous bus was being scrapped.\n\"It felt like a sign from David that we should try to replace it. He had loved his years at the school and especially school trips.\n\"So, to finally have the minibus here and to see how pleased all the children are, is wonderful.\n\"David would be so proud of us all and I hope that the children here now have happy memories of their time at the school, just as David did,\" she said.\nSince her husband's death, Mrs Corbett has advocated for BSL training for emergency service workers.\nThe school has trained nine firefighters in Level 1 BSL, while 33 Derbyshire Police officers have been trained elsewhere in Level 1.\nMrs Corbett said she was at work when she received a distressed video call from her children to say her husband had fallen ill.\nBy the time Mrs Corbett got home, she said paramedics had arrived but could not communicate to her what had happened, for which EMAS has apologised.\nPaul Burrows, head teacher of the school, said: \"The generosity and dedication of David's family and the deaf community is really heart-warming.\n\"This new minibus will make a huge difference to our students, providing them with greater opportunities for learning and enrichment.\"\nThe new minibus is painted in the school's colours and has Mr Corbett's name printed on the side and the front.\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Derby\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, external, on X, external, or on Instagram, external.

      "text": "Travel for autistic boy saved after donations\n- Published\nA school which could not provide an autistic boy with education after his \"lifeline\" minibus was destroyed in a break-in says it is overwhelmed by donations to help him travel again.\nThe Mackenzie Thorpe Centre school in South Bank, Middlesbrough, had its \u00a350,000 minibus targeted by a thief on 19 July.\nThe Ford Tourneo van was stripped of its parts, causing \u00a316,000 worth of damage.\nBut the centre, run by the North East Autism Society (NEAS), said the donations meant its 12-year-old pupil Caleb could continue to be taken to and from school.\nThe van, which had its bonnet, engine and tyres stolen during the break-in, was used to take Caleb on trips to local attractions, leisure facilities and parks.\nThe school's interim principal Corrina McEwan said thanks to the \"magnificent community response\", Caleb could continue learning.\nThe money, which includes a \u00a310,000 donation from The Teesside Family Foundation, will go towards leasing a replacement vehicle for him until a permanent replacement is ready.\nShe said: \"We are incredibly grateful and overwhelmed by the generosity shown to us. We were devastated by what happened, but this means there will be limited disruption.\"\nCaleb's mum Sarah Bowman said the donation had helped \"restore my faith in human nature\".\n\"They accepted Caleb when he was expelled from a different special needs school because of his extreme challenging behaviour, offering a more 'bespoke' community school environment, and this bus is his lifeline in accessing activities \u2013 it is his safe space,\" she said.\nThe school, which is named after Middlesbrough-born artist Mackenzie Thorpe, provides specialist education and care for autistic and neurodivergent children and adults across the region.\nTony Wedlake, from the volunteer-run Teesside Family Foundation, said: \"As well as helping the school and NEAS, it is also a way of acknowledging the fantastic support Mackenzie Thorpe has given the foundation over the years.\"\nThe foundation provides free holidays to families and specialist equipment for disabled children.\nA further \u00a31,500 was donated by the Wainstones Hotel, at Great Broughton, while additional public donations were made through a GoFundMe appeal.\nCleveland Police said it was still investigating and urged anyone with information to contact the force.\nFollow BBC Tees on X,, external Facebook, external, Nextdoor and Instagram, external.\nGet in touch\nDo you have a story suggestion for BBC Tees?\nRelated topics\n- Published25 July"
