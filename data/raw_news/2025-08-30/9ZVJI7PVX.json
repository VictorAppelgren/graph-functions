  "content": "The daughter of serial killer Dennis Rader has spoken about what it's like being the child of a murderer in a podcast.\n\nKerri Rawson's father is known as the BTK killer - a nickname he gave himself which related to his MO - binding, torturing and killing his victims. Rader terrified residents of Wichita, Kansas for decades, continuing the BTK murders and ridiculing letters for years until he stopped in 1991.\n\nThe killer, 80, has confessed to murdering 10 people - including two children aged nine and 11 - in Wichita, Kansas between 1974 and 1991, before going dark. However, Investigators have linked him to two other potential victims.\n\nHis arrest was the result of his hubris: the then-married father-of-two had been anonymously corresponding with police - notably Wichita Police Lieutenant Ken Landwehr, with whom Rader believed he had a special bond - about the violent crimes. Rader's letters were marked with his bizarre BTK logo and spelling mistakes, and he would taunt police with crude jokes about what he did to his victims.\n\nBy 2004, 13 years had passed since BTK had claimed his last victim, prompting a newspaper to print an article suggesting people had forgotten about BTK. This is said to have irritated Rader, and so he resumed his correspondence with the police.\n\nIn his communications with Lieutenant Ken Landwehr, Rader asked if it was possible to send a floppy disk to police, without them being able to trace the computer the disk came from. Landwehr lied, and assured the killer that it would be untraceable. When Rader sent the disk to the police via a local TV station, law enforcement were able to trace it back to a local Lutheran church, where Rader was president of the congregation.\n\nKerri was in her mid twenties when she learnt about her father's gruesome crimes. She has been open about how difficult it was to come to terms with what he had done, detailing her struggle in several books.\n\nShe has also appeared in a number of interviews, and was the subject of an episode of ABC's 20/20 True Crime Vault podcast, titled My Father BTK, which was published in July this year (after originally airing in 2019).\n\nRader committed his first murder four years before his daughter was born, and continued in nightmarish secrecy through her childhood until she was 12.\n\nAfter being convicted of 10 murders, Rader was handed 10 consecutive life sentences and, with no chance of parole for 175 years, will die in prison. He escaped execution because Kansas had no death penalty at the time of the murders.\n\nSpeaking on the podcast about when she learnt the FBI had arrested her father on suspicion of the murders, Kerri said she wanted to 'pass out'.\n\nShe added: 'I was like, my father's a good guy. He's Boy Scout leader, president of the church. You've got the wrong man, because you don't believe it's true, and you don't want it to be true. You know, the father, you know, is not capable of any of [that].'\n\nIn fact, it was holding down this fa\u00e7ade as a family man with an everyday job that meant Rader was able to remain above suspicion for the notorious killings.\n\nHowever, one of his jobs helped him commit the crimes: from 1974 to 1988, Rader worked a humdrum job for ADT Security installing home security alarms. The role gave him eerie access to people's homes and an intricate understanding of personal security, which he would use in his crimes such as cutting the phone lines before creeping inside.\n\nAccording to Kerri, learning the truth about her father made her feel that 'every moment of [her] whole life was a lie, even back to before [she was] born'.\n\nWhen asked if she was worried her mother had also been involved in the crimes, Kerrie said: 'No, I never imagined that my mom was involved in anything bad. I was very worried about her, and wanted to call her and let her know I was okay, and I wanted to know how my brother was doing.\n\n'He was stationed in Connecticut with the Navy and so I wasn't able to talk to my mom or my brother for six or seven hours after the arrest.'\n\nMrs Rader - who was granted an emergency divorce from her killer husband in 2005 - sounded heartbroken and grief stricken after hearing about the arrest Kerri revealed.\n\nKerrie has spoken about how difficult it was to learn about the crimes, telling PEOPLE in 2019: 'It took more than 10 years before I could even sit across from someone and even talk about this. Nobody wants to believe their father could be capable of such monstrous things.\n\n'If my mother, brother or I ever had any inkling, we would've gone screaming to the police.'\n\nDespite his unimaginable acts, Kerrie has said that during her childhood, Rader would normally resemble an average middle-America dad - but he would occasionally show flashes of a violent temper.\n\nIn her book A Serial Killer's Daughter: My Story of Faith, Love, and Overcoming, she wrote: 'The key to surviving life with dad? Watch the pot closely, turn down the heat, and know when to get out of its way before it blows.'\n\nDescribing the moment she was told about the killings, she wrote: 'I grabbed at the wall jutting out near the stove. I was shaking all over. The room turned red. Dark splotches came into view. I was falling into a black hole, with no idea of how I was ever going to get out.'\n\nDespite the extreme trauma of learning her father was a serial killer, Kerri has gone on to help law enforcement solve cold cases.\n\nIn January 2023, she first became aware of new cold cases linked to her father through the investigation into the disappearance of Cynthia 'Cyndi' Dawn Kinney, a 16-year-old cheerleader who was last seen in 1976.\n\nIn June that year, she said she then became aware of the unsolved murder case of Shawna Garber, whose remains were found near Pineville, MO, in December 1990, which motivated her to volunteer to help investigators.\n\nAt the time, Osage County, Oklahoma, Undersheriff Gary Upton said the investigation into whether he was responsible for additional crimes started with the re-examination last year of the 1976 disappearance of Kinney in Pawhuska.\n\nRader has been questioned over the two disappearances before, and denied killing either woman but did previously say he 'enjoyed' his meeting with investigators over the Garber's disappearance.\n\nThe cases were reopened, and Kerrie was enrolled to help. She had not seen her father face-to-face since his arrest in 2005. Rader had been unhelpful in discussing the unsolved cases with police, and it was hoped his daughter could help break him down and reveal further details of his gruesome crimes.\n\nShe fly out to see her father in Kansas for a total of three hours in June and July of 2023.\n\nSpeaking about the meeting at the time, she said: 'I hadn't had contact with him for 18 years, besides letters. To sit across from him was quite staggering.'\n\nShe added that Rader was 'shocked' by her visit as she hadn't told him she was coming, and she found that her father's health has deteriorated significantly to the point where she 'doesn't know how much time he has left.'\n\nShe described him as 'fragile', and was wheeled into their visitation in shackles and a wheelchair. Due to his poor eyesight, Kerrie said he didn't even recognise her at first.\n\n'His eyesight is really bad and he couldn't tell who I was right away, but he was shocked,' she said. 'He's in a wheelchair, but he could still give me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. It was like a reunion.'\n\nHowever, when she started pressing for details about the cold cases, Rader brushed her off, dashing hopes he would give grieving families some relief after previously refusing to cooperate with police.\n\n'He's still sharp as a tack,' she said, despite his ailing health. 'He was coming up with alibis, I mean he could tell I was there for answers. It was surreal.'\n\nAnother issue Kerrie spoke about was her father's court appearances. Rader plead guilty to 10 counts of murder, thereby waiving his right to a jury trial.\n\nHowever, he appeared in court in June 2005, where he allocuted about the crimes in chilling detail.\n\nKerrie revealed she had not attended the hearings, explaining: 'I wouldn't have been able to do it. I was torn because you want to be there supportive for your father, but the media presence was massively heavy.'\n\nHaving this type of crisis of identity when a parent has been found guilty of gruesome crimes is not uncommon, according to Dr. Katherine Ramsland, a Professor Emerita of Forensic Psychology at DeSales University, and the author of Confession of a Serial Killer \u2013 The Untold Story of Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer.\n\nShe worked with Rader himself to analyse his psyche, and delve into the motivations behind his gruesome crimes.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Mail, she that there is no single response among those whose parents are serial killers.\n\n'The daughters of serial killers I've known have struggled over the shock and betrayal of a father (or mother) who has turned out to be a monster,' Dr Ramsland explained.\n\n'The responses differ. Some withdraw, some go public, some change their name and try to live a normal life. A few have been forced into crimes, and some of them have turned their parent in.'\n\nShe continued: 'Whether they forgive or they reject, they\u2019ve been emotionally damaged. Their sense of instability might continue for years. Maybe they'll never trust again. Some find solace in religion, community, and family. Others hope for the offender to revert back to the person they once knew. A few just cut the offender out of their lives.\n\n'Their entire sense of identity has been altered. How they deal with it depends on their perception of the circumstances and their level of resilience.'",

      "text": "The Shattering Moment I Learned My Dad Was the Notorious BTK Serial Killer \"I'd do anything not to be the daughter of a serial killer,\" says Kerri Rawson, the daughter of BTK Killer Dennis Rader By Johnny Dodd Johnny Dodd Johnny Dodd is a senior writer at PEOPLE, who focuses on human interest, crime and sports stories. People Editorial Guidelines Published on January 23, 2019 08:00AM EST Kerri Rawson has spent nearly 14 years trying to shake the memory of that morning in February 2005 when an FBI agent showed up at her front door with devastating news. Dennis Rader, the doting, protective 59-year-old father she thought she knew, had just been arrested for 10 unimaginably savage murders \u2014 and unmasked as the serial killer known as \u201cBTK,\u201d for \u201cbind, torture, kill,\u201d a name he\u2019d created for himself while terrorizing the family\u2019s hometown of Wichita, Kan., between 1974 and 1991. \u201cIt took more than 10 years before I could even sit across from someone and even talk about this,\u201d Rawson tells PEOPLE in this week\u2019s cover story. \u201cNobody wants to believe their father could be capable of such monstrous things.\u201d Now, Rawson, 40, has written a book \u2014 A Serial Killer\u2019s Daughter \u2014 that chronicles how her horror and anger were complicated by the love she\u2019d felt for her father, as well as the terrible toll his double-life has taken on her family. (Rawson\u2019s book comes out Jan. 29.) Julian Dufort The sheer savagery of her father\u2019s crimes hasn\u2019t made her journey easy. Rader often stalked his victims \u2014 most of whom he strangled slowly after binding their arms and legs with rope \u2014 for months, then hid mementos from his kills in the floorboards beneath the family\u2019s linen closet. Memories of the morning her life was turned upside down still haunt Rawson, whose husband Darian was at work when the FBI agent appeared at the front door of their Detroit-area apartment. \u2022 For more on how Kerri Rawson grapples with the horrible truth that her dad is the notorious BTK Killer, subscribe now to PEOPLE or pick up this week\u2019s issue, on newsstands Friday. Kerri on fishing trip with her father in 1982. Courtesy Kerri Rawson Reluctantly, she let the agent inside and moments later he began to tell her why he\u2019d come. \u201cHave you heard of BTK?\u201d he asked Rawson, who was unaware that her father had just been arrested by dozens of police officers after detectives had linked him to the killings through a floppy disk BTK had recently sent them, taunting them that he was about to kill again. Rawson was confused by the question. \u201cIt seemed like such a weird thing to bring up,\u201d she recalls. \u201cSuddenly I was thinking, \u2018My mom\u2019s been murdered.\u2019 My mind started making these illogical leaps because I was so scared and frightened.\u201d As her mind raced and she tried to make sense of his words, she heard the agent say something about her father being a murderer. In her panic and confusion, Rawson began thinking, \u201cMy God, my father murdered my mom. \u2026 I felt like I was going to pass out. I was falling apart, holding onto the wall above the stove and I told him, \u2018I need to sit down.'\u201d Over the next few hours the terrible truth began to sink in \u2014 and years would pass before any semblance of normalcy would return to her life. Her father would ultimately plead guilty to the 10 murders and is now serving a 175-year sentence. \u201cI was just trying to stay alive and breathe,\u201d Rawson recalls of the day she learned the horrible truth. \u201cTrying to recover from the shock, telling myself over and over that I\u2019d do anything not to be the daughter of a serial killer.\u201d 20/20 will air an interview with Kerri Rawson on Friday, February 1 at 9pm ET on ABC.
