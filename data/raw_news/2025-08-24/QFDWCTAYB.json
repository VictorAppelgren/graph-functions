  "title": "Shopify Stock Popped 22% After Earnings. Is it Too Late to Buy?",
  "description": "The stock has pulled back in subsequent trading sessions, but will that attract buyers?",
  "content": "\u2022 Shopify's site and ecosystem continue to attract more merchants.\n\u2022 Gross merchandise volumes and revenue are growing at a rapid pace.\n\u2022 Whether Shopify looks \"expensive\" may depend on the metric one chooses.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Shopify \u203a\n\nShopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) is on fire. After its Aug. 6 earnings report for the second quarter of 2025, the stock popped 22%. The stock has retreated since then, but it is still up by more than 80% over the last year.\n\nAlthough such gains are impressive, they could also lead to concerns over the stock and its valuation. Investors need to take a closer look at Shopify stock to see whether now is a good time to add shares, or whether they should stand pat or possibly sell.\n\nShopify has become the leading company among e-commerce platform providers. It first stood out by offering a no-code, highly customizable site that non-programmers could set up and launch. The company enhanced this ease of use by also emphasizing speed, making it more user-friendly and less likely that e-retailers would lose sales due to a slow website.\n\nMoreover, it also built an ecosystem that helped online merchants with ancillary tasks such as payments, email marketing, and, more recently, AI tools such as Sidekick and Shopify Magic. Since sales platforms are not particularly unique, the ecosystem gives Shopify a competitive advantage that its clients will not find on most other platforms.\n\nThese capabilities helped make Shopify stock a pandemic darling, and it had a peak closing price of more than $169 per share in 2021. Unfortunately, the stock sold off in the 2022 bear market, and this was exacerbated by an attempt to build a Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN). Consequently, it lost as much as 87% of its value as it returned to losses.\n\nThe company later decided that building such a network was too costly and a poor fit for what is otherwise a software company. After selling the SFN to Flexport in 2023, profitability soon returned, and the stock began moving higher.\n\nThat bull market has largely continued. Today, the stock is only about 20% below its all-time closing high.\n\nThanks to that growth, Shopify generated nearly $163 billion in gross merchandise volume in the first half of 2025, rising 27% yearly. That generated just over $5.0 billion in revenue in the first two quarters of 2025, a 29% yearly surge.\n\nKeeping expense growth in check led to a 51% rise in operating income. Unfortunately, unrealized losses weighed on its performance in Q1. Thus, its net income was just $224 million in the first half of 2025, though that was an improvement over the $102 million loss in the same year-ago period.",

      "text": "Revenue is many things. Commonly known as sales, it\u2019s the top line of the income statement as well as a key financial metric that investors use to measure the financial health of a business. Like any financial metric, there are also rules underpinning the way it\u2019s measured and recorded, and investors should be familiar with these revenue recognition principles.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is revenue?\nPut simply, revenue is a business\u2019s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered. In some businesses, revenue is referred to as sales, though it can also come in the form of commissions, premiums, subscriptions, and credit card fees, as well as other channels, depending on the type of business in question.\nRevenue is often used as one way of measuring the size of a business, and investors tend to look at revenue growth as a reflection of a business\u2019s growth rate. Along with profits, or net income, revenue is generally one of the two most important metrics that investors look at in the income statement.\nUnderstanding revenue\nUnderstanding revenue\nRevenue might seem like a simple concept, but the way it\u2019s recorded isn\u2019t always straightforward, and how it\u2019s recorded often depends on the type of business.\nFor some businesses, like retail, revenue is typically recorded when a sale is made, but for other businesses, like software, it\u2019s more complicated. In accrual accounting, the basis for an income statement, revenue is recorded when a service is provided, not when it\u2019s paid for. So the timing of revenue recognition can differ significantly from the timing of cash collection, depending on the type of business and how customers pay their bills. In contract-based businesses like software, customers may pay up front for some products or pay after the services have been provided.\nAccrual accounting is designed to smooth out the lumps that are common in cash-based accounting, making revenue a useful indicator of how a business is performing. However, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on cash flow to make sure that revenue is being converted into cash.\nCash Flow\nHow to use it\nHow to use revenue\nRevenue is a valuable tool for investors, and there are a number of ways it plays into financial analysis. One common usage is in the price-to-sales ratio, which values a stock based on how the share price compares to revenue per share.\nFor profitable companies, investors typically prefer to use the price-to-earnings ratio, but the price-to-sales ratio can help complete the valuation picture since profit margins can vary from quarter to quarter, and profit growth relies on revenue growth. For companies in sectors like software that may not have profits, the price-to-sales ratio is especially valuable since it shows how expensive the stocks are and how they compare to others.\nRevenue growth is also a key metric for investors. In general, revenue growth is the best metric to use to assess a company\u2019s growth rate and potential. Although revenue has to ultimately translate into profits, a stock\u2019s value is closely tied to its top-line growth rate since that offers an indication of the demand for a company\u2019s products and its potential for expansion.\nRelated investing topics\nHow it's calculated\nHow revenue is calculated\nAt its most basic level, revenue is calculated as price multiplied by the quantity sold. If a restaurant sold 20 hamburgers for $10, its revenue would be $200.\nFor most companies, which have multiple product lines and different businesses, calculating revenue is more complex, and the underlying concept is straightforward. Revenue is money that comes in from normal business operations. That\u2019s separate from one-time gains like stock sales, legal proceeds, or interest income for non-financial companies.\nUnderstanding revenue is a valuable tool for any investor, especially as we look forward to the next bull market. Knowing the different ways that businesses recognize revenue is helpful for analyzing individual sectors. Comparing the cash flow statement with revenue is also important to make sure businesses are converting their revenue into cash.\nFinally, looking at metrics like the price-to-sales ratio and revenue growth can help guide your investments; both of those key metrics start with revenue."

      "text": "Competitive advantage is a term frequently used in business contexts and is typically what drives superior profits, better product sales, and the continuous ability to innovate.\nCompanies with strong competitive advantages are the best positioned to succeed within their industries and generally are able to fend off rivals more easily than others. Some of the most common factors influencing competitive advantage include cost control, product differentiation, and customer service.\nWhat is competitive advantage?\nWhat is competitive advantage?\nCompetitive advantage refers to a company's ability to produce goods and/or services more cheaply or at a higher quality than its rivals. A business may have superior customer service or may be able to produce goods at lower cost through economies of scale (a business concept that denotes the correlation between the quantity of a product a company makes and the price the company can profitably charge). A company with one or more competitive advantages is well positioned to execute its business strategy and grow sustainably relative to its peers.\nCompetitive advantage is synonymous with a company's \"unique selling proposition,\" or the distinctive reason customers are repeatedly drawn to buying a company's products or services. Perhaps you appreciate a product's low price. Maybe you like the product because it's unique in the marketplace and no other company produces anything with the same functionality. Or, perhaps, you simply value the customer service.\nThe unique selling proposition can take the form of a cost advantage -- customers in this case make repeat purchases because they are attracted to the low price. Alternately, competitive advantage can be ascertained through product differentiation. In this instance, a product's differentiated qualities entirely distinguish it from products by competitors, creating a loyal customer base.\nCompetitive advantages are important because they enable companies to consistently outperform their rivals. Companies deploy their competitive advantages to attract as many new customers as possible and increase their profit margins. By purchasing one product over another, you are implicitly affirming the seller's competitive advantage.\nCompetitive advantage vs. comparative advantage\nCompetitive advantage vs. comparative advantage\nCompetitive advantage is frequently confused with \"comparative advantage,\" which is actually just one type of competitive advantage. A company with a comparative advantage produces goods or services more efficiently than its peers. If a company requires a lower quantity of an input (for example, fuel) to produce the same output as another company, then the first company has a comparative advantage. Similarly, a comparative advantage exists if one company can transform the same quantity of inputs into a higher number of outputs than its competitors.\nPut another way, comparative advantage is a measure of relative opportunity cost, which is the value of the inputs expended, relative to a competitor, to produce a certain set of outputs. Companies with comparative advantages have opportunity costs that are lower than those of their competitors.\nExamples of competitive advantage\nExamples of competitive advantage\nAs a simple example, it's easy to see how Apple (AAPL 1.21%) enjoys several competitive advantages over other companies in the tech industry. First, Apple produces visually appealing, minimalist-inspired products that perform on a superior level relative to competitors' products. Many of the bugs commonly associated with Windows computers rarely afflict Mac devices. From this standpoint, one of Apple's most significant competitive advantages is its product quality. The company further establishes a competitive advantage by making it easy for customers to integrate Apple devices across the company's various product lines.\nThe Apple customer experience is also meant to create competitive advantage. Certainly, the way in which Apple sells its products, both online and in stores, is favorable for both buyers and seller. Purchases are completed seamlessly through computers, smartphones, and watches, and most of the in-store paperwork, if you do visit a store, is completed via tablet. Apple makes it extremely easy to be a customer, which creates significant brand loyalty. This devotion to Apple explains how the company is able to make the same phone repeatedly and still grow its revenues!\nAnother example is Slack (NYSE:WORK), one of the tech sector's newest darlings, which allows its users to replace email with real-time communication and file sharing. The application is also enjoyable to use -- the exact opposite of email -- and excels as a central hub for companies' employees and contractors. Slack's competitive advantages are both the uniqueness of its product and the growing power of its brand. For this example, it's how fundamentally different Slack is that garners the company a competitive advantage.\nTypes of competitive advantages and strategies\nTypes of competitive advantages and strategies\nCompanies strive to create competitive advantages to differentiate themselves from rivals. A company may choose to hire only those with a very specific skillset to make the company's most important decisions. Harnessing this specialized knowledge and skill base can by itself create a competitive advantage and also shrinks the talent pool available to competitors. People with superior skills can be deployed to create superior products, which, in turn, can attract more customers. Companies must continuously seek new ways to develop competitive advantages in order to find new buyers and increase customer retention.\nAs mentioned above, competitive advantages can be established based on product differentiation, product quality, or product cost. Competitive advantage can also be achieved by offering outstanding customer experiences. Strong marketing and branding, in addition, can increase competitive advantage by establishing and reinforcing customer loyalty.\nA differential competitive advantage is considered the holy grail of competitive advantages. A company with differential competitive advantage offers products that are both unique and superior in quality. A company with a differential competitive advantage holds a strong competitive position via multiple elements of its business, thus creating a wide gap between the company and its industry peers.\nBusinesses that seek to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage are aiming to become entrenched atop their respective industries for years or decades; they are not trying to simply achieve the best results for a single quarter. Sustainable competitive advantage requires continuous improvement throughout the organization, ongoing product improvement, and new concept ideation. Companies with phenomenal product quality wishing to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage don't just create one winning product; they continue to iterate and expand their offerings to increasingly capture market share over time.\nRelated investing topics\nApplying competitive advantage to investing\nApplying competitive advantage to investing\nAt least a basic understanding of competitive advantage is necessary for any industry analysis investors conduct to determine what a company is worth. Searching for companies with clear competitive advantages within their respective industries can help you to decide how to invest, particularly when creating a portfolio of long-term stock holdings.\nIt's also important to be able to recognize competitive advantage when you see it. A company's competitive advantage is the reason you buy from certain businesses and why you are likely to continue doing so in the future. As time passes and business landscapes continually evolve, new sources of competitive advantage will continue to emerge in all sectors of the economy."
