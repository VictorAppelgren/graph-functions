  "description": "The best electric cargo bike on the market just got front suspension and new headlights.",
  "content": "How time flies. I first reviewed the original Urban Arrow in 2020, when my kids were 3 and 5. Back then, nothing delighted a couple of preschoolers more than strapping into a big, motorized cargo bike and scooting around town, shrieking, with the wind blowing in their tiny faces. Alas, they are now 8 and 10. When I picked up my 8-year-old two days ago, he crouched down in the box while sitting on the padded seats (with seat belts!) so that none of his friends would see him.\n\nAll this to say: My Tern GSD and I are great friends, but I wish my kids were five years younger so I could\u2019ve bought the FamilyNext Pro instead. Urban Arrow's new electric cargo bike has a lot of great upgrades, is easier to ride than ever, and is even more useful as my kids have gotten older.\n\nTo the naked eye, the two biggest upgrades to the FamilyNext Pro are a newly redesigned cargo box and suspension on the front fork. (It also comes in a very classy, new sage green, but unfortunately, my demo bike was in black.)\n\nThe box looks totally different\u2014my friend asked if my bike had gotten longer somehow. It\u2019s longer and slimmer, with rounded corners instead of square ones, and there are now headlights on the bike. It has shorter sides, so it\u2019s easier to get in and out. Unlike other bakfiets, or box bikes, that I\u2019ve tried, the box sits much lower to the ground. I can confirm that in my testing, both adults and kids had an easy time climbing in and out.\n\nThe box is made from expanded polypropylene (EPP) foam, which is initially disconcerting\u2014it shows dings and bumps very easily. However, Urban Arrow describes it as \u201can upside-down helmet,\u201d and the foam cushioning did reassure me that even if I let the bike tip over, my kids or friends wouldn\u2019t just immediately hit the pavement. You can also replace the foam easily in the event of a crash or some other unsightly event.\n\nThe front cargo box now has a front fork with 60 millimeters of travel. I truly love this. It really is a safety issue when you\u2019re going fast with 60 to 150 pounds in the front box. I was cruising along at 20 mph and hit a pothole, and I just boinged right out of it.",

      "text": "In true Pacific Northwestern summer fashion, I have been riding around with multiple cubic feet of wood and soil in the panniers of the test Tern GSD S10. This is the most popular electric cargo bike in my neighborhood, and I personally contributed to its popularity. It's the model of electric cargo bike that I bought to take my kids to school and to carry pallets around the city. Every day, I see parents carting their kids around in Tern Storm Boxes. There are so many that I no longer do an impromptu wave when I see someone riding one that matches mine.\nThis year\u2019s update of the GSD makes it more reliable and car-replacement-like than ever. It now has ABS brakes so that you don\u2019t have to worry about stopping on hills, even with a heavy load or in the rain\u2014a very welcome development here in Portland, Oregon. The new Bosch Smart System connects to your phone and has GPS tracking and an ebike lock and alarm. It has a new reinforced frame and meets the most stringent safety standards. Oh, and this particular model costs over $7,000. You get what you pay for.\nPrice of Admission\nTern is known for wonderfully compact bikes that take up very little space and are easy to ride and store but carry a ridiculous amount of stuff. They\u2019re the perfect parent city bike. As always, the bike has several price points with slightly varying components.\nThe P10 has a Shimano Deore 1x10 transmission with an earlier Bosch eBike system and starts at $4,999, and the P00 has an Enviolo internally geared hub with Gates belt drive and the earlier Bosch eBike System and starts at $5,899. The highest-priced tier, which is the one I\u2019m testing, is the S10 and it has the Shimano Deore 1x10 transmission, the new Bosch smart system with customizable modes and a Connect module, and ABS braking and starts at $6,699.\nLet\u2019s start with ABS brakes. This is the first bike I\u2019ve tested with it and I\u2019ve seen on Reddit that people have doubts. It\u2019s just one more proprietary Bosch component that you\u2019ll have to take into the shop to fix. If you\u2019re an experienced cyclist, you might think it\u2019s overkill. I\u2019ve been riding for years without it. If you\u2019re a fair-weather biker, it\u2019s probably not worth it. In dry, sunny conditions, it sounds squeakier, feels weirder, and takes me longer to stop than my old Tern GSD. There\u2019s just a lot more cables flapping around. I can see why it might seem vaguely annoying."

      "text": "The Best Electric Cargo Bikes for Families\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nThere are a number of physical, philosophical, environmental, and logistical reasons why it\u2019s better to hop on a bike than it is to drive a car. Sitting in traffic is mind-numbing. Earth is on fire. Yet somehow it's easy to ignore all this when you're late to work and have yet to wrestle pants onto your screaming toddler.\nHow We Test\nEach tester rides the bike for a minimum of 20 miles. We have testers from coast to coast, from Brooklyn, New York, to Portland, Oregon, and a few cities in between. Each tester rides on a variety of surfaces to test the bike's handling\u2014not just roads but also gravel, dirt, and potholed streets\u2014while carrying cargo. This will vary from tester to tester; for example, editor Julian Chokkattu is 6'4\" and weighs more than me and my entire family when riding on one bike.\nOther factors we look at are:\n- Does the bike meet safety specifications so it won't blow up in your garage?\n- Can the battery be taken off?\n- Are the parts proprietary to the bike?\n- Can you see the display well outdoors and is operation intuitive?\nFor more tips, check out our complete guide to How to Buy an Ebike.\nWhich Bike Type Is Best for You?\nElectric cargo bicycles come in two configurations. The first are front-loader bikes, also known as bakfiets or Long Johns, which suspend a cargo box between the rider and the front wheel. The other layout is a midtail or longtail, which extends the rear end of the bicycle to accommodate more bodies and gear.\nBoth shapes have pros and cons. I've found that the bigger the rider, the more likely they want a front-loader bike, which in addition to hauling kids can be used as a big bin for yard equipment, tools, and more. However, you will need a garage or storage space and a very good and reliable lock system; they're harder to maneuver and much heavier if you have to go over curbs or rough terrain; and they don't feel particularly stable at slower speeds.\nIf you're a smaller or lighter person, you may prefer a midtail or a longtail, which maneuver more like a regular bicycle. However, the weight is suspended on the back end and higher up, which makes some people nervous about dropping it. I own a longtail; I prefer the maneuverability, but it can be annoying making sure that everything is strapped down on a rack or in a pannier. If possible, I recommend making an appointment at your local bike shop to try several models before committing.\nIf you're trying to reconcile your carefree biking days of yore with your current life as a family chauffeur\u2014or even if you don't have kids and just want to make a quick run to the hardware store\u2014I highly recommend getting an electric cargo bike. Mine has transformed my life, turning my dull, daily errand-running into a multitasking combination of joyride and workout. I ride each bike for around 20 miles each, biking my kids to school or the dog to the vet, toting large zucchinis or who knows what around on some of the best (and worst) electric cargo bikes around.\nThese are our favorites. Once you have a bike, check out our guide to family biking with kids. Need a smaller vehicle? Check out our roundups of the best electric bicycles and best bike accessories.\nUpdated October 2024: We added new information about the Urban Arrow, the Mod Easy sidecar, and the Radio Flyer Via Pro. We also added spec tables and a How We Test section, and we updated links and prices.\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get a 1-year subscription to WIRED for $5 ($25 off).

      "text": "One of the biggest surprises of parenthood has been dealing with the overwhelming amounts of stuff. Take going to the beach, for example. Before kids, a quick beach trip was as complicated as putting on a pair of shorts over a bathing suit, tossing a tallboy in a backpack, and biking to the water.\nNow, I do a 30-minute scamper around the house while grabbing and stuffing items in a bag like a hamster stockpiling for winter. Water bottle? Check. Toddler bathing suits and towels? Check. Diapers? Sand toys? Check. And that\u2019s before I get to all the pandemic-related gear, like child-sized masks and hand sanitizer.\nLuckily, for the past week, I\u2019ve been riding the Urban Arrow Family. For sheer convenience, nothing beats a Dutch-style front-loading cargo electric bike. Rather than carefully tucking all our gear into different packs and panniers, I can just toss everything into the big cargo box, and that includes my kids.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that terrifying?\u201d my neighbor called out one day, as she saw me set off down the street with the front box full of UPS packages.\nWeirdly enough, it isn\u2019t. Urban Arrow is a Dutch company, the land from whence the front-loading cargo bike (also called bakfiets) originated. So it\u2019s not surprising that I found the Family to be both comfortable and surprisingly maneuverable, even though it has a cushy seat, curved handlebars, and a sit-up style frame instead of the straight handlebars and more forward-leaning style that I prefer.\nA lot of that maneuverability is due to the shape and style of the cargo basket. Unlike other bike boxes, the floor (which is an easy-to-clean grate) sits at the bottom of the front chassis, instead of lying on top of it. This puts the box\u2014and therefore the cargo\u2014several inches lower than on other front cargo bikes, which makes it feel more stable.\nThe box itself is about 27.5 inches across, which includes a few inches for the protective aluminum top tube (like a kiddie roll bar) and two inches of heavy-duty expanded polystyrene foam, which is the material often used to pad motorcycle helmets. My kids felt pretty secure inside, and it was wide enough for both the 3- and 5-year-old to sit side by side on the included padded seat. I do have gangly spider children, though. It would probably be a tight fit if they were much bigger."
