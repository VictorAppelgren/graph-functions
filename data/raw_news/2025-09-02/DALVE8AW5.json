      "text": "5 Cincinnati Bearcats football instant takeaways from opening loss to Nebraska\n- UC Bearcats' late drive ends with interception at goal line in season-opening loss to Nebraska in Kansas City\n- UC Bearcats had chance to tie or win in the closing seconds despite nearly non-existent passing attack.\n- Quarterback Brendan Sorsby passed for only 69 yards but rushed for 96 yards and two touchdowns.\nKANSAS CITY, MO \u2013 With Arrowhead Stadium packed full of red, the Nebraska Cornhuskers began their highly anticipated third season under Matt Rhule with a 20-17 win over the Cincinnati Bearcats.\nScott Satterfield\u2019s team tried to counter the red \u2018Husker presence by playing in all-red uniforms with new red helmets. While stylish, UC suffered its first season-opening loss under Satterfield. UC\u2019s only win will be financially, where they\u2019re scheduled to get 75% of the Aug. 28 ticket sales and board the charter home with a minimum guarantee of $2.5 million.\nAttendance for the Battle Sports Kansas City Classic at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium was 72,884.\n\"It was Cincinnati's home game, but it didn't feel like it, for sure,\" Satterfield said. \"It was one of the louder stadiums I've played a game in. It certainly affected us offensively. I think we had four false start penalties and had to go with a silent cadence. It definitely affected the game. Their crowd was good tonight.\"\nThe Bearcats had one last drive to tie the game or take the lead. Starting from their own 9-yard line, they drove to the Nebraska 33. But a long pass to Caleb Goodie was intercepted in the end zone by Malcom Hartzog to preserve the win.\n\"Malcolm Hartzog doesn't talk a lot, he just makes plays,\" Nebraska coach Matt Rhule said.\nNebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola was 33-for-42 for 243 yards and two touchdowns to lead Nebraska and Emmett Johnson ran for 108 yards. UC's Brendan Sorsby was just 13-for-25 passing for 69 yards but did run for 96 yards and had the Bearcats in position to win at the end of the game.\nNebraska outgained UC in total yardage 353-271. The Cornhuskers ran 78 plays to UC's 55.\n\"We dominated time of possession, but Cincinnati came out and answered in the second half,\" Rhule said.\nIn the first half, UC was outgained 197-81 yards. Defensively, Satterfield wasn't happy that Raiola and Nebraska's offensive coordinator, Dana Holgorsen, had nearly 40 minutes to make plays against UC's 20:30, but was glad the Cornhuskers scored only 20 points despite having possession almost twice as long as the Bearcats.\n\"Definitely the loudest stadium I've ever played in,\" linebacker Jake Golday said.\nCincinnati Bearcats football vs. Nebraska takeaways\n1. Fans are still enamored with Travis Kelce, Taylor Swift\nIn a sluggish first quarter, UC led 3-0, but much of the focus was on Jason and Travis Kelce, who were on the field pre-game along with fellow UC teammate Bryan Cook, now a Chiefs teammate of Travis.\nTravis Kelce's new fianc\u00e9e Taylor Swift was also there in a private box, where many of the game cameras were focused. Late in the game, the stadium cameras went to the box where Travis Kelce played to the crowd. Even though his Bearcats were losing, he still smiled for those in his NFL stadium.\n2. Nebraska running back Emmett Johnson made himself known\nJohnson rushed for 598 yards last year, but had several bursts in the game for Nebraska, sustaining drives. Johnson ran for 76 yards in the first half and was a reliable pass catcher. Johnson finished with 108 yards on 25 carries. He was also the most productive receiver for the 'Huskers with seven grabs.\nGolday led UC's defense with 12 tackles, a sack and a tackle for loss, but gave hats off to Johnson.\n\"A great player, for sure,\" Golday said. \"We knew he was a great player coming in. He had a great game.\"\n3. New Cincinnati Bearcats receivers held in check by Nebraska\nPassing was almost non-existent in the first half, with Sorsby throwing for just 20 yards. Cyrus Allen was the only UC receiver with two catches. It wasn't better in the second half as weapons UC needs, like tight end Joe Royer and receivers Allen, Caleb Goodie and Jeff Caldwell, were shut down. Caldwell did not catch his first pass until there were nine minutes left in the game.\nThere really wasn't much effective passing until UC needed to move the ball late. Allen had five catches, but newcomers Goodie and Caldwell were held to one apiece. Clearly, it wasn't the debut anyone expected.\n\"We had great confidence coming into the game,\" Satterfield said. \"I think our receivers had a really great fall camp. You don't know until the first time you play a game. This is a tough environment, maybe one of the toughest we'll play in all year. We've got to get better when it's loud like that. I still have a lot of confidence in those receivers.\"\nSaid Sorsby of Nebraska's pass defense, \"They just did a good job all the way around. Whenever you have 69 yards passing, you're either clearly not doing something right or they're doing something really well. I think it was a combination of both. Props to those guys. We've got to figure it out.\"\nTight end Royer was also heavily covered and limited to three catches for 11 yards. For the Bearcats to succeed, they have to stretch the field. Unfortunately, on this night, the longest pass play went only 14 yards.\n\"I don't lose any confidence in the receivers,\" Sorsby said. \"I made some bad throws, some bad reads. There's definitely still opportunities there. We've got to figure it out before we get to conference play. This is obviously a tough loss. We wanted to win, but it really doesn't have anything to do with us getting to Dallas (Big 12 championship game). Our goal is still Dallas.\"\n4. Cincinnati Bearcats with late-half turnover, much like last season\nIn nine of their 12 games in 2024, UC gave up a score in the final minutes of the first half. With 1:06 left in the half, a Sorsby pass to Goodie was eventually ruled a fumble. That set up Raiola and the Cornhuskers in prime field position. Raiola's touchdown pass to Nyziah Hunter made it a 10-point lead at the break at 13-3 as opposed to 6-3.\nUC had that fumble, then the final pick on the pass meant for Goodie in the end zone near the end of regulation. Nebraska did not turn the ball over in the game.\n\"That's the difference in the game,\" Satterfield said. \"Three-point game and the two turnovers proved to be the difference.\"\nThe pre-halftime fumble resulted in seven points for the Cornhuskers leading to a familiar end. The last two seasons, the Bearcats have dropped eight games by eight points or less.\n5. Cincinnati Bearcats rotate running backs\nScott Satterfield stuck to his guns and played every running back at least one series: Evan Pryor, Tawee Walker, Manny Covey and Chance Williams all got a shot. Pryor and Walker had spurts, but the drives involving Covey and Williams were short-lived and Max Fletcher would have to come on and punt.\nNot surprisingly, quarterback Sorsby was UC's most effective runner. Walker eventually got some yards in a fourth-quarter scoring drive, but the majority of the big runs went to Sorsby. Sorsby finished four yards shy of 100 and scored both of the Bearcats' touchdowns. Walker had 53 yards on just seven carries.\n\"We'll go back and see who gives us the best chance to win,\" Satterfield said. \"We've got confidence in a lot of those guys in the running back room.\"\nNext up for Cincinnati Bearcats\nIt's a 3:30 p.m. kickoff for the Nippert Stadium opener vs. Bowling Green, Saturday, Sept. 6. The Falcons are now coached by former Ohio State and NFL running back Eddie George and hosted Lafayette Thursday night. Bowling Green won 26-7.\nThe teams haven't played since 1994 when Bowling Green came to Nippert and rolled Rick Minter's Bearcats 38-0 in his first year on the job. The Bearcats are 0-4 historically against Bowling Green which finished 7-6 last season after losing to Miami University in the MAC title game 28-12. UC won in Oxford vs. Miami last year, 27-16 to reacquire the Victory Bell.\n\""

      "text": "Cincinnati Bearcats football overreactions to close loss vs. Nebraska in Arrowhead\nKANSAS CITY, MO \u2013 A sea of red resulted in some Cincinnati Bearcats green, but the Battle Sports Kansas City Classic at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium will go down as yet another frustrating close loss.\nNebraska held off the Bearcats 20-17 when UC couldn't convert on a game-tying or game-winning score with the ball on the Nebraska 33-yard line. With 39 ticks left in the game, UC quarterback Brendan Sorsby's pass intended for Caleb Goodie in the end zone instead fell in the hands of Nebraska safety Malcolm Hartzog Jr.\nDespite the presence of former Bearcats Jason and Travis Kelce, Bryan Cook and America's trendiest pop star, Taylor Swift, the celebrity mojo wasn't enough to push UC to victory. Of the 72,884 in attendance, there was no question who the vast majority were rooting for.\nBuy Cincinnati Bearcats football tickets this seas\n5 overreactions to Cincinnati Bearcats loss to Nebraska\n1. Cincinnati Bearcats passing game wasn't improved\nA key objective in the offseason was to try to increase the speed of the wide receivers so the Bearcats could stretch the field, making long gains. Last year's squad struggled late in the season to make such plays.\nEnter Walter Payton Award finalist, 6-foot-5 Jeff Caldwell from Lindenwood, burner Caleb Goodie from Colorado State and playmaker Cyrus Allen from Texas A&M. They looked great during camp, but a hostile atmosphere at Arrowhead can't be duplicated.\nThe trio combined for just seven catches for 51 yards, with 41 of those yards and five catches going to Allen. Caldwell's lone reception didn't come until the fourth quarter and was for only five yards. Goodie was involved in the two costly turnovers that helped Nebraska to the victory. His late first-half fumble led to a touchdown and the interception at the end sent the Cornhuskers fans to the parking lot happy (though Sorsby underthrew the ball).\nStretching the field? UC's longest pass play went 14 yards to Allen. Tight end Joe Royer? The probable NFL draft pick was limited to three catches for 11 yards.\n\"They just did a good job all around,\" Brendan Sorsby said of Nebraska's defense. \"Whenever you have 69 yards passing, you're either clearly not doing something right or they're doing something really well. I think it was a combination of both.\"\nSaid Satterfield, \"You don't know until the first time you play a game. We've got to get better in these environments. I do have a lot of confidence in those receivers that they can make plays. We'll go back and watch tape and see how we can put them in better positions to make plays.\"\n2. Cincinnati Bearcats need to settle on 'alpha' running back\nSatterfield had said they were going to give each running back a series, then decide on a \"hot hand.\" UC did rush for 202 yards, but 96 of those were from Sorsby and 18 from receiver Allen. That leaves 88 yards from the running backs on 14 carries. That's an average of 6.3 yards per carry, but the Chance Williams and Manny Covey sets resulted in just six yards rushing and both times the Bearcats went \"three and out.\"\nEvan Pryor was held to 29 yards and was not able to get outside, where he's most effective. Tawee Walker was the most successful runner with 53 yards on seven carries. Pryor and Walker each had one catch out of the backfield, so it was not a banner day. If Walker was brought in to replicate the 894 yards and 10 touchdowns he had at Wisconsin last year, he's going to need more than seven carries per game.\n\"We came into the game with a plan to play them all,\" Satterfield said. \"We'll go back and watch that and see who gives us the best chance to win. We've got confidence in a lot of those guys in that running back room.\"\nPrevious Cincinnati Bearcats vs. Nebraska content\n5 takeaways from Cincinnati Bearcats loss to Nebraska in Kansas City\nLive updates from Cincinnati Bearcats vs. Nebraska Cornhuskers Aug. 28\nSee Cincinnati Enquirer game-by-game predictions for Cincinnati Bearcats\n3. Cincinnati Bearcats allow late first-half points vs. Nebraska. Is this 'Same old ... ?'\nIn the last four minutes of the first half last season, UC gave up a touchdown to Towson, a field goal to Pitt, a touchdown to Texas Tech, a field goal to UCF, a touchdown to Colorado, a touchdown to West Virginia, a field goal to Iowa State, a touchdown to Kansas State and a field goal to TCU. They were 2-8 in those games. Four of those losses were by seven points or less.\nDown 6-3 with 1:06 in the first half, Sorsby, from his own 19, completed a five-yard toss to Goodie. It was Goodie's only catch, but it was ruled a fumble, handing Nebraska the ball. Less than 30 seconds later, Raiola hit Nyziah Hunter for a touchdown and Nebraska went to the locker room up by 10 instead of three. The math is simple.\n\"The two turnovers proved to be the difference,\" Satterfield said.\n4. 'Mini-Mahomes' Dylan Raiola, Emmett Johnson of Nebraska had their way vs. Cincinnati Bearcats\nStatistically, Raiola was 33-of-42 for 243 yards and two touchdowns. UC sacked him three times. Nebraska offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen's best accomplishment was controlling the clock as Nebraska had nearly twice the amount of time as UC (39:30 to 20:30).\n\"For our guys to play 40 minutes and to hold them to 350 (353) yards and 20 points, that's outstanding defensive football,\" Satterfield said.\nSenior linebacker Jake Golday led UC with 12 tackles, a sack and a tackle for loss. Many of those came vs. Nebraska runner Johnson who led everyone with 108 yards on 25 carries, though his 4.3-yard average was less than UC's backs.\n\"We knew he was a great player coming in,\" Golday said. \"He had a great game.\"\nJohnson had 76 of his yards in the first half, when UC was limited to just 22 on the ground.\n5. Cincinnati Bearcats shouldn't have 'sold' home game vs. Nebraska\nThis would be an easy one to shoot from the hip over as the natural assumption would be UC could win if they had \"home field advantage.\" The reality is, UC is likely not going to get a major non-conference opponent into Nippert with a capacity of just under 40,000. In previous years, they played Ohio State and Oklahoma at the Bengals stadium.\nThere's also the reality that Power Four schools must set aside $20.5 million to pay athletes under the NCAA vs. House agreement, plus back damages to athletes from 2016-2020. \"College-only\" towns in these conferences have the luxury of deep-pocketed donors whose sole interests are subsidizing their favorite schools. Cincinnati has the NFL and MLB and many suitors looking for thick wallets to be philanthropic to their causes.\nPower Four \"big boy\" football also involves substantial buyouts in contracts and the need for extra revenue streams. Athletically, no one likes taking it on the chin for a check, but financially, UC AD John Cunningham's team engaged in a transaction that nearly every AD in the country would have accepted.\nThe game was originally set for Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, then \"bought out\" by the Arrowhead group, who cold-called UC. With a $2.5 million guarantee, 75% of the 72,884 tickets sold and no operational expenses, estimates are the profit could be in the $6 million neighborhood.\nHad UC won by three, you would call the move genius.\nFuture overreaction\nUC is 0-4 against Bowling Green, including a 38-0 shutout in 1994 at Nippert Stadium. They are cursed!\nThe above is all true except for the cursed part. While there surely was cursing 31 years ago when the Falcons flogged the Bearcats, UC should have the talent level to win, in addition to the momentum a home game at Nippert brings to the team.\nNever discount the MAC, as it attracts some of the finest players. Before making the national title game last season, Marcus Freeman's Notre Dame Fighting Irish lost to Northern Illinois 16-14 in South Bend. But the reality is UC should be a comfortable favorite, ready to prove something to their home fans.\nHow to watch Cincinnati Vs. Bowling Green Saturday, Sept. 6"

  "argos_summary": "The Cincinnati Bearcats lost 20-17 to Nebraska in a game that was originally scheduled as a home opener but was relocated to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City for financial reasons. The 72,884\u2011seat venue hosted celebrities like Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, but the Bearcats\u2019 performance was hampered by turnovers and a weak passing attack. The game\u2019s relocation and the significant revenue from ticket sales highlight the growing trend of universities monetizing non\u2011conference matchups at larger venues.",
