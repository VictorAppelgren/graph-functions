I don't have the bandwidth for it right now,\" she says. \"I'm not somebody that likes to do something when I can't be good at it.\"\n\nThe reality star, 44, goes on to explain that the treatment she has received for the tumors in her brain have caused some challenges, and she wouldn't want others to misinterpret her actions because of that.\n\n\"I feel like my words are a little stuttery sometimes and it doesn't mean I'm telling a lie,\" she notes. \"Some people have to relearn to talk after having these surgeries that I had. The fact that I can do as much as I can do, I'm so blessed for. But it still happens to me, and some days are very bad.\"\n\n\"Some days, I'm just stumbling word over word,\" she continues. \"And I would hate to be on a show like that and have somebody think that I was not being honest and really I was just struggling. And then them get the heat for it because how could you do that to someone that has cancer?\"\n\n\"I don't think it would be the best for the cast, and it wouldn't be the best for me right now,\" she adds.\n\nMellencamp was a main cast member for seasons 8 through 10 of RHOBH, with her three seasons airing between 2017 and 2020.\n\nThough returning to the series in the immediate future is a hard no for Mellencamp, host Jamie Kern Lima asks if she would ever return to the franchise at some point in the future.\n\nTo that, the reality star admits she doesn't know.\n\n\"I enjoy it so much now that I recap it,\" she says, referring to her Two T's in a Pod podcast with fellow reality star Tamra Judge of The Real Housewives of Orange County and her Diamonds in the Rough podcast with her former RHOBH costar Erika Jayne.\n\n\"I don't know that I need to be on that particular show again,\" she explains of her Real Housewives experience. \"But I would love to be on TV in some capacity.\"\n\nElsewhere during her podcast appearance, Mellencamp reveals what she is \"most fearful\" of in her life right now.\n\nShe seemingly refers to death as \"the most obvious\" thing to be afraid of, before admitting that she's \"fearful of feeling alone.\"\n\nThat said, she quickly shoots that down by calling it an \"irrational fear\" because she has \"so many friends and family\" around her.\n\n\"Some people aren't blessed with that,\" she says, adding, \"I need to get this out of my head.\"\n\nMellencamp's admission about her \"fear of being alone\" comes as she navigates dating while going through cancer and a divorce from husband Edwin Arroyave.\n\nIn a statement shared in November 2024, Mellencamp \u2014 who is the daughter of singer John Mellencamp \u2014 announced that she was filing for divorce from Arroyave after 13 years of marriage. Those proceedings were put on pause after her stage 4 cancer diagnosis in April 2025, and the two have remained on friendly terms.\n\nIn the meantime, Mellencamp started dating someone new, as she shared the news in a June episode of her Two Ts In A Pod podcast. The man was later identified as Ricci Rea.\n\nIn an episode that followed, Mellencamp opened up about finding a partner who can understand where she's at in life, saying, \"If it\u2019s enough for you, great. If it\u2019s not enough, I won\u2019t be upset. I mean, yes, my feelings will probably be hurting, but this is all I got to give. And if that\u2019s enough, great.\"\n\nHowever, she and Rea have since split, with Mellencamp explaining in early July that she had to call things off.\n\n\u201cRight now, it started getting to the point where it\u2019s starting to get a little bit more serious. I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t have the capacity for this right now,\u2019\u201d Mellencamp said. \u201cHe\u2019s a really nice guy, couldn\u2019t be a nicer guy.\"\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe third part of Mellencamp's interview on The Jamie Kern Lima Show drops Tuesday, Aug. 12, at 9 a.m. ET/6 a.m. PT on YouTube.",

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2016. People Editorial Guidelines Published on July 9, 2025 04:44PM EDT 3 Comments Rachel Zoe. Credit : Mark Hanson NEED TO KNOW Rachel Zoe opens up to PEOPLE about her decision to join the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills for season 15Zoe finally sets the record straight on reports that she's doing the show for moneyZoe reveals how filming has compared to when she did her first Bravo series, The Rachel Zoe Project, which ran from 2008 to 2013 For Rachel Zoe, life is coming full circle as she prepares to make her reality TV return. When the celebrity stylist, 53, ended her show The Rachel Zoe Project after five seasons in April 2013, her son Skyler was 2, and she was early into her pregnancy with her second son, Kaius. Now, Skyler and Kaius are 14 and 11, respectively, and she found out about her casting in the upcoming season 15 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills \"on my way to Sky's graduation from middle school,\" Zoe tells PEOPLE. \"I actually cried,\" she says. \"I was like, 'How is this even possible?' The whole thing is wild. It's been a very surreal time, honestly.\" Rachel Zoe and sons Kaius and Skyler. Rachel Zoe/Instagram Zoe confirmed she was joining the RHOBH cast with a social media post on June 6. The announcement came nine months after she announced her split from her husband of 26 years, Rodger Berman, 56. \"While building my different businesses and raising my kids over the past 10 years, I've discussed coming back to TV in different ways,\" she says. \"But for me to go back [on TV], it had to be when I really felt like I had a lot to share and a lot to say. Publicly, as we know, my life has shifted in many ways personally and professionally. I felt like it was the time now to sit with an amazing group of women and really talk about my new life and what that looks like.\" Zoe knows there are a lot of aspects of her life that seem unattainable, but she's found joy in hearing just how much people have connected to her story. \"I know that sounds silly, because I know I'm a fashion person, and I know my life may not be that relatable, but I go through very real, very relatable things and emotions,\" she says. \"I live my life in a very normal, relatable way most of the time. I think that to sit with women and talk about that, for me, is a great way to sort of share what I'm living through, what I'm going through. I think I have a really strong message to share now, and I think that's really why I wanted to do the show.\" Contrary to reports, Zoe is \"not doing the show for the money\" and says the rumors are \"so ridiculous.\" In the time since her first show began in 2008, Zoe has learned to grow a thick skin. \"In 2008, I think there was maybe Twitter, but not what exists now,\" she says. \"It's funny because people will just jump on something. They create a story and a narrative, and then, all of a sudden, it's viral. It's everywhere. There used to be tabloids when I was doing my show, and it was like one person would write something and then it could be other places. But it was different because it was in print, so there were different lead times.\" Now, \"one incorrect things gets said, and it's around the internet in like 60 seconds,\" she says. \"So that's been a little surreal.\" Related Stories Kathy Hilton Says She\u2019s 'Already Filmed a Few Times' with New 'RHOBH' Cast Member Rachel Zoe (Exclusive) Rachel Zoe on 10 Years of Oscars Styling and Talks a Red Carpet Return 'Without the Pettiness' (Exclusive) Zoe initially decided to go on TV with The Rachel Zoe Project to \"give people an inside look\" at the fashion industry. During a recent visit to New York, Zoe says \"at least twice a day\" someone would come up to her to say \"I became a stylist because of you and your show.\" \"The Rachel Zoe Project gave that insight and inspired young people to live their dream, which they didn't even know existed, really, because a lot of people didn't know what a stylist was,\" she says. \"Certainly, I didn't. I was just sort of figuring it out as I went.\" Filming for RHOBH compared to The Rachel Zoe Project has been \"incredibly different,\" Zoe says. \"It's very organic,\" she says. \"For me, when cameras roll, I don't feel them, I don't see them, and I pretend they're not there. I feel like the best way to do this is, like, let's just roll. Let's just roll and let's just be organic about how we create this. So it's been fun.\" Zoe says her style mantra has remained the same through both experiences. \"To be honest, on [The Rachel Zoe Project], I just sort of got dressed in real time every day,\" she says. \"Now, I'm just sort of winging it, too. I've gone into my archives and pulled some things I'll probably wear for filming, but I honestly wish I could say that it was planned and calculated. It's a little bit ready, set, go.\" Taylor Jacobson, Rodger Berman, Rachel Zoe and Brad Goreski on The Rachel Zoe Project. Andrew Durham/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty On RHOBH, Zoe has loved getting the chance to film with new friends like Bozoma \"Boz\" Saint John and longtime friends like Kathy Hilton. \"Boz I had on my podcast and fell in love with her,\" Zoe says. \"I've known Kathy Hilton forever, like 20 years, and I'm very close with her daughters and with her. She's such a great friend and a great person. She had a lot to do with why I'm doing the show. So, I think there's so many reasons, honestly, but overall it just felt like the right time.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Credit : Jamie McCarthy/Getty Teddi Mellencamp's husband Edwin Arroyave has been a big source of support amid her cancer journey. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum and the entreprenuer got married in 2011 and later welcomed three kids together. Mellencamp filed for divorce from Arroyave in November 2024, just three months before the TV personality revealed she had several tumors in her brain. While the two have not formally reconciled, Arroyave has stayed by Mellencamp's side, opening up about how their relationship has evolved in the wake of her cancer diagnosis in an April 2025 episode of The Eds podcast. Teddi Mellencamp's 3 Kids: All About Slate, Cruz and Dove (and How They're Supporting the RHOBH Alum amid Her Health Diagnosis) \"People think that's hard, but for me, that's just what I do,\" he said. \"Like it's no matter what, I will always love Teddi and she's been a big part of my life ... So it wasn't even like, a question.\" \"I think a big part of dealing with this situation is feeling confident, feeling like you're not alone,\" Arroyave added. \"And I think her friends all stepped up, her family all stepped up. And it helped me a lot.\" So who is Teddi Mellencamp's husband? Here's everything to know about Edwin Arroyave and his relationship with the RHOBH alum. He is an entrepreneur Edwin Arroyave arrives at the 2022 iHeartRadio Music Festival on Sept. 23, 2022, in Las Vegas. David Becker/Getty Arroyave is the founder and CEO of Skyline Security Management, which he launched in 1999, per his LinkedIn. The company focuses on providing personalized home security solutions and is licensed across more than half of the U.S., per its website. They met at a night club Edwin Arroyave and Teddi Mellencamp on 'Watch What Happens Live' with Andy Cohen. Charles Sykes/Bravo/Getty During a January 2019 conversation with Yahoo Life, Mellencamp and Arroyave opened up about the early days of their relationship, including their first encounter at a nightclub in 2008. \"The first time Edwin saw me, he was leaving a nightclub and I was walking in,\" she said, adding that he basically did a \"180.\" \"I basically stalked her until I saw her friends leave her for three seconds and then I went in really quick and asked if she wanted a drink,\" Arroyave added. Mellencamp also joked about how she was \"tricked a little bit\" at first, saying, \"When I first saw Edwin, he had a beanie cap on, and then when I saw him the next morning, the beanie was off and there was a ponytail hanging out the back.\" \"The alarm went off the next morning, and I looked at him, I'm like, 'Alright Edward, time to go,' \" she said, adding that she accidentally called him \"Edmund.\" Mellencamp didn't think much would come of their encounter. Instead, the reality TV star thought it would be a \"story that you tell your girlfriends,\" and that she would maybe see him \"one more time.\" She shared that they casually dated \"for a long time,\" but meeting Arroyave's daughter made the relationship feel \"a lot more real.\" They got married in July 2011 Teddi Mellencamp and Edwin Arroyave on their wedding day. Edwin Arroyave/ Instagram During the conversation with Yahoo Life, Mellencamp reflected on their engagement \u2014 which almost didn't happen. \"He came home and he had tears in his eyes, and I'd never really seen him cry before,\" she said. \"He just put a blank check down on the bedside table, and he was like, 'Hey, I just wanted to tell you that I love you, and I went to go buy the ring today. I'm sorry I just don't believe in marriage, and I don't want you to break up with me.' \" Mellencamp said it felt as though the life had been \"sucked out\" of her, but told him that they would \"figure it out\" after Christmas Eve the next day. In a holiday twist, the ring box ended up being in one of Mellencamp's Christmas presents from Arroyave. \"Your mind plays tricks on you,\" Arroyave added. \"At the end of the day, I knew that this was the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.\" The pair tied the knot on July 4, 2011. In an awkward moment, Arroyave's alarm clock accidentally went off as he was about to say \"I do,\" but the ceremony continued on. They share three kids Teddi Mellencamp and Edwin Arroyave celebrate Easter with their three children Slate, Cruz and Dove in March 2024. Teddi Mellencamp/ Instagram Mellencamp and Arroyave welcomed three children together: Slate, Cruz and Dove. In December 2024, Mellencamp shared a heartfelt Instagram message to Arroyave, detailing how bonding with his daughter in the early days of their relationship helped open her eyes to motherhood. \"I would never have known I wanted kids until meeting my amazing stepdaughter, Isabella,\" she said. \"My love for her changed my life and 5 years later came Slate, then Cruz, and then our miracle baby Dove in 2020.\" \"I may be far from perfect but being a mother has been the greatest gift you could have given me,\" Mellencamp added. During the April episode of The Eds podcast, Arroyave shared that he and Mellencamp decided to be \"upfront\" with their children about her health struggles. \"I tried my best to again not sugarcoat it too much,\" he said. \"I called it the way it was. It's like, 'Hey, there's some tumors that your mom has in her brain.' And I said, 'It sounds worse than what it is, but this is what I think is, this is what we think is going to happen. This is sort of how we're going to deal with it, and this is why I'm confident that she's going to make it through.' \" They split in late 2024 Teddi Mellencamp and Edwin Arroyave attend the Cure Melanoma Gala on Oct. 24, 2024, in New York City.

Court documents cited \"irreconcilable differences,\" and listed their separation date as Oct. 20, 2024. That December, Mellencamp shared during the first episode of her podcast Diamonds in the Rough that despite their divorce filing, marrying Arroyave and having kids with him was \"one of the best things that [she's] ever done.\" \"We're completely happy to be around one another,\" she said. Although they split, Arroyave has been by Mellencamp's side through her health struggles, from visiting her in the hospital ahead of her February brain surgery to updating her fans and followers. Mellencamp\u2019s health struggles have helped them reconnect Edwin Arroyave and Teddi Mellencamp. Edwin Arroyave/ Instagram Arroyave acknowledged on The Eds podcast that Mellencamp's health struggles have helped them reconnect amid their divorce filing, but clarified that they are still taking things just one day at a time. \"The first thing is just making sure that we take care of this first and all that other stuff,\" he said. \"We'll see what happens with time. But for right now, it's just more of like, how do we take care of you? And how can we get you back to normal as fast as [possible]?\" Arroyave added, \"That other stuff will figure itself out.\" Close Leave a Comment Read more: Celebrity Celebrity Relationships"

People Editorial Guidelines Published on February 13, 2025 02:04PM EST 15 Comments Teddi Mellencamp. Credit : Gilbert Flores/Variety/Getty Over the years, Teddi Mellencamp has been transparent about her battle with skin cancer after having more than 17 different spots of melanoma removed. Now, the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, 43, revealed that she has been diagnosed with \u201cmultiple\u201d brain tumors and will undergo surgery to remove some of them before beginning radiation. Although Mellencamp has not shared whether her brain tumors are a result of her past melanoma spots, melanoma skin cancer has a rapid growth rate and can be life-threatening. According to the National Institute of Health, up to 60% of patients with advanced melanoma develop brain metastases during the course of their disease, and \u201cthe presence of brain metastases significantly worsens a patient\u2019s prognosis.\u201d This occurs when cancer cells migrate through the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, experts noted that when melanoma spreads to the brain, there is often more than one lesion at a time. As Mellencamp continues to share updates on her health, here\u2019s a complete timeline of the reality star\u2019s cancer journey so far.
