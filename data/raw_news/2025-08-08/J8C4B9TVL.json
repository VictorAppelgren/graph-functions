  "description": "The Omaha\u2013Lincoln branding debate tests whether geography or mindset defines tech hub identity.",
  "content": "At 58 miles apart, should Omaha-Lincoln brand itself as one startup hub?\n\nWhether or not Nebraska economic development branding matters much to you, this teaches about how places can (or can\u2019t) show up together. I looked at eight other city-pair tech regions to put Nebraska\u2019s debate in context.\n\n\u201cOmaha and Lincoln are the same startup ecosystem,\u201d entrepreneur-consultant Tom Chapman wrote in a recent LinkedIn essay that\u2019s ricocheting through Nebraska\u2019s tech circles. He noted that M25\u2019s new Best of the Midwest list ranks Lincoln No. 15 and Omaha No. 16 \u2014 side by side, yet still separate.\n\nThe question prompted me to ask for feedback from others. Literal distance matters, but other culture factors play a role too, like airports, sports teams and commutes.\n\nThere may also be more than one answer: A single cohesive ecosystem strategy can be a different concept than how a given place is marketed and talked about.\n\nWhat the distances say\n\nTo see how unusual (or not) a joint Omaha\u2013Lincoln identity would be, I mapped the road distance between eight well-known paired innovation hubs.\n\n1) Different parts of the country present differently\n\nThe big states of the Great Plains simply have less density than the denser mid-Atlantic and the faster-growing Southeast. Silicon Valley\u2019s Bay Area (SF\u2013SJ) and Colorado\u2019s Front Range (Denver\u2013Boulder) confront traffic and cultural differences, but they\u2019ve each developed a shared identity. Omaha\u2013Lincoln sit within a similar distance as those two examples, and have even more cultural cohesion.\n\nDC and Baltimore are closer than San Francisco and San Jose, yet rarely market themselves together \u2014 a point Chapman\u2019s supporters highlight.\n\nEvery paired region I found that actually co-brands (or is widely perceived as a single ecosystem) sits inside that threshold. At 90 miles, New York\u2013Philadelphia illustrates the psychological distance that creeps in, even with fast rail links. Louisiana does have a strong statewide identity, but Baton Rouge and New Orleans are still distinct. Meanwhile, especially close cities like Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul inevitably co-exist.\n\nWhy it matters for Nebraska\n\nChapman argues a united \u201cBuilder Plains\u201d (or some name yet to emerge) would help the state \u201cpunch above its weight,\u201d combining resources such as Invest Nebraska, University of Nebraska Medical Center spin-outs and software heavyweights Hudl and Buildertrend.\n\nLongtime startup champions like Chapman remember the roots of the beloved news resource Silicon Prairie News, a Technical.ly affiliate now focused on Nebraska: it once served a far-wider reach of the Midwest and Great Plains. As more activity blossomed in more places, it made sense for Silicon Prairie News to narrow its focus.\n\nChapman argues that at a regional level, the Omaha\u2013Lincoln paring should present more like Denver\u2013Boulder. Critics worry about diluting each city\u2019s identity, but the data suggest the mileage barrier isn\u2019t the problem.\n\nBranding only sticks if local founders and funders use it. Expect the conversation to surface at upcoming ecosystem events and in the next M25 rankings.\n\nIn the meantime, tell me: Should Omaha and Lincoln fly one startup flag, or keep their own colors?",

      "text": "Omaha and Lincoln need to come up with better branding. I maintain that Omaha and Lincoln are the same startup ecosystem. Just as my neighborhood is different from Aksarben or Dundee or the Haymarket - they make up components of a larger whole. For us to succeed, Omaha and Lincoln leaders need to come up with a shared identity - including a name. Sadly, this does matter. Yesterday, M25 released their best ecosystems in the Midwest - Lincoln was 15 and Omaha was 16. The two cities essentially move around each other in that range. In 2024, Omaha was 16 and Lincoln was 18. [As an aside, I looked at the criteria, and I have some thoughts...but this is not a judgment on rankings or how to evaluate places.] Together, the two appear likely to have a bigger/better ecosystem than Kansas City...which is twice as large. Don't we want to punch above our weight class - rather than punching each other? But, on X and Linkedin, I see people pointing out the success or failure...rather than the joint opportunity. Here's the problem in my mind. The ecosystem involves startup companies and their support network. Do Omaha and Lincoln have different support networks? Is Invest Nebraska less invested in Omaha? Do our lawyers only serve their home city? Does the prototype grant only go to the Platte river? Does Hudl only have people in Lincoln? Does UNMC only produce startups and doctors for Omahans? Should only Lincoln people support Husker athletes on Opendorse? Does Omaha get to cheer for BuilderTrend but not CompanyCam? For reference - Silicon Valley, according to similar analysis, includes San Francisco and San Jose (two different MSAs) that are further apart than Omaha and Lincoln by mileage and driving times. Why don't we re-brand Omaha and Lincoln for startup purposes as something that brings us together? And to be clear, this is not all of Nebraska. Council Bluffs is much more a part of the ecosystem than Scottsbluff. Builder Plains? The Platte Region? [Another aside - I suck at naming things.] Try your hand - but we really need to do better. Lincoln and Omaha work well together - but we get mad (or at least side eye) at each other whenever someone \"wins\". This is not a kumbaya post. This is me saying that legitimately we need to come up with branding that expresses the truth. This helps companies like Peeq Pro - to have a united, well recognized startup hub as its home. We have an opportunity to be the engine of the plains as a startup hub - Buildertrend, CompanyCam, Hudl, Green Plains Inc., Major Talent, Workshop, Opendorse, Monolith, Event Vesta, dare I say, Peeq Pro... But our cities have to come together with a new united ecosystem - around brand, name, and focus. These are signals of a shared vision...not mechanisms to get better rankings. Is this not obvious?\n100% agree. Combined we\u2019d punch at the level of KC, Raleigh, etc and it\u2019s 40 minutes to drive Old Market to Haymarket. Which is comparable if not shorter than many of the other large \u201cecosystems\u201d like Phoenix, The Bay, DFW, New York etc. One name Kathy Andersen and I had spitballed before was Flatwater Founders (before the FFP launched) to harken to the Platte River\nGreat comment. It should be all of Nebraska. I\u2019m a recently repatriated Nebraska native after living in the Bay Area for 12 years. I run one of the most advanced AI startups in Nebraska and we\u2019re based in Ravenna developing the Silicon Prairie Center with Kirk Zeller, DBA. We\u2019ve been largely ignored by the state startup eco-system infrastructure, other than potential clients of our capabilities. Big loss for the state to not leverage our tech, Bay Area connections, and repatriation story.\nAren't Omaha and Lincoln already branded as the Silicon Prairie?\nMaybe it could (should) be like this, but the culture is also a bit different between the networks. Omahans seem to have movers and shakers that like excluding or actively interfering with each other. Lincolnites (other than me sometimes) don't really seem to do that and at times feel a burn here or there from the Omahans.\nI\u2019d advocate that we quiet our cleverness and keep it simple - let\u2019s just refer to us as Omaha-Lincoln. Whenever we mention the startup community or the entrepreneurial ecosystem, we refer to it as the Omaha-Lincoln ecosystem. Never separate the two. This mindset will be more powerful than any brand we try to come up with, and will ensure that if we\u2019re considering something for one community, we\u2019re immediately including the other.\nGreat perspective, of course. At the same time, I'm not sure it's a branding issue... Maybe we just need strong leaders who step up and lead? Lead all of Nebraska startup, angel, and VC energy?\nIt\u2019s not just the business community that is split, the arts community is as well. I am well entrenched in the Omaha arts community and there is little to no overlap with Lincoln\u2019s despite both cities having decent art scenes.\nEach taking on the fight alone is poor strategy and lack of vision. Its Nebraska... we are already fighting against the idea that its the middle of nowhere. Go to the coasts and talk about Nebraska. The response... \ud83d\udca9. We can fight for scraps or join forces and show the rest of the country that we are in the middle of everything and not the middle of nowhere.\nQuite obvious to this ecosystem stakeholder.\nDebunking the myth that there is a talent shortage in Nebraska \ud83c\udf3d\n21hThis thread and other similar conversations made me write a blog post: https://www.ignitenebraska.org/blog/omaha-lincoln-two-ecosystems"

      "text": "Inspired by a healthy debate happening in Nebraska about whether Omaha and Lincoln should present as a single cohesive startup ecosystem or independent ones, the Technical.ly newsroom looked at the distance of other different regions. (Thanks Tom Chapman for the inspiration!) Three points: (1) Of course different parts of the country present differently. I've long marveled that DC and Baltimore are closer to each other San Jose and San Francisco (Bay Area!) but leaders there have been slow to co-identify. (Tammi Thomas, Shervonne Cherry and Margaret Roth have all heard this from me, though Kathy Etemad Hollinger and Tom Shaw are working on it!) In contrast, many places around the country leverage statewide identities, and Nebraska is a prime one -- I know Dell Gines, Stefanie Monge and Matt Wynn must have feelings there. I also think of Tony Zanders and Nexus Louisiana, where Kwamena Aidoo has also given me a lesson or three. (2) Second, whenever I talk about this, people always point out travel time matters. I'm actually less convinced of this! Travel time in \"Silicon Valley\" are famously erratic, and in contrast there is a (reasonably) efficient train system between New York and Philadelphia but (even with occasional super commuters like Michael Brennan) noooooo one thinks of those as the same ecosystem. (Hot take: I think they should!) (3) Across all the regions of the country, something does appear to happen once you get past, say, 40-50 miles of distance: There just aren't any cohesive ecosystems at that distance that I can find. Denver and Boulder are fairly distinct but the relative proximity salvages it: it's the same distance between Dallas and Fort Worth, which gets blended as a region though there are real ecosystem differences (isn't that right Cameron Cushman!) Minneapolis-St. Paul are, you know, literally adjacent (as Meg Steuer, Ben Ihde and Alfonso N. Cornish II, JD can attest), and the Raleigh-Durham heart of Research Triangle might as well be (right, Chris Heivly and \ud83d\udce3 Kelly Propst). So at those distances, it's inevitable to develop a single cohesion. My take on the Nebraska debate? Well, obvs the community decides, but I'd add that statewide identities help, when individual ecosystems are a bit too far to reasonably identify as one. Whatcha think?\nMan, if we could bottle up the energy around this topic we could fuel Nebraska power plants for *years.* My take? Omaha and Lincoln combined don't have the population of even one of the metros listed in most of those comparisons (Not so fast, Louisiana). Of course we're one ecosystem. Now, that said, there's a fun give and take, kind of like a sibling rivalry. Sure, we bicker. Sure, we compete. And there's a telling \"is their slice of cake bigger than mine?\" glance this older brother can't help but notice. But the reality is each makes the other better. They trade talent, comingle resources, build upon everyone's wins. Case in point: Silicon Prairie News' pitch competition last year was held in Omaha. We had 19 semifinalists. Nine were from Omaha. Eight from Lincoln. One from Kearney and one from Grand Island. That wasn't because we were checking some sort of boxes for geographic representation. It was because those were the best pitches. We act as one ecosystem. And we're better for it!\nTo add flavor for Minnesota, there are initiatives like Naturally MN that intentionally include the whole state, or Medical Alley that connects the assets of Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN with the enterprise leaders and university researchers in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, not to mention contributions from Saint Cloud and beyond.\nStartup and Scaleup Champion. Connector of People and Ideas. Advisor and Strategist.\n1hExcellent point. Need louder messaging about the convenience of NYC to Philly. It's easy and affordable with better quality of life and lower operating costs for talent and space. (Would be great to explore the opportunity and value of NYC+Philly integration/outpost ecosystem! I'll sign up!) Plus, a friend of mine had a theory that if Mamdani is elected mayor of NYC, Philly is the closest \"next place,\" and would benefit from the possible exodus."
