  "title": "Does Walmart Sell DeWalt Tools? Here's What You Should Know",
  "description": "While Walmart does carry DeWalt products, its use of third-party sellers for these items means there's no guarantee that you'll get a well-maintained tool.",
  "content": "It is no secret that DeWalt is among the most highly regarded and best-ranked power tool brands on the market. With battery systems like MAX and Flexvolt, DeWalt gives you the opportunity to stock your garage with an array of helpful tools that can all be operated by the same power source, saving you money in the long run. That does not even get into things like hand tools, which DeWalt makes on just as high a level as its flashier power tools.\n\nPart of the reason DeWalt is so popular is that you can find them anywhere. Its selection can be purchased from major chains like The Home Depot and Lowe's, as well as many independent hardware stores. For greater accessibility, you may be wondering if you can find the brand at a major retailer like Walmart, as the store might offer them at a lower price than you would find elsewhere.\n\nA visit to Walmart.com reveals just about every tool you could want from the company, be it saws, drills, or ratcheting screwdrivers. However, there is a significant catch if you buy these from Walmart. You will see these products are available for purchase from third-party sellers, similar to the way Walmart offers Riyobi tools. Essentially, Walmart acts as the go-between instead of being the actual retailer.",

      "text": "Does Walmart Sell Ryobi Tools? Here's What You Should Know\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nThese days, you can find power tools just about anywhere. However, if you're interested in a specific brand, you may have to do some searching. After all, not all brands are available at every tool retailer. For example, Bauer and Icon are exclusive to Harbor Freight, the home of several tools that belong in every home garage. Meanwhile, Ryobi is most often found on shelves at Home Depot, as the line technically became exclusive to the hardware giant years ago.\nSurprisingly, this doesn't mean Home Depot is the only place to acquire such tools. If you peruse the Walmart website for a bit, you're likely to stumble upon a Ryobi product. The catch is that the selection won't be as extensive as Home Depot's, and you wouldn't be buying them from Walmart itself. Walmart's website allows third-party sellers to list items, such as Ryobi tools, and sell them at whatever price point and quantity they choose. This means that you won't find Ryobi tools in physical Walmart locations, only on the website, as this would fly in the face of the line's Home Depot exclusivity.\nWhile it might seem like the Walmart website is a good place to go for new additions to your Ryobi collection, that's not quite the case. There are some risks to entertaining these third-party sellers.\nRisks of buying Ryobi tools from the Walmart website\nIn an ideal situation, buying Ryobi tools from a Walmart website vendor won't present any issues. Unfortunately, there's a lot of room for error with this route, to the point that there are some undeniable risks. First and foremost is the quality of your purchase, which has the potential to be all over the place. As an unofficial source of Ryobi products, third-party sellers aren't held to the same standards as Ryobi itself and Home Depot. This means items could arrive broken, missing pieces, or replaced by other items entirely. Listings that include open box buying options are even more risky, as you know going into it that the tool isn't brand new and could be used.\nTypically, Ryobi's tool warranties would have you covered if something were wrong with your tool right out of the box. But for this warranty to apply, the tool needs to be purchased from an authorized retailer. In the case of Walmart or Amazon \u2014 somewhere you should think twice about buying Ryobi batteries and tools from \u2014 there's a good chance that a Ryobi warranty won't come included. In fact, Walmart's Ryobi listings prompt buyers to contact the seller to clarify what kind of warranty the tool in question may or may not come with.\nNeedless to say, there are serious concerns to keep in mind when buying Ryobi from the Walmart website. Moving away from hypotheticals, how have such transactions actually gone according to buyers?\nHow has buying Ryobi tools from Walmart gone for actual customers?\nNot a lot of people appear to have bought Ryobi tools from Walmart's website. Most tools only have a handful of reviews, though most of them seem positive.\nFor example, reviews of the Ryobi 40-volt cordless trimmer predominantly give it props for its build quality and power. The same goes for the comments on the Ryobi 18V cordless impact driver, with one reviewer saying the cool worked as expected. Even the Ryobi 18V 4Ah battery received a lot of praise from customers.\nStill, there are some negative assessments to go around, too. Several users purchased what was deceptively categorized on the Walmart website as a Ryobi 18V 6Ah battery, only to receive a low-quality aftermarket battery. The Ryobi 18V clamp fan isn't a favorite, either, with a three out of five star rating and one review stating they didn't get what they ordered. The Ryobi cordless blower kit also garnered low ratings from the few who bought it.\nOverall, buying Ryobi tools from Walmart is a mixed bag, to put it generously. Just to be safe, you're better off buying from Ryobi directly or Home Depot to avoid any stress-inducing mishaps. You could also take a look at Hart tools instead, which is one of Walmart's many exclusive brands."

      "text": "Every Major Power Tool Brand Ranked Worst To Best\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nFor DIY aficionados, seasoned craftsmen, and professionals alike, power tools are not just tools -\u2013 they are the engine driving every project to its finish line. Whether it's the precision of a drill, the raw power of a saw, the versatility of a grinder, or the torque of an impact driver, the right tool can elevate the efficiency of any task.\nHowever, the market is saturated with countless brands, each vying for attention, and high-quality power tools don't come with a low price tag. Opting for a bargain at a local hardware store might seem tempting, but the real cost comes out when that tool breaks down too soon, sending you back to the store in search of a replacement.\nIn this article, we dive deep into the world of premium power tool brands, evaluating and ranking them. All of the brands on this list are major brands that are the go-to for professionals on a construction site or for home use. While brand loyalty is admirable, we're ignoring personal biases and focusing purely on tangible metrics to find which power tool brand is best for you.\nEvery brand on this list is top tier in the industry, but we ranked them based on quality manufacturing, warranty, customer service, and ease of use. Here is a list of every major power tool brand ranked from worst to best.\nCaterpillar\nCaterpillar, often referred to simply as Cat, is one of the most recognizable brands in the heavy machinery realm. While its characteristic logo is most commonly associated with big construction vehicles, the company also makes some fantastic hand-powered tools as well.\nThe distinguishing feature of Cat Power Tools is its exclusive use of Graphene batteries, in contrast to the common lithium-ion variants. One of the main advantages of Graphene batteries is a remarkably swift charge time compared to lithium batteries and a longer charge cycle lifespan. This cutting-edge battery technology gives Caterpillar a real edge in the market.\nWith a history that goes back to the early 1900s, Caterpillar's legacy spans more than a century. While it dominates the large-scale construction machinery segment, Caterpillar's venture into powered hand tools is still in its early stages, but with an emphasis on innovations like the Graphene battery, it is steadily carving a unique identity in the tools sector. Given its long-standing reputation and commitment to quality, Caterpillar is a solid choice for those seeking powerful tools at reasonable prices.\nMac Tools\nVisit any auto shop, and you're likely to see Mac Tools at every station. Known for its product durability, reliability, and comfortable design, Mac Tools has carved a niche primarily in the automotive sector.\nWhile its product lineup is diverse, covering hand and power tools, the company's specialty lies in catering to the automotive industry. The focus isn't just on power, it's also on user comfort. Features like ergonomic grips on hand tools make extended use easier. Its collection also spans from pneumatic tools for demanding tasks to versatile battery-powered tools suitable for both pros and hobbyists.\nCustomer service is another arena where Mac Tools shines. Its unique approach involves sending out fully stocked work trucks to garages and job sites. Not just for sales, these field reps handle warranty claims, replenish stock, and provide a hands-on customer service experience. This direct, human-centric approach is a refreshing change from the impersonal and often frustrating phone-based service systems we've all grown accustomed to.\nMac Tools do come with a steeper price point, but considering their limited warranty, quality build, and ergonomic design, they are an investment expected to stand the test of time.\nSkil\nFor most, the iconic Skil Saw likely springs to mind when you hear the name Skil. That's no accident -\u2013 back in 1924, Skil revolutionized workshops everywhere by inventing the modern portable circular saw. Fast forward to today, and its reputation continues to buzz.\nBeyond saws, Skil has broadened its horizon with a dynamic lineup of both hand and powered tools. However, the company hasn't just been riding the wave of past success. Skil's commitment to innovation is evident in all of its offerings. From clever charging solutions, including handy USB options for on-the-move work, to user-friendly enhancements on its signature saws, Skil's probably thought of it. The adjustable depth meters and snap-on rail systems are genuine game-changers, letting users achieve precision cuts without breaking the bank.\nSpeaking of finances, Skil stands out for its value too. To put things in perspective, consider that a standard Mac Tools hand-powered drill costs approximately $250. However, a similar Skil hand drill costs approximately $100.\nIt's worth noting that Skil equipment will not compete with high-powered workshop tools. They simply aren't as strong. However, anybody wanting to do home improvements that don't need to take a bolt off a tractor will find that Skil power tools are inexpensive, feature-rich, and perfect for at-home use.\nBlack and Decker\nBlack and Decker merged with Stanley Works in 2010. That's significant because Stanley Works is the same company that owns Craftsman, meaning the two tool brands live under the same umbrella. Unlike Craftsman, which was a house brand for Sears, Black and Decker existed as a standalone tool manufacturer for over a century before its merger. The brand mostly specializes in budget-friendly tools and exists in the same overall space as Ryobi, Kobalt, and similar brands. Like Craftsman, Black and Decker makes regular tools, power tools, and lawn tools, among other things.\nIn terms of quality, it's about what you would expect for a power tool in its price point. The general advice we found is that they work just fine and can live a long life provided that the person using the tool is using it within spec. In other words, these tools aren't professional level, but they should easily be good enough for DIY fixes at home and maybe some light use on the job. Provided that you can manage your expectations, there's nothing wrong with Black and Decker.\nIn the grand scheme, Black and Decker is competitive in its space but it's not special in any way. The major benefit is being able to pick up something like this Black and Decker MAX 20V cordless drill kit that comes with several tools for under $100. However, if you need to do something a little heavier, you may want to look a little further down the list.\nSnap-on\nStep onto any U.S. military base around the globe and there's a good chance you'll find Snap-On tools in more than a few hands. While there isn't an official supplier for tools in these sectors, Snap-On's dominance is no accident. Not only are their tools high quality but many are also made in the USA. Many government agencies still give preferential treatment to American-made products when crafting their budgets. While the majority of Snap-On hand tools feature American craftsmanship, some electronic and plastic components are globally sourced.\nSnap-On is known for its outstanding customer service and high-quality tools. All of its hand tools have a lifetime warranty and their power tools have a generous limited warranty that covers any breakages. They come with a comprehensive limited warranty that predominantly covers defects and malfunctions. Word to the wise: if you're gearing up for heavy use, it's worth a glance at the details of Snap-On's policy.\nSnap-On's tools have a reputation for being sturdy, reliable, and built to last. But unsurprisingly, along with a stellar reputation comes a higher price tag. The high price point, however, is often offset for government agencies thanks to substantial bulk discounts.\nSo if you're looking for power tools that don't just meet standards but set them \u2013- and if your wallet agrees \u2013- Snap-On products will likely last the lifetime of your workshop.\nMetabo HPT\nThe name Metabo may not ring a bell, but chances are you'll recognize its former name, Hitachi, as Hitachi rebranded its North American power tools division to Metabo in 2018. While the name might have changed, the quality and performance that made Hitachi renowned haven't. It is also important to note if you're looking for power tools, make sure to search for Metabo HPT as it's a separate branch of Metabo that specifically makes power tools.\nThe Metabo HPT power tools sit comfortably in the mid to high-end spectrum, price-wise. However, what really sets them apart are the features that justify this price tag. Its most unique and innovative feature is the multi-volt power system. This intuitive feature enables hand power tools to oscillate between direct power source use and a battery-powered option. Whether you're tethered to a workshop or out on a site, Metabo HPT tools adapt. Need a power surge in your garage? Plug it in. Need mobility on a remote job site? Go wireless.\nMetabo HPT also has a host of accessories that make using its tools even easier. From customizable ergonomic grips that improve comfort and handling to nifty reloadable screw attachments, perfect for tasks like drywall installation, the variety is impressive. They also offer an array of power bank solutions to ensure your toolkit is always charged. With Metabo, you will be paying a premium for a full system, but it's a system that is easy to use and one that will last.\nHilti\nHilti might not be the first name that comes to mind for many unless you're in the construction industry, especially within its specialized segments. Hilti is known for its heavy demolition equipment and its all-in-one systems for efficiency and safety. Headquartered in Liechtenstein, Hilti doesn't merely produce tools \u2014 it crafts comprehensive systems. Beyond the usual power tools, it offers heavy-duty variants with an emphasis on safety and maintaining a clean work environment, thanks to integrated dust prevention features.\nWhile Hilti operates globally, its forte lies in large-scale demolition gear. These aren't your everyday garage tools. Instead, Hilti specializes in equipment that can tackle big jobs like drilling through concrete walls while maintaining a clean job site. This design approach extends to their in-house tracking system, ON!Track, that measures jobsite metrics, offering helpful insights.\nA standout feature is its Nuron power system, a large battery pack that's compatible with numerous Hilti tools. Its tremendous charge capacity and quick-charge capabilities are game-changers. Moreover, Hilti has a reputation for excellent safety and anchoring equipment, offering an array of tools crafted explicitly for anchoring construction elements virtually anywhere. While Hilti might not ring bells in the DIY community, it has a major presence in professional construction. Hilti's products are more expensive than other brands, especially since you'll need to buy its proprietary systems to get the most out of the system.\nRigid\nRidgid is a major player in the power tools arena, an American company that has been in operation since 1923. True to its name, Ridgid tools embody durability and are built to serve generations. To back this up, it is one of the few companies to offer one of the most robust lifetime warranties on the market.\nWhile most brands might offer lifetime warranties for hand tools, Ridgid extends this commitment to its power tools as well. The warranty is comprehensive, shielding users from all potential issues apart from misuse and the inevitable wear and tear. However, with Ridgid's durable build quality, wear and tear concerns are minimal. Should any challenges arise, Ridgid's efficient servicing network provides swift resolutions.\nAt the heart of Ridgid's innovations is the Gen5x Motor. This brushless motor system underscores Ridgid's reputation for resilience, power, and minimal maintenance. These qualities have become synonymous with the brand, making it a go-to for professionals and DIY enthusiasts alike.\nWhile Ridgid presents an extensive line of general power tools, it also shines with specialized tools, particularly in the realm of plumbing. From drain snakes to versatile pipe cutters, each tool showcases Ridgid's dedication to lasting functionality. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a home enthusiast, if you need a reliable tool that lasts, Ridgid's blend of durability and an unmatched warranty makes them an excellent choice.\nBauer\nBauer tools aren't the most well-known in the tool space. They are an in-house brand for Harbor Freight and have been since 1977. That means if you haven't been in a Harbor Freight store before, you've likely never heard of this brand. Those who do shop at Harbor Freight tend to enjoy the tools, and some folks buy several so that they can use the interchangeable batteries.\nThey're about on par with Kobalt and Ryobi, except their tool selection is smaller overall. That isn't to say that it's bad. You can get the basics like a drill, a rotary tool, and a nail gun from the same brand without issue. You just miss out on the extra, and often weird stuff of brands like Ryobi. As mentioned, the batteries are interchangeable, and they compete well with other brands at their price point. However, like all tool makers, Bauer has a habit of discontinuing stuff on occasion and moving their product lineup around.\nIn all, Bauer is right up there with Ryobi and Kobalt, and potentially even better in some cases. We found stories online of people who have owned their Bauer tools for as long as 10 years. However, those same people note that the quality of the tools have improved over the last few years specifically, so people buying new should get a better experience than those who did previously. Bauer tools have a 90-day standard warranty and a one- or two-year warranty after that depending on the tool.\nKobalt\nKobalt is best known as the in-house brand for Lowe's. Patrons of the U.S. retail chain will doubt see these tools littered in every aisle where tools exist as Kobalt has quite a large selection and Lowe's advertises them pretty heavily. In terms of history, there isn't too much. The company was founded in 1998 in partnership with Lowe's and J.H. Williams Tool Group, and the brand has been making those bright blue tools ever since. The tools are manufactured by the Danaher Corporation, which also makes tools for other brands like Craftsman. Chevron and JS Products also contributes some help.\nSo how good are these tools? They're actually not bad for their price point. They easily compete with Ryobi in this space, although Ryobi focuses more on power tools and electric lawn implements whereas Kobalt also makes your basic wrenches, screwdrivers, and other stuff like that along with power tools. Much like Ryobi, the brand has both 24V and 40V batteries that are interchangeable with virtually ever power tool in the lineup, making it easy enough to find the correct batteries if you need more.\nTo top things off, there is a decent warranty that ranges from one year to lifetime depending on the tool. You can probably swap Kobalt and Ryobi on the list all day long without coming up with a definitive answer as to which brand is better, but they're both about the same in terms of quality based. However, we're giving the slight edge to Ryobi because it simply has a larger selection.\nRyobi\nRyobi has been crafting tools since 1943, starting out in Japan and growing into a name that DIY enthusiasts recognize worldwide. A defining feature of Ryobi tools is their availability and convenience. It's one of the most accessible tool brands on the market that's perfect for home use. You walk into almost any hardware store around the globe, and there's a good chance you'll spot Ryobi tools lining the shelves. Ryobi has everything from specialized gadgets to those handy multi-purpose tools we all love.\nThe standout feature of this brand is that all of Ryobi's tools use the same battery connection through the ONE+ system. Imagine having a garage full of tools and just one type of battery to power them all. It's super convenient if you're all-in with Ryobi, though perhaps less handy if you've got a mix of different tool brands.\nNow, if we're talking about taking these tools to a professional worksite, they might not stand up to some of the heavy-duty brands. Still, for most of us fixing things around the house or diving into weekend DIY projects, Ryobi offers a solid blend of reliability and affordability.\nHercules\nHercules is another tool brand sold specifically at Harbor Freight. However, unlike Bauer, Hercules is a family-owned brand, let by Jack Hercules. On top of having a sweet name, Hercules has a decent selection of tools on par with Bauer but a tad smaller than Kobalt or Ryobi. Since they are rivals in Harbor Freight's tool aisles, the two brands are compared all the time as shoppers decide which one they want to go with. In general, the consensus is that Hercules makes higher quality tools but also comes with a higher price tag as a result.\nSo, how does Hercules stack up overall? Quite well actually. Like Bauer, the brand is starting to get some recognition for having better tools than people know about. Some Hercules tools punch far above their weight class while others are merely average. We've seen several people compare them directly to Milwaukee tools in terms of power and reliability, but we don't have any concrete data to compare the two directly. The biggest complaint we've seen is that the brand doesn't add tools to its lineup very often, so what you see is likely what you'll get for a while.\nOverall, Hercules is a solid brand. Its price-to-performance ratio is quite good and definitely worthy of consideration. We've seen people say that they use these professionally, and it's definitely possible, but they may not be our first choice for that. For DIY home projects, though, all of their tools should be more than sufficient.\nMilwaukee\nEstablished in 1924, Milwaukee is an American company that produces top-tier, durable tools tailored for professionals, especially within the construction industry. Those who have an eye for quality and money to spare may decide to outfit their home garage with Milwaukee power tools, but it'll probably be overkill for most jobs around the house.\nCentral to Milwaukee's lineup is the M18 Fuel system. Despite the name, the M18 is fundamentally an 18V battery system that's compatible with the full product range. Though \"Redlithium\" might sound like a fancy marketing term, the real essence lies in its capability \u2014 Milwaukee claims it offers a 50% boost to power and lifespan.\nFor businesses managing vast tool inventories, Milwaukee's One Key system is a game-changer. This cloud-based tracking system morphs applicable tools from the Milwaukee catalog into smart devices, diligently monitoring inventory, maintenance, and tool usage. In the extensive landscape of construction where tracking and maintaining hundreds of tools across multiple job sites is essential, One Key provides valuable oversight.\nBosch\nBosch, a German powerhouse in tool manufacturing since 1886, not only stands out as a premier brand but also owns other prominent tool brands, like Dremel. What sets Bosch apart is its drive for innovation, especially in green initiatives and advanced safety. At its core, Bosch focuses on the end-user. This commitment is evident in how they craft their tools, focusing on comfort, safety, and overall functionality.\nA key feature for professionals is the Bosch Toolbox app. This app tracks tools, calculates project times, and maintains a record of tool maintenance. While tailored for professionals, the avid DIY enthusiast may find it useful for project organization, too.\nOn the environmental front, Bosch is proactive in trying to reduce its carbon footprint. The company is investing in sustainable solutions, such as energy-efficient power, recyclable packaging, and batteries, and has been pioneering eco-friendly manufacturing processes. Catering to a broad spectrum, from mid-tier products for DIY homeowners to professionals seeking high-end products, Bosch's diverse lineup of power tools makes them an extremely versatile brand.\nDremel\nDremel is an interesting brand because unlike most, it doesn't occupy the larger power tool segment. Instead, it makes just one tool, and that tool is useful and sold for a reasonable price most of the time. Dremel seems to have found its niche because it's been around since 1932 and seems to be still going strong to this day. You don't usually make it that long in the market if people don't like your products. In addition to its hallmark Dremel rotary tool, it also uses the same technology in other products from pet nail trimmers to pumpkin carving tools.\nSince Dremel is so unique in the power tools space, it's very difficult to judge it based on other tools. The rotary tool \u2014 which comes in both corded and cordless variants \u2014 is supremely useful. The bit system gives it all sorts of potential uses from sanding rough edges to unscrewing things from the wall. Just last year, I used a Dremel to carve out a small section of a door frame so I could put a light switch cover on the wall behind it.\nWith that said, if you can come up with some creative uses for it, it's definitely worth having one in the garage, even if it's the corded model. Pair it with a diverse rotary tool accessory kit and you have a tool that can sand, screw, cut, brush, sand down pet nails, carve pumpkins, and whatever else. Its surprisingly low price point mixed with its absurd practicality makes Dremel a big thumbs up from us.\nCraftsman\nA mark of American tool craftsmanship since 1927, Craftsman started as a strategic brand for Sears, reinforcing its standing as a one-stop-shop department store. While Sears was already a household name due to its extensive mail-order catalog business, the Craftsman brand further solidified its reputation as a trusted retailer and quickly became synonymous with dependable home tools. However, the landscape shifted in 2017 when Stanley Black & Decker acquired the brand.\nThis acquisition indicated notable changes for Craftsman. Once exclusively found in Sears' stores, Craftsman tools are now widely available across various outlets, demonstrating Stanley Black & Decker's expansive distribution network. Moreover, with a renewed emphasis on domestic manufacturing in the United States, Stanley Black & Decker has been spearheading efforts to establish more US-based manufacturing facilities.\nToday, Craftsman remains a symbol of American reliability. It strikes a balance between quality and affordability, maintaining its time-tested standards while diversifying its range, including innovative storage solutions and gardening power equipment.\nDeWalt\nDeWalt is under the same corporate umbrella with another notable name in our list, Craftsman. Both of these top-tier brands are housed within the vast Stanley Black & Decker conglomerate. While Craftsman is a more consumer-focused brand, DeWalt is more heavily marketed towards professionals. DeWalt was bought out during the 1960s and has since grown and expanded significantly under the guidance of Black & Decker.\nOne distinguishing feature that sets DeWalt apart is its Flexvolt Battery system. This innovative technology allows batteries to operate at 20 volts for prolonged use or surge to 60 volts for those extra tough jobs, offering an extra layer of flexibility that few power tools have. Furthermore, DeWalt boasts the integrated Tool Connect app. This sophisticated platform tracks compatible tools and controls larger machinery through its Bluetooth-enabled functionalities.\nThough DeWalt is widely recognized as an industry-centric brand, it also offers a range of consumer-focused power tools. These tools are competitively priced without compromising on reliability. Both seasoned contractors and DIY enthusiasts consistently alike still trust DeWalt as one of the premier tool brands in the market.\nMakita\nMakita is a Japanese company that has been in the tool-crafting business since 1915, solidifying its position as a titan in the industry. The legacy and precision of Japanese craftsmanship shine through in every tool they produce. Central to Makita's innovation is its consistent battery system. No more rummaging through drawers or cabinets to find the right battery for the right power tool. The 18V LXT battery powers over 300 tools, the 12V CXT system provides power to about 75, and the larger 40V XGT works with more than 100 products. It's a game-changer when you're mid-project and need to switch tools on the fly.\nWhile each brand on this list has its own legion of loyalists, even the most die-hard fans from other camps can't help but nod in respect to Makita. Its tools are frequently lauded as among the most resilient and adaptable in the market.\nMakita stands behind its products with impressive warranties. Battery-powered tools have a three-year limited warranty and gas-powered tools have a two-year limited warranty. All of its products have a 30-day money-back guarantee and a one-year full warranty that covers any defects due to manufacturing. This shows great customer service as well as the company's confidence in its manufacturing and quality."
