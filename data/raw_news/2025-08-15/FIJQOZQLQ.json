  "title": "New I.R.S. Rules for Large Wind and Solar Projects Released",
  "description": "The move comes as the Trump administration has issued a barrage of new restrictions on renewable energy across the country.",
  "content": "The Internal Revenue Service on Friday issued new rules that would restrict the ability of wind and solar companies to claim federal tax breaks, a move that analysts said could threaten the viability of many renewable energy projects under development.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s giant domestic policy bill, which was signed into law on July 4, was already set to rapidly phase out lucrative tax credits for new wind and solar farms unless they began construction in the next 12 months. The new I.R.S. guidance would add further restrictions by tightening longstanding rules for what counts as the \u201cbeginning of construction,\u201d which will make it harder for many projects to qualify.\n\nPreviously, a wind or solar farm was said to have begun construction if the developer spent at least 5 percent of the project cost, which many companies did by purchasing electrical transformers or other large equipment ahead of time. The developer could then claim any tax breaks that were in effect that year, as long as they finished construction within the next four years.\n\nThe new I.R.S. guidance eliminates this so-called \u201c5 percent safe harbor\u201d rule for large wind and solar farms, although it keeps it in place for rooftop solar projects and other smaller solar installations.",

  "argos_summary": "The IRS issued new rules tightening the definition of \"beginning of construction\" for wind and solar projects, eliminating the 5% safe harbor that previously allowed developers to claim tax credits after early equipment purchases. This change, combined with President Trump's bill that phases out tax credits for projects not started within 12 months, threatens the viability of many renewable energy developments. The safe harbor remains for rooftop and smaller solar installations, but large wind and solar farms face stricter qualification requirements.",
