      "summary": "Vanguard’s survey shows that 57% of Americans earn less than 3% on cash savings, with many still holding money in low‑yield checking or physical cash. High‑yield savings, CDs, and money‑market funds can deliver over 4% as of August, yet 60% of savers feel they don’t understand the interest‑rate landscape. Younger generations, especially Gen Z, are particularly under‑earning, and inertia keeps many in outdated accounts. Short‑term rates, tied to the Fed funds rate, are expected to fall later this year, but current yields should stay above the 2.7% inflation rate for now.",
