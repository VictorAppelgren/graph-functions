  "title": "Why I recommend this Asus laptop for creatives over my MacBook Pro M4 (and it's not just price)",
  "description": "The new Asus ProArt P16 improves on its predecessor, making it one of the most capable Windows laptops for creative workloads.",
  "content": "If you're familiar with Asus' creator-focused laptops, you'll feel right at home using the 2025 ProArt P16. It is nearly identical to its predecessor in terms of design and purpose, as the laptop is meant for creative professionals looking for a high-performance machine. It sticks with what worked last time, making a few key adjustments.\n\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\n\nFirst off, the ProArt P16 has a lightweight physical design, making it easy to carry around. I found the keyboard to be too mushy for my liking. It doesn't have a great typing feel, but the keycaps are quiet, so that's a plus. The touchpad takes up a large portion of the wrist rest, enabling better comfort and ease of use. On either side of the keyboard is a pair of Harman/Kardon speakers delivering strong audio output.\n\nSo far, things are looking good for the ProArt P16, and things get even better once you look inside.\n\nMy review unit came loaded with some solid hardware, indeed. It houses an AMD Ryzen AI HX 370 processor, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. Yes, you can game this; no, I don't recommend doing so. It overheats fast, and the display only has a refresh rate of 60Hz. Large heat vents are located at the bottom, expelling hot air. I do not recommend placing the computer on your lap unless you want your legs to be cooked.\n\nAlso: Finally, an ultraportable Windows laptop I'd use at the office (even though it's for gamers)\n\nAsus' ProCreator Hub greatly contributed to my enjoyment, and it reminded me of MSI's Center app, which has a similar function. The app has various laptop features in one central location, one being the ability to instantly change how the device performs without having to go into BIOS. By making the right adjustments to the hardware, the ProArt P16 can exceed expectations for performance and battery life.\n\nBelow is a benchmark test results table comparing the 2025 ProArt P16 to its predecessor, as well as the M4 MacBook Pro and the MSI Stealth 16 AI, another laptop with a similar purpose. You'll notice that Asus' new machine outperforms most of its rivals across the various benchmark rendering tests. There are instances where it falls behind, but it isn't a large gap.\n\nIf you're looking for a powerful alternative to your old MacBook, this ProArt laptop is your best bet in 2025.\n\nThe Creator Hub offers utility beyond tweaking performance. The WorkSmart tool lets you group multiple apps together. So when you click one of these groups, all those apps open simultaneously, saving you time. Color Control allows users to actively adjust the screen output on the fly. For example, you could tweak the blue light output so it's easier on your eyes or change which color gamut is being shown.\n\nYou might change the gamut to DCI-P3 to show off \"movie-grade colors\". Display P3 is best \"suited for displaying vivid colors on mobile devices and laptops.\" You don't have to mess with the output, since the screen is impressive on its own. Asus' ProArt P16 has a high-quality 16-inch 4K OLED display. Images are stunning as colors practically leap out. The screen had two downsides: the 60Hz refresh rate, as mentioned earlier, and the display's glossiness. So much light is reflected that it can be hard to see the screen under bright conditions.\n\nUp in the upper left-hand corner of the touchpad is the DialPad, which allows you to customize your own controls in each app. The physical design offers more precise control than the touchpad, which makes cycling through different tools easier than you'd assume.\n\nI tried incorporating the DialPad into my workflow to edit a video on CapCut, a photograph on Pixlr, and render 3D models in Blender using the DialPad, and found out that it's best used in conjunction with the touchpad. It works best as an supplemental tool for quick access to change brush sizes or cycling through video clips, but it isn't designed to replace the touchpad or mouse altogether.\n\nAlone, it's great at executing delicate procedures, like cleaning up specific areas in a photo. The problem is that it lacks haptic feedback: pressing down doesn't result in the \"click\" you'd expect. So to click and drag an effect on a video's timeline or grab the corner of a model in Blender, you'll have to use the touchpad.\n\nFortunately, using both simultaneously isn't difficult. Your left hand can be the DialPad while your right is on the touchpad, and it all feels natural. Using just the touchpad is an option, but it's difficult to maintain the same level of accuracy.\n\nAlso: This ultraportable Asus laptop is my favorite MacBook Air alternative (and it's better in some ways)\n\nI also have to give credit to the hardware. Rendering 3D environments in Blender took very little time to complete. I was able to hop between my 4K editing and 20 different Chrome tabs without any hiccups. The only time I experienced any slowdown was when I was playing 10 different livestreams in 4K on YouTube -- but apart from niche cases, it's solid.\n\nOver at Best Buy, the Asus ProArt P16 is on sale for $2,500, which is more than what I was expecting. Last year's ProArt is retailing for just $2,000. I recommend grabbing the 2025 laptop if you want the best of the best and don't mind paying a bit more. As shown in the performance tests, there is a sizable gap between the two devices.\n\nThat said, the 2024 version is definitely still competitive, so if you're looking for a powerful graphics-minded laptop and want to save some money, I'd highly recommend it, especially if it sees some additional price drops.",

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nFinally, an ultraportable Windows laptop I'd use at the office (even though it's for gamers)\nMSI Stealth 16 AI\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The MSI Stealth 16 AI is on sale at Best Buy for $2,030.\n- It's a gaming laptop with powerful hardware and a vibrant OLED display that's ideal for both gaming and graphic design.\n- However, like its predecessor, it has a hungry battery and runs hot.\nThe 2025 MSI Stealth 16 is the latest entry in the tech company's sleek gaming laptop series. I'm pretty familiar with the Stealth line, having reviewed several models in the past. This version doesn't reinvent the wheel. In fact, it shares many similarities with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, to its benefit and to a fault.\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\nFirst off: on the surface, I genuinely can't tell the difference between this model and the previous generation. The Stealth 16 measures 14\"x 10.22\"x 0.85\" inches -- the exact same dimensions as the A16. It even weighs the same at 4.63 pounds.\nWhat's funny is I used to think that was really heavy, but after carrying around chunky laptops, MSI's device feels lightweight. Even with the power adapter, I didn't mind carrying it around town. By the way, I factor that adapter into the overall weight because you will need it on hand. More on that later.\nBringing back the classics\nA few other great design elements make their triumphant return. Going down the list, you have a full-size gaming keyboard. Each button has a 1.5mm travel distance, ensuring a comfortable typing feel. Six surround sound speakers are located at either end below the keyboard for immersive audio.\nOne of my favorite moments testing this laptop came from listening to \"Doomsday\" by MF Doom. The lyrical flow from Doom sounded crystal clear and powerful through the laptop's speakers, filling my entire room with his supervillainy.\nAbove the keyboard is the 16-inch OLED display. At QuadHD+ (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) resolution, it's not quite 4K, but it's close enough -- the screen still delivers impressive visual output. Colors are vibrant, the high resolution delivers detailed images, and the 240Hz refresh rate ensures smooth on-screen motion.\nPower boost\nOne of my favorite things about MSI laptops is how easy it is to tweak their performance. On many Windows 11 laptops, all you can really do is change the Power mode in the Settings, but MSI Center, its internal settings program is actually pretty robust. Here, you can adjust the computer's output on the fly. For example, enabling Extreme Performance and Discrete Graphics Mode delivers the best hardware results.\nAlso: I tested Dell's XPS successor, and it beat my $3,000 Windows laptop in almost every way\nInside my review unit was an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. It's a pretty good configuration, if I say so myself, and it shows in the performance numbers.\nBelow is a list comparing MSI's Stealth 16 with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI Plus, and the Dell Premium 16. You'll notice that the newer model has better raw processing and rendering power than the others, indicating it excels at handling heavy workloads and rendering complex 3D graphics.\nThere is a bit of a gap between the Stealth 16 and the A16 on PCMark 10, suggesting that the older model has better general performance; it's able to hop between web pages and apps without much issue. However, I didn't experience any slowdown. This laptop ran great everywhere.\nPCMark 10 | Geekbench 6 | Cinebench 2024 | Cinebench R23 | |\nMSI Stealth 16 AI | 7,693 | 15,883 | 1,129 | 21,656 |\nMSI Stealth A16 AI+ | 7,913 | 14,196 | N/A | 18,336 |\nDell Premium 16 | 6,865 | 14,763 | 726 | 17,522 |\nHaving Dell's machine may seem random, but you need to understand that the Stealth 16 isn't just a solid gaming computer. It's also a powerful graphic design laptop, too. For testing, I installed Blender, a free 3D creation app, and edited images on Pixlr. I'm not much of an artist, but I did manage to create and render simple scenes starring Blender's complex monkey model.\nI had a similar experience with Pixlr, as I was able to edit 4K photographs without any major hiccups. The entire process went smoothly. MSI's laptop is a powerhouse in almost every sense of the word.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for a week, and it makes even the XPS feel outdated\nAs powerful as the laptop may be, it has its limits. I ran multiple 4K YouTube livestreams as part of my usual 50-tab Chrome browser test. Everything ran fine when there were only three livestreams, although once I hit six, I noticed a slowdown. Livestreams were slow to load. It took a few seconds before the Stealth 16 could play the video as normal.\nStaying cool\nHeavy workloads do cause the Stealth 16 to heat up a bit, but high temperatures were never an issue. Heat vents are strategically placed above the keyboard, on the side of the laptop, and on the bottom, so your hands are never at risk of touching a hot keyboard. In fact, the keys stayed nice and cool the entire time. Unfortunately, this means you can't place the computer on your lap; otherwise, your legs will be blasted by hot air.\nThis ability to stay cool under duress is thanks to the Cooler Boost 5 cooling system, which consists of two large fans and five heat pipes directing hot air out through the vents. This system is also on the vastly more powerful MSI Raider 18 HX.\nUnsurprisingly, MSI's Stealth 16 is not designed to be away from its charger for long. You can push its endurance by enabling ECO-Silent and Integrated Graphics Mode in the MSI Center app, and Best Power Efficiency in Windows, but even then, it will last around six hours on a single charge, depending on what you're doing.\nLike many gaming laptops with this kind of hardware, it may have power, but it lacks in stamina. For that reason, I'd suggest this for users who don't need an all-day battery kind of laptop, but are fine with a few hour stints throughout the day.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe MSI Stealth 16 AI is on sale at Best Buy for $2,030, which is a good price for a laptop with this kind of hardware. I recommend this device to anyone looking for an affordable gaming laptop that can also be used as a work machine. If you like this laptop but want to save some cash, its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, is very similar and still relevant in 2025, retailing for $1,800.\nIf you want a more powerful graphic design computer, I suggest the Alienware 18 Area-51. It is a much more powerful gaming laptop that leaves every laptop I mentioned so far in the dust. I think it's one of the best for the year. It is, however, very expensive; my review unit cost $3,200."

TCL's Nxtpaper technology offers a paper-like screen that's made for tired eyes like mine. The TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G is the company's affordable attempt at relieving some of the stress that comes from modern smartphone screens.\nAlso: I gave up my iPhone for a dumbphone with no apps. A month later, here's my take\nIt's a unique trick for a very inexpensive smartphone that needs to be seen to be understood. While far from perfect, and definitely a device built to a price, it brings a differentiator that will matter for some users looking to give their eyes a rest while they scroll or read.\nA unique multi-faceted display\nThe display is what immediately sets the 60XE apart. TCL's Nxtpaper 3.0 matte coating gives the glass an undeniably unique finish that I quite like. On-screen content looks a bit like E-ink depending on the mode the phone is in, but underneath that hazy layer is a standard 1080p, 120Hz LCD panel.\nThe coating addresses a slew of common downsides of modern displays. It reduces blue light, cuts reflections to nearly nothing, and even eliminates most fingerprints. There's also a nice texture that feels a bit like paper, which is a nice departure from a sea of glossy, reflective displays.\nBeneath the power and volume buttons is a physical Nxtpaper Key, a plastic switch that feels a bit cheaper than I'd like. Flipping the switch offers up a menu of distinct modes that change how the display operates.\nTCL clearly wants users to notice and appreciate this feature because every toggle results in a five-second full-screen animation complete with an obnoxious serenade. I made sure to set my volume to mute so I could avoid the theatrical effect.\nEach mode provides its own twist on usability and comfort. Color Paper Mode, my favorite, mutes the colors while retaining a standard Android interface that's easier on the eyes for all-day use. I even enjoyed watching YouTube videos in this mode, though everything feels a bit flatter than my eyes are used to.\nInk Paper Mode goes one step further, stripping color from icons and text for a no-frills grayscale approach, while still delivering the full unencumbered Android experience. Max Ink Mode is the most dramatic change, stripping all color while also limiting apps to a small subset of essentials and suspending certain background processes.\nAlso: iOS 26 envy? 5 iPhone features you can already use on your Android (Samsung included)\nThe result is an ultra-minimal, battery-saving mode that can last more than a week on a single charge. I enjoyed this mode for reading ebooks and could see it as a great solution for users looking to cut back on smartphone use entirely.\nThe display does come with a major caveat. On the brightest days, the matte finish would all but wash out on-screen content, often making it unusable in direct sunlight. If you spend time outside reading or working, you'll be looking for shade like I was.\nPerformance and battery\nPerformance is modest but serviceable, with a MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor inside paired with 8GB of RAM. In use, this is not a phone for hardcore users who push their devices to the limit. I noticed many actions have a slight delay attached to them. Launching the camera often takes a few seconds to negotiate.\nGeneral tasks like web browsing, email, and messaging are responsive enough to keep me happy, but things never felt snappy.\nOn the software front, the 60 XE runs Android 15, with a promise from TCL of just one upgrade to Android 16 and two years of security patches. As someone who always decries the poor state of Android OS update promises, this is a weak point, and TCL needs to step up its game. Anyone hoping to get long-term value should consider other options.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nI found battery life to be a highlight, which isn't that surprising given the 5,010mAh battery hidden inside. I routinely made it through the day with around 20-30% capacity to spare at bedtime. Wired charging tops out at a slow 18 watts, so quick daytime top-ups will take some time, but it's fine for plugging in overnight.\nFor the truly battery paranoid, there's the Max Ink Mode that considerably jumps battery life to more than a week if you are willing to cut down on much of what the phone is capable of.\nStay for the display, but not the camera\nThe plastic marble-like backplate surrounds a large circular camera array that's hard to miss and perhaps even more premium-looking than its price point. One pet peeve of mine is an off-center camera module, and this phone has a notable wobble when placed on a tabletop as a result.\nThe camera system itself is one area where the low-end cutbacks really show. The main sensor does its best outdoors in very bright conditions and needs a lot of light to help shots taken indoors. The camera performance is mediocre with soft output that lacks punch and definition most of the time.\nLow-light conditions easily demonstrate the camera system's baseline capability, and the ultrawide lens often results in grainy images. The 32MP front camera works, but that's about it. Let's just say that this is not the phone for the discerning camera buff.\nZDNET's buying advice\nWhat the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G offers is a key standout feature: a unique matte display. At $250, the 60XE offers something that you really can't find anywhere else, in this price category and beyond, and the benefits of that might matter a lot for certain users. For everyone else, consider phones like the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which offers better imaging, better speed, and its signature modular design approach.\nFollow my latest tech reviews and projects across social media.

The electronics have improved, but the basic act of operating a digital camera has remained mostly the same. Cameras are a gaggle of buttons that are a cryptic arrangement to anyone but the initiated.\nThe real innovation in the picture-taking experience has been the smartphone, which has made picture-taking an always-available tool for documenting everything with relative ease.\nThere is still an audience, however, for innovation beyond what smartphones offer. Young consumers keep buying digital cameras, and a new generation is always interested to learn more about photography as an art.\nAlso: The best vlogging cameras of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nInto the void steps lens and camera maker Sigma Corp., based in Kanagawa, Japan, just outside Tokyo. The company this spring introduced a radical redesign of the digital camera's basic mode of use.\nThe Sigma BF, as it's called, reduces the mass of buttons to a small set of touch-sensitive controls. All the functions of digital photography are still there to be experimented with and exploited -- shutter speed, lens aperture, or \"f-stop,\" and \"ISO,\" the level of light that can be recovered from a scene -- but they are under your command in a radically simplified user interface.\nI've been testing the BF for some weeks now, and I'm smitten with the changes. The hardware's design is beautiful, and the new user interface is very thoughtful. The name \"BF\" stands for \"beautiful foolishness,\" and you could say this kind of redesign is crazy, but I love it.\nA camera for a new age of photographers\nSigma, a sixty-three-year-old company, makes most of its money from lenses for all camera brands. As a result, its cameras have tended to be somewhat experimental, never selling in the same volume as Sony, Canon, or Nikon. That means that the company takes chances. Often, the results are wild and beautiful.\nThe BF is really meant for a new age of prosumers who want to up their game in photography. At a retail price of $2,199, the price is not insignificant, but it is on the low end for what you'd pay for a very good 35mm digital camera these days. Lenses, which have to be bought separately, run from about $600 for a fixed focal length \"prime\" lens to $1,300 or more for zoom lenses. The BF uses what's called an \"L-mount,\" which means you're not limited to Sigma's lenses; it's also compatible with lenses from Leica, Panasonic, Samyang, and Sirui.\nAlso: Eufy's latest security camera has AI-powered color night vision - and no monthly fees\nThe premise of stepping up your game from the smartphone camera is pretty simple, to my mind: You will never, ever, get as good a picture with any smartphone camera as you will with a camera that has a real lens. The lens is the key. The optics are just so superior to the optics on a smartphone.\nI tested the BF with a 50mm prime lens from Sigma, the same kind I already use for most of my photography.\nNo matter what you are photographing, there are immediate benefits to using a real camera versus a smartphone camera.\nOne benefit is the detail you get. Here's a picture of a butterfly landing on some vegetation in a vivarium. When cropping the image to see the butterfly up close, you'll get a level of detail that is clean rather than the murky detail you get even with a smartphone's optical zoom:\n(None of these photos have been edited. They are all straight out of the camera. In some cases, the file size has been compressed to accommodate the publishing system.)\nNot only detail but also control of the depth of field via the aperture dial on the lens provides control over the selective blurring of objects, the \"bokeh.\"\nSmartphones will give you fake bokeh that is generated in software rather than the actual bending of the light via the lens elements. Rarely will fake bokeh give you a really complex, thrilling effect where both foreground and background elements are selectively blurred, leading to a more sophisticated image, such as this cypress I snapped in New York's Central Park:\nAnd even when fake bokeh works, I don't think you'll achieve the almost holographic, floating beauty you get with a real lens while preserving all the detail of the foreground subject, as with this thistle:\nThe second advantage is that a real lens will give you more real proportions than a smartphone lens that has a lot of barrel distortion. Like a building architectural shot or this bank vault:\nYou can get a nice, crisp skyline shot at twilight as the light changes:\nA swing to simplicity\nWhere the BF departs from other cameras is in the simplicity of design and user interface.\nThe hardware is, very simply, a solid shell milled from a block of aluminum and then filled with electronics. It's a gorgeous manufactured object with a super solid feel. (Sigma cameras always feel super solid, but this is on a new level.)\nThe BF's body is one of the lightest full-frame mirrorless cameras on the market, at just under a pound, compared to devices such as the Sony a7 IV, which weighs nearly a pound and a half.\nFor non-camera users, the weight of any real camera is something of a surprise compared to a smartphone such as an Apple iPhone Pro, which weighs half a pound. Holding 15 ounces worth of an unfamiliar object prompted some people to whom I handed the BF to remark, \"It's so heavy!\"\nAlso: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nThe total weight of the camera is the combination of the 15 ounces and the 12 ounces of the 50mm Sigma lens. That kind of heft is typical of full-frame lenses because they have a lot of glass inside them. (And this particular Sigma lens is not very heavy as 50-millimeter lenses go.)\nThe real adjustment for a novice photographer is getting used to the balance of weight between camera and lens versus carrying a slab of a smartphone with uniform weight distribution.\nThe camera comes in two finishes, a striking silver color and a deep black. I chose to try the black as I like to use the camera often in discreet settings such as a jazz club, so I wanted something less flashy than the silver.\nThe sensor is a full-frame, 35mm Sony chip with just under 25 megapixels, less than the 60 megapixels in some 35mm cameras. Despite a lower pixel count, I found the sensor produced rich detail, certainly enough for Instagram pictures and possibly good enough for wall-sized prints depending on the exposure. Sony is a very reliable name for sensors, so it makes sense for Sigma to go with the market leader.\nImages are stored in the internal 230-gigabyte flash memory, which I found to be more than enough for my purposes. I usually offloaded the pictures onto my iPad or MacBook after each photo-taking session via USB-C and then cleared the BF's memory.\nAlso: Why the best fix for headless server frustration might be a little box named Comet\nOn the software side, the radical simplification of the user interface is striking -- it's even something of a revelation.\nI've been a user of Sigma cameras for over a decade, my main camera these days being the Sigma fp-L, a 60-megapixel model introduced a couple of years ago. I love that camera, but I would be very happy to see the changes in the BF user interface become standard on Sigma cameras going forward.\nThe main innovation is removing a lot of shooting information from the LCD screen. Instead of seeing the aperture or shutter speed and other settings constantly on the display, each setting on the BF occupies a separate, tiny LCD -- it's called a \"status monitor\" though I tend to think of it as simply a \"mini-LCD\" -- to the right of the main display.\nA click wheel just below the mini-LCD, formally called the \"dial pad,\" reminiscent of the first Apple iPod's click wheel, lets you rotate through the values of shutter speed, etc. The changing values are displayed on the mini-LCD as you do so, and you click the center button of the click wheel to select the setting you want.\nThere's also a touch-sensitive playback button, so you can peek at what you just snapped with a soft touch, and a touch-sensitive menu button, which is a quick way to peek at the camera's settings. And a power button at the bottom of all this, of course.\nThe effect is that the main display screen is a pristine window into what you're capturing in the real world, while the mini-LCD and the click-wheel are your controls. It's a nice division that elegantly separates the gaze from the adjustments.\nThe main LCD is a 2.1 megapixel model and is terrifically responsive for things such as selecting the focus area by tapping with your finger, or using pinch and swipe when looking through the photos you've taken.\nAlso: Stanford's holographic AI glasses are coming for your clunky VR headset\nIf you half-press the shutter button, the display momentarily shows the key settings before you fully commit to the shutter release. If you press on the center button of the click-wheel, or dial pad, extra settings come up for the function that's in focus, such as shutter speed.\nStreet photography delight\nThe BF's light weight and simplified user interface made for nice street photography, one of my favorite pastimes.\nI tended to carry the camera at my waist in one hand, holding onto the lens, sometimes with the camera body flipped upside-down, with my pinky finger on the shutter button. That way, I achieved a kind of nonchalant pose that did not draw attention to my picture-taking.\nAlso: I used Google's photo-to-video AI tool on my selfie - and it made me do the tango\nSometimes, I looked at the LCD to see what I was snapping, but oftentimes, I just took a picture in the general direction to see what chance would produce.\nThe autofocus function of the BF was super fast, notably faster than the response time of the fp-L, probably because of the BF's lower-megapixel-count sensor. That made for excellent motion capture, such as this basketball game:\nOne of the BF's shortcomings is having an electronic shutter: Instead of mechanical blades opening and closing, the sensor chip controls in software when the exposure happens. The common knock against an electronic shutter is that it can lead to blurring of fast motion. In the case of the basketball game, in late afternoon daylight, I saw no issue.\nAnother potential drawback is that indoors, in artificial light, the electronic shutter can produce dark bands across the image if the shutter speed is too fast. That can require you to take the picture at a slower shutter speed. In practice, I found it not to be much of a problem.\nImproved electronics\nIn addition to autofocus speed, Sigma has done a very good job with the BF's low-light support, which was already quite good on the fp-L.\nOne of my favorite low-light picture tests is a diorama in the North American mammals hall of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. This is one of the darkest exhibits in the museum, and it's challenging to photograph if you don't have the camera resting on a tripod to allow for a long exposure.\nAlso: Why ads are coming to your favorite AI bots and you've only got yourself to blame\nTwo taxidermy wolves run on a painted landscape of the Michigan countryside. To the naked eye, the diorama is very, very dark because it is meant to suggest nighttime on the prairie. Here's what it typically looks like, taken with minimal low-light support by the BF:\nMost museum visitors who view the diorama turn on their smartphone camera's flash to take a souvenir shot. But, to my mind, flooding the scene with flash spoils the effect.\nInstead, I cranked up the BF to its highest ISO setting, 102,400 -- fairly high up there for any digital camera. The result is that the wolves emerge in beautiful detail from the darkness -- not as sharp or clean as if the scene were well-lighted, but that's the point:\nIn practice, the BF does a very nice job in darkly lit spaces where you might actually want a picture, such as a jazz club.\nWhen set on a tripod with professional lighting and a backdrop, the BF is also excellent for formal portraits, far better than what you'll get using a smartphone camera for your headshots.\nEven without using a macro lens, the 50mm will allow you to get pretty good closeup shots of something like your favorite toy, from a minimum distance of 18 inches, which you can then crop and still have lots of vivid detail.\nOf course, you could also add a macro lens to the BF and get even closer.\nA gentle introduction to pro features\nSigma has simplified some of the functions for newbies so that the same technical effects are present but in a more inviting fashion. For example, on the Sigma fp-L, a separate button is for \"tone control\" that lets you adjust the light across the scene by degrees for shadows and highlights to make a scene have more or less contrast.\nOn the BF, there's no button for tone control, but when selecting colors with the click-wheel, you can bump up or down values of \"highlight,\" \"shadow,\" and \"fade,\" to alter the degrees of lights and darks. That works in both still images and videos.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nThere's also an option called \"look effect,\" where you can dial up or down how vivid or how flat a given color filter is, which is a nice, obvious way to understand making your pictures or videos more striking or more sedate.\nIn practice, the BF does a great job with tone and exposure on automatic. A street scene at sunset, for example, nicely balances the vivid highlights of the sky with the street detail without blown highlights or detail lost in the shadows.\nWhen you review photos, the main LCD display gives you all the information on the tone adjustments you made, which is helpful for determining what works and what doesn't.\nSome things that are typically buried in sub-menus on digital cameras are brought forward in the BF's UI.\nSo, for example, when filming a movie, you have the option to turn on \"constant AF,\" which does a better job of grabbing hold of a new subject entering the frame. That is now an option from the click-wheel rather than being buried as a sub-menu option.\nOf course, there are trade-offs to simplicity. Other functions that were accessed directly via dedicated buttons on digital cameras become things you have to hunt for.\nFor example, auto-exposure lock forces the camera to keep the amount of light in the scene the same as you move it, rather than altering the exposure. This allows you to find the right balance of light and dark and hold onto it while you shift your focus.\nAlso: The 10 apps I can't live or work without - on Windows, Mac, and mobile\nOn the fp-L, auto-exposure lock has its own button. In the BF, you have to move the click wheel to the exposure section of the menus and then turn on auto-exposure lock by tapping on the icon. This extra step is fine if you don't use auto-exposure lock much.\nAnother example is a feature of most digital cameras called fill light, the ability to lighten up dark parts of a picture. On most cameras, you have an option to turn on the fill light while you're taking pictures. On the BF, fill light is something you adjust after the fact by editing the DNG, \"digital negative,\" or \"RAW,\" image in the camera.\nSigma's suggestion overall is to use color and filter adjustments to achieve a similar effect to fill light. In other words, the user interface consolidates traditional operations such as fill light and auto-exposure lock into a simpler set of choices that can be more centrally manipulated.\nAnd some things are just different. On the fp-L, and most cameras, when recording a video, you can take a still image as you're recording. On the BF, if you want a still image as well, you do it when replaying the video, by selecting \"save as JPEG.\"\nHow it performs with video\nSpeaking of video, I found the results were very satisfying. You can take 6K video (6,016 x 3,384) that looks great even without electronic stabilization turned on.\nI took this shot of a woman having her personal photo shoot in front of the Plaza Hotel. Although it's jerky and not cinematic, it was a wonderful spontaneous moment in great quality:\nWhen you turn on the electronic stabilization feature, video is reduced from 6K to \"ultra-high-def\" (3,840 x 2,160) because the camera needs to crop each frame to line up frames and make the shakiness disappear.\nIn a low-light setting, such as this video at Small's jazz club in Greenwich Village, I thought it produced a wonderful-looking film without a tripod.\nHere's where we see an example of the click-wheel at its best. I had the fun of rotating through the different color filters to change up the color from moment to moment while filming, something I would never do when color choices are a single button.\nAlthough my use of the feature is rather gimmicky here, I can see all kinds of possibilities with the click wheel, enabling new ways of controlling the camera during filming.\nLike all cameras, the sound you record with the built-in microphone video is never as good as if you had a dedicated mic attached, especially for something like music. But I thought the result here was very good in a space with challenging acoustics.\nAlso: This hidden Pixel camera setting gave my photos the pop they've been missing\nEven in low light, using the camera hand-held, you can get a nice video like this one taken in a darkened tango hall. In a dark place like a dance hall, with swaying bodies moving to and fro, with the camera in your hand and no stabilization turned on, it can be challenging to capture motion in a way that's satisfying. I love what the BF did with the color and the lights in this scene while managing to shift autofocus from one couple to the next:\nBattery life\nBattery life was fine for my purposes. I got as much as six hours of shooting on a single charge, including intermittent shooting and periods of intense activity. That meant in some cases over 500 exposures in DNG+JPEG format. That's better than the official specification by Sigma for approximately 260 images on a charge. Of course, your results may vary.\nIn my experience, plugging the BF into an iPad via USB-C for forty minutes will charge the camera from zero back to a third of its battery life. You can also bring along a spare battery and swap it in via the latched compartment on the bottom of the BF.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe complaints I've seen about the Sigma BF from seasoned photographers seem to be mostly about the reduction of controls to the click wheel and the mini-LCD. Consolidating controls in that way, they argue, robs the pro photographer of their muscle memory. Some pros also wish the touch screen did more to control the functions rather than just serving as a very good display.\nAlso: I tried Google's new agentic IDE, and it blows away the popular VS Code - here's how\nIn essence, pros have a hard time adjusting to a radically simplified UI. It's a fair point of view, but this is something of a Steve Jobs moment. You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette, and you may have to break habits to reinvent how photography is done.\nI think the BF is a terrific option for a beginning photographer or even an experienced pro. The touch-screen display is intuitive in a smartphone age, the electronics are just as fast as you'd expect based on smartphone picture-taking, and the output is very Instagram-worthy.\nAnd your envious friends will immediately want to know, What is that wild-looking camera you've got?"

At the top of the line is the new AMD-powered ProArt P16, which exudes power and performance with a sleek, all-black form factor, giant trackpad with Asus' proprietary DialPad, and a brilliant display.\nI had a chance to go hands-on with the ProArt P16 a few months ago and found it to be a highly capable machine with a lot of raw power. However, it also requires some customization and optimization to get the most out of it. Before I touch on that, let's take a look at the hardware.\nAlso: Microsoft's Surface Laptop is finally getting the upgrade every business user has been waiting for\nThe ProArt P16 has 32GB of memory, an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, and a 12-core, 24-thread chip with a 50 TOP NPU. This strong core powers the device's creative endeavors, whether video editing, using advanced animation or graphic design programs, or simply multitasking with a handful of different apps and dozens of browser tabs.\nOne of the best parts of this laptop, however, is its display. The 500-nit, 3840 x 2400 resolution AMOLED touchscreen display delivers a crisp, bright picture with a glossy, premium coating. Powered by the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, it features DLSS 3 (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and support for ray tracing.\nAlthough it can deliver a good gaming experience, it's held back a bit by the 60Hz refresh rate, which is part of the give-and-take of the device's overall feature set. Asus' decision to limit the refresh rate is disappointing, but it keeps the price point low and solidifies its intended use case as a creator-first machine.\nAlso: The hybrid Windows laptop I recommend most for work travel also has an OLED display\nIn that vein, it comes with a stylus that feels precise and responsive, especially on the smooth, glossy display, which feels like a blank canvas beckoning you to sketch on. The pen on this laptop is good enough for artists and designers to use seriously, as all too often, they're either too laggy or too barebones to justify using. Here, however, it's snappy and responsive and comes with various capabilities that work in tandem with the DialPad to power customizable, single-click actions.\nI also appreciate that this laptop is not a 2-in-1. Convertible laptops are often forced to switch to tablet mode if you want to use them with a stylus, as pressing on the display in laptop mode pushes it down unless you support it with your hand.\nThe ProArt P16 was designed with this in mind, as the display locks into place at its furthest angle. Instead of folding back from the pressure of the pen, it stays upright with a generous degree of bend. Just keep in mind that pushing back too hard will result in the front of the device lifting off the desk.\nAlso: This HP EliteBook I tested is one of the most versatile work laptops of 2025 - and it's on sale\nThe Asus DialPad is another unique feature that creatives will love to tinker with. If you haven't seen it before, it's a small, raised wheel on the trackpad that can be customized to activate different settings, like changing brush sizes in Photoshop or cutting, pausing, or rewinding in CapCut or Premiere. The DialPad's small physical size makes activating and scrolling through the \"wheel\" fast and easy, especially for common features.\nMy only gripe about the DialPad was that it took a minute to set up. It came disabled on the laptop out of the box, requiring me to activate it with a specific gesture on the trackpad that isn't obvious unless you look it up (you press the icon in the top right corner of the trackpad, then quickly slide diagonally down toward the middle of the trackpad). As one of this laptop's premier features, wouldn't it make sense to a) have it work out of the box and/or b) feature an easy setup tutorial?\nAlso: Need a new laptop for the office? Save $400 on the Dell 16 Plus and improve your workflow\nOnce it was activated, however, I quickly became a fan. I like how granular you can make the customizations, and it's useful even beyond creative use cases. In fact, I found that some of the most handy cases were in productivity apps and in the browser, enabling quick functions during the workday for frequent actions.\nThe other Asus programs that come with the laptop are useful to varying degrees, not to mention that they were rather slow to fire up. Asus' \"Muse Tree,\" for example, took an unexpectedly long time to install and get going. I had a chance to go hands-on with this app previously, and although it's a very cool idea, I'm still on the fence regarding its usefulness.\nThe high-end and satisfying keyboard has absolutely silent keys. Similarly, the trackpad is massive, extending from the keyboard to the edge of the device, and has a velvety matte texture. One downside is that I had some trouble getting it to function at a high capacity in a particularly cold office. If your hands are on the cold side, you might experience some slow responses.\nAlso: Why I highly recommend the M4 MacBook Air to most people (and now it's on sale)\nThis could potentially be adjusted with optimization, which is the other big thing I'd like to mention about this laptop. In my experience, Asus laptops respond particularly well to optimization settings across the board. The ProArt P16 is a perfect example of this; different profiles or settings parameters can drastically affect performance, ranging from battery life to speed and responsiveness.\nThis also applies to Windows updates, particularly regarding demanding workloads. When I first fired up this laptop, for example, its performance was noticeably worse until I went through the series of Windows updates for the OS, updated drivers, and followed up with the list of updates in the MyAsus app.\nThe P16's performance improved after I updated it, and it was then optimized further once I got used to the DialPad and configured the trackpad and power profiles.\nAll of this is to say that the ProArt P16, for me, was not a laptop that came ready to go out of the box but rather requires some personalization and attention to get the most out of it. This applies to its rich feature set, but it takes a moment to incorporate it into creative workflows. Ultimately, this is a good thing, as it encourages innovation on the user's part to break out of cloned UIs and workflows that all look the same.\nPutting a more concrete number to its performance, in our benchmarking tests, the ProArt P16 placed somewhere in between the M3 MacBook Pro and the M4, although it should be noted that it's more on par with the M3 than Apple's latest M4 product.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nApple MacBook Pro with M4 | 1,000 | 3,823 | 14,849 |\nApple MacBook Pro with M3 | 906 | 3,072 | 11,623 |\nAsus ProArt P16 | 1,096 | 2,904 | 12,787 |\nApple MacBook Pro with M1 Pro | 828 | 2,211 | 12,482 |\nLastly, let's briefly mention the battery. This is a laptop with a powerful suite of hardware and a 16-inch AMOLED display, so I wasn't expecting much going into my testing. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how robust the battery is, especially when paying attention to power-saving settings.\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\nI easily got over 10 hours of battery life with normal use and intermittent high-demand tasks. However, with intensive creative tasks and heavy multitasking, you can expect around seven hours before connecting to an outlet.\nZDNET's buying advice\nIf you're looking for a powerful laptop with solid hardware and a rich, dynamic feature set, I recommend the Asus ProArt P16 as a solid choice for advanced creators who want to challenge the status quo and enjoy tinkering with customization settings to maximize creative output.\nHowever, if you're looking for an out-of-the-box creative powerhouse, I recommend the Apple M3 or M4 MacBook Pro. It has all the powerful hardware ready to tackle creative tasks and couldn't possibly be easier to set up. If you like the ProArt P16 but want something a bit more accessible, Asus' ProArt PZ13 is a more compact version at almost half the price.\nThis article was originally published on December 6, 2024, and was updated on July 23, 2025."

It goes without saying that this TV is a beast -- an expensive one. And the Bravia 5 is not even considered the company's flagship model (you can look to the Bravia 8 II and Bravia 9 for that). But this TV is impressive, and after testing it for a week, I'll explain why.\nAlso: You should turn off this default TV setting ASAP - and why even experts recommend it\nThe Bravia 5 is a Google TV, so setting up the UI was fairly easy using the remote and the Google Home app on my phone. But be prepared for a series of screens requiring you to check boxes for privacy disclaimers. The era of streaming content has become very complicated.\nOtherwise, the interface is intuitive, offering quick access to a vast selection of streaming services, apps, and voice control capabilities via Google Assistant. The personalization features are also a plus for helping you discover new content.\nThis behemoth of a display comes with a relatively small remote control. It's slender and lightweight, and if you have fat fingers like me, you might accidentally press enter when you meant to press a navigation button.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated feature that can revitalize an old system for free\nI appreciate the downsizing of remotes across most brands these days. Yet despite all the streamlining, Sony (and most others) insist on including dedicated app buttons. You know, for Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and whatever other platforms the manufacturer contracts with. These buttons take up a lot of real estate and make the remote seem almost \"disposable\" because brands get bought, sold, and sometimes change names.\nFor example, I have a Roku TV with a Vudu button. Who or what is Vudu? That platform still exists, but it's now known as Fandango Media (a joint venture between NBC Universal and Warner Bros.).\nI don't mean to make an example of Sony; its engineers are simply abiding by the current trend. Yet, I haven't met anyone who says they use these dedicated app buttons. When you have a smartly designed home screen, you don't need them.\nThat is one of my two peevish critiques of the Sony Bravia 5. Second is the fact that this remote is not backlit. Come on, Sony. If I'm buying a $6,000 TV, I envision a home cinema experience in the dark (just like in a movie theatre). This means I don't want to turn on my phone to aim a light source at the \"magic wand\" just so I can pause the thing when my DoorDash order arrives. To me, backlighting on remotes seems like a simple ask for anything above a budget model television.\nApologies for my digressionary rant on remote control design. Despite these minor gripes, it became clear to me that the Bravia 5 has plenty to shout about.\nAlso: The next big HDMI leap has arrived - how the 2.2 standard is shaking things up\nFor one thing, Sony's prowess in display technology is impressive. Its proprietary Cognitive Processor XR upscales images beautifully, ensuring motion is slippery smooth with minimal blur. From fast-paced action scenes in the 2023 Mission: Impossible rendition to 2025 NBA highlights, the Bravia 5 delivered 4K resolution with exceptional clarity, vibrant colors, and impressive contrast. HDR content truly pops, showcasing deep blacks and brilliant highlights.\nWhile 4K content looks phenomenal, lower-resolution content (like older cable broadcasts) tends to reveal imperfections more noticeably on such a large screen, even with the XR processor's excellent upscaling.\nThe Sony Bravia 5 can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate with VRR and ALLM enabled, which means the TV dynamically adjusts to match the frame rate of the content being displayed. This is especially good news for gamers. With those kinds of specs, playing Fortnite on a display of this size is an electrifying experience. The Bravia 5 showed no sign of screen tearing, with exquisitely responsive gameplay.\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nAlready impressed by the images on this behemoth TV, I ran a few tests at the lab for dirty screen effect, burn-in, and blooming. I clocked no degradation, even close to the edges. The color test was consistent; the subtitle test yielded no visible blooming, and the scrolling text motion was liquid.\nHaving said that, viewing the Bravia 5 from side angles was not the best. It's fair to assume that, with the same build and technology in a smaller Bravia 5, this would also be the case. With a 98-inch screen, though, you probably won't get many complaints from someone sitting on the far edge of your couch. And while Sony TVs generally handle reflections well, a screen this large can still be susceptible to glare in brightly lit rooms, so strategic placement and light control are important factors. (You might consider getting some blackout curtains.)\nAlso: I changed 12 settings on my Apple TV to instantly improve the performance\nThis Mini LED TV bears a peak brightness of around 800 nits. That isn't eye-popping OLED-level brightness, but in a dark room, you might want to lower the brightness on a Bravia 5 to prevent eye strain. Trust me, the TV is plenty bright, and it can accommodate seating from any conceivable home theater.\nWhat about sound? The Sony Bravia 5 uses Sony's Acoustic Multi-Audio system, and it's worth some praise. It combines two down-firing X-Balanced speakers for bass and midrange with a pair of Sound Positioning tweeters on the top corners of the back panel to handle mids and highs. The result is a well-balanced listening experience, with clear dialogue and vocals complemented by ambient effects that fill the space nicely.\nFor the ultimate audio experience, though, the Sony Bravia 5 could use a companion soundbar to round things out. Again, if you're investing this much in a giant screen, then your budget might not be too far stretched to install a comprehensive surround sound system as well.\nAlso: This is the soundbar I recommend for deeply immersive audio - and now it's $300 off\nThe Bravia 5 has an impressive array of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 on the wireless side, and several physical ports. I really like how Sony included an infographic panel (of sorts) right next to each port to make it clear which cables go where. It comes with four HDMI ports -- one of them eARC (for that soundbar you should buy), another being 4K at 120Hz (for your online gaming needs).\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe 98-inch Sony Bravia 5 is a formidable piece of home entertainment technology. Its stunning picture quality, immersive scale, and excellent smart features make it a dream display for any cinephile or gaming enthusiast.\nGrand proportions notwithstanding, Sony's quality will shine through on any smaller-sized Bravia 5 screen. This one runs for about $5,999, whereas you can get an 85-inch Bravia 5 for less than half that price or a 75-inch for one-third the cost.\nEven if it's not about the money, not every home can accommodate a colossal 98-inch panel. So, if your home's parameters aren't suitable for something this big, you'll arguably be getting a better value by downsizing a step or two on screen size.\nIf you have the budget and space, the Bravia 5 delivers on its promise of a magnificent viewing experience. And if you're seeking the ultimate home cinema experience, pair this TV with a high-end soundbar to match the visual grandeur with equally powerful and nuanced audio.\nHow we test TVs\nWhile testing and researching the TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:\n- Price: Not all budgets are created equal. And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV.\n- Screen size: The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space.\n- Picture and audio quality: A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. The best TVs we test have often been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.\nFor a more detailed look, check out our extensive TV testing methodology."

A good laptop is more than a machine. It's a creative tool as important to the graphic designer as the brush is to the artist. It needs to run demanding software, display color with precision, and handle massive files without stuttering or overheating.\nWe tested the top models of 2025 to find which ones meet the demanding needs of today's graphic artists.\nAlso: Best laptops for video editing\nWhat is the best laptop for graphic design right now?\nWe tested many excellent laptops to create this list, but our pick for the best laptop for graphic design is Apple's M4 MacBook Pro. It has a stunning display and excellent M4 chip performance. However, our top pick might not be the best fit for every designer's needs. We've rounded up various other top-tier options from Dell, Asus, and Lenovo, so there's many options for a wide range of budgets and features.\nThe best laptops for graphic designers in 2025\nApple's new M4 MacBook Pro takes our top spot as the best graphic design laptop. This should come as no surprise, as MacBook Pros are often lauded for their top-tier performance and high-quality screens. In fact, this model shares many similarities to the previous number one pick: the M3 MacBook Pro. It just does everything better.\nThe latest MacBook Pro houses the tech giant's M4 chipset, improving the laptop's ability to handle resource-heavy software like illustration apps. ZDNET's Senior Reviews Editor Kerry Wan recently reviewed the M4 MacBook Pro. According to his tests, the model \"outperforms its predecessors, as well as some of the latest Windows machines running Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) chipsets.\"\nWan said the hardware makes \"demanding workflows like 4K video editing feel natural.\" This MacBook Pro also comes with 16GB, which it uses to run Apple Intelligence features and the now-upgraded Siri.\nReview: Apple MacBook Pro M4\nYou have a choice between either a 14-inch or 16-inch Liquid Retina Display, with the latter having a maximum resolution of up to 3,456 x 223 pixels. The M3 MacBook Pro had a similar screen, but the M4 MacBook Pro has a nano-texture coating. This gives the display a \"matte-frosted layering [that] significantly reduces glare.\" In short, you can take this laptop under the sun and still see the screen clearly, which is perfect for working or creating outdoors this summer.\nApple M4 MacBook Pro specs: CPU: Apple M4 | GPU: M4 integrated graphics | RAM: 16GB | Storage: 512GB SSD | Display: Liquid Retina XDR\nIf you want Apple hardware that's lighter on your wallet and in your bag, we recommend the MacBook Air M3. The M3 chipset is a force to be reckoned with, even on the lightweight MacBook Air.\nReview: Apple MacBook Air M3\nIn addition to the ultra-thin form factor, graphic designers will love that the M3 can output up to two different external monitors simultaneously, allowing you to do your work on bigger screens. The M3 chip on board the Air also allows for future-proofing down the line, with integration with Apple Intelligence and all the upcoming AI features.\nMacBook Air M2 specs: CPU: Apple M3 | GPU: M3 integrated graphics | RAM: 8GB | Storage: 256GB SSD | Display: 13.6-inch Liquid Retina\nLenovo's recent Yoga 9i 2-in-1 refresh earns our title of the best 2-in-1 graphic design laptop. Convertible 2-in-1 laptops lend themselves very well to professional creative work, as you can write up a document while the machine is in laptop mode and immediately flip the screen to place it into tablet mode.\nReview: Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1\nThe Yoga 9i 2-in-1 features a stunning 2.8K OLED with vibrant colors, so this is something graphic designers and other creatives will love working on. Furthermore, the speakers are housed on the hinge, which helps them sound super crisp and clear, especially for a laptop. The system even comes complete with subwoofers for that extra punch. You also get a free stylus with purchase, allowing you to jump right into your work.\nLenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 OLED specs: CPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 155H | GPU: Integrated Intel graphics card | RAM: 16GB | Storage: 512GB | Display: 14-inch 2.8K resolution OLED\nMicrosoft has made some great drawing laptops, but now Asus is giving the tech giant a run for its money with the ProArt PZ13, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus. Similar to Surface laptops, this device consists of a 3K AMOLED touchscreen tablet connected to a detachable keyboard, but Asus' machine is better suited for creative professionals.\nAlso: Best drawing tablets\nThe laptop's display supports Dolby Vision, VESA DisplayHDR True Black, and the entire DCI-P3 color gamut, all of which work together to deliver a \"stunning visual experience.\" Unique to this device is the Creator Hub, a dashboard app that lets you adjust the color output of the ProArt PZ13's display on the fly. It's a handy tool that ensures colors are shown more accurately. There's even a special mode that enhances the visual fidelity of movies.\nReview: Asus ProArt PZ13\nBesides the display and lightweight design, Asus' ProArt PZ13 has a ridiculously long battery life, capable of lasting over 21 hours on a single charge. You can leave it on overnight and still find it running the next morning.\nAsus ProArt PZ13 specs: CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus | GPU: Integrated Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite GPU | RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X | Storage: 1TB SSD | Display: 13-inch 2,880 x 1,800 AMOLED touchscreen\nOne reason why Samsung's Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 makes for a great graphic design laptop is due to its high-quality display. It has a 16-inch 3K touchscreen that runs at a 120Hz refresh rate and \"covers 120% of the DCI-P3 color gamut.\" Everything listed coalesces into stunning visual fidelity second only to a MacBook Pro.\nThe display would've been enough for the laptop to secure a place on this list, but the experience is made even better thanks to the in-box S-Pen, which writes very smoothly on the glass. Its responsiveness makes using the accessory a pleasure, and it was a standout highlight during our testing.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360\nAlthough the Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 lacks the Nvidia GeForce graphics card seen on the Galaxy Book4 Ultra, the device still performs quite well thanks to its next-gen Intel Core Ultra 7 256V processor and integrated Intel Arc 140V graphics card. Our testing shows it easily handled having many open tabs, windows, and apps running at the same time. There wasn't a single dip in performance.\nBecause it is a Galaxy Book, you will need to own a recent Samsung Galaxy smartphone to use all its features, such as Quick Share, Multi Control, and Second Screen.\nSamsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 specs: CPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 256V | GPU: Intel Arc 140V | RAM: 16GB | Storage: 1TB SSD | Display: 16-inch 3K AMOLED\nGraphic designers constantly on the go should check out this year's Dell XPS 13. The series is known for its sleek designs and top-of-the-line performance, and this model has the same stylish zero-lattice keyboard and capacitive touch panel.\nIt is about 13.4-inches across and weighs a mere 2.6 pounds, meaning you can stuff it inside a bag and easily take it with you. Dell's machine is not going to encumber you in any way.\nReview: Dell XPS 13 (2024)\nMost of the important changes on the 2024 XPS 13 are found inside the laptop. The early model boasts an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, an Intel Arc graphics card, and 32GB of memory. Everything together results in super-fast processing speeds, quick load times, and smooth multitasking. We also can't forget to mention the high-quality display, which is capable of outputting a 3K image resolution.\nThe OLED model has a peak refresh rate of 60Hz. If speed and accuracy is important to you, then we recommend purchasing the mid-range since its refresh rate can go up to 120Hz.\nDell XPS 13 specs: CPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 155H | GPU: x | RAM: 32GB | Storage: 1TB SSD | Display: 13.4-inch 3K OLED touchscreen\nWhat are the tariffs in the U.S.?\nThe recent U.S. tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nCNET: Tariff Pricing Tracker: We're Watching 11 Products You Might Need to Buy\nLaptops and PCs are also hit hard by the new U.S. tariffs, with import duties potentially increasing prices by up to 35%. Many major brands still rely on Chinese and Vietnamese factories for assembly, meaning consumers could soon pay significantly more for everything from budget Chromebooks to high-end gaming rigs.\nThese tariffs may accelerate efforts to move production to regions like Mexico or India, but shoppers can expect higher costs and fewer discounts in the short term.\nRight now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.\nAlso: Tariff exemptions for electronics offer a break for tech - but not for long\nWhat is the best laptop for graphic design?\nWe chose the 14-inch Apple MacBook Pro from 2024 as the best laptop for graphic design due to its exceptional high-resolution display and great hardware performance.\nIf you're thinking about getting something else, the table below compares the best graphic design laptops according to price, screen size, and CPU.\n| Best laptop for graphic designers | Starting Cost | Display | CPU |\n| Apple MacBook Pro M4 | $1,399 | 14\" Liquid Retina XDR display | Apple Silicon M4 |\n| Apple MacBook Air M3 | $1,030 | 13.6\" Liquid Retina display | Apple Silicon M3 |\n| Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 | $1,735 | 14\" OLED touchscreen | Intel Core Ultra i7-1360P |\n| Asus ProArt PZ13 | $1,100 | 13\" AMOLED touchscreen | Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus |\n| Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 | $1,450 | 16\" 3K AMOLED touchscreen | Intel Core Ultra 7 256V |\n| Dell XPS 13 | $1,100 | 13.4\" 3K OLED display | Intel Core Ultra 7 155H |\nWhich graphic design laptop is right for you?\nGraphic design laptops can handle many tasks, but some are better than others in certain scenarios. Hardware-demanding work such as video editing, requires a high-end computer.\nYou need to know what you're looking for in a laptop; you don't want to buy a device that's going to struggle. Here's how to figure out which laptop for graphic design works best for you:\n| Choose this laptop for graphic design... | If you want\u2026 |\n| Apple MacBook Pro M4 | The best graphic design laptop overall.

Here are some of the top factors you'll want to consider before making a purchase:\n- Hardware: Creative professionals rely heavily on their laptops' graphics cards to do their work. Graphics cards must also be paired with strong CPUs and a good amount of RAM to perform at a high level.\n- Display: All that performance doesn't mean squat if the laptop's display can't accurately showcase your work. Creative professionals greatly prefer high-resolution displays.\n- Screen size: 16-inch or 17-inch laptops are much heavier than 13-inch or 14-inch devices. Regular travelers may want something smaller so they can leave the laptop with the big screen at the office or at home.\n- Battery life: Decide whether you need a high-end laptop that can accomplish tasks but only run for a few hours, or a mid-ranger that can last an entire day.\n- Price: Price is an important factor to consider when shopping for laptops. Obviously, the more expensive options tend to have better hardware. That said, don't completely discount the cheaper models because many still deliver awesome performance.\nHow we test laptops\nThere are many excellent laptops on the market for graphic design, and our staff at ZDNET has the opportunity to review many of them. We look at the aforementioned factors, including display, battery life, and value. We then test them as we would use them in the real world, from surfing the internet to streaming videos to more specific use cases for graphic design.\nOnce all the testing is complete, the ones we liked are reviewed, given a specific category, like the best Windows laptop for graphic design, and placed on the list.\nFor more on our testing process, check out our comprehensive laptop testing methodology page.\nFAQs on graphic design laptops\nIs battery life important in the best laptops for graphic designers?\nYes, but it depends on what you have.\nBattery life is essential for lightweight, travel, or cheap laptops. These models don't have the most superb hardware in the world and are often mid-range devices. You won't want to worry about your laptop dying on you in the middle of a project.\nBattery life doesn't matter as much for bulky, powerful laptops like the MSI Creator Z16. You'll be using this machine primarily at home, and computers of this caliber are heavy. Speaking from experience, you don't want to lug around a big laptop daily. Plus, their hardware demands a lot of power, so your battery will drain much more quickly.\nIs connectivity important in the best laptops for graphic designers?\nHaving a wide array of ports on a graphic design laptop is important, but ultimately, it comes down to what you need.\nSome manufacturers equip their devices with only a few inputs in order to keep sizes small and the weight low. This is a good design move for ultraportable laptops. That said, creative professionals work with a variety of devices and peripherals. Perhaps they need to connect their laptop to an external display or multiple monitors. This extends to audio equipment and SD cards, too.\nGood laptop connectivity options are crucial to many professionals' work. You can solve this problem by buying a docking station to complement your computer, obtaining way more inputs and outputs than you ever could.\nAlso: The best 5 laptop docking stations\nIf you just want a single device, you may be better off buying a heftier laptop with a variety of ports. A lightweight machine is ideal for travel.\nAre MacBooks really that much better than Windows laptops when it comes to graphic design?\nWhen it comes to hardware, not really. Modern MacBooks certainly have powerful M-series chipsets, allowing them to rise above the rest, but Windows laptops have come a long way in bridging the gap. We would argue that Windows hardware is comparable to, and in some cases better than, Apple's tech.\nThe main difference between the two comes down to software. MacBooks have a great selection of apps onboard that still trounces Microsoft software. GarageBand is still great for editing music, and iMovie is also fantastic for basic video edits.\nAlso: Boost your security and productivity with the top Mac apps\nWindows 11, on the other hand, doesn't have the greatest selection. For years, base apps on Windows computers were terrible. No one in their right mind takes Paint seriously. That's what PhotoShop is for. Things have improved, but base apps on Windows 11 still pale compared to what's on macOS. Those starting software choices can make a huge difference.\nCan gaming laptops be used for graphic design?\nGaming laptops are definitely a great alternative for graphic designers. They are often equipped with some of the most powerful processors in the tech industry. They also have great graphics cards, huge storage drives, and a ton of RAM, providing professionals with all the power and space they need for work. Many even have stunning displays.\nAlso: Best budget gaming laptops of 2025\nThat said, they do have some problems. 1) Gaming laptops can be heavy. In some cases, over seven pounds. 2) They're expensive. 3) They don't always have the most pleasing designs. Several models feature bulky, all-black designs, or RGB lighting that not everyone likes.\nWhen is the best time to get laptop deals?\nLaptops constantly go on sale throughout the year, but many devices see deeper discounts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In fact, those two days are usually the best time to find great deals for laptops, although Amazon Prime Day comes close. Many brands get in on the festivities. Apple slashes the price tag on MacBooks, Lenovo does the same with ThinkPads, and Asus discounts its ZenBook laptops. You'll be able to find these deals across multiple online retailers like Amazon, QVC, Best Buy, and Walmart. You will be hard-pressed to find a website that doesn't engage.\nThe next big shopping day is Boxing Day, which is December 26. Prices usually aren't slashed as steeply on this day as they are on Black Friday, but you can still find great deals. It's hard to say what will be on sale this Boxing Day.\nOther graphic design laptops\nBest travel laptop for graphic design\nLG Gram Pro 17\nIf you're looking for a laptop with a huge display that is still portable, it doesn't get lighter than LG's Gram Pro 17. Its Meteor Lake processor and GeForce RTX 3050 GPU work in tandem with a brilliant 2K high-res WQXGA display and wafer-thin form factor.\nReview: I tested LG's 17-inch Gram Pro and it's the big-screen, lightweight laptop to beat"

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nThis ultraportable Asus laptop is my favorite MacBook Air alternative (and it's better in some ways)\nAsus Zenbook A14\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The Asus Zenbook A14 with 16GB of memory is on sale at Best Buy for $599.\n- It's a fantastic balance of innovation and value with an OLED display, competitive hardware, and a satisfying physical form.\n- While its use case is clearly defined, the laptop has its limits when it comes to high-end performance.\nThe Asus Zenbook A14 is on sale for $599 at Best Buy for the 16GB model. That's a $400 discount on one of the best laptops we've tested this year.\nWhen Asus officially announced the Zenbook A14 at CES this year, I wasn't the only one to be low-key enamored with it. It's a great laptop in its own right, but it stands out as a successful balancing act between performance and affordability while hitting all the right notes that consumers care about.\nMade of Asus' proprietary ceraluminum material, the Zenbook A14 almost feels like a prototype model that's empty inside, as it's exceedingly light at just 2.1 pounds (for reference, the 13-inch MacBook Air is 2.7 pounds). When you set it down, the device opens easily with the lift of a single finger, revealing the brilliant OLED display.\nAlso: This 16-inch Acer is a full-package value pick I'd happily replace my main laptop with\nAsus committed to a neutral-forward aesthetic with the A14. The brand messaging features muted tones and quiet, sophisticated imagery punctuated by natural motifs, which work to form a cohesive identity.\nThis aesthetic highlights Asus' determination to deliver a cohesive brand message while balancing innovation and cost. For example, the display on the Zenbook A14 looks good right out of the box. It's bright, crisp, and efficient. But closer inspection reveals that it's not as premium a display as you'd find on, say, Asus' ProArt P16.\nThe display is framed by plastic bezels carefully designed not to look cheap, but again\u2026 this isn't the ProArt. Additionally, the panel over the FHD display has some slight warping that can give a funhouse mirror effect when you catch your reflection on the glossy surface.\nOnce the display is turned on, however, whatever jumpscare you just saw is quickly forgotten, as it delivers a brilliant image: contrast is crisp, colors are vivid, and it's bright, at 600 nits and a full HD+ (1920 x 1200) resolution that pairs well with the speedy performance.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for a week, and it makes even the XPS feel outdated\nSpeaking of performance, let's discuss the tech that powers this device. Asus again focused on balance, pairing the base-level Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor with the 32GB RAM configuration and the slightly faster Snapdragon X Plus with the lower-end, 16GB RAM configuration.\nThis balancing act results in a slightly unintuitive pricing structure: the laptop with the higher-end processor is cheaper ($999) as it comes with half the memory (which is what you're really paying for). The version with more RAM and the lower-end Snapdragon X processor starts at $1,099.\nThe difference between the two processors is ultimately not that massive, both are eight-core chips, but the Snapdragon X chip is limited to 3.0 GHz clock speed, putting a performance cap on this laptop.\nThat cap is fine because this device isn't made to tackle intensive workloads. It's for the modern professional who lives in the cloud, works remotely, and values a nice display.\nAlso: The hybrid Windows laptop I recommend most for work travel also has an OLED display\nThat being said, the performance is solid. It's a fast laptop: it boots quickly, loads apps swiftly, and navigates the web without lag. It runs silent and cool, generating almost no heat -- even with the slim form factor.\nIn our benchmarking tests, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processor performed better than I expected against more premium devices with Intel's Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" chip, particularly in its higher-end sibling, the Zenbook S14, and Dell's XPS 13 in multi-core performance. The processor even surpassed the latter in single-core performance.\nComparing this laptop's numbers to HP's OmniBook X with the Snapdragon X Elite, for example, suggests the device is outclassed at the higher end of performance but is highly optimized for everyday tasks and able to deliver a faster, more efficient experience in those use cases.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nZenbook A14 (Snapdragon X) | 541 | 2133 | 10624 |\nZenbook S 14 (Intel Lunar Lake) | 481 | 2748 | 11050 |\nDell XPS 13 (Intel Lunar Lake) | 552 | 2743 | 11005 |\nHP Omnibook X (Snapdragon X Elite) | 470 | 2326 | 13160 |\nThe laptop's strong performance is allied to an enjoyable physical form factor. The keyboard is fantastic -- it's one of the most comfortable laptop keyboards I've used. I make this claim without exaggeration and note its success isn't due to anything particularly expensive or high-end. Asus just hit the mark when balancing design and cost.\nAlso: I recommend this Asus laptop to creative professionals and business users alike. Here's why\nThe keys are smooth and matte, with a slick texture that borders on ASMR. I also love how the laptop's ceramic body is fingerprint-resistant and easy to clean, even when splashed in the kitchen or coffee shop.\nFor remote or hybrid workers who move from place to place, the laptop also features the right number of ports (an HDMI, two USB-Cs, and one USB-A) to handle whatever accessories you carry in tow or to charge the battery. I'm (sort of) kidding, but that leads me to my last point.\nHands down, the best part of this laptop is the outstanding battery life. Asus advertises up to 32 hours on a single charge. Although that's the top end of the estimation, it's not far off from what you can expect with everyday use. During my testing, a day's work in the office didn't take me down past 50%.\nThe Snapdragon X processor reduces power consumption to a trickle when it's not in use. If you do need juice, the A14 charges quickly, reaching close to 75% after just an hour of charging. This capability translates to a laptop that can last a couple of days' work on one charge, even if that includes multiple video calls.\nAlso: I'm a Windows user, but the MacBook Air M4 could be my new primary laptop at this price\nI'll also mention a few of the drawbacks of this laptop (but there aren't many). The first is that the Qualcomm Adreno GPU on this system is not designed for high-end gaming. Sure, it can certainly handle casual games. But this isn't a device made for the latest FPS.\nAlso, the display, while it looks great, is still capped at a 60Hz refresh rate, which keeps the battery (and price point) low but further limits any aspirations of high-end gaming. Ultimately, while the Zenbook A14 is competitively priced, this is not a $1,500 laptop.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Zenbook A14 has a coherent identity: it's a lightweight, aesthetic machine for the modern professional, effortlessly mobile in both form factor and battery life, but trades some raw power for all that endurance. That being said, the Snapdragon X processor punches well above its weight and competes handily with chips that are, on paper, more powerful.\nBecause of its cohesive identity, how well it balances innovation and value, and the hardware performance, the Zenbook A14 is one of the best laptops I've reviewed in the past year and one I'd strongly recommend as long as its strengths align with your needs.\nTo top it all off, the starting price of $999, when not on sale, is fairly competitive -- if Asus succeeds in selling this laptop's brand story in a way that positions it as an alternative to other ultraportable, such as Apple's MacBook Air.\nWhy the Asus Zenbook A14 gets an Editors' Choice award\nWe awarded the Asus Zenbook A14 an Editors' Choice because it combines a sleek, ultraportable form factor with a balanced design and approachable price point. This laptop looks as good as it performs and balances the right amount of hardware for the everyday user looking for a versatile laptop for work and play. For this set of use cases, it's the best in its class.\nThis story was originally published on February 14, 2025, and was updated on July 31, 2025, to reflect the new Best Buy deal and the latest relevant internal links."

I did, and it was totally worth it\nM4 MacBook Pro\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The M4 MacBook Pro starts at $1,799 and features improvements in the most subtle places.\n- Upgrades to graphical performance, battery life, and transfer speeds are the most notable.\n- Be prepared to overpay for almost every spec bump.\nOn Amazon, every single M4 MacBook Pro configuration is on sale. You can buy Apple's latest flagship laptop for as low as $1,299.\nI've been using the M4 MacBook Pro for a few months now, and it's the most boringly awesome device in my daily arsenal.\nWithout making my 14-inch M1 MacBook Pro jealous, the latest model is Apple's most polished and complete laptop yet, to the point where the base M4 configuration may just be good enough for 90% of users. Most people will be delighted by the M4 MacBook Pro's overall computing experience, especially if they're coming from an Intel-based system.\nAlso: 5 Apple devices you definitely shouldn't buy this month (and 7 to get instead)\nA smaller percentage -- the enthusiasts -- will absolutely salivate over the finer touches, from the changes to the USB-C ports to the brighter screen in SDR mode. In fact, the base M4 model -- not the M4 Pro or M4 Max -- is precisely the one I've been lugging around town, and it's got all the bells and whistles I need to push through rigorous amounts of video and photo editing, gaming (with all the rays traced), and content consumption.\nI'm on hour 11 since last charge, and this laptop has 20% of battery left in the tank. That's not exactly the \"24-hour battery life\" that Apple touts in its marketing, but remember that the company benchmarks by hours of video playback only. With various creative tasks and background apps running, I've been very impressed with the M4 MacBook Pro's endurance. If it were my M1 MacBook Pro, my battery anxiety would've kicked in much earlier.\nAlso: Should you buy the iPhone 16 or iPhone 17? How to decide which model to buy\nThe new M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pros feature USB-C Thunderbolt 5 ports, becoming some of the first laptops on the market to support faster 120Gbps transfer speeds, up to 240W charging, and more robust monitor support. For professional creatives who use external GPUs and storage solutions and need a portable system that can swiftly move large files, paying for the extra processing power is justifiable.\nOtherwise, the base M4 MacBook Pro is more than competent, with its now three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports. Not only is the additional USB-C port situated on the right side of the laptop, which plays nicer with all the monitor and charging cables that naturally reside on the right side of my office desk, but the new processor allows the computer to extend up to two monitors while the lid is open. Previously, you'd have to close the MacBook lid in order to power two external monitors.\nBesides the ports, the only major hardware difference between the base M4 MacBook Pro and the M4 Pro and M4 Max variants is the number of cooling fans, with the higher-tier options having two instead of one. While I haven't been able to test the difference in throttling and heat dissipation of all three systems, I've been satisfied with the base M4's performance. Whether I was running benchmarks or playing Myst on high graphical settings and with ray tracing active, the laptop's fan never hissed in a distracting, \"tapping out\" manner.\nAlso: Is a refurbished MacBook worth it? I did the math, and here's my buying advice\nBefore I jump into benchmarks, I'd like to give a nod to the M4 MacBook Pro's display. The 14-inch model doesn't have the same punchiness and depth as the tandem OLED on the M4 iPad Pro, but the new brightness rating -- 1,000 nits at SDR and 1,600 nits at HDR -- paired with the optional, expensive, and satisfying clean nano-texture coating makes this the best-looking laptop display I've used. The matte-frosted layering significantly reduces glare, while the brighter panel just manages to beat out the November sun, which still thinks it's summer.\nWith the M1 MacBook Pro -- and every other laptop with a glossy display -- I often found myself smudging the webcam area when lifting the lid or wiping off a dust mark. On the M4 MacBook Pro, after a week of intensive use, the display remains clean and pristine.\nSo, is the $150 upcharge for the nano-texture display worth it? For most people, no. Instead, consider picking up a matte screen protector from Amazon for less than $20. You'll be nearly as satisfied for more than a fraction of the cost.\nNow, here's a breakdown of the M4 MacBook Pro (with a 10-core CPU, a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage) benchmark scores:\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nApple MacBook Pro with M4 | 1,000 | 3,823 | 14,849 |\nApple MacBook Pro with M3 | 906 | 3,072 | 11,623 |\nApple MacBook Pro with M1 Pro | 828 | 2,211 | 12,482 |\nLenovo Yoga Slim 7i with Intel Core Ultra 7 258V (Series 2) | 507 | 2,736 | 10,887 |\nUnsurprisingly, the M4 MacBook Pro outperforms its predecessors, as well as some of the latest Windows machines running on Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) chipsets. It's quite spectacular to see the $1,599 M4 MacBook Pro outpacing a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip that I paid almost $3,000 for.\nAlso: Apple's tariff costs and iPhone sales are soaring - how long until device prices are too?\nIt helps that every MacBook model (including the M3 and M4 Air) now starts at 16GB of RAM; We have AI to thank for that. I've been toying with the MacOS Sequoia to get a taste of what life is like when I spend less time thinking while using the MacBook (read: relying on Apple Intelligence instead). Here's a brief tier list of the best new features:\n- ChatGPT-powered Siri (A tier): It's quite game-changing when Siri can actually answer more sophisticated queries instead of populating search results. It's also been great being able to access a floating Siri menu by double-pressing the command key, though I'd love to be able to automatically start a voice prompt with a long press.\n- Writing Tools (B tier): From event invitations to real estate messages, I've been needing to manage various conversations and have greatly benefitted from the AI-assisted responses. The only thing is, my natural tone is somewhere between the \"Professional\" and \"Concise\" versions, so there's always a thing or two that needs to be dialed down or spiffed up.\n- Image Playground (C tier): Besides the output from the image generator looking like variants of the Jetpack Joyride icon, I've been struggling to find a practical, real-world use for it. Oftentimes, sending an emoji gets the same point across as an AI-generated thumbnail, and for much less time.\nZDNET's buying advice\nFor the same price as the previous generation MacBook Pro models, the M4 variants -- particularly the base configuration -- offer notable upgrades in performance, utility, and battery life. The introduction of Thunderbolt 5 ports, an M4 processor that's better built for machine learning, a more capable webcam, and a brighter display funnel into a form factor that should play well with office workers, digital nomads, students, professional creatives, and more.\nFor most users, the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the way to go. If you need more internal storage than the 512GB, bumping up to the 1TB tier for $200 is not the worst idea. Beyond that, I'd advise picking up an external SSD, which gives you more storage than what Apple does and for significantly less money.\nIf you're after portability and can live without features like the ProMotion display and an SD card slot, you won't miss out on much by opting for the less expensive (but still capable) M4 or M3 MacBook Air, which even support the upcoming Apple Intelligence features.\nThis article was originally published on November 7, 2024, and was updated on August 5, 2025."
