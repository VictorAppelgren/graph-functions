      "feedback": "This draft rightly links O’Leary’s mom-derived habits to a durable-goods, balance-sheet‑centered macro view, but to reach world‑class standards you should (1) formalize a multi‑year, regime‑based framework: Baseline growth with gradual AI productivity, a policy regime that could include UBI with social/identity costs, and a cyclical auto/EV transition path; (2) articulate a clean causal chain from household balance sheets (e.g., 15% savings and separate accounts, Chanel‑quality durable purchases) to macro transmission (consumption smoothing, credit demand, investment in durable goods, and policy risk premia), explicitly tying each link to the cited sources (1GVYF2V8O, 2QRLB974F); (3) strengthen scenario structure with clear catalysts/triggers and invalidation points: AI adoption pace crossing a productivity threshold; UBI experiments showing employment/mental‑health outcomes (NL5YYTLF2); Ford/EV‑capex signals (22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW) as regime‑shifters; and explicit invalidation cues (e.g., sustained high unemployment or a failed EV transition); (4) quantify where possible using the numbers in sources: 15% savings, two Chanel suits per year, six‑month saving cadence (O’Leary); Ford’s 5.18% yield, 8x forward P/E, 17% YTD rise, Q2 EV losses (22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW); EV capex up to $50B through 2026; Finland’s UBI result; (5) fix attribution and reconcile conflicts: note that Finland’s trial is not universally generalizable and that UBI debates hinge on labor‑identity psychology per NL5YYTLF2; (6) tighten the base‑case narrative to a crisp, 2–3 sentence core and place the rest as explicit sub‑sections with parallel lineages; (7) improve readability and adherence to the SECTION FOCUS by stating clear regimes, transition conditions, a base case, key risks, what to watch, and confidence; (8) ensure every claim is tied to an ID in SOURCE MATERIAL and avoid over‑generalities or extraneous material not supported by the cited pieces.",
