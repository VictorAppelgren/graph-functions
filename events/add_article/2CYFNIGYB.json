      "summary": "Investors entered 2025 with high optimism after two years of 20% equity gains, but the S&P 500 fell to bear‑market territory in April before rallying to record highs. Market analysts now expect increased volatility in the second half of the year, driven by the July 9 tariff deadline, the Trump administration’s policy shift, and ongoing geopolitical risks. While recession fears have eased, Fed policy remains a key uncertainty, with most banks forecasting two rate cuts in 2025 and a terminal rate of 3.5% in 2026. AI and technology earnings continue to support equity upside, but tariff and geopolitical headwinds could temper growth, especially if tariff escalation or oil shocks materialize.",
