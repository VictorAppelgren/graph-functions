  "content": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem traveled to Illinois on Friday to call out Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, accusing both Democrats of \"being obstructionist\" when it comes to getting criminal illegal immigrants off the streets.\n\nNoem, speaking in a Chicago suburb, highlighted the recent ICE arrests of a Mexican illegal immigrant convicted of predatory sexual criminal assault against a victim under the age of 13, a Polish national convicted of attempted murder and aggravated domestic battery and an illegal immigrant from Micronesia with three DUI convictions.\n\n\"These individuals would still be out on our streets today committing crimes and attacking people and harming them and hurting our children if Governor Pritzker and Mayor Johnson had their way. Because their choice has been routinely over and over and over again to release these criminals back on the streets,\" Noem said.\n\n\"The debate over so-called sanctuary policies has real consequences and has consequences for our law enforcement officers, but also for the families that live here and the businesses that are just trying to provide for their community,\" she added.\n\nBONDI DOJ NAMES AND SHAMES 35 SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS THAT \u2018PUT AMERICAN CITIZENS AT RISK\u2019\n\nRepresentatives for both Pritzker and Johnson did not immediately respond Friday to requests for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\n\"I'm here today because the elected leaders in this state of Illinois are ignoring the law. In fact, they're being obstructionist when it comes to getting dangerous criminals off of their streets,\" Noem also said. \"They are deciding the dangerous criminals that are murderers, rapists, money launderers, have committed assault, that are trafficking children are more important than the families that live in the communities here.\"\n\nNOEM WARNS OF \u2018UNPRECEDENTED\u2019 THREAT LEVEL FOR ICE AGENTS, BLAMES 'LIES' FROM DEMOCRATS\n\n\"That includes Governor Pritzker, Mayor Johnson and others who have worked so hard to protect these dangerous criminals. They'd rather be a sanctuary state and continue to put those individuals above American citizens, American citizens who built this country, who have raised their families here for generations,\" Noem added.\n\nNoem also told reporters Friday that \"In just the last seven months, ICE has issued over 1,664 detainers in Chicago alone,\" marking a \"106% increase\" over what was issued during the Biden administration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" she said, \"Chicago and its leadership has only honored 8% of those.\"",

These steps include preparing an application for naturalization, paying fees, completing an interview and taking the oath of allegiance to the United States.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration prioritized securing the border and cracking down on the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the country.

The scene turned from peaceful to violent as rising unrest prompted police to deploy tear gas. The Los Angeles immigration protests were among other nationwide protests against federal immigration raids conducted by ICE agents.

The property, a former airport, has been outfitted with sturdy tent structures to house 5,000 undocumented immigrants amid the Trump administration's deportation blitz to remove the millions of migrants who entered the country during the Biden administration."

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Justice identified nearly three dozen cities and states across the country on Tuesday that it said were sanctuaries for illegal immigrants and warned that it planned to take legal action against more of those jurisdictions.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement the cities and states, which mostly lean blue, have immigration policies that \"impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design.\"\n\"The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country,\" Bondi said.\nFEDERAL JUDGE TOSSES TRUMP DOJ LAWSUIT AGAINST SANCTUARY POLICIES IN CHICAGO\nFour of the 13 states on the DOJ\u2019s list, California, New York, Colorado and Illinois, have already faced lawsuits over their immigration policies. Others on the list include Delaware, Nevada, Minnesota and Washington, D.C.\nThe lawsuit in Illinois is the furthest along in the court process and has not played out in DOJ\u2019s favor at this stage. A federal judge tossed out the DOJ\u2019s claims, saying Illinois\u2019 state and local policies were protected by the Constitution and that the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit encroached on Illinois\u2019 sovereignty. The DOJ could still appeal the decision or amend its complaint.\nBut the DOJ, which has shifted heavily during the Trump administration to focusing on immigration enforcement, has also seen some success.\nLOUISVILLE MAYOR SHIFTS DOJ POLICY AFTER LEGAL THREAT FROM DOJ\nIts threats to Louisville, Kentucky, resulted in the mayor there modifying the city\u2019s policy to be more cooperative with the federal government. A DOJ spokesperson said the purpose of the list was to encourage other states and cities to do the same.\n\"This is a chance for these jurisdictions to come to the table and work with us to keep Americans safe,\" the spokesperson said.\nOther cities on the DOJ's radar include Boston, New Orleans, Seattle and Philadelphia. Four counties were also on the list.\nA common reason that cities and states become targeted for being illegal immigrant sanctuaries involves detainer policies.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) uses detainers to make federal requests to jails to hold immigrants in custody who could be living in the country illegally so that ICE can arrest them. Sanctuary jurisdictions have policies in place to ignore those notices.\nIn the case of Louisville, for instance, the mayor has agreed to honor the 48-hour period ICE has been requesting to hold suspects so that they are not released before federal authorities can potentially arrest them."

Phrases like \"traitor\" and \"ICE pig\" were spray-painted onto their personal vehicles.\nWhile officers responded, shots were fired from nearby, striking one local police officer in the neck, who is expected to survive.\nNoem said attacks like this are part of a troubling pattern. The Department of Homeland Security told Fox News they\u2019ve seen assaults against ICE officers rise nearly 700% since the same time last year, something Noem called \"unprecedented.\"\n\"These targeted attacks against these law enforcement officers is a disrespect and a dangerous situation that we're in,\" she said.\nTensions regarding immigration enforcement have escalated, with anti-ICE riots breaking out in Los Angeles last month. Many city and state leaders have pushed back against the Trump administration\u2019s deportation agenda, refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities. Critics argue the raids are politically motivated and destabilize communities.\nNoem said that rhetoric by politicians has had real-world consequences for her officers.\n\"I think about it every day, every word that comes out of my mouth. I think, how can I protect these officers so they can do their jobs?\" said Noem. \"It\u2019s a heavy weight that sits on you every single day.\"\nShe also addressed a website that works to expose the identities of ICE agents, who typically cover their faces to protect themselves and their families from retribution. According to Noem, the website has led to direct threats against agents and their loved ones.\n\"They\u2019re talking about kidnapping their families. They\u2019re going after their colleagues,\" she said. \"It\u2019s extremely dangerous, and the rhetoric has to stop.\"\nNoem defended ICE\u2019s broader mission and said attacks against officers won\u2019t deter their work. She pointed to the agency\u2019s role in tracking down thousands of missing migrant children who entered through the Biden-era sponsorship program. Many, she said, were exploited by abusers.\n\"These ICE officers are patriots,\" she said. \"They\u2019re going out every day and making our streets safer.\"\nThe DHS secretary urged Americans to support ICE agents during the period of unrest.\n\"If you know a law enforcement officer, go today and thank them,\" Noem said. \"Cook their family a meal, go support them, and go talk about it on social media or go have their backs.\""
