  "title": "'Alien: Earth' Begins With Crucial Context and Constant Chaos",
  "description": "Sydney Chandler, Timothy Olyphant, and Alex Lawther star in the FX series created by Noah Hawley, which debuted this week.",
  "content": "There\u2019s a moment in the second episode of Alien: Earth where everything changes in an instant. The show you think you are watching, about a crashed ship and some weird hybrids, becomes the show you\u2019ve always wanted to see. One of the most iconic creatures in film history makes its debut on your TV screen, it\u2019s slow-motion, and it\u2019s glorious. From there, things only get more interesting, more disgusting, and more awesome. It\u2019s off to the races.\n\nThe first two episodes of Noah Hawley\u2019s Alien: Earth premiered this week, and we\u2019re going to be here with you all season to break it down. The show\u2019s arrival is the culmination of years of curiosity and anxiety, especially for fans of the Alien franchise. Alien on Earth? How would that work? Would the show feel like an Alien movie? How can we care without Ripley? Well, in the show\u2019s first episode, Hawley erases all of that by giving you a ton of fascinating context and potential. Then, in the second episode, he blends those with the wild, horror-driven chaos Alien fans know and crave. By the end, we\u2019re left gasping for air, dying to see where it all goes next. Let\u2019s recap, shall we?\n\nFrom the first moments of \u201cNeverland,\u201d the premiere episode of Alien: Earth, you know you\u2019re in good hands. The slow, methodical title reveal, directly inspired by the original films, shows both a reverence for the material as well as an ability to evolve with it. We meet the crew of USCSS Maginot, a deep-space research vessel owned by Weyland-Yutani, and in a very familiar scene of groggy space-travelers crowding around a dinner table, are hit with a ton of exposition about the world of the show. Paramount among these revelations is that five companies control the entire planet, with Weyland-Yutani only being one, and that this mission was about acquiring specimens. A mission that cost many, many lives. Then, to illustrate that, we enter another room in the ship, lovingly referred to as \u201cThe Zoo,\u201d and we see not just Facehuggers and eggs from the other movies, but all sorts of new, weird, creepy, crawly things.\n\nSo the show basically starts as an Alien movie. People wake up on a ship, they talk, and there are creatures. This is comfortable. This is good. But the episode is called \u201cNeverland,\u201d and we quickly pivot to something completely different, a remote research facility of another of those companies, Prodigy. It\u2019s run by a young trillionaire named Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), and we pick things up right as he\u2019s about to make history. He\u2019s about to transfer a human consciousness into a synthetic body, basically defeating death. That human is a young girl named Marcy, who we see to be kind, sweet, and empathetic. She\u2019s sick, though, and in her new body, sickness won\u2019t be a thing. She chooses a new name for herself, Wendy, as per Boy\u2019s obsession with Peter Pan.\n\nWendy (Sydney Chandler) is still Marcy on the inside, but not the outside. On the outside, she\u2019s fast, strong, and potentially immortal. She discusses some of that with Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant), a fellow synthetic being, and Dame Sylvia (Essie Davis), one of the scientists responsible for the procedure. Wendy then learns more kids are coming to join her, and she\u2019s to act as their big sister, easing them into the obviously terrifying notion of leaving their mortal bodies. Here, Hawley is setting up a whole new world for us, ripe with philosophical implications. Are these beings human? What is their potential? What are their limits? And what are the larger implications of life if there is no more death?\n\nAll questions for another moment because things need to get going. Hawley channels David Fincher\u2019s camerawork from Alien 3 to let us know that some terrible things have happened on the Maginot. People are dead, creatures are out, and the ship\u2019s security officer, a cyborg named Morrow (Babou Ceesay), relays this information to Weyland-Yutani. Even as he dooms one of his shipmates by not allowing her access to his secure cabin, the only priority for Morrow is getting the specimens to the company. That final shipmate subsequently gets torn apart by the now fully grown xenomorph, which then almost gets Morrow too before he hides in a special compartment.\n\nAs the Maginot zooms towards Earth, we meet the show\u2019s other main character, Joe (Alex Lawther). Joe is Wendy\u2019s older brother, and she, through some mysterious power no one at Prodigy can figure out, has been accessing and manipulating cameras to spy on him. Whether or not that attachment to her brother is a good thing is up for debate among the powers that be. Joe is a medic working in the military of Prodigy, and after he tells his friends that a request for transfer has been denied, the Maginot crashes into the city. Joe and the team immediately jump into action, gearing up and heading to help survivors.\n\nWendy sees this on her screens and has a wild idea. Prodigy should send her and her fellow multi-billion-dollar immortal children to the crash site to help. This moment seems wildly out of place and forced for many reasons, but the biggest one is they\u2019re kids. What do they know about military movements or rescue missions? And the other characters all tell Boy this over and over. Wendy only wants to go because her brother is in peril. Even so, the trillionaire agrees to her plan. He wants to see what his new toys can do.\n\nBack at the crash site, we watch multiple teams go deeper and deeper into the ship. We see how it has smashed through a skyscraper to create a deep hole of danger. Morrow escapes his hatch and reports back to Weyland-Yutani that he\u2019s going to try and secure the cargo despite the soldiers boarding the ship. Joe\u2019s group and a few others walk around too. Each finds signs that some very, very bad things happened, including one cryochamber where a guy has a hole in his chest. (\u201cUh-oh,\u201d thinks every Alien fan.) Two others enter a lab that has lots of creatures still in containment, but not all of them. Two massive insect-looking creatures slip into their clothes, later emerging to suck the blood out of their bodies, killing them.\n\nAs the episode comes to an end, Kirsh talks to Wendy about the differences between humanity and their kind. But Wendy doesn\u2019t want to hear any of it. She tells Kirsh that, no matter what she has to do, her brother will survive. She\u2019s cheated death; she now wants to do the same for him.\n\nSince FX gave us two episodes to start things off, instead of breaking things down after episode one, let\u2019s dive right into episode two and save the minutiae for after. Episode two of Alien: Earth is called \u201cMr. October,\u201d both a direct reference to the episode\u2019s inclusion of baseball Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, and a broader scope term for a hero stepping up to the challenge when it\u2019s most needed. Both Wendy and Joe fit that bill in the episode, which makes sense, because the term was taught to them by their father, who we meet in several flashbacks and yes, is played by series creator Noah Hawley himself.\n\nAlso, the beginning of \u201cMr. October\u201d establishes something very cool about the series. Instead of some kind of \u201cPreviously on Alien: Earth\u201d montage, the show replays those moments during the slow, methodical title reveal. It\u2019s a fun way to both suck us right back into the show and give us a few brief reminders of what to remember as the story moves forward.\n\nAs Joe and his team dive deeper into the crash site, learning more and more about the horrors that befell the crew, Boy and Sylvia have a discussion back at Prodigy. He explains that he didn\u2019t create Wendy and the other hybrids to cheat death and sell immortality. That\u2019s certainly a benefit, but not the main reason. He\u2019s an unparalleled genius and simply wants to meet someone who blows his mind. Someone who is smarter than him. And, he hopes, by mixing a human being with a supercomputer, maybe he\u2019ll achieve that. Sylvia seems skeptical about the claim, but the conversation is ripe with foreshadowing, not just of why he let the kids go to the crash site, but of what Wendy and his new family might become.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true in light of what we see later. A day before the crash, we learn that Wendy was spying on her brother remotely as always. He was at an office and asked a government robot for an early exit from his military job so he could go to college on Mars. But, fearing she\u2019d lose him, Wendy manipulates the code of the robot from thousands of miles away, denying his claim. She even makes it retort with an inside joke she and he shared from an Ice Age movie, which confuses him amid the disappointment. The Prodigy scientists are blown away by this because they have no idea how she did it. The next day, when he\u2019s forced to deal with the crash, Wendy feels guilty about it. She kept her brother in his job and caused him to be in this dangerous situation. This informs not just her seemingly random request to go to the crash, but Boy Kavalier\u2019s even more surprising agreement with her. He saw her do something he\u2019s never seen before, and he wants to see what else she\u2019s capable of.\n\nWhich brings us all the way back to 1,500 words ago and the first paragraph of this piece. The moment it all changes. Joe and his friends continue to search the crash when he senses something above him. Slowly, out of the dark, emerges the xenomorph, and it chases Joe across the giant pit at the center of the structure. It\u2019s here when, after all the thoughts of crashes, hybrid beings, and humanity, we were reminded this is an Alien show. And Alien is awesome.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that continues through the rest of the episode as the creature chases Joe up and down the building. At one point, it gleefully massacres a costume party. The next, it obliterates a group of soldiers. In both instances, the xenomorph leaves gallons of blood, guts, and exploded body parts everywhere. In a show that seemed so quiet and introspective at the start, it was wholly surprising and awesome to get some real, gross, Alien carnage. We absolutely loved it.\n\nWhen Wendy and the kids reach the crash site, she immediately starts hearing something. Something no one else hears. When she then abandons her team to go find her brother, it only intensifies. As Wendy and Slightly (Adarsh Gourav) go after Joe, Kirsh and the rest of the group dive deeper into the ship. They discover numerous other alien species, including an incredibly creepy eyeball octopus that jumps on your face, sucks out your eye, and then takes over your body. Or, at least that\u2019s what it appeared to do to the cat it had infected and what it tried to do to Nibs (Lily Newmark), another of Wendy\u2019s siblings.\n\nAfter a second encounter with the xenomorph, including a very cinematic slow-motion jump over a gaudy chandelier, Joe is about to die. But, he\u2019s saved by Morrow, who has finally caught up to one of the specimens he and his crew found in space, and he is supposed to reacquire for the company. We even get a glimpse of how he and those soldiers were probably able to neutralize these creatures, by using electricity to freeze them and then a weird, organic net gun to trap them. The net doesn\u2019t hold, of course, as the xeno escapes and kills a bunch of other soldiers, but Joe survives and Wendy finally finds him.\n\nKirsh wants Wendy and Slightly to head to the front of the ship, where they\u2019ve discovered there are a bunch of eggs in storage (\u201cUh-oh,\u201d thinks every Alien fan), so Wendy convinces Joe to go with them. On the way, Slightly lets it slip that she is his sister, which Joe doesn\u2019t understand. He buried his sister. But, we learn, her dad agreed to donate her to Prodigy to save her life. It just had to be kept a secret. Joe is scared and skeptical, but after asking a few hyper-specific questions only his little sister would know, he gives in. We\u2019ve only been with these characters for two episodes, but it was still an incredibly touching, heartfelt moment. A moment that\u2019s very quickly taken from them when the xeno returns and seemingly smashes Joe down into the building. Wendy decides she\u2019ll go after him and that\u2019s the episode.\n\nThe first two episodes of Alien: Earth are incredibly dense but also very entertaining. Each is filled with interesting ideas and possibilities, plus lots of gross, creature horror. We also begin to see how this is all going to weave together. Corporations fighting over these creatures. Wendy and the hybrids exploring themselves and these other creatures. Creatures that, like themselves, are not of this world. Plus, a brother and sister reunite under impossible circumstances. Sign us the heck up for six more weeks of Alien: Earth.\n\nHere\u2019s where we\u2019re going to mention a few things that didn\u2019t quite fit into the flow of the story above but were worth noting.\n\u2022 We love all the winks back to the original Alien movies. Clearly, the whole Magniot scenario is Ridley Scott\u2019s original, but Joe and the Prodigy team being transported to the crash site was very James Cameron, and the show goes full Alien 3 a few times to show the POV of the xenomorph. It felt like just the right level of homage without being in your face.\n\u2022 Will we get to see what happened on the Magniot? The show obviously leaves it to the imagination but even without all the killer aliens and stuff, they set up some weird dynamics between the characters, especially with that other cyborg character, Mr. Tang.\n\u2022 Who else was creeped out by the long, lingering shot of the \u201cSee no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil\u201d sculpture on the wall at Prodigy? Clearly, we\u2019re supposed to be very, very skeptical of the ethics happening at this place.\n\u2022 Did you catch that Joe kept that Reggie Jackson ball? It was a subtle thing, but we think, speaks to his character. He\u2019s a good guy, clearly, but not infallible. If the owner of a huge piece of baseball history has just been cut in half by a killer alien, sure, he\u2019s taking it.\n\u2022 Both episodes this week had a single shot of a man, in a full hazmat suit, powerwashing a wall at Prodigy. It is not connected to anything else so far but was obviously put in there for some reason. What could it be?\n\u2022 We loved the scene between Boy Kavalier and Yutani (Sandra Yi Sencindiver). Just two trillionaires, trying to outsmart one another, completely oblivious to the actual implications of what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s going to be fun to see how that corporate battle surrounding the crash and creatures plays out. Plus, do we think we learn how Yutani knew about the xenos?\n\u2022 What the hell is up with the giant pod creature hanging from the ceiling? It started to reveal itself, but then Tootles (Kit Young) left. We can\u2019t wait to find out.\n\u2022 Morrow mentioned that the xenomorph can sense fear. Is the true? How would he know that? That feels like a very interesting thread that could be explored.\n\u2022 Why is Marcy/Wendy special? Boy tells her she\u2019s special, and not just because she\u2019s the first human to be transferred. There are other reasons too, which is why he went and took her from her family. She must have something about her that made her an ideal candidate for this. What could it be?\n\nWhat did you think of the premiere of Alien: Earth? Let us know below.",

      "text": "It\u2019s clearly not some giant leap to say Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien is a masterpiece. That\u2019s simply been a factual statement since the day it opened. But as we get ready for the next Alien movie to hit theaters this summer, we decided to look back on the franchise to see if we could dive a little deeper. Find something new, or at least try. Here\u2019s what we came up with.\nThese days, we consider Alien to be both one of the best sci-fi and maybe even horror movies of all time. Which, clearly, it is. But I also think it should be considered one of the greatest mysteries of all time. Mystery and intrigue are the engine that keeps things going in the film well before an alien pops out of a man\u2019s chest and wreaks bloody havoc.\nThe whole film moves and is built around creating questions. Questions that are then answered with answers that provide more questions. It starts when we see the crew of the Nostromo wake up. We wonder why they are waking up, what life is like on the ship, and more. Those questions are answered when it\u2019s revealed a mysterious message has been detected and they have been tasked to investigate. Who sent that message? Why did they send it? Once they arrive on the mysterious planet, the crew discovers a massive alien spacecraft. Clearly, this is who sent the message but what the hell is this ship? Where did it come from? Who is on it?\nThings get taken to a whole other level once the crew boards the ship. They encounter a giant skeleton sitting in some mix of a chair and weapon fans would later name the Pilot. Who is this creature? How long has it been there? What was it doing? How did it die? Those questions, unlike most of the rest, never get answered because quickly things take a turn when Kane (John Hurt) encounters these equally fascinating eggs, only to open one and, well, we know what happens from there.\nScott\u2019s focus on mystery extends to the filmmaking techniques too. The film opens with his camera slowly exploring the Nostromo, almost like a person quietly sneaking around looking for something specific. That camera move is copied again after the Facehugger lets go of Kane and Ash (Ian Holm) is dissecting it. The sets themselves are also created like a maze, with multiple levels, tunnels, nooks, and crannies everywhere, each one piquing curiosity in unique ways. Characters are often viewed in shadow, the music is always moody and contemplative, everything is slow and deliberate.\nOnce the alien bursts out of Kane\u2019s chest, the film certainly shifts, but still maintains its identity. The narrative mysteries are merely replaced by the structure of a typical murder mystery as the creature picks off each crew member one by one like something out of an Agatha Christie novel. Is it a traditional murder mystery structure? No, especially since we know who the killer is and what they look like. But that\u2019s just a unique way to give it a fresh approach while also raising tension and anticipation.\nEventually, the film tees up one final, major mystery to be solved, which is how and why the Nostromo ended up with the creature in the first place. We learn the company, later revealed to be Weyland-Yutani, ordered the android Ash to find and return it, even at the expense of the lives of the crew. The revelation is painful and shocking for the remaining characters but delicious for the audience. It\u2019s such a ruthless directive that we both hate everything about it but also simply need to know more. What does the company think this creature will do? How did they find out about it? And what do they expect to happen if the mission is a success?\nScott\u2019s film has no interest in those answers. Instead, like so many great sci-fi films of the era, it leaves those to the imagination in favor of character and story. Which, obviously, Alien has in every single frame. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a masterpiece. But watching it again, thinking about the new film coming out, we couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the specific ways Alien draws us in and hasn\u2019t let go in over four decades.\nWatch Alien now on Hulu. The new film, Alien: Romulus, opens August 16.\nCorrection 2:15 p.m.: We called the skeleton the \u201cEngineer\u201d in our original post, which is a Prometheus term not Alien. That\u2019s been updated.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "A good movie is one you enjoy the first time you watch it. A great movie is one you find joy in dozens of viewings later. For me, James Cameron\u2019s Aliens is not just a great movie, it\u2019s an incredible movie, and though I\u2019ve seen it so many times over the years, I sat down to watch it again for its upcoming 35th anniversary to see if, or how, it could reward me yet again. Not only did it do that, it spoke to me in a way I never expected, and it has to do with my late mom.\nMy first memories of Aliens are all about my mom, Nancy. A few years after the film was released, I\u2019d of course heard about it and wanted to see it. When it finally came on HBO, probably eight or nine-year-old me told my mom I wanted to watch it and she said she wasn\u2019t sure it was appropriate. So, she said, she\u2019d watch it first and let me know if I could see it. I think it was on at 9 or 10 p.m. one night and as I went to bed, I anxiously awaited the morning to get the verdict. \u201cCan I see Aliens?\u201d was the first thing I asked when I woke up and my mom said \u201cAbsolutely not. That was way too scary.\u201d She hated it, was terrified by it, but watched it anyway because she knew it was important to me. She caved eventually, and I probably saw it soon after, but having that maternal instinct hovering over my first memories of the film is why, to me, Aliens, resonated much more this time around.\nThe film is way more than an entertaining, smart way to make a sequel from a classic, which is what one urban myth would like you to believe is what happened. The myth goes like this: before he made the film, writer/director James Cameron walked into a conference room at 20th Century Fox, wrote the word \u201cAlien\u201d on a whiteboard, gave it a second, then added an \u201cS.\u201d Then he put two lines through it making it a dollar sign. Whether or not that story is true, a) I\u2019d like to believe it is, and b) it\u2019s an excellent surface reading of Aliens.\nIn its most basic form, Aliens is the perfect, quintessential sequel. It takes everything you knew and loved about the first movie, flips it on its head, and makes it bigger. (For years, I thought it made it better too, but these days, I think the original holds that title.) And yet, besides the fact the film has more aliens, more humans, more guns, and bigger stakes, Aliens sits in that pantheon of perfect sequels because of its humanity and its portrayal of the strongest of human bonds.\nAs the film begins, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is dealing with a lot. She\u2019s been in hyper sleep for almost six decades and hasn\u2019t really had the time to process that. Plus, she\u2019s still grappling with the fact that what seems like just days ago for her, a mysterious alien killed her entire crew and she was forced to destroy it and the ship she was on. She has nightmares about it every night and the corporate executives who owned that ship don\u2019t actually believe her. She also finds out dozens of families are now on LV-426, the planet where she and her crew found that alien, which fills her with dread and guilt. She may have defeated one alien, but it seems very likely there could be more. Basically, she\u2019s deeply, psychologically traumatized. (Side note: I rewatched the theatrical version because that\u2019s what was released 35 years ago but it\u2019s worth noting the extended Special Edition adds in the revelation that during Ripley\u2019s extended hypersleep her daughter back on Earth had passed away, which only bolsters this characterization.)\nEventually\u2014with the promise of a new job\u2014Ripley begrudgingly decides to go back to LV-426, save the families in danger, and destroy all the aliens. This time though she\u2019s not going with just a few crew members. She\u2019s going with the Colonial Marines, an elite team of space soldiers who, over the course of the film, become a new family for Ripley. She fosters relationships with them and, ultimately, mutual respect which makes the fact that very quickly upon landing the majority of the Marines are wiped out even more devastating. There\u2019s also the later revelation that all of the promises made to Ripley before the trip were lies and the only reason everyone went is to bring an alien home for experimentation, just like in the original movie.\nBut then something changes. Ripley and the Marines find Newt (Carrie Henn), a young girl who seems to be the lone survivor of the apparent massacre that happened on the planet. Finding survivors isn\u2019t what the Marines are there for but it\u2019s Ripley\u2019s reason for living. She\u2019s a protector at heart and very quickly her maternal instincts, which we\u2019d previously seen directed at Jonesy the cat, come out. Aliens goes from being a movie about Marines destroying monsters to about a mother protecting a young girl who she begins to see as a daughter. Beyond just the anti-corporate subtext and blossoming familial relationship, basically everything about the movie is excellent: the cast of supporting characters (Al Matthews as Apone! Bill Paxton as Hudson! Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez! Michael Biehn as Hicks!), the surprising evil mastermind (Paul Reiser as Burke), the huge action set pieces, the constant humor, quotable dialogue, all of it. But it\u2019s Ripley and Newt who make the film work so well all these years later.\nAs the film reaches its climax and Ripley can get off the planet, she decides to stay and risk everything for Newt\u2014which is also the point where Ripley discovers the Alien Queen, a character who, like Ripley, wants to protect her children. That means the film\u2019s final battle between Ripley and the Queen is really the fight between two mothers who will stop at nothing to protect their families. Ripley wins, of course, and if you weren\u2019t quite convinced this thread was the beating heart of the film, Newt calls Ripley \u201cMommy\u201d for the first time. It\u2019s a beautifully touching moment in the midst of all the goo and gore. The film then ends with both Newt and Ripley agreeing they can dream again, a signifier they\u2019re beginning to deal with the trauma. As they go to (hyper) sleep, what has previously been such a bombastic, militaristic score by James Horner plays out like a lullaby, letting the mother and daughter finally sleep. And dream.\nSome of you might be reading this and thinking, much like Cameron\u2019s \u201c$,\u201d this is a fairly obvious reading of Aliens. And you\u2019d be right. I\u2019m not pretending like I\u2019m the one who finally cracked the code after 35 years. In that time though I\u2019d usually key more into anticipation for the action, humor, and violence instead of the mother/child relationship. Which brings me back to Nancy.\nLast year, I lost my mom to a long battle with breast cancer. Though I don\u2019t remember exactly when I first saw Aliens, I do remember when I didn\u2019t see it, and it was the day after she watched it. My mom was protecting me from the nightmares a young child definitely would have had watching the film at that age. Now, 35 years later, I realize my late mom was trying to shelter me from it. To protect me from any potential trauma watching this intense, scary movie might have caused. It\u2019s that personal subtext, 16 months removed from my mom\u2019s passing, that really helped punctuate the emotion Cameron put into the film in a way it hasn\u2019t before. She was my Ripley. I was her Newt.\nMy mom never protected me from any killer aliens (that I know of) but always wanted the best for me and fostered everything I am today. From always taking me to the movies as a kid, to helping me get a job at a video store in high school, to supporting a college education where I primarily studied film\u2014she always supported me on my road ahead, toward a future where I write about movies every day. Like Ripley and Newt, we too dreamed together.\nWhen I sat down to rewatch Aliens last week, I didn\u2019t expect it to turn into this. But, ultimately, that\u2019s what the great movies do. They forge personal relationships with you and evolve in different ways every time you watch them\u2014and Aliens is certainly a great movie, one that might be best known for its action, but is truly unforgettable because of how much it\u2019s concerned with a mother\u2019s relationship with a child. Aliens was first released July 18, 1986, which means it\u2019s celebrating its 35th anniversary on Sunday. You can watch it on Amazon or, likely, your personal collection.\nWondering where our RSS feed went? You can pick the new up one here."

Nia DaCosta (who most recently helmed the revival of Candyman) is directing the film.\nIn the finale of Ms. Marvel season one, Carol Danvers showed up in Kamala Khan\u2019s bedroom, marking the first real tease of the film. The film release date change came with a poster. Most recently the teaser trailer dropped and here\u2019s our breakdown of everything we saw.\nUpcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe Release Dates\nSecret Invasion\nRelease date: June 21 (On Disney+)\nThis series picks up storylines from both Captain Marvel and Spider-Man: Far From Home to explain the decades-long Skrull invasion of Earth.

Hiddleston confirmed \u201cthe whole cast\u201d of Loki\u2019s first season will return for season two on an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live. In December, we got a very, very brief tease of season two.\nEcho\nRelease date: November 29, 2023 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from the Hawkeye series will follow Echo, a deaf martial artist, as played by actress Alaqua Cox. Devery Jacobs (Reservation Dogs) co-stars. Echo officially began filming on May 24, according to a tweet by series creator Marion Dayre. According to James Clement on an episode of the Weekly Planet podcast, both Vincent D\u2019Onofrio and Charlie Cox are set to return for the Echo series at Disney+.\nThe series was recently announced along with Ironheart, Agatha Coven of Chaos and What If season 2 as potentially moving to 2024.\nX-Men \u201897\nRelease date: Fall 2023 (On Disney+)\nThe X-Men are coming to the MCU\u2026 kinda. X-Men \u201897 is a revival of the classic \u201890s animated show, bringing back the same style, stories and yes, theme song, of the iconic series. (See more: X-Men \u201897 Looks Like a Nostalgic Blast From the Past)\nIronheart\nRelease date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nWith Tony Stark gone, the MCU needs a new super-genius inventor. Enter teenage prodigy Riri Williams (played by Dominique Thorne), who creates a brand new, ultra-advanced armored suit. Other cast members include Anthony Ramos (In the Heights) as the villain the Hood and Lyric Ross (This Is Us). Chinaka Hodge (TNT\u2019s Snowpiercer) is attached as the head writer, and Black Panther director Ryan Coogler is an executive producer alongside Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige and others. Manny Montana (Good Girls) has joined the cast of Marvel\u2019s Ironheart in an undisclosed role as well as Han Solo himself, Alden Ehrenreich.\nAgatha: Coven of Chaos\nRelease date: Winter 2024 (On Disney+)\nThis spinoff from WandaVision will star Kathryn Hahn as her fan-favorite character Agatha Harkness. Joe Locke (Heartstopper) and Aubrey Plaza (Hahn\u2019s Parks and Recreation co-star, among her other many credits) are also in the cast, as is Patti LuPone. (A second WandaVision spin-off, this one focusing on Paul Bettany\u2019s Vision, is also reportedly in the works.)\nCaptain America: Brave New World\nRelease date: August 26, 2024 (in Theaters)\nWe\u2019ve got a new Captain America, so it was inevitable that we\u2019d be getting a new Cap movie. Anthony Mackie will appear in the title role. Harrison Ford was announced to take over the role of General Thaddeus Ross and will make his debut in this release.\nDaredevil: Born Again\nRelease date: Spring 2024 (On Disney+)\nCharlie Cox and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio will return as Daredevil and Kingpin for an 18-episode Disney+ series.

Things remain uncertain for Foggy and Karen.\nThunderbolts\nRelease date: December 20, 2024 (In theaters)\nMarvel Studios is readying a movie based on the comic Thunderbolts and director Jake Schreier has been tapped to bring it to life. This film marks the end of Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Steven Yeun (Nope) signed on for an undisclosed role\nBlade\nRelease date: February 14, 2025 (In theaters)\nDisney hasn\u2019t revealed much about this reboot of the franchise that features a badass vampire-hunter who is also a vampire, but we know that it stars two-time Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, who also played Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes in Netflix Marvel series Luke Cage. We also know Blade appeared (or at least his voice did) in the end credits of The Eternals. After losing director Bassam Tariq, who would have been the first U.S.-Pakistani person to helm a Marvel Studios film, Blade was put on pause, and its release date was shifted. But now it has a new director in place: Lovecraft Country\u2019s Yann Demange, as well as a writer in Michael Starrbury, so the September 2024 date looks ever more likely.\nDeadpool 3\nRelease date: May 3, 2024 (In Theaters)\nRyan Reynolds\u2019 \u201cmerc with the mouth\u201d is set to appear in Disney\u2019s first R-rated film following the company\u2019s completed acquisition of Fox assets. Oh, and did you happen to hear that Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine is also appearing in this one? Unless you are cut off from all social media, you no doubt caught that announcement.\nDeadpool 3 writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick spoke with Den of Geek about how Deadpool\u2019s move to the MCU will not affect the feel of the movie. Or, in Wernick\u2019s words: \u201cDeadpool\u2019s gonna be Deadpool.\u201d Reese also said that Disney has been more than willing to ensuring the franchise keeps its core identity. Shawn Levy (Free Guy) is directing.\nFantastic Four\nRelease date: May 2, 2025 (In theaters)\nPhase Six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, kicks off with the MCU debut of Marvel\u2019s most famous family. Jon Watts was scheduled to directbut he is no longer doing that\u2014Matt Shakaman of WandaVision is now in the chair\u2014and though we saw John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, there\u2019s no guarantee he returns.\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\nRelease date: May 1, 2026 (In theaters)\nSince neither Phase Four or Phase Five ended with Avengers movies, Phase Six will end with two, back to back. The first is The Kang Dynasty, a title which heavily suggests that Kang (Jonathan Majors) will play a major role. Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi) will direct.\nAvengers: Secret Wars\nRelease date: May 7, 2027 (In theaters)\nIt all comes down to this. Phase Six, and the whole Phase 4-6 arc of the Multiverse Saga, ends with Secret Wars. We don\u2019t know anything about the plot other than the comics that the title is based on; Marvel veteran Michael Waldron (Loki, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) is writing the script.\nArmor Wars\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nThis project\u2014originally slated for a Disney+ series, but now getting the feature film treatment\u2014will follow James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as he tracks down stolen tech that allows criminals to replicate Iron Man technology.\nAlso: Marvel slotted several other projects for Phase Six that take place alongside Fantastic Four and the Avengers films. There are two in fall 2024, two in winter 2024, one in winter 2025, two in spring 2025 and two in summer 2025. Some of those are probably\u2026\nUnscheduled But Probably Still Happening Shows & Movies\nMoon Knight Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMoon Knight himself, Oscar Isaac, was recently spotted in Egypt and teased that a second season of his show could be on the way. Marvel and Disney have yet to confirm.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThis new animated show is loosely spun out from a breakout episode of What If? that saw MCU heroes battling a zombie apocalypse.\nSpider-Man: Freshman Year\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nDisney says this new animated series follows Peter Parker \u201con his way to becoming Spider-Man in the MCU, with a journey unlike we\u2019ve ever seen and a style that celebrates the character\u2019s early comic book roots.\u201d\nWhat if\u2026? Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nThe speculative animated series and its omnipresent narrator the Watcher will return with an all-new season. The show\u2019s creators say next season will focus on new stories, new heroes, and \u201clots of fun.\u201d Though the trailer still hasn\u2019t been released, the Marvel Animation Panel at San Diego Comic Con revealed some Phase 4 characters that will be in the show.\nUntitled Wakanda Series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nNot much is known yet about this show set in Black Panther\u2019s home country.\nUntitled Shang-Chi sequel\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nShang-Chi\u2019s debut movie was compelling, exciting and fun. It also made a ton of money, so a sequel is inevitable. That the film\u2019s director is making Avengers: The Kang Dynasty does throw it into limbo a bit.\nUntitled Wonder Man series\nRelease date: Unknown (On Disney+)\nMarvel Studios has announced that it\u2019s moving ahead with a Wonder Man series. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton is attached to helm and Brooklyn 99 writer Andrew Guest (who also produced Hawkeye) is on board to showrun the series. On October 31, the title star was announced: genre favorite Yayha Abdul-Mateen II.\nUntitled mutants movie\nRelease date: Unknown (In theaters)\nNow that Disney owns the old Fox assets that included all the \u201cmutant\u201d Marvel superheroes, you can very likely count on characters like the X-Men making an MCU debut.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "When the idea was first floated of bringing the iconic Alien franchise to TV, many were skeptical. Films such as Ridley Scott\u2019s 1979 original and James Cameron\u2019s 1986 sequel are all-time classics. Follow-ups, like David Fincher\u2019s 1992 film and Scott\u2019s 2012 return, were also noteworthy for their own reasons. Alien just felt like a franchise that had been very well-explored already and could only be damaged in translation to a different medium.\nWell, I am elated to report that any skeptics, myself included, were beyond wrong. Alien: Earth is not just a worthy addition to the Alien franchise; it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened to it since James Cameron\u2019s Aliens. The show is an imaginative, surprising, and fascinating evolution of the franchise in every single way. Creator Noah Hawley somehow found a perfect balance of everything we know and love about Alien, combined it with new, wild perspectives on those preconceptions, and then centered it around an emotional, riveting human tale. Alien: Earth is an excellent show that is both worthy of the Alien franchise and also makes the entire thing immeasurably more interesting. The Alien franchise is better today than it was yesterday thanks to Alien: Earth.\nio9 saw six of season one\u2019s eight total episodes, and after watching them, we are extremely confident those final two won\u2019t change any of this. The story is too rich, the twists and turns too fun, and the scares too perfect to get messed up. We can\u2019t wait to see where it all goes and to explore everything about it, all season long.\nSet three years before the events of the first Alien, the inciting incident of Alien: Earth is when a Weyland-Yutani ship, the USCSS Maginot, crashes into a city run by a corporation called Prodigy. While all the Alien movies have had their plots based on some kind of Earth story, we never actually saw what was happening on Earth, and this show takes that concept and runs with it. On the show, Earth is run by five mega corporations, two of which are Weyland-Yutani and Prodigy, and when the Weyland-Yutani ship crashes in Prodigy territory, all bets are off.\nThat\u2019s especially true because the Maginot is not a normal ship. It\u2019s a deep space research vessel that has been away for 65 years collecting alien creatures to bring back to Earth for study. One of those, of course, is the xenomorph. But there are others too, some of which are even grosser and creepier. And, if you\u2019ve seen an Alien movie, we bet you can figure out how a ship full of killer creatures ended up crashing into Earth instead of landing safely. (Which the show at first teases, and later explores in an episode that\u2019s akin to its own Alien movie.)\nAll of this, however, is merely set dressing for the main story of Alien: Earth. That\u2019s the story of Wendy (Sydney Chandler), a hybrid person created by Prodigy. Prodigy, and the other companies, are in a race to figure out immortality, and Prodigy has innovated technology that transfers the consciousness and memories of a child into a superior, mechanic body. Wendy is the first, but she\u2019s followed by others, and their childlike wonder and curiosity factor into them being sent to the Maginot crash to aid in the rescue efforts. That Wendy\u2019s brother Hermit (Alex Lawther from Andor) is there is also a big part of it, especially since he thinks his sister is dead.\nAnd while that super compelling story of cyborgs, hybrids, and immortality is always present, Alien: Earth never loses sight of the fact it\u2019s an Alien show. The xenomorph, and the other creatures, are slightly tangential at the start but very quickly become crucial to the plot. That, in turn, then leads to lots and lots of scary, bloody, Alien-worthy scenes. Also, by having aliens actually make it back to Earth, we get to see almost an Alien fan\u2019s fantasy of what these companies would actually do if these creatures were returned safely. Everything in the movies was always just about Weyland-Yutani getting a xenomorph back to Earth, but it never happened. Here, we learn it has happened, and those stories are some of the most satisfying, shocking, and awesome moments in the series. Alien: Earth might technically be a prequel to the movies, but it delivers in ways the movies never do.\nAs this is all happening, Hawley also makes sure every inch of every frame screams \u201cAlien.\u201d Wires are exploding from everywhere. Chains with hooks hang down from the ceilings. Plenty of blinking monitors and broken crates illuminate spaces. Everything has this almost gooey, gross feeling about it. That even extends to the characters, such as the head of Prodigy Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), a \u201cboy genius\u201d trillionaire who sees major opportunities when the Maginot crashes into his city. There\u2019s also Kavalier\u2019s synthetic sidekick Kirsch, played by Timothy Olyphant, who is supposed to be trustworthy but always has that whiff of something being wrong with him. We are constantly on our toes around these slimy characters, and it adds even more drama and mystery.\nThe heart of the show, though, once you get past the xenomorphs, is Wendy. Putting this superheroic robot, who has the mind and demeanor of a child, at the center of the action adds an extremely unique and profound feel to the whole show. She\u2019s loveable, she\u2019s sweet, she can rip your head off in two seconds, and she can jump off cliffs without a scratch. As we watch her struggle with her new body, her emotions, her past, and eventually these creatures, we\u2019re watching not just this fascinating, layered character; we\u2019re watching a megastar be born in Chandler. She\u2019s incredible.\nAlien: Earth is incredible too. It took this self-proclaimed, lifelong Alien super fan on a ride unlike anything I\u2019d been on in years. I was left completely entertained, wholly engaged, and desperate to learn more about everything in this world. There are scares, surprises, and a story that keeps you wanting more and more. Best of all, all of it can, and will, be derailed at any time by a well-placed Facehugger, a Chestburster, or one of those giant, acid-for-blood monsters.\nAlien: Earth debuts with a two-part premiere August 12 on both Hulu and FX and will continue each Tuesday after that. Episodes drop at 8 p.m. EST on Hulu and 8 p.m. EST/PST on FX. Don\u2019t miss it.\nCorrection: An original version of this article misnamed the ship from the show as the USS Maginot. It\u2019s actually the USCSS Maginot, which has been updated. We also added more specifics about when episodes air.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "The DC Extended Universe is finally giving Marvel a run for its money\u2014something that\u2019s bound to increase now that James Gunn is running the show. The DCEU\u2019s myriad projects stretch far beyond superhero mainstays Batman, Superman, and the Justice League, promising to include new and interesting takes on DC Comics\u2019 enormous stable of characters.\nWhat follows is an up-to-date list of everything DCEU-related that\u2019s on the way: DC movies heading to theaters, as well as DC streaming movies and shows coming to Max.\nLast updated 8/23/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next DC Movie?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\nRelease date: December 20 (in theaters)\nDirector James Wan returns for the next adventure following Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) as the newly crowned King of Atlantis. Now in his new role, Arthur will explore more of the world under the sea while also dealing with new threats from Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and others. Like Shazam 2, Aquaman 2 has endured its share of release-date changes, with its new Christmas 2023 date designed to give Wan and company ample time to complete all the necessary special effects.\nUpcoming DC Movie Release Dates\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\nRelease date: October 4, 2024 (in theaters)\nTodd Phillips never saw his Joker movie as anything but a singular film. But over a billion dollars at the box office and an Oscar for Best Actor (for star Joaquin Phoenix) obviously changed things. We have a few nuggets of info so far: the title is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux(French for \u201cshared madness\u201d), Phoenix is returning and will co-star with Lady Gaga (who\u2019s playing Harley Quinn), Zazie Beetz is probably returning as Arthur Fleck\u2019s neighbor, and\u2026 it\u2019s likely going to be a musical? Filming wrapped in early April 2023.\nThe Batman 2\nRelease date: 2025 (in theaters)\nHot off the success of Matt Reeves\u2019 long-awaitedThe Batman, everyone involved made it clear that wasn\u2019t a one-and-done. Robert Pattinson\u2019s Batman will be back. Will he face off with the Joker? It\u2019s possible but not definitive. You\u2019d imagine the Penguin and Catwoman could be back too. We don\u2019t know much yet about this one, but we do know it won\u2019t be arriving until 2025.\nCurrent DC Shows\nDoom Patrol Season 4, Part 2\nRelease date: TBD 2023 (on Max)\nThe fourth and final season of Doom Patrol\u2014starring Brendan Fraser, Matt Bomer, Diane Guerrero, April Bowlby, Joivan Wade, Timothy Dalton, Skye Roberts, and Michelle Gomez\u2014already aired its first batch of episodes; the remaining six will return later this year.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows Without Release Dates\nThe Penguin\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nYou saw him in The Batman and now, Colin Farrell\u2019s Penguin is getting his own Max series. As of April 2023, the show is in production, with a cast that also includes Cristin Milioti, Rhenzy Feliz, Michael Kelly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Deirdre O\u2019Connell, with Clancy Brown and Michael Zegen recurring.\nPeacemaker Season 2\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nFrom the instant that opening credits scene rolled for the first time, DC fans and non-fans alike fell in love with Peacemaker. Well, he\u2019s coming back, still played by John Cena and still from the twisted mind of James Gunn. There\u2019s no word on when it\u2019ll happen but we\u2019re guessing 2024.\nSuperman: Legacy\nRelease date: July 11, 2025\nJames Gunn will write and direct this Superman movie, which is touted as not being an origin story. Casting announcements started with Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane, who\u2019ll be played by David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. We also know Isabela Merced will play Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi is Mister Terrific, and Nathan Fillion is a Green Lantern (Guy Gardner), as well as Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho.\nMore Upcoming DC Movies and Shows Announced for the Gunn/Safran Era\nThe shake-up at DC Studios got a huge zap of energy at the end of January, when James Gunn and Peter Safran announced their massive slate of planned projects. Little is known about most of these projects so far in terms of cast and crew and even release dates\u2014but we do have a few tidbits for each.\nCreature Commandos (An animated Max show) \u2013 A seven-episode animated series written by James Gunn himself. It stars Indira Varma (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Game of Thrones) as the Bride, who\u2019s the lead character, and Marvel veteran Frank Grillo as Rick Flagg Sr.\u2014father of Rick Flagg, played by Joel Kinnaman in The Suicide Squad. The rest of the cast includes David Harbour (Stranger Things) as Eric Frankenstein, Sean Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as G.I. Robot, Zoe Chao (The Afterparty) as Nina Mazursky, Alan Tudyk (Star Wars: Rogue One) as Dr. Phosphorus, Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as new character Princess Ilana Rostovic, and Peacemaker\u2019s Steve Agee and Sean Gunn returning as John Economos and Weasel, respectively.\nWaller (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Viola Davis will reprise her Suicide Squad character; the story will bring back characters from the Peacemaker show and tell a story with events set between Peacemaker seasons one and two.\nLanterns (A live-action Max show) \u2013 Set on Earth, this mystery series will follow Hal Jordan and John Stewart doing their thing as DC\u2019s \u201csuper cops.\u201d\nThe Authority (Theatrical film) \u2013 The Wildstorm superhero characters will make their big-screen debut in a film co-written by Gunn.\nParadise Lost (A live-action Max show) \u2013 How did Wonder Woman\u2019s world, Themyscira, come to be? Find out in this Game of Thrones-ish tale set before her birth.\nThe Brave and the Bold (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on the acclaimed Grant Morrison comic run, this will explore the story of Batman\u2019s son, Damien Wayne, and will feature \u201cother members of the extended Bat-family.\u201d\nBooster Gold (A live-action Max show) \u2013 The \u201closer from the future\u201d superhero character gets his own series.\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (Theatrical film) \u2013 Based on Tom King\u2019s comics run, this movie will explore how Supergirl is different from Superman. It\u2019s not yet certain if Sasha Calle, who plays Supergirl in The Flash, will reprise the role here.\nSwamp Thing (Theatrical film) \u2013 The character\u2019s \u201cdark origins\u201d will be the focus of this one. DC does horror! Rumored but not yet confirmed to be directing, James Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) told Collider that he\u2019s slated to write the script.\nUpcoming DC Movies and Shows That Were Once in Development, But Whose Fate Is Unclear in the Gunn/Safran Era\nTa-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams\u2019 Superman movie\nRelease date: Unknown (in theaters)\nThe news of Superman: Legacy cast uncertainty on this project from writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and producer J.J. Abrams. There hadn\u2019t been an update on this one in a while, but in late April, James Gunn himself told io9 that the two films don\u2019t necessarily cancel each other out: \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting movie \u2026 if it comes in and it\u2019s great \u2026 and if the timing is right, that could absolutely happen. That\u2019s totally unrelated. It would be an Elseworlds tale like Joker.\u201d\nMichael B. Jordan Superman Series\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nMichael B. Jordan was once developing a Superman take for Max as a limited series that would feature Val-Zod as opposed to Clark Kent. Again, there hasn\u2019t been an update in a while.\nStatic Shock\nRelease date: Unknown\nPart of the relaunch of the Milestone comic brand is this adaptation produced by, once again, Michael B. Jordan. A writer was hired back in 2021 to come up with a script and we haven\u2019t heard much since.\nJustice League Dark\nRelease date: Unknown (for Max)\nJ.J. Abrams was among the people involved with bringing this evil super-team to life and while there hasn\u2019t been a ton of movement on the project of late, it\u2019s been around long enough that we\u2019d imagine it happens eventually.\nMetal Men\nRelease date: Unknown\nOne of the more recent pre-Gunn/Safran DC films to go into development, this is this tale of six beings based on various powerful metals. It\u2019s from directors Ron Clements and John Musker (Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Moana), so if it happens, it\u2019ll have an incredible pedigree.\nZatanna\nRelease date: Unknown\nLast year, Emerald Fennell won an Oscar for writing Promising Young Woman. She followed that up landing the job to write this DC superhero flick about the young magician. Like most of the films in this section, there hasn\u2019t been movement in a while.\nHourman\nRelease date: Unknown\nYes, the hero who takes a drug that makes him a hero for an hour was, back in 2021, rumored to be in development. Whether or not that\u2019s still the case is unknown but we figured it was worth noting.\nUntitled Arkham Show\nRelease date: Unknown (on Max)\nIn addition to The Penguin, Matt Reeves has said he plans to expand the world of The Batman into Max shows. At one point, a series about Gotham PD was in the works, but now he says it might be more about the inner workings at Arkham Asylum. On October 25, The Staircase\u2019s Antonio Campos came aboard as a writer\u2014the third to hold that position on the potential series so far\u2014and may direct and serve as showrunner if the show happens, according to a report in Variety.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "Ridley Scott is never one to mince words. Just Google his name and you\u2019re likely to find the legendary director\u2019s hot takes on a variety of subjects, like extraterrestrials, Star Wars, and beyond. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to franchises he helped make famous like Blade Runner and Alien. So, with the first Alien TV show in the works, it\u2019s no surprise that Scott\u2019s opinion of it is decidedly spicy.\nLate last year, Disney confirmed that writer-director Noah Hawley was working on a brand new TV show based on the iconic Alien franchise. But, unlike the movies from Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, and others, which mostly take place on faraway planets or in space, Hawley\u2019s story will be set on Earth. \u201cThe alien stories are always trapped,\u201d he said earlier this year. \u201cTrapped in a prison, trapped in a space ship. I thought it would be interesting to open it up a little bit so that the stakes of \u2018What happens if you can\u2019t contain it?\u2019 are more immediate.\u201d\nWhich, hypothetically, sounds interesting since the Alien stories were largely about keeping the aliens away from Earth. Flipping that at least makes sense as a way to do something new and fresh. However, one person seems to disagree: Ridley Scott. \u201cIt\u2019ll never be as good as the first one,\u201d Scott told The Independent when asked for his opinion on the show. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll say.\u201d\nBy just saying that, Scott is obviously implying a lot. He\u2019s implying that he\u2019s not a fan of the idea or the show and that he feels his version of the franchise remains the best which, honestly,it pretty much does. In the same interview he even pointed out that having the xenomorph creature at the center of the story isn\u2019t necessarily what audiences want, using the example that his prequel Prometheus, which didn\u2019t center on xenomorphs (though one does appear), massively outgrossed Alien: Covenant, which did.\nNeither of those films are as good as the original either, so Scott\u2019s opinion on the show kind of applies to his own work as well. Nevertheless, anytime the director of Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, and The Martian talks, we love to listen.\nWondering where our RSS feed went? You can pick the new up one here."

      "text": "\u201cStar Wars! Nothing but Star Wars! Give me those Star Wars! Don\u2019t let them end\u2026\u201d Just as Bill Murray said it in 1978, we\u2019re still saying it today. Star Wars is everywhere these days, with multiple movies and TV shows in the works from Disney and Lucasfilm. This article will give you the most up-to-date Star Wars release dates so you know exactly when every new Star Wars movie or Disney+ show will arrive.\nWhat are the next three movies? What TV shows are coming up? Have any TV shows or movies been canceled? What are people saying about what\u2019s next? We\u2019ve got you covered on all things in a galaxy far, far away.\nThis post was last updated on 9/13/2023.\nWhat\u2019s the next Star Wars movie?\nSharmeen Obaid-Chioy\u2019s New Jedi Order Film Film\nRelease Date: TBD, but May 26, 2026, December 18, 2026 or December 17, 2027 (In Theaters)\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023 in London, Lucasfilm announced that three Star Wars movies are now in the works.\nJames Mangold (Indiana Jones 5) will direct a film 25,000 years before any known Star Wars timeline about the first Jedi to use the Force.\nDave Filoni will direct a film that\u2019s kind of the Star Wars Disney+ Avengers, telling the story of a climactic event meeting the stories of The Book of Boba Fett, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka and more in the time between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens.\nAnd Sharmeen Obaid-Chioy will direct a film set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker following Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she creates a New Jedi Order.\nThis last one, we think, is the film that Damon Lindelof (Lost, The Leftovers, Watchmen) was co-writingwith Justin Britt-Gibson before departing the project. Steven Knight is now reportedly writing.\nA week after the news of these films first broke, it began to seem like the Rey project by Obaid-Chioy could be the first one out of the gate. However, in June, Disney shuffled its release schedule and moved its December 2025 Star Wars movie to May 2026, and added a third Star Wars movie to the schedule in December 2026. So maybe these three movies are on those dates. We\u2019ll see.\nUpcoming Star Wars release dates\nThese shows and movies have all been officially announced and are in various stages of production, even if we don\u2019t know when they will definitely come out.\nStar Wars: Ahsoka\nRelease Date: Now Playing (On Disney+)\nThe first full live-action Ahsoka Tano show from co-creator Dave Filoni is finally here. Rosario Dawson is, of course, returning. And our first look at footage confirmed that actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo has been cast as Sabine Wren; more recently, Eman Esfandi was confirmed as Ezra Bridger. At Star Wars Celebration this year we learned Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing Hera Syndulla, Lars Mikkelsenis playing Grand Admiral Thrawn and Wes Chatham is his right-hand man.\nWhat does that all mean? Well, in the first teaser trailer, you can see she\u2019ll make good onthe Star Wars Rebels finale and go after Thrawn. And what about the fact she knows Luke Skywalker now? And how does Ray Stevenson\u2019s lightsaber-wielding character fit in?\nThe show is now airing on Disney+ and here you can read our weekly recaps:\nEpisode 1, \u201cMaster and Apprentice: and Episode 2, \u201cToil and Trouble\u201d\nEpisode 6, premiering September 19\nEpisode 7, premiering September 26\nEpisode 7, premiering October 3\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\nRelease Date: 2023 (On Disney+)\nCreated by Spider-Man Homecoming/Far From Home/No Way Home director Jon Watts along with writer Chris Ford, this mystery Star Wars show is now currently in development. The title for the show was released during the Star Wars Celebration, and was previously internally referred as \u201cGrammar Radio.\u201d Celebration also revealed its headlining star, Jude Law.\nSet after the events of Return of the Jedi, Skeleton Crew is described as an adventure in the mold of Amblin adventures of the 1980s. The show will be about seeing the galaxy through the eyes of children (but it is not a kids show), and will follow a group of children who get lost in the galaxy and try to find their way home. Jon Watts explained that the series will take place during the same time period as the upcoming Ahsoka series and The Mandalorian.\nFilming on the series began in 2022 and ended in early 2023. And though not much is know about what happens on the show,it has been revealed that The Daniels, the Oscar-winning directors of Everything Everywhere All At Once, directed an episode. Ditto David Lowery, who did the film The Green Knight. Read more about the show here.\nio9 saw the first footage at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and you can read about it here. Three of the main stars of the show are played by Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Kyriana Kratter, and Robert Timothy Smit. Rumors suggest it could debut in November or December 2023.\nStar Wars: The Acolyte\nRelease Date: 2024 (On Disney+)\nRussian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland will be the first person to bring the excellent High Republic timeline into live-action with this show, long rumored to star Amandla Stenberg before an actual confirmation finally arrived at San Diego Comic-Con 2022\u2014one of few Star Wars bits of news to emerge from the convention.\nIn an interview in 2022, Headland revealed the show would be about 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace. \u201cA lot of those characters haven\u2019t even been born yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at the political and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about. My question when watching The Phantom Menace was always like, \u2018Well, how did things get to this point?\u2019 How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? Like, what went wrong? What are the scenarios that led us to this moment?\u201d\nIn an interview released later, Headland spoke about her goals for the series. For Headland, above all else The Acolyte is a mystery, and that mystery is figuring out what is going on in this peak period. It was also suggested that The Acolyte will bring more elements from the Expanded Universe to canon, but what parts that will be incorporated will remain to be seen.\nIn September 2022, both Jodie Turner-Smith and Squid Game\u2019s Emmy-winning Lee Jung-Jae joined the cast, with an official announcement in November adding Carrie-Anne Moss, Manny Jacinto, and others to the roster. The first image, which you see above, was released in November and you can read about the first footage here, which was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023.\nAnd no, despite what bullcrap rumors you may have been reading online, the show has not been canceled.\nAndor: Season 2\nRelease Date: August 2024 (On Disney+)\nSeason one of Tony Gilroy\u2019s Rogue One prequel starring Diego Luna showed an excitingly different side of Star Wars. Season two will reportedly be spread across the four years leading up to Rogue One, with four episodes covering each year in Cassian Andor\u2019s life until that fateful point. Filming began in late 2022.\nAt Star Wars Celebration 2023, Gilroy announced the show should be out in August 2024 and showed fans the first footage from the season. Read about it here. Plus, the final episodes of the season/series will take place just days before Rogue One, leading right into that story.\nOne minor hiccup though, due to the Writer\u2019s Guild strike, showrunner and head writer Tony Gilroy left his duties show in May 2023. He\u2019s unlikely to return until the Writer\u2019s Strike is over, which could cause a delay.\nStar Wars: A Droid Story\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nLucasfilm Animation is teaming up with Industrial Light and Magic for this streaming show that will \u201cintroduce us to a new hero, guided by legendary duo R2-D2 and C-3PO.\u201d We don\u2019t know anything beyond that and there hasn\u2019t been a significant update in years, which could be a good thing or bad thing.\nStar Wars: Lando\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nWay back in December 2020, Disney announced a bunch of Star Wars TV shows. Among them was a Lando show which, at the time, was going to be made by Dear White People creator Justin Simien. After that, things went quiet for about three years. Then,in an April 2023 article, Donald Glover hinted that he\u2019s still interested and it\u2019s still possible in the works. A May 2023 interview with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed it\u2019s still in the works.\nThe first significant update in almost three years came in July when news broke that Simien has been off the project since he started working on Haunted Mansion, and not only is Donald Glover going to star in the series, he\u2019s co-writing it with his brother Stephen.\nUntitled Taika Waititi Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nIn May 2020, news broke that Oscar-winning director of Thor: Ragnarok would be helming and co-writing along with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. \u201cTaika\u2019s approach to Star Wars will be fresh, unexpected, and \u2026 unique,\u201d Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said. \u201cHis enormous talent and sense of humor will ensure that audiences are in for an unforgettable ride.\u201d\nThere was a time when this was likely to be the next Star Wars film but, after Star Wars Celebration 2023, it seems like it\u2019s now on the back burner. That was confirmed by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy who said the Oscar-winner is still working on the film, it\u2019s just going slowly.\nIn the past, Waititi has discussed some broad ideas of what he wants to do with his upcoming film. Read those below.\nTaika Waititi Doesn\u2019t Want Star Wars to Rely on Legacies\nAre You as Confused About Taika Waititi\u2019s Star WarsMovie as We Are?\nUntitled Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nWe mentioned this one above but, at some point, Dave Filoni will be directing a film that is meant to be a climactic event wrapping up stories that have begun on shows he\u2019s involved with such as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew and others.\nUntitled James Mangold Star Wars Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nThis was one of the three films announced at Star Wars Celebration but, like Filoni\u2019s, isn\u2019t likely to be next. This one is set 25,000 years before the original trilogy and tells the story of the first person to use the Force.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about, I want to be part of the saga, but I also don\u2019t want to be holding so much lore in the air that you can hardly tell a story,\u201d Mangold told io9 when asked about this film. \u201cAnd what I really wanted to do\u2026was just can we make a kind of the Ten Commandments of the Force, you know? A kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known, understood, wielded, and harnessed.\u201d We love this idea so much we even wrote about it.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Haven\u2019t Been Officially Announced, But We Think Are Still Happening\nThe Mandalorian Season 4\nRelease Date: TBD\nWith The Mandalorian Season 3 now in the books, all eyes look ahead to season 4. However, the season has not yet been officially announced. Unofficially though, series creator Jon Favreau said he\u2019s already written a fourth season which he probably wouldn\u2019t have done just for fun. It\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just a matter of when, especially with writers and actors on strike.\nThe Book of Boba Fett Season 2\nRelease Date: TBD (On Disney+)\nThe Book of Boba Fett season one ended with the implication that we\u2019d see more of these character in the future. But alas, there has been no official announcement\u2026 yet. Dive into the making-of season one while we wait and ponder the words of executive producer Robert Rodriguez who said he knows when the character is coming back, but he can\u2019t say when.\nUntitled Shawn Levy Movie\nRelease Date: TBD\nShawn Levy, the prolific director and producer behind Stranger Things, Night at the Museum, and Free Guy is gearing up to develop a film in a galaxy far far away. He\u2019ll focus on that after completing Deadpool 3, which stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nStar Wars Movies and TV Shows That Are Currently Unscheduled and Probably NOT Going To Happen\nStar Wars: Rangers of the New Republic\nOriginally announced alongside shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and Andor, Rangers of the New Republic was rumored to be Cara Dune\u2019s show which would tie into The Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. However, with actress Gina Carano no longer a part of Star Wars, word on the street is this will no longer be happening. Nothing is official though.\nUntitled Rian Johnson Trilogy\nLet\u2019s be honest. Do we think this is happening anymore? Probably not. Rian Johnson has moved on to other things. But, until we hear otherwise (and no one is officially saying), we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that before the divisive release of The Last Jedi, Lucasfilm officially said Johnson would make his very own trilogy. It hasn\u2019t officially been canceled yet but, in a new interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy suggested that it\u2019s been placed on the back burner as Johnson does other things. With Johnson\u2019s next film, Glass Onion, set for release in late 2022 though, he\u2019s been quoted saying he still hopes these movies happen. So do we.\nStar Wars: Rogue Squadron\nFor several years, Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins\u2019 film about pilots in the Star Wars universe has been earmarked as the next film. Well, that\u2019s no longer the case. After months of rumors suggesting it might move off its 2023 release date, Disney officially took it off the schedule. On December 13 2022, Jenkins said the movie is still in \u201cactive development\u201d but recent news suggests it\u2019s dead. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy disagrees, saying in May 2023 it\u2019s still on the books.\nUntitled Kevin Feige Movie\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige is best known for helping create the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as much as he loves Marvel, he loves Star Wars even more. And so it was exciting to hear that he was producing a Star Wars movie and even recruited Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness writer Michael Waldron to help him. Feige doesn\u2019t like to even acknowledge this project though and in a 2022 interview, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy also tiptoed around the project\u2019s existence. Then, a few weeks before Star Wars Celebration 2023, we learned the project is likely dead.\nFor more, check out io9\u2019s list of every canceled (or re-worked) Disney Star Wars project.\nWant more io9 news?

      "text": "At a Glance:\nDoctor Who ended the eras of both Chris Chibnall as series showrunner and Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor in 2022 with \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d bringing to a close a three-season, three-special run.\nWhittaker\u2019s replacement is returning star David Tennant. He will play the official 14th incarnation of the Doctor under returning showrunner Russell T. Davies, who revived Doctor Who in 2005 and managed the series until 2009.\nTennant will appear in three specials in November 2023 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who on November 23.\nHe\u2019ll be joined by returning characters Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, who were played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins in season four of Doctor Who. Neil Patrick Harris will play a new villain, while Heartstopper\u2019s Yasmin Finney will play a character named Rose.\nTennant will be succeeded by Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. His announcement in May 2022 makes him the first Black male actor to play the character on-screen.\nGatwa will star in Doctor Who\u2019s 14th season, set to air some time in 2024.\nMillie Gibson will co-star as the 15th Doctor\u2019s companion.\nGame of Thrones star Indira Varma will play a mysterious character known as \u201cthe Duchess.\u201d\nDoctor Who\u2019s beloved tradition of doing a Christmas Special\u2014no more New Year\u2019s Day Specials, in other words\u2014will return in 2023, with another confirmed for 2024.\nComedian Sooz Kempner will star in Doom\u2019s Day, a new transmedia Doctor Who campaign tied into the anniversary. She\u2019ll play Doom, the titular intergalactic assassin, who has found herself hunted by Death itself\u2014and must use a purloined vortex manipulator with a day\u2019s worth of time-jumping charge to find the Doctor and save herself.\nThis post was last updated 5/30/23.\nWhat\u2019s Been Going on in Doctor Who?\nThree Doctor Who specials aired out the last days of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s time as the Doctor in 2022. \u201cEve of the Daleks\u201d saw the Doctor and her companions Dan (introduced in the prior 13th season, known as Doctor Who: Flux) and Yaz facing the titular iconic monsters in a time loop paradox. \u201cLegend of the Sea Devils\u201d revived the classic \u201870s monsters for a new adventure, while \u201cPower of the Doctor\u201d saw the 13th Doctor face off against the Master in an adventure that ultimately saw her mortally wounded, returning her companions to contemporary Earth while she regenerated into a new body.\nWhy Is David Tennant the Doctor Again? Is David Tennant Playing the 10th Doctor?\nWhittaker regenerated not into previously announced new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa, but David Tennant, who played the official 10th incarnation of the Time Lord from Christmas 2005 to New Year\u2019s Day 2010, before reprising the role for Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary special, \u201cThe Day of the Doctor,\u201d in 2013.\nWhile this marks his first return on-screen in the series since then, Tennant will not be playing the 10th Doctor, but the official 14th incarnation\u2014and the character will be aware that they are both using a familiar form and are a new entity. Aside from the fact that Tennant is arguably the most popular actor to take on the role, so bringing him back for the 60th anniversary makes sense, there\u2019s plenty of reasons Doctor Who can come up with as to why the Doctor\u2019s regenerative process decided to re-use an old identity, more of which you can read about here.\nWhen Will Doctor Who Return in 2023?\nDoctor Who will return for three special episodes in November 2023, set to air in celebration of the series\u2019 60th anniversary.\nWhat Is Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary Special About?\nAside from Tennant returning as the Doctor, he\u2019ll be joined by former companions Donna Noble and Wilfred Mott, played by Catherine Tate and Bernard Cribbins (the actor\u2019s last role prior to his passing in July 2022) in Doctor Who\u2019s fourth season. Donna exited the series as a regular character after an adventure lead to her needing to have her memory wiped by the 10th Doctor, forgetting her time alongside him lest her mind face grievous harm, so just how Donna will play into the the story remains to be seen.\nThe Doctor and Donna will face a mysterious new adversary, played by Neil Patrick Harris, and will be joined in the specials by Yasmin Finney as a new character named Rose. How Finney\u2019s Rose might connect to the other famous Rose of Doctor Who, Billie Piper\u2019s Rose Tyler, also remains to be seen.\nIs There a Trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th Anniversary?\nThe first premiered at the end of \u201cThe Power of the Doctor,\u201d and you can watch it above. The second premiered in December and you can watch it here:\nWhen Will Ncuti Gatwa Become the Doctor?\nGatwa is briefly seen in the trailer for Doctor Who\u2019s 60th anniversary, so will presumably follow the long tradition of new Doctors appearing in the final moments of their predecessor\u2019s last episodes to become the 15th Doctor. The BBC has announced that Gatwa will appear as the Doctor first \u201cover the festive season\u201d in 2023, before he takes over full-time in a new season of the show after that.\nIs There a Doctor Who Season 14 Release Date?\nThere\u2019s no current release date for season 14 of Doctor Who, but it is expected to be broadcast some time in 2024.\nWhere Is Doctor Who Streaming in the U.S. and UK?\nCurrently, the first 13 seasons of the revived Doctor Who are streaming on the BBC iPlayer in the UK; in the U.S., the revived series streams exclusively on HBO Max. In both countries, episodes from the classic era of the show are available through Britbox.\nThis will change in 2023, at least in the U.S. The BBC and Disney have announced that as part of a new deal, Doctor Who will stream exclusively worldwide on Disney+, except for in the UK and Ireland, where it will still stream on the BBC iPlayer and BBC One. It\u2019s currently unknown if this will affect Doctor Who\u2019s place on BBC America, where it currently airs in the U.S..\nDoes Disney Co-Own Doctor Who Now?\nA report in the wake of the BBC/Disney announcement from British paper the Telegraph alleged that the deal will also see Disney contribute finances to help create the show, and while the series\u2019 creative team will still hold control of the series primarily, the deal will allow Disney some level of say in the creative decisions for the series\u2014as well as allowing access to talent or \u201ccinematic production moments\u201d previously inaccessible due to the BBC\u2019s budget for the show.\nNone of this has been confirmed by the BBC, however. The announcement strictly focused on Disney\u2019s acquisition of Doctor Who\u2019s streaming rights, and did not mention any co-owning. The new era of the series will be made for the BBC by Bad Wolf Studios, created by former Doctor Who producer Julie Gardner and former BBC Controller of Fiction Jane Tranter\u2014which is now owned by Sony Pictures Television, after the studio took a majority stake in Bad Wolf in December 2021. The series was previously made by BBC Studios directly.\nIn January, Davies did say that Doctor Who is now working with a bigger budget, telling GQ that Disney\u2019s involvement came about as part of \u201cthe BBC\u2019s notion to go for a streamer to invest in the show worldwide \u2026 We\u2019re not on the budget level with Star Wars and the Marvel shows, [but] it\u2019s better than it was \u2026 We\u2019re not allowed to talk about budget\u2026 but it\u2019s more than I\u2019ve ever had to work with.\u201d\nWant more io9 news?
