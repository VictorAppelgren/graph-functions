      "summary": "Gazprom has signed a legally binding agreement to build the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline to China via Mongolia, with a potential capacity of 50 billion cubic metres per year for 30 years at a lower price than European rates. The deal is seen as a diplomatic win for President Putin amid Western sanctions, but China remains cautious about dependence on a single supplier and has not confirmed pricing or volume flexibility. No construction timeline or delivery start date has been disclosed, leaving key financial and operational details unresolved. The project is expected to become the world’s largest, most capital‑intensive gas pipeline.",
