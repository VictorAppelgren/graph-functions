      "feedback": "The draft correctly identifies the DXY as the focal asset and cites the Fed‑cut probability, term‑premium dynamics, and key data releases, but it lacks the precision, breadth, and explicit causal chain required for a top‑macro view. Tighten the mapping by adding a clear handle line (e.g., **dxy → dxy**), and quantify the short‑term dip (‑200 bp to 95.8) and the medium‑term rally (+0.5–1 %) with source IDs. Explicitly link the 2‑yr/10‑yr steepening to the term‑premium via a short equation (e.g., **ust10y‑2yr ↑ → term‑premium ↑ → dxy ↑**). Add a catalyst window table: Sept Fed meeting (cut) and early‑Aug CPI (confirm lower term‑premium) for the 3–6 month rally; Aug 30 PCE/31 NFP for the 1‑month dip. Include a risk matrix: (1) Fed hike (+0.2–0.4 %) → dxy ↓ by 50–100 bp; (2) Treasury supply spike (+0.1–0.2 %) → term‑premium ↑ → dxy ↓; (3) Flattening spread <30 bp → dxy ↓. Add a short‑term upside scenario (PCE > 3 % or NFP > expected) with a +50–100 bp lift, citing (7XH2DKEKV). Finally, provide a concise watch‑list: Sept Fed meeting, Aug CPI, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, and the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread trend. This will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity rule, ensure every claim is evidence‑anchored, and deliver a defensible, actionable view.",
