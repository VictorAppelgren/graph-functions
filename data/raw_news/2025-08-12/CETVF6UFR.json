  "content": "The Council of Europe urged all its 46 member nations to halt their deliveries of weapons to Israel due to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza.\n\nMichael O\u2019Flaherty, the Council\u2019s commissioner for human rights, said all its member states should do what\u2019s necessary to avoid exacerbating the current situation in the Palestinian enclave, following Germany\u2019s move to halt some arms deliveries to the Jewish State in light of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s order to invade Gaza City.\n\n\u201c[Members should do] their utmost to prevent and address violations of international human rights,\u201d O\u2019Flaherty said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis includes applying existing legal standards to ensure that arms transfers are not authorized where there is a risk that they may be used to commit human rights violations.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Flaherty also called on the members \u2014 which include the UK, France and Italy \u2014 \u201cto intensify efforts to provide relief to those affected by the conflict.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Flaherty noted that his statement was partially influenced by Germany\u2019s decision to curb arms exports to Israel on Friday.\n\nGermany, along with the US and Italy, is among the top foreign suppliers of military equipment for the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nChancellor Friedrich Merz\u2019s surprise stance was among the loudest rebukes yet by one of Israel\u2019s strongest international backers over the decision to invade Gaza City.\n\n\u201cThe even harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved by the Israeli Cabinet last night, makes it increasingly difficult for the German government to see how these goals will be achieved,\u201d Merz said.\n\n\u201cUnder these circumstances, the German government will not authorize any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice,\u201d he added.\n\nCritics of the invasion plan, including the IDF\u2019s own chief of staff, have warned that the full military occupation of Gaza City would only result in unnecessary casualties and put the remaining 50 hostages at risk.\n\nNetanyahu, however, maintains that military pressure is the only way to rid Gaza of Hamas and rescue the hostages, only 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.\n\nThe embattled prime minister has reiterated that the conflict in Gaza is a \u201cjust war,\u201d labeling any pushback as a reward for Hamas.",

      "text": "UK will recognize Palestinian state unless Israel agrees to cease-fire, allows UN aid into Gaza: PM\nLONDON \u2014 The UK will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel agrees to a cease-fire in Gaza, allows the UN to bring in aid and takes other steps toward long-term peace, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday.\nStarmer, who is under mounting domestic pressure over the issue as scenes of hunger in Gaza horrify many Britons, convened a rare summertime Cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Gaza. It came after he discussed the crisis with President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland on Monday.\nThe president told reporters he didn\u2019t mind Starmer \u201ctaking a position\u201d on statehood.\nStarmer said Tuesday that Britain will recognize a state of Palestine before the United Nations General Assembly, \u201cunless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, agree to a cease-fire and commit to a long-term, sustainable peace, reviving the prospect of a two-state solution.\n\u201cAnd this includes allowing the UN to restart the supply of aid, and making clear there will be no annexations in the West Bank,\u201d he said.\nIt seems highly unlikely that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu could meet the conditions, which cut to the heart of the most intractable issues in the conflict. Netanyahu rejects the two-state solution on both nationalistic and security grounds.\nIsrael\u2019s foreign ministry said it rejected the British statement.\n\u201cThe shift in the British government\u2019s position at this time, following the French move and internal political pressures, constitutes a reward for Hamas and harms efforts to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages,\u201d the ministry said on X.\nStarmer also repeated UK demands that Hamas release all the hostages it holds, agree to a cease-fire, disarm and \u201caccept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza.\u201d\nStarmer said in a televised statement that his government will assess in September \u201chow far the parties have met these steps\u201d before making a final decision on recognition.\nBritain has long supported the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel, but has said recognition should come as part of a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict.\nBut Starmer said Tuesday Britain was willing to take the step because \u201cthe very idea of a two-state solution is reducing and feels further away today than it has for many years.\u201d\nHe said that despite the set of conditions he set out, Britain believes that \u201cstatehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people.\u201d\nPressure to formally recognize Palestinian statehood has mounted since French President Emmanuel Macron announced that his country will become the first major Western power to recognize a Palestinian state in September.\nMore than 250 of the 650 lawmakers in the House of Commons have signed a letter urging the government to recognize a Palestinian state.\nMore than 140 countries recognize a Palestinian state, including a dozen in Europe. Macron\u2019s announcement last week make France is the first Group of Seven country and the largest European nation to take that step.\nAs with France, British recognition would be largely symbolic, but could increase diplomatic pressure for an end to the conflict \u2013 especially as Starmer appears to have the tacit approval of Trump.\nBritain has a particular historic role as the former governing power of what was then Palestine and author of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which backed the establishment of a Jewish homeland.\nForeign Secretary David Lammy said Britain bore a \u201cspecial burden of responsibility.\u201d\n\u201cOur support for Israel, its right to exist, and the security of its people, is steadfast,\u201d Lammy told a meeting at the UN in New York on Tuesday. \u201cHowever, the Balfour Declaration came with the solemn promise that nothing shall be done, nothing which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the Palestinian people as well. And colleagues, this has not been upheld, and it is a historical injustice which continues to unfold.\u201d\nFrance welcomed Britain\u2019s announcement.\n\u2033The United Kingdom is joining the momentum created by France for the recognition of the state of Palestine,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot posted on X."

      "text": "Netanyahu lays out Gaza City incursion goals as critics warn it could turn to Israel\u2019s \u2018Vietnam\u2019\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid out Sunday his five goals to seize Gaza City and free it from Hamas \u2014 as he faces mounting pressure, with one world leader warning that the military incursion could turn into his own \u201cVietnam.\u201d\nNetanyahu called his plan to invade Gaza City \u201cthe best way to end the war\u201d quickly, as he laid out the five-point plan for peace.\n\u201cOne, Hamas disarmed. Second, all hostages freed. Third, Gaza demilitarized. Fourth, Israel has overriding security control. And five, non-Israeli peaceful civilian administration,\u201d the premier summarized.\n\u201cThat\u2019s our plan. Given Hamas\u2019s refusal to lay down its arms, Israel has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas,\u201d Netanyahu added.\nNetanyahu maintains that the operation won\u2019t lead to the full military occupation of Gaza, instead, it will focus on targeting Hamas\u2019 terrorist cells stationed in Gaza City.\nThe premier did not offer a timeline on how the military incursion would proceed, saying only that it would be done \u201cfairly quickly.\u201d\nHe likened the operation to the military takeover of the southern city of Rafah, another controversial incursion that was once tapped as the final tactic to eliminate Hamas last year, only for the terror group to re-emerge elsewhere in Gaza.\nExperts have also expressed doubts that such an operation could be speedily resolved, with many warning that it would only indefinitely extend the war, which has raged on for nearly two years.\nAs the United Nations holds an emergency meeting this weekend to discuss the Gaza City incursion, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani presented a stark warning to Netanyahu.\n\u201cThe invasion of Gaza risks turning into a Vietnam for Israeli soldiers,\u201d he told the daily Il Messaggero, referencing the years-long quagmire and losses in Vietnam that ended with the withdrawal of the US military.\nWhen news of the incoming operation broke last week, Colin Clarke, a counter-terrorism expert at the New York-based Soufan Group, told The Post that the incursion would put more IDF soldiers at risk of being attacked by not only Hamas, but also by armed insurgents opposing the occupation.\n\u201cThis puts the IDF under new risks, with the soldiers having to deal with regular ambushes, improvised explosions and sniper fire from an insurgency,\u201d Clarke warned.\nThe plan to invade Gaza City, which IDF chief of staff Eyal Zamir also opposes, has also caused tens of thousands to march in the streets of Tel Aviv to oppose their government\u2019s action, calling for a cease-fire agreement in its place to free the remaining 50 hostages.\nNetanyahu and his cabinet have claimed that the military operation is still the best way to free the captives, only 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.\nThe embattled premier also faces pressure from members of his far-right coalition accusing him of falling short on the goal to take over Gaza.\nBezalel Smotrich, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s security cabinet, said he has lost faith in Netanyahu\u2019s ability and desire to lead Israel to victory.\nWith Post wires"

      "text": "Trump sending Israel thousands of 2,000-pound bombs despite cease-fire: report\nPresident Trump greenlit the delivery of thousands of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, according to a report.\nAs many as 1,800 MK-84 bombs will be shipped off to the Jewish state in the coming days \u2014 reversing a Biden administration hold on the explosive supply, Israeli officials told Axios.\nThe Israeli government was reportedly notified by the Pentagon about the release on Friday, the day before Hamas released four hostages as part of the cease-fire agreement.\nThe massive bombs were held in storage since May, when Biden decided to hold off on a delivery out of concern Israel would cause significant civilian devastation by unleashing the weapons in densely populated areas of Gaza.\nThe US previously delivered more than 10,000 of the bombs \u2014 known as \u201cbunker busters\u201d because they can reach deep underground before detonating \u2014 to Israel during the war.\nThe halt caused a major strain on the US\u2019s relationship with Israel.\nThe news comes just days after outgoing Israeli ambassador to the United States Mike Herzog revealed he expected Trump to reverse the ban within his first few days in office.\n\u201cWe believe that Trump is going to release, at the beginning of his term, the munitions that haven\u2019t been released until now by the Biden administration,\u201d Herzog said.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment."

      "text": "Israel says it killed a Hamas terrorist posing as an Al Jazeera reporter, 4 others in targeted airstrike\nA prominent Al Jazeera journalist was killed in an airstrike alongside four of his colleagues as Israel\u2019s military accused him of posing as a reporter to run a Hamas terrorist cell.\nAnas al-Sharif, a 28-year-old correspondent, was among those killed Sunday when the strikes hit a tent near Al Shifa Hospital in eastern Gaza City, Gaza officials and Al Jazeera confirmed.\n\u201cAl-Sharif was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell and advanced rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and IDF troops,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, calling him a \u201cterrorist\u201d who \u201cposed as an Al Jazeera journalist.\u201d\n\u201cIntelligence and documents from Gaza, including rosters, terrorist training lists and salary records, prove he was a Hamas operative integrated into Al Jazeera,\u201d the IDF said.\n\u201cA press badge isn\u2019t a shield for terrorism.\u201d\nBefore his death, al-Sharif had denied ties to Hamas, as had his network.\nAl Jazeera called the airstrikes a \u201ctargeted assassination\u201d and accused Israeli officials of incitement.\nCalling al-Sharif \u201cone of Gaza\u2019s bravest journalists,\u201d Al Jazeera blasted the attack as a \u201cdesperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza.\u201d\n\u201cAnas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people,\u201d the Qatari network said in a statement.\nThe network said al-Sharif had left a social media message to be posted in the event of his death that read, \u201cI never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who remained silent.\u201d\nAl-Sharif, who boasted more than 500,000 followers on X, had been posting on social media just minutes before his death \u2014 saying that Israel had been intensely bombarding Gaza City for more than two hours.\nIn the wake of his death, Hamas said the latest strikes may signal the start of an Israeli offensive.\n\u201cThe assassination of journalists and the intimidation of those who remain paves the way for a major crime that the occupation is planning to commit in Gaza City,\u201d the terror group said in a statement.\nAl-Sharif began reporting for Al Jazeera a few days after war broke out and his coverage repeatedly went viral.\nIn January, he whipped off his press vest and helmet following news of a cease-fire. Al-Sharif cried on air in July, too, as women behind him collapsed from hunger.\n\u201cI am talking about slow death of those people,\u201d he said at the time.\nMeanwhile, the Committee to Protect Journalists, which in July urged the international community to protect al-Sharif, said Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against him.\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,\u201d said Sara Qudah, CPJ\u2019s director for the Middle East and North Africa.\nWith Post wires"

  "argos_summary": "The Council of Europe has called on its 46 member states to stop arms deliveries to Israel amid the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, following Germany's decision to halt some military exports. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu plans a military incursion into Gaza City to eliminate Hamas, which has drawn criticism and concerns over potential casualties and the safety of hostages. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that Britain will recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel agrees to a cease-fire and allows UN aid into Gaza, reflecting growing international pressure for a resolution to the conflict.",
