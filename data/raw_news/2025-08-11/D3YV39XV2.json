  "description": "Congress will have a significant role to play if President Donald Trump wants to extend his takeover of the police in Washington, D.C., to crack down on crime for more than a month.Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act and declared a public emergency on Monday. Under the law, Trump is allowed to direct the D.C. mayor to deliver him control of the Metropolitan Police Department.However, the Home Rule Act says the president is allowed to initially use this power for up to 48 hours. If the president wants to extend that authority for 30 days, relevant committees in Congress must be notified with an explanation of the need and expected time duration.Indeed, Trump wrote a letter on Monday to the House Oversight Committee saying he needed to address violent crime in D.C.

      "text": "President Donald Trump promised on Monday to clean up crime and vagrancy in the nation\u2019s capital by shifting more responsibilities over the district to the federal government.\nTrump made the announcement during a press conference at the White House, where he laid out a number of executive actions he was taking to fight violent crime, decrease homelessness, and otherwise clean up Washington, D.C.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor, and worse,\u201d Trump said. \u201c This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we\u2019re gonna take our capital back. We\u2019re taking it back.\u201d\nTrump on Monday invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act and declared a public emergency. This granted him to move the D.C. Police Department under the control of the Justice Department. DEA Administrator Terry Cole will head the department, per Trump\u2019s orders.\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and U.S. District Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro all appeared alongside Trump at the news conference.\nThe president also added that he was sending 800 National Guard troops to patrol the streets of D.C. Last week, the administration sent 500 federal agents into the district, including from the FBI, ATF, DEA, Park Police, the U.S. Marshal Service, the Secret Service, and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cThe murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on earth,\u201d Trump said, adding that \u201cthe only language\u201d that criminals understand is when you \u201cknock the hell out of them.\u201d\nThe president added that he would like to see Republicans in Congress move to end cashless bail in the district, saying that the policy led to lawlessness in the streets. Trump added that he planned to improve infrastructure in the district and crack down on homeless encampments.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to replace the medians that are falling down all over the roads. We\u2019re gonna replace the potholes,\u201d he said.\nBurgum, who briefly spoke during the conference, said that Park Police had cleared over 70 homeless camps from D.C. since March 27.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be removing homeless encampments from all over our parks, our beautiful, beautiful parks, which now a lot of people can\u2019t walk on,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re moving the encampments away, trying to take care of people. Some of those people, we don\u2019t know how they even got there.\u201d"

      "text": "Norton, Van Hollen Will Reintroduce Bills to Grant D.C. Full Control Over Its National Guard, Police as Trump Calls in D.C. National Guard and Federalizes D.C. Police\nWASHINGTON D.C. \u2013 Today, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) and U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) announced that they will reintroduce their legislation to grant the District of Columbia full control over the D.C. National Guard and the Metropolitan Police Department when Congress reconvenes in September. These measures are needed more urgently than ever as President Donald Trump today assumed control of D.C.\u2019s police department and announced plans to deploy the National Guard in the District. The Administration took these actions without consulting D.C. government officials and despite crime being at a 30-year low in 2024 and a decrease of 26% this year compared to the same time period last year.\n\u201cPresident Trump's unprecedented federalization of the D.C. Police today and his activation of the D.C. National Guard without D.C.'s consent underscore the necessity of D.C. statehood,\u201d Norton said. \u201cUntil we get the full protections that statehood would provide, our bills repealing the president's authority to federalize the local D.C. police department and to give D.C.'s mayor control over the D.C. National Guard, like governors of states have over their National Guards, places D.C. closer to having control over some of its most vital affairs. Thank you to Senator Van Hollen for being my determined partner on these bills in the Senate and a vigorous advocate for D.C. home rule.\u201d\n\u201cTrump\u2019s raw authoritarian power grab in D.C. is part of a growing national crisis. He\u2019s playing dictator in our nation\u2019s capital as a dress rehearsal as he pushes democracy to the brink. While we continue to fight for statehood for D.C., Trump\u2019s assault on D.C.\u2019s autonomy makes it all the more critical that we give the District full control over its own National Guard and police department. This is not just about self-governance for D.C. \u2013 it\u2019s also about preventing authoritarian overreach by a lawless president like we are witnessing today,\u201d said Senator Van Hollen.\n\u201cWhile the District of Columbia has seen violent crime decline over the past two years, there is still more progress to be made on making it safer for all. But if Trump actually cared about the people of D.C. and their safety, he wouldn\u2019t have blocked the local government from spending over $1 billion of its own money to fund its own police department, schools, and more. Instead of commandeering the local police and deploying the military to the City\u2019s streets, Donald Trump should give D.C. back its money and get the hell out of the District\u2019s way,\u201d Senator Van Hollen continued. The Senator introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) to unlock the over $1 billion of D.C.\u2019s own funds that Republicans unnecessarily froze through their funding bill in March. Their bill passed the Senate unanimously, but House Republicans have still not brought it up for a vote.\nThe District of Columbia Police Home Rule Act would repeal the provision in the Home Rule Act that gives the President the authority to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department. The Home Rule Act provides that, \u201cwhenever the President of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes, he may direct the mayor to provide him, and the mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.\u201d\nThe District of Columbia National Guard Home Rule Act would name the Mayor of Washington, D.C. as Commander-in-Chief of the D.C. National Guard, giving the Mayor the same control over the D.C. National Guard that the governors of the states and the three territories with National Guards have over their respective National Guards. Under current law, the President is Commander-in-Chief of the D.C. National Guard.\n###"

Congressional approval is required for any extension of Trump's authority beyond 48 hours, and Democrats plan to introduce legislation to restore local control over D.C.'s police and National Guard.",
