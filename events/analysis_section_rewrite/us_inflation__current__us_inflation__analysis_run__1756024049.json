      "feedback": "High-signal edits to lift to world-class in 0–3 weeks: anchor the causal chain in a tight, testable 3-step flow (macro-rate path → unsecured-lending pricing → consumer spending/substitution) and drop extraneous material; cite only the IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL that actually drive the argument (S7M6BJSRT for personal-loan pricing mechanics and 8VMO3PFEO for BeeStation Plus’s built-in 8TB, no-subscription, ~$400 price, plus its business-use case). Quantify every claim with concrete numbers from the sources: personal-loan APRs are quoted 8.99%–35.49% (fixed/variable) with typical 24–36 month terms (up to 84 months in some cases) and origination fees 1%–8% (S7M6BJSRT); BeeStation Plus is 8 TB, no ongoing cloud fee, around $400, easily set up, with Plex integration and cloud-sync options (8VMO3PFEO); tires example: Douglas tires priced $50–$120 and reported durability 40–60k miles (4B5JK15SY). Build a crisp near-term thesis: if rates surprise higher (Fed-inflation path hawkish), unsecured-credit costs stay elevated, leading to reduced discretionary/tech spending and increased substitution into durable-capital solutions like BeeStation; if credit tightens meaningfully, monitor loan-originations, revolving-utilization trends, and cloud-substitution signals in durable goods (BeeStation-type purchases). Specify catalysts and invalidation: catalysts—Fed-rate guidance or inflation prints that push real yields higher or lower; invalidation—any rapid dovish pivot that compresses risk premia and restores easy credit, or a sharp drop in inflation that restores consumer-spending quickly. Translate to actionable monitor points: track weekly loan-originations and soft-pull activity (S7M6BJSRT), the pace of BeeStation adoption/pricing (8VMO3PFEO) and related cloud-substitution behavior in small businesses, plus price signals in durable goods (4B5JK15SY). Tighten the narrative with a single, explicit base-case (modest tightening into 0–3 weeks with elevated lending costs) and explicit risks (policy pivot, delinquency uptick, energy/transport-cost shocks). Finally, fix the prose to a lean 250–350 word outline, remove the stray (9) citation, and ensure every factual hook is tied to a cited ID (S7M6BJSRT, 8VMO3PFEO, 4B5JK15SY).",
