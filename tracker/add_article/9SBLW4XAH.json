      "summary": "APAC stocks opened lower after a weak handover from Wall Street, while European equity futures signaled a firmer cash market open with the Euro Stoxx 50 up 0.3%. The dollar (DXY) maintained its recent gains, but USTs and Bunds showed little direction amid a bear‑steepening curve. Crude futures were choppy after a whipsaw, and gold steadied at a fresh all‑time high. The UK announced November 26 as the budget date, and markets are eyeing a slate of data releases—including EU producer prices, US services PMI, and JOLTS—alongside ongoing tariff disputes and risk‑off sentiment.",
