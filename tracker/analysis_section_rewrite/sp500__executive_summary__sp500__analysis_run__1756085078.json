      "feedback": "Overall, the draft hazards runaway breadth (multiple regimes and stocks) at the expense of a tight, testable house view; it needs a single, multi-year Regime Base Case anchored in a falsifiable causal chain (tariff baseline ~10% with China levies up to ~34% driving domestic capex in semiconductors/AI/energy) and a crisp transmission from policy to capex, ROIC discipline, and equity risk premia. Actionable edits: condense to 4–6 sentences, frame a one-idea base-case plus one clear Regime A trigger, and isolate the narrative to Ford (as a price‑and‑profit test), Netflix (growth/valuation risk), and a 1–2 proxy alt for portfolio ballast, with Alt 1/Alt 2 presented only as explicit, bounded overlays. Quantify precisely: Ford Q2 EV losses ~$1.3B, adj margin ~4.3%, ROIC ~10.1%, forward P/E ~8–10x and yield ~5.2% (cite 65UUBU0OR; 22PL3Q360); Netflix Q2 revenue +15.9%, FCF +86.9%, P/E ~51.7x, view to 2030 profitability (61SVFUKBY; A88B7V8PY); Alt 1 KO and Alt 2 Alphabet should be one-liners with a clear catalyst and optionality footprint (STBVARD8F; YX2J8NHZ1). Rework the catalysts into 3–4 concrete, time-bound events (Biohaven PubMatic deadlines: Sept 12 and Oct 20, 2025; Spirit going-concern; Yemen/energy risk; 4.2B–4.5B tokenized Treasuries in 2025; 16T RWA by 2030; crypto bands) and attach them to observable market outcomes (SGB2PAZGK; OGK8WLL69; JPAIHPA4N; Z5IA1CYUF; I2SJU04DF; 4LDHF4T77; 4VN4UTWX1). Ensure every quantitative assertion has a single source ID, reconcile any conflicts with a single central thesis rather than parallel narratives, and trim redundancies and repetition so the final 4–6 sentence/point brief reads executive, decisive, and decision-ready.",
